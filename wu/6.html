THE LAST DAYS CHAPTER I THE EARLY DAYS Richard Harding Davis was born in Philadelphia on April 18, 1864, but, so far as memory serves me, his life and mine began together several years later in the three-story brick house on South Twenty-first Street, to which we had just moved.  For more than forty years this was our home in all that the word implies, and I do not believe that there was ever a moment when it was not the predominating influence in Richard&#x27;s life and in his work.  As I learned in later years, the house had come into the possession of my father and mother after a period on their part of hard endeavor and unusual sacrifice.  It was their ambition to add to this home not only the comforts and the beautiful inanimate things of life, but to create an atmosphere which would prove a constant help to those who lived under its roof--an inspiration to their children that should endure so long as they lived.  At the time of my brother&#x27;s death the fact was frequently commented upon that, unlike most literary folk, he had never known what it was to be poor and to suffer the pangs of hunger and failure.  That he never suffered from the lack of a home was certainly as true as that in his work he knew but little of failure, for the first stories he wrote for the magazines brought him into a prominence and popularity that lasted until the end.  But if Richard gained his success early in life and was blessed with a very lovely home to which he could always return, he was not brought up in a manner which in any way could be called lavish.  Lavish he may have been in later years, but if he was it was with the money for which those who knew him best knew how very hard he had worked. In a general way, I cannot remember that our life as boys differed in any essential from that of other boys.  My brother went to the Episcopal Academy and his weekly report never failed to fill the whole house with an impenetrable gloom and ever-increasing fears as to the possibilities of his future.  At school and at college Richard was, to say the least, an indifferent student.  And what made this undeniable fact so annoying, particularly to his teachers, was that morally he stood so very high.  To &quot;crib,&quot; to lie, or in any way to cheat or to do any unworthy act was, I believe, quite beyond his understanding.  Therefore, while his constant lack of interest in his studies goaded his teachers to despair, when it came to a question of stamping out wrongdoing on the part of the student body he was invariably found aligned on the side of the faculty.  Not that Richard in any way resembled a prig or was even, so far as I know, ever so considered by the most reprehensible of his fellow students.  He was altogether too red-blooded for that, and I believe the students whom he antagonized rather admired his chivalric point of honor even if they failed to imitate it.  As a schoolboy he was aggressive, radical, outspoken, fearless, usually of the opposition and, indeed, often the sole member of his own party.  Among the students at the several schools he attended he had but few intimate friends; but of the various little groups of which he happened to be a member his aggressiveness and his imagination usually made him the leader.  As far back as I can remember, Richard was always starting something--usually a new club or a violent reform movement.  And in school or college, as in all the other walks of life, the reformer must, of necessity, lead a somewhat tempestuous, if happy, existence.  The following letter, written to his father when Richard was a student at Swarthmore, and about fifteen, will give an idea of his conception of the ethics in the case: SWARTHMORE--1880. DEAR PAPA: I am quite on the Potomac.  I with all the boys at our table were called up, there is seven of us, before Prex. for stealing sugar-bowls and things off the table.  All the youths said, &quot;O President, I didn&#x27;t do it.&quot;  When it came my turn I merely smiled gravely, and he passed on to the last.  Then he said, &quot;The only boy that doesn&#x27;t deny it is Davis.  Davis, you are excused.  I wish to talk to the rest of them.&quot;  That all goes to show he can be a gentleman if he would only try.  I am a natural born philosopher so I thought this idea is too idiotic for me to converse about so I recommend silence and I also argued that to deny you must necessarily be accused and to be accused of stealing would of course cause me to bid Prex. good-by, so the only way was, taking these two considerations with each other, to deny nothing but let the good-natured old duffer see how silly it was by retaining a placid silence and so crushing his base but thoughtless behavior and machinations. DICK. In the early days at home--that is, when the sun shone--we played cricket and baseball and football in our very spacious back yard, and the programme of our sports was always subject to Richard&#x27;s change without notice.  When it rained we adjourned to the third-story front, where we played melodrama of simple plot but many thrills, and it was always Richard who wrote the plays, produced them, and played the principal part.  As I recall these dramas of my early youth, the action was almost endless and, although the company comprised two charming misses (at least I know that they eventually grew into two very lovely women), there was no time wasted over anything so sentimental or futile as love-scenes.  But whatever else the play contained in the way of great scenes, there was always a mountain pass--the mountains being composed of a chair and two tables--and Richard was forever leading his little band over the pass while the band, wholly indifferent as to whether the road led to honor, glory, or total annihilation, meekly followed its leader.  For some reason, probably on account of my early admiration for Richard and being only too willing to obey his command, I was invariably cast for the villain in these early dramas, and the end of the play always ended in a hand-to-hand conflict between the hero and myself.  As Richard, naturally, was the hero and incidentally the stronger of the two, it can readily be imagined that the fight always ended in my complete undoing.  Strangulation was the method usually employed to finish me, and, whatever else Richard was at that tender age, I can testify to his extraordinary ability as a choker. But these early days in the city were not at all the happiest days of that period in Richard&#x27;s life.  He took but little interest even in the social or the athletic side of his school life, and his failures in his studies troubled him sorely, only I fear, however, because it troubled his mother and father.  The great day of the year to us was the day our schools closed and we started for our summer vacation.  When Richard was less than a year old my mother and father, who at the time was convalescing from a long illness, had left Philadelphia on a search for a complete rest in the country.  Their travels, which it seems were undertaken in the spirit of a voyage of discovery and adventure, finally led them to the old Curtis House at Point Pleasant on the New Jersey coast.  But the Point Pleasant of that time had very little in common with the present well-known summer resort.  In those days the place was reached after a long journey by rail followed by a three hours&#x27; drive in a rickety stagecoach over deep sandy roads, albeit the roads did lead through silent, sweet-smelling pine forests.  Point Pleasant itself was then a collection of half a dozen big farms which stretched from the Manasquan River to the ocean half a mile distant.  Nothing could have been more primitive or as I remember it in its pastoral loveliness much more beautiful.  Just beyond our cottage the river ran its silent, lazy course to the sea.  With the exception of several farmhouses, its banks were then unsullied by human habitation of any sort, and on either side beyond the low green banks lay fields of wheat and corn, and dense groves of pine and oak and chestnut trees.  Between us and the ocean were more waving fields of corn, broken by little clumps of trees, and beyond these damp Nile-green pasture meadows, and then salty marshes that led to the glistening, white sand-dunes, and the great silver semi- circle of foaming breakers, and the broad, blue sea.  On all the land that lay between us and the ocean, where the town of Point Pleasant now stands, I think there were but four farmhouses, and these in no way interfered with the landscape or the life of the primitive world in which we played. Whatever the mental stimulus my brother derived from his home in Philadelphia, the foundation of the physical strength that stood him in such good stead in the campaigns of his later years he derived from those early days at Point Pleasant.  The cottage we lived in was an old two-story frame building, to which my father had added two small sleeping-rooms.  Outside there was a vine-covered porch and within a great stone fireplace flanked by cupboards, from which during those happy days I know Richard and I, openly and covertly, must have extracted tons of hardtack and cake.  The little house was called &quot;Vagabond&#x27;s Rest,&quot; and a haven of rest and peace and content it certainly proved for many years to the Davis family.  From here it was that my father started forth in the early mornings on his all-day fishing excursions, while my mother sat on the sunlit porch and wrote novels and mended the badly rent garments of her very active sons.  After a seven-o&#x27;clock breakfast at the Curtis House our energies never ceased until night closed in on us and from sheer exhaustion we dropped unconscious into our patch-quilted cots.  All day long we swam or rowed, or sailed, or played ball, or camped out, or ate enormous meals--anything so long as our activities were ceaseless and our breathing apparatus given no rest.  About a mile up the river there was an island--it&#x27;s a very small, prettily wooded, sandy-beached little place, but it seemed big enough in those days.  Robert Louis Stevenson made it famous by rechristening it Treasure Island, and writing the new name and his own on a bulkhead that had been built to shore up one of its fast disappearing sandy banks.  But that is very modern history and to us it has always been &quot;The Island.&quot;  In our day, long before Stevenson had ever heard of the Manasquan, Richard and I had discovered this tight little piece of land, found great treasures there, and, hand in hand, had slept in a six-by-six tent while the lions and tigers growled at us from the surrounding forests. As I recall these days of my boyhood I find the recollections of our life at Point Pleasant much more distinct than those we spent in Philadelphia.  For Richard these days were especially welcome.  They meant a respite from the studies which were a constant menace to himself and his parents; and the freedom of the open country, the ocean, the many sports on land and on the river gave his body the constant exercise his constitution seemed to demand, and a broad field for an imagination which was even then very keen, certainly keen enough to make the rest of us his followers. In an extremely sympathetic appreciation which Irvin S. Cobb wrote about my brother at the time of his death, he says that he doubts if there is such a thing as a born author.  Personally it so happened that I never grew up with any one, except my brother, who ever became an author, certainly an author of fiction, and so I cannot speak on the subject with authority.  But in the case of Richard, if he was not born an author, certainly no other career was ever considered.  So far as I know he never even wanted to go to sea or to be a bareback rider in a circus.  A boy, if he loves his father, usually wants to follow in his professional footsteps, and in the case of Richard, he had the double inspiration of following both in the footsteps of his father and in those of his mother.  For years before Richard&#x27;s birth his father had been a newspaper editor and a well-known writer of stories and his mother a novelist and short-story writer of great distinction.  Of those times at Point Pleasant I fear I can remember but a few of our elders.  There were George Lambdin, Margaret Ruff, and Milne Ramsay, all painters of some note; a strange couple, Colonel Olcott and the afterward famous Madam Blavatsky, trying to start a Buddhist cult in this country; Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett, with her foot on the first rung of the ladder of fame, who at the time loved much millinery finery.  One day my father took her out sailing and, much to the lady&#x27;s discomfiture and greatly to Richard&#x27;s and my delight, upset the famous authoress.  At a later period the Joseph Jeffersons used to visit us; Horace Howard Furness, one of my father&#x27;s oldest friends, built a summer home very near us on the river, and Mrs. John Drew and her daughter Georgie Barrymore spent their summers in a near-by hostelry.  I can remember Mrs. Barrymore at that time very well---wonderfully handsome and a marvellously cheery manner.  Richard and I both loved her greatly, even though it were in secret.  Her daughter Ethel I remember best as she appeared on the beach, a sweet, long-legged child in a scarlet bathing-suit running toward the breakers and then dashing madly back to her mother&#x27;s open arms.  A pretty figure of a child, but much too young for Richard to notice at that time.  In after-years the child in the scarlet bathing-suit and he became great pals.  Indeed, during the latter half of his life, through the good days and the bad, there were very few friends who held so close a place in his sympathy and his affections as Ethel Barrymore. Until the summer of 1880 my brother continued on at the Episcopal Academy.  For some reason I was sent to a different school, but outside of our supposed hours of learning we were never apart.  With less than two years&#x27; difference in our ages our interests were much the same, and I fear our interests of those days were largely limited to out-of-door sports and the theatre.  We must have been very young indeed when my father first led us by the hand to see our first play.  On Saturday afternoons Richard and I, unattended but not wholly unalarmed, would set forth from our home on this thrilling weekly  adventure.  Having joined our father at his office, he would invariably take us to a chop-house situated at the end of a blind alley which lay concealed somewhere in the neighborhood of Walnut and Third Streets, and where we ate a most wonderful luncheon of English chops and apple pie.  As the luncheon drew to its close I remember how Richard and I used to fret and fume while my father in a most leisurely manner used to finish off his mug of musty ale.  But at last the three of us, hand in hand, my father between us, were walking briskly toward our happy destination.  At that time there were only a few first-class theatres in Philadelphia--the Arch Street Theatre, owned by Mrs. John Drew; the Chestnut Street, and the Walnut Street--all of which had stock companies, but which on the occasion of a visiting star acted as the supporting company.  These were the days of Booth, Jefferson, Adelaide Neilson, Charles Fletcher, Lotta, John McCullough, John Sleeper Clark, and the elder Sothern.  And how Richard and I worshipped them all--not only these but every small-bit actor in every stock company in town.  Indeed, so many favorites of the stage did my brother and I admire that ordinary frames would not begin to hold them all, and to overcome this defect we had our bedroom entirely redecorated.  The new scheme called for a gray wallpaper supported by a maroon dado.  At the top of the latter ran two parallel black picture mouldings between which we could easily insert cabinet photographs of the actors and actresses which for the moment we thought most worthy of a place in our collection.  As the room was fairly large and as the mouldings ran entirely around it, we had plenty of space for even our very elastic love for the heroes and heroines of the footlights. Edwin Forrest ended his stage career just before our time, but I know that Richard at least saw him and heard that wonderful voice of thunder.  It seems that one day, while my mother and Richard were returning home, they got on a street-car which already held the great tragedian.  At the moment Forrest was suffering severely from gout and had his bad leg stretched well out before him.  My brother, being very young at the time and never very much of a respecter of persons, promptly fell over the great man&#x27;s gouty foot.  Whereat (according to my mother, who was always a most truthful narrator) Forrest broke forth in a volcano of oaths and for blocks continued to hurl thunderous broadsides at Richard, which my mother insisted included the curse of Rome and every other famous tirade in the tragedian&#x27;s repertory which in any way fitted the occasion.  Nearly forty years later my father became the president of the Edwin Forrest Home, the greatest charity ever founded by an actor for actors, and I am sure by his efforts of years on behalf of the institution did much to atone for Richard&#x27;s early unhappy meeting with the greatest of all the famous leather-lunged tragedians. From his youth my father had always been a close student of the classic and modern drama, and throughout his life numbered among his friends many of the celebrated actors and actresses of his time.  In those early days Booth used to come to rather formal luncheons, and at all such functions Richard and I ate our luncheon in the pantry, and when the great meal was nearly over in the dining-room we were allowed to come in in time for the ice-cream and to sit, figuratively, at the feet of the honored guest and generally, literally, on his or her knees.  Young as I was in those days I can readily recall one of those lunch-parties when the contrast between Booth and Dion Boucicault struck my youthful mind most forcibly.  Booth, with his deep-set, big black eyes, shaggy hair, and lank figure, his wonderfully modulated voice, rolled out his theories of acting, while the bald-headed, rotund Boucicault, his twinkling eyes snapping like a fox-terrier&#x27;s, interrupted the sonorous speeches of the tragedian with crisp, witty criticisms or &quot;asides&quot; that made the rest of the company laugh and even brought a smile to the heavy, tragic features of Booth himself.  But there was nothing formal about our relations with John Sleeper Clark and the Jefferson family.  They were real &quot;home folks&quot; and often occupied our spare room, and when they were with us Richard and I were allowed to come to all the meals, and, even if unsolicited, freely express our views on the modern drama. In later years to our Philadelphia home came Henry Irving and his fellow player Ellen Terry and Augustin Daly and that wonderful quartet, Ada Rehan, Mrs. Gilbert, James Lewis, and our own John Drew.  Sir Henry I always recall by the first picture I had of him in our dining-room, sitting far away from the table, his long legs stretched before him, peering curiously at Richard and myself over black-rimmed glasses and then, with equal interest, turning back to the ash of a long cigar and talking drama with the famous jerky, nasal voice but always with a marvellous poise and convincing authority.  He took a great liking to Richard in those days, sent him a church-warden&#x27;s pipe that he had used as Corporal Brewster, and made much of him later when my brother was in London.  Miss Terry was a much less formal and forbidding guest, rushing into the house like a whirlwind and filling the place with the sunshine and happiness that seemed to fairly exude from her beautiful magnetic presence.  Augustin Daly usually came with at least three of the stars of his company which I have already mentioned, but even the beautiful Rehan and the nice old Mrs. Gilbert seemed thoroughly awed in the presence of &quot;the Guv&#x27;nor.&quot;  He was a most crusty, dictatorial party, as I remember him with his searching eyes and raven locks, always dressed in black and always failing to find virtue in any actor or actress not a member of his own company.  I remember one particularly acrid discussion between him and my father in regard to Julia Marlowe, who was then making her first bow to the public.  Daly contended that in a few years the lady would be absolutely unheard of and backed his opinion by betting a dinner for those present with my father that his judgment would prove correct.  However, he was very kind to Richard and myself and frequently allowed us to play about behind the scenes, which was a privilege I imagine he granted to very few of his friends&#x27; children.  One night, long after this, when Richard was a reporter in New York, he and Miss Rehan were burlesquing a scene from a play on which the last curtain had just fallen.  It was on the stage of Daly&#x27;s theatre at Thirtieth Street and Broadway, and from his velvet box at the prompt-entrance Daly stood gloomily watching their fooling.  When they had finished the mock scene Richard went over to Daly and said, &quot;How bad do you think I am as an actor, Mr. Daly?&quot; and greatly to my brother&#x27;s delight the greatest manager of them all of those days grumbled back at him:  &quot;You&#x27;re so bad, Richard, that I&#x27;ll give you a hundred dollars a week, and you can sign the contract whenever you&#x27;re ready.&quot;  Although that was much more than my brother was making in his chosen profession at the time, and in spite of the intense interest he had in the theatre, he never considered the offer seriously.  As a matter of fact, Richard had many natural qualifications that fitted him for the stage, and in after-years, when he was rehearsing one of his own plays, he could and frequently would go up on the stage and read almost any part better than the actor employed to do it.  Of course, he lacked the ease of gesture and the art of timing which can only be attained after sound experience, but his reading of lines and his knowledge of characterization was quite unusual.  In proof of this I know of at least two managers who, when Richard wanted to sell them plays, refused to have him read them the manuscript on the ground that his reading gave the dialogue a value it did not really possess. In the spring of 1880 Richard left the Episcopal Academy, and the following September went to Swarthmore College, situated just outside of Philadelphia.  I fear, however, the change was anything but a success.  The life of the big coeducational school did not appeal to him at all and, in spite of two or three friendships he made among the girls and boys, he depended for amusement almost wholly on his own resources.  In the afternoons and on holidays he took long walks over the country roads and in search of adventure visited many farmhouses.  His excuse for these calls was that he was looking for old furniture and china, and he frequently remained long enough to make sketches of such objects as he pretended had struck his artistic fancy.  Of these adventures he wrote at great length to his mother and father, and the letters were usually profusely decorated with illustrations of the most striking incidents of the various escapades.  Several of these Swarthmore experiences he used afterward in short stories, and both the letters and sketches he sent to his parents at the time he regarded in the light of preparation for his future work.  In his studies he was perhaps less successful than he had been at the Episcopal Academy, and although he played football and took part in the track sports he was really but little interested in either.  There were half-holidays on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and when my brother did not come to town I went to Swarthmore and we spent the afternoons in first cooking our lunch in a hospitable woods and then playing some games in the open that Richard had devised.  But as I recall these outings they were not very joyous occasions, as Richard was extremely unhappy over his failures at school and greatly depressed about the prospects for the future. He finished the college year at Swarthmore, but so unhappy had he been there that there was no thought in his mind or in that of his parents of his returning.  At that time my uncle, H. Wilson Harding, was a professor at Lehigh University, and it was arranged that Richard should go to Bethlehem the following fall, live with his uncle, and continue his studies at Ulrich&#x27;s Preparatory School, which made a specialty of preparing boys for Lehigh.  My uncle lived in a charming old house on Market Street in Bethlehem, quite near the Moravian settlement and across the river from the university and the iron mills.  He was a bachelor, but of a most gregarious and hospitable disposition, and Richard therefore found himself largely his own master, in a big, roomy house which was almost constantly filled with the most charming and cultivated people.  There my uncle and Richard, practically of about the same age so far as their viewpoint of life was concerned, kept open house, and if it had not been for the occasional qualms his innate hatred of mathematics caused him, I think my brother would have been completely happy.  Even studies no longer worried him particularly and he at once started in to make friendships, many of which lasted throughout his life.  As is usual with young men of seventeen, most of these men and women friends were several times Richard&#x27;s age, but at the period Richard was a particularly precocious and amusing youth and a difference of a few decades made but little difference--certainly not to Richard.  Finley Peter Dunne once wrote of my brother that he &quot;probably knew more waiters, generals, actors, and princes than any man who lived,&quot; and I think it was during the first year of his life at Bethlehem that he began the foundation for the remarkable collection of friends, both as to numbers and variety, of which he died possessed.  Although a &quot;prep,&quot; he made many friends among the undergraduates of Lehigh.  He made friends with the friends of his uncle and many friends in both of the Bethlehems of which his uncle had probably never heard.  Even at that early age he counted among his intimates William W. Thurston, who was president of the Bethlehem Iron Company, and J. Davis Brodhead, one of Pennsylvania&#x27;s most conspicuous Democratic congressmen and attorneys.  Those who knew him at that time can easily understand why Richard attracted men and women so much older than himself.  He was brimming over with physical health and animal spirits and took the keenest interest in every one he met and in everything that was going on about him.  And in the broadest sense he saw to it then, as he did throughout his life, that he always did his share. During those early days at Bethlehem his letters to his family were full of his social activities, with occasional references to his work at school.  He was always going to dinners or dances, entertaining members of visiting theatrical companies; and on Friday night my mother usually received a telegram, saying that he would arrive the next day with a party of friends whom he had inadvertently asked to lunch and a matinee.  It was after one of these weekly visits that my mother wrote Richard the following: Monday Night. MY DARLING Boy: You went off in such a hurry that it took my breath at the last.  You say coming down helps you.  It certainly does me.  It brings a real sunshine to Papa and me.  He was saying that to-day.  I gave Nolly a sort of holiday after her miseries last night.  We went down street and got Papa a present for our wedding day, a picture, after all, and then I took Miss Baker some tickets for a concert.  I saw her father who said he &quot;must speak about my noble looking boy.&quot;  I always thought him a genius but now I think him a man of penetration as well.  Then Nolly and I went over to see the Russians.  But they are closely boxed up and not allowed to-day to see visitors.  So we came home cross and hungry.  All evening I have been writing business letters. Papa has gone to a reception and Charley is hard at work at his desk. I answered Mr. Allen&#x27;s letter this morning, dear, and told him you would talk to him.  When you do, dear, talk freely to him as to me.  You will not perhaps agree with all he says.  But your own thoughts will be healthier for bringing them--as I might say, out of doors.  You saw how it was by coming down here.  Love of Christ is not a melancholy nor a morbid thing, dear love, but ought to make one more social and cheerful and alive. I wish you could come home oftener.  Try and get ahead with lessons so that you can come oftener.  And when you feel as if prayer was a burden, stop praying and go out and try to put your Christianity into real action by doing some kindness--even speaking in a friendly way to somebody.  Bring yourself into contact with new people--not John, Hugh, Uncle and Grandma, and try to act to them as Christ would have you act, and my word for it, you will go home with a new light on your own relations to Him and a new meaning for your prayers.  You remember the prayer &quot;give me a great thought to refresh me.&quot;  I think you will find some great thoughts in human beings--they will help you to understand yourself and God, when you try to help them God makes you happy my darling. MAMA. It was in this year that Richard enjoyed the thrill of seeing in print his first contribution to a periodical.  The date of this important event, important, at least, to my brother, was February 1, the fortunate publication was Judge, and the effusion was entitled &quot;The Hat and Its Inmate.&quot;  Its purport was an overheard conversation between two young ladies at a matinee and the editors thought so well of it that for the privilege of printing the article they gave Richard a year&#x27;s subscription to Judge.  His scrap-book of that time shows that in 1884 Life published a short burlesque on George W. Cable&#x27;s novel, &quot;Dr.  Sevier,&quot; and in the same year The Evening Post paid him  $1.05 for an article about &quot;The New Year at Lehigh.&quot;  It was also in the spring of 1884 that Richard published his first book, &quot;The Adventures of My Freshman,&quot; a neat little paper-covered volume including half a dozen of the short stories that had already appeared in The Lehigh Burr.  In writing in a copy of this book in later years, Richard said:  &quot;This is a copy of the first book of mine published.  My family paid to have it printed and finding no one else was buying it, bought up the entire edition.  Finding the first edition had gone so quickly, I urged them to finance a second one, and when they were unenthusiastic I was hurt.  Several years later when I found the entire edition in our attic, I understood their reluctance.  The reason the book did not sell is, I think, because some one must have read it.&quot; In the summer of 1882 Richard went to Boston, and in the following letter unhesitatingly expressed his opinion of that city and its people. BOSTON, Wednesday. July 1882. DEAR FAMILY:-- I left Newport last night or rather this morning.  I stopped at Beverly and called on Dr. Holmes.  He talked a great deal about mama and about a great many other things equally lovely in a very easy, charming way.  All I had to do was to listen and I was only too willing to do that.  We got along splendidly.  He asked me to stay to dinner but I refused with thanks, as I had only come to pay my respects and put off to Dr. Bartol&#x27;s.  Dr. Holmes accompanied me to the depot and saw me safely off.  Of all the lovely men I ever saw Dr. Bartol is the one.  He lives in a great, many roomed with as many gables, house.  Elizabethan, of course, with immense fireplaces, brass and dark woods, etchings and engravings, with the sea and rocks immediately under the window and the ocean stretching out for miles, lighthouses and more Elizabethan houses half hid on the bank, and ships and small boats pushing by within a hundred rods of the windows.  I stayed to dinner there and we had a very jolly time.  There were two other young men and another maiden besides Miss Bartol.  They talked principally about the stage; that is, the Boston Stock Company, which is their sole thought and knowledge of the drama.  The Dr. would strike off now and then to philosophizing and moralizing but his daughter would immediately sit upon him, much to my disgust but to the evident relief of the rest.  His wife is as lovely as he is but I can&#x27;t give it to you all now.  Wait until I get home. The young lady, the youths and myself came up to Boston together and had as pleasant a ride, as the heat would allow.  I left them at the depot and went up to the Parker House and then to the Art Museum.  The statuary is plaster, the coins are copies, and by the way, I found one exactly like mine, which, if it is genuine is worth, &quot;well considerable&quot;, as the personage in charge remarked.  The pictures were simply vile, only two or three that I recognized and principally Millet and some charcoal sketches of Hunt&#x27;s, who is the Apostle of Art here.  The china was very fine but they had a collection of old furniture and armor which was better than anything else.  Fresh from or rather musty from these antiques, who should I meet but the cheerful Dixey and Powers.  We had a very jolly talk and I enjoyed it immensely, not only myself but all the surrounding populace, as Dixey would persist in showing the youthful some new &quot;gag,&quot; and would break into a clog or dialect much to the delectation of the admiring Bostonians.  I am stranded here for to night and will push on to Newport to-morrow.  I&#x27;ll go see the &quot;babes&quot; to night, as there is nothing else in the city that is worth seeing that I haven&#x27;t investigated.  I left the Newburyportians in grief with regret.  I met lots of nice people and every one was so very kind to me, from the authoresses to the serving maids.  Good-bye. DICK. CHAPTER II COLLEGE DAYS In the fall of 1882 Richard entered Lehigh, but the first year of his college life varied very little from the one he had spent in the preparatory school.  During that year he had met most of the upper classmen, and the only difference was that he could now take an active instead of a friendly interest in the life and the sports of the college.  Also he had formed certain theories which he promptly proceeded to put into practical effect.  Perhaps the most conspicuous of these was his belief that cane-rushes and hazing were wholly unnecessary and barbarous customs, and should have no place in the college of his day.  Against the former he spoke at college meetings, and wrote long letters to the local papers decrying the custom.  His stand against hazing was equally vehement, and he worked hand in hand with the faculty to eradicate it entirely from the college life.  That his stand was purely for a principle and not from any fear of personal injury, I think the following letter to his father will show: BETHLEHEM, February 1882. DEAR DAD: You may remember a conversation we had at Squan about hazing in which you said it was a very black-guardly thing and a cowardly thing.  I didn&#x27;t agree with you, but when I saw how it really was and how silly and undignified it was, besides being brutal, I thought it over and changed my mind completely, agreeing with you in every respect.  A large number of our class have been hazed, taking it as a good joke, and have been laughed at by the whole college.  I talked to the boys about it, and said what I would do and so on, without much effect.  Wednesday a junior came to me, and told me I was to be hazed as I left the Opera House Friday night.  After that a great many came to me and advised and warned me as to what I should do.  I decided to get about fifty of our class outside and then fight it out; that was before I changed my mind.  As soon as I did I regretted it very much, but, as it turned out, the class didn&#x27;t come, so I was alone, as I wished to be.  You see, I&#x27;d not a very good place here; the fellows looked on me as a sort of special object of ridicule, on account of the hat and cane, walk, and so on, though I thought I&#x27;d got over that by this time.  The Opera House was partly filled with college men, a large number of sophomores and a few upper class men.  It was pretty generally known I was going to have a row, and that brought them as much as the show.  Poor Ruff was in agony all day.  He supposed I&#x27;d get into the fight, and he knew he&#x27;d get in, too, sooner or later.  If he did he&#x27;d be held and not be able to do anything, and then the next day be blamed by the whole college for interfering in a class matter.  He hadn&#x27;t any money to get into the show, and so wandered around outside in the rain in a great deal more excited state than I was.  Howe went all over town after putting on his old clothes, in case of personal damage, in search of freshmen who were at home out of the wet.  As I left the building a man grabbed me by my arm, and the rest, with the seniors gathered around; the only freshman present, who was half scared to death, clung as near to me as possible.  I withdrew my arm and faced them.  &quot;If this means hazing,&quot; I said, &quot;I&#x27;m not with you.  There&#x27;s not enough men here to haze me, but there&#x27;s enough to thrash me, and I&#x27;d rather be thrashed than hazed.&quot;  You see, I wanted them to understand exactly how I looked at it, and they wouldn&#x27;t think I was simply hotheaded and stubborn.  I was very cool about it all.  They broke in with all sorts of explanations; hazing was the last thing they had thought of.  No, indeed, Davis, old fellow, you&#x27;re mistaken.  I told them if that was so, all right, I was going home.  I saw several of my friends in the crowd waiting for me, but as I didn&#x27;t want them to interfere, I said nothing, and they did not recognize me.  When among the crowd of sophomores, the poor freshman made a last effort, he pulled me by the coat and begged me to come with him.  I said no, I was going home.  When I reached the next corner I stopped.  &quot;I gave you fair warning, keep off.  I tell you I&#x27;ll strike the first man, the first one, that touches me.&quot;  Then the four who had been appointed to seize me jumped on me, and I only got one good blow in before they had me down in the gutter and were beating me on the face and head.  I put my hands across my face, and so did not get any hard blows directly in the face.  They slipped back in a moment, and when I was ready I scrambled up pretty wet and muddy, and with my face stinging where they had struck.  It had all been done so quickly, and there was such a large crowd coming from the theatre, that, of course, no one saw it.  When I got up there was a circle all around me.  They hadn&#x27;t intended to go so far.  The men, except those four who had beaten me, were rather ashamed and wished they were out of it.  I turned to Emmerich, a postgraduate, and told him to give me room.  &quot;Now,&quot; I said, &quot;you&#x27;re not able to haze me, and I can&#x27;t thrash twelve of you, but I&#x27;ll fight any one man you bring out.&quot;  I asked for the man that struck me, and named another, but there was no response. The upper classmen, who had just arrived, called out that was fair, and they&#x27;d see it fair.  Goodnough, Purnell and Douglas, who don&#x27;t like me much, either.  Ruff was beside me by this time. He hadn&#x27;t seen anything of it, and did not get there until he heard me calling for a fair chance and challenging the class for a man.  I called out again, the second time, and still no one came, so I took occasion to let them know why I had done as I did in a short speech to the crowd.  I said I was a peaceable fellow, thought hazing silly, and as I never intended to haze myself, I didn&#x27;t intend any one to haze me.  Then I said again, &quot;This is the third time, will one of your men fight this fair?  I can&#x27;t fight twelve of you.&quot;  Just then two officers who had called on some mill-hands, who are always dying for a fight, and a citizen to help them, burst into the crowd of students, shouldering them around like sheep until they got to me, when one of them put his arm around me, and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about this crowd, but I&#x27;ll see you&#x27;re protected, sir.  I&#x27;ll give &#x27;em fair play.&quot;  One officer got hold of Ruff and pretty near shook him to pieces until I had to interfere and explain.  They were for forming a body-guard, and were loud in their denunciations of the college, and declaring they&#x27;d see me through if I was a stranger to &#x27;em. Two or three of the sophomores, when they saw how things were going, set up a yell, but Griffin struck out and sent one of them flying one way and his hat another, so the yells ended.  Howe and Murray Stuart took me up to their rooms, and Ruff went off for beefsteak for my eye, and treated the crowd who had come to the rescue, at Dixon&#x27;s, to beer.  The next day was Saturday, and as there was to be a meeting of the Athletic Association, of course, I wanted to show up.  The fellows all looked at my eye pretty hard and said nothing.  I felt pretty sure that the sympathy was all with me. Four men are elected from the college to be on the athletic committee.  They can be nominated by any one, though generally it is done by a man in their own class.  We had agreed the day before to vote for Tolman for our class, so when the president announced nominations were in order for the freshmen class, Tolman was instantly nominated.  At the same time one of the leading sophomores jumped up and nominated Mr. Davis, and a number of men from the same class seconded it.  I knew every one in the college knew of what had happened, and especially the sophomores, so I was, of course, very much surprised.  I looked unconscious, though, and waited.  One of the seniors asked that the nominees should stand up, as they didn&#x27;t know their names only their faces.  As each man rose he was hissed and groaned down again.  When I stood up the sophomores burst into a yell and clapped and stamped, yelling, &quot;Davis!  Davis! vote for D!&quot; until I sat down.  As I had already decided to nominate Tolman, I withdrew my name from the nominees, a movement which was received by loud cries of &quot;No!  No!&quot; from the sophs.  So, you see, Dad, I did as you said, as I thought was right, and came out well indeed.  You see, I am now the hero of the hour, every one in town knows it, and every one congratulates me, and, &quot;Well done, me boy,&quot; as Morrow &#x27;83 said, seems to be the idea, one gets taken care of in this world if you do what&#x27;s the right thing, if it is only a street fight.  In fact, as one of the seniors said, I&#x27;ve made five friends where I had one before.  The sophs are ashamed and sorry, as their conduct in chapel, which was more marked, than I made it, shows.  I&#x27;ve nothing to show for it but a red mark under the eye, and so it is the best thing that could possibly have happened.  Poor Ruff hugged me all the way home, and I&#x27;ve started out well in a good way, I think, though not a very logical one. Uncle says to tell you that my conduct has his approval throughout. DICK. To which letter my father promptly replied: PHILADELPHIA.  February 25th, 1882. DEAR OLD BOY: I&#x27;m glad the affair ended so well.  I don&#x27;t want you to fight, but if you have to fight a cuss like that do it with all your might, and don&#x27;t insist that either party shall too strictly observe the Markis O&#x27; Queensbury rules.  Hit first and hardest so that thine adversary shall beware of you. DAD. At that time the secret societies played a very important part in the college life at Lehigh, and while I do not believe that Richard shared the theory of some of the students that they were a serious menace to the social fabric, he was quite firm in his belief that it was inadvisable to be a member of any fraternity.  In a general way he did not like the idea of secrecy even in its mildest form, and then, as throughout his life, he refused to join any body that would in any way limit his complete independence of word or action.  In connection with this phase of his college life I quote from an appreciation which M. A. De W. Howe, one of Richard&#x27;s best friends both at college and in after-life, wrote for The Lehigh Burr at the time of my brother&#x27;s death: &quot;To the credit of the perceptive faculty of undergraduates, it ought to be said that the classmates and contemporaries of Richard Harding Davis knew perfectly well, while he and they were young together, that in him Lehigh had a son so marked in his individuality, so endowed with talents and character that he stood quite apart from the other collegians of his day.  Prophets were as rare in the eighties as they have always been, before and since, and nobody could have foreseen that the name and work of Dick Davis would long before his untimely death, indeed within a few years from leaving college, be better known throughout the world than those of any other Lehigh man.  We who knew him in his college days could not feel the smallest surprise that he won himself quickly a brilliant name, and kept a firm hold upon it to the last. &quot;What was it that made him so early a marked man?  I think it was the spirit of confidence and enthusiasm which turned every enterprise he undertook into an adventure,--the brave and humorous playing of the game of life, the true heart, the wholesome body and soul of my friend and classmate.  He did not excel in studies or greatly, in athletics.  But in his own field, that of writing, he was so much better than the rest of us that no one of his fellow-editors of the Epitome or  Burr needed to be considered in comparison with him.  No less, in spite of his voluntary nonmembership in the fraternities of his day, was he a leader in the social activities of the University.  The `Arcadian Club&#x27; devoted in its beginnings to the `pipes, books, beer and gingeralia&#x27; of Davis&#x27;s song about it and the `Mustard and Cheese&#x27; were his creations.  In all his personal relationships he was the most amusing and stimulating of companions.  With garb and ways of unique picturesqueness, rarer even in college communities a generation ago than at present, it was inevitable that he sometimes got himself laughed at as well as with.  But what did it all matter, even then?  To-day it adds a glow of color to what would be in any case a vivid, deeply valued memory. &quot;It is hard to foresee in youth what will come most sharply and permanently in the long run.  After all these years it is good to find that Davis and what his companionship gave one hold their place with the strongest influences of Lehigh.&quot; But Richard was naturally gregarious and at heart had a great fondness for clubs and social gatherings.  Therefore, having refused the offer of several fraternities that did him the honor to ask him to become a member, it was necessary for him to form a few clubs that held meetings, but no secrets.  Perhaps the most successful of these were &quot;The Mustard and Cheese,&quot; a dramatic club devoted to the presentation of farces and musical comedies, and The Arcadia Club, to the fortnightly meetings of which he devoted much time and thought.  The following letter to his father will give some idea of the scope of the club, which, as in the case of &quot;The Mustard and Cheese,&quot; gained a permanent and important place in the social life of Lehigh. DEAR DAD: We have started the best sort of a club up here which I am anxious to tell you of.  It consists of a spread, net price of which will be about 30 cents each, every two or three weeks.  Only six fellows belong and those the best of the College.  Purnell, Haines and myself founded it.  I chose Charley, Purnell, Reeves, Haines and Howe.  We will meet Saturday nights at 9 so as not to interfere with our work, and sing, read, eat and box until midnight.  It is called the &quot;Pipe and Bowl,&quot; and is meant to take the place that The Hasty Pudding, Hammer and Tongs and Mermaid do at other colleges.  Two of us are to invite two outsiders in turn each meeting.  We will hope to have Dad a member, honorary, of course, when we can persuade him to give us a night off with his company.  We want to combine a literary feature and so will have selected readings to provoke discussions after the pipes are lit.  The men are very enthusiastic about it and want to invite Mr. Allen and you and every one that they can make an honorary member of immediately. It was first as an associate editor and afterward as editor-in-chief of the college paper, The Lehigh Burr, that Richard found his greatest pleasure and interest during his three years at Lehigh.  In addition to his editorial duties he wrote a very great part of every issue of the paper, and his contributions included short stories, reports of news events, editorials, and numerous poems. As, after his life at college, Richard dropped verse as a mode of expression, I reprint two of the poems which show him in the lighter vein of those early days. A COMMENCEMENT IDYL &quot;I&#x27;m a Freshman who has ended his first year,                But I&#x27;m new;      And I do whate&#x27;er the Juniors, whom I fear,                Bid me do.           Under sudden showers I thrive;           To be bad and bold I strive,           But they ask--`Is it alive?&#x27;           So they do. I&#x27;m a Sophomore who has passed off his exams,                Let me loose!      With a mark as high as any other man&#x27;s,                As obtuse           I&#x27;m fraternal.  I am Jolly.           I am seldom melancholy           And to bone I think is folly,                What&#x27;s the use? I&#x27;m a Junior whom exams. have left forlorn,                Flunked me dead; So I&#x27;ll keep the town awake &#x27;till early morn;                Paint it red.           At class-meetings I&#x27;m a kicker,           Take no water with my liquor,           And a dumb-bell&#x27;s not thicker                Than my head. I&#x27;m a Senior whose diploma&#x27;s within reach,                Eighty-four. On Commencement Day you&#x27;ll hear my maiden-speech;                I will soar!           I got through without condition;           I&#x27;m a mass of erudition;           Do you know of a position!&quot; OUR STREET &quot;Our street is still and silent,                Grass grows from curb to curb, No baker&#x27;s bells           With jangling knells                Our studious minds disturb.           No organ grinders ever call,                No hucksters mar our peace;           For traffic shuns our neighborhood                And leaves us to our ease. But now it lives and brightens,                     Assumes a livelier hue;                The pavements wide,                On either side,                     Would seem to feel it too.                You might not note the difference,                     The change from grave to gay,                But I can tell, and know full well,                     Priscilla walks our way.&quot; Shortly after his return to college Richard celebrated his nineteenth birthday, and received these letters from his father and mother: April 17th, 1883. MY DEAR BOY: When I was thinking what I could give to you to-morrow, I remembered the story of Herder, who when he was old and weak and they brought him food and wine asked for &quot;a great thought to quicken him.&quot; So I have written some old sayings for you that have helped me.  Maybe, this year, or some other year, when I am not with you, they may give you, sometimes, comfort and strength. God bless you my son-- YOUR OLD MOTHER who loves you dearly--dearly. THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER PHILADELPHIA, April 17th, 1883. MY DEAR BOY: You are to be nineteen years old on Wednesday.  After two years more you will be a man.  You are so manly and good a boy that I could not wish you to change in any serious or great thing.  You have made us very happy through being what you have been, what you are.  You fill us with hope of your future virtue and usefulness. To be good is the best thing of all; it counts for more than anything else in the world.  We are very grateful that you have even in youth been wise enough to choose the right road.  You will find it not easy to keep upon it always, but remember if you do get off struggle back to it.  I do not know but I think God loves the effort to do as well as the act done. I congratulate you my dear son, on your new birthday.  I wish you health, happiness and God&#x27;s loving care.  May he bless you my son forever.  I enclose a trifle for your pleasure.  My love to you always, but God bless you dear Dick. DAD. In the fall of 1885, Richard decided to leave Lehigh and go to John Hopkins University, where he took a special course in such studies as would best benefit him in the career which he had now carefully planned.  During this year in Baltimore Richard&#x27;s letters show that he paid considerable attention to such important subjects as political economy and our own labor problems, but they also show that he did not neglect football or the lighter social diversions.  In a short space of time he had made many friends, was very busy going to dinners and dances, and had fallen in love with an entirely new set of maids and matrons.  Richard had already begun to send contributions to the magazines, and an occasional acceptance caused him the satisfaction common to all beginners.  It was in regard to one of these early contributions that my mother wrote Richard the following letter: PHILADELPHIA January 1887. DEAR BOY: What has become of The Current?  It has not come yet.  If it has suspended publication be sure and get your article back.  You must not destroy a single page you write.  You will find every idea of use to you hereafter. Sometimes I am afraid you think I don&#x27;t take interest enough in your immediate success now with the articles you send.  But I&#x27;ve had thirty years experience and I know how much that sort of success depends on the articles suiting the present needs of the magazine, and also on the mood of the editor when he reads it. Besides--except for your own disappointment--I know it would be better if you would not publish under your own name for a little while.  Dr. Holland--who had lots of literary shrewdness both as writer and publisher--used to say for a young man or woman to rush into print was sure ruin to their lasting fame.  They either compromised their reputations by inferior work or they made a great hit and never played up to it, afterwards, in public opinion. Now my dear old man this sounds like awfully cold comfort.  But it is the wisest idea your mother has got.  I confess I have GREAT faith in you--and I try to judge you as if you were not my son.  I think you are going to take a high place among American authors, but I do not think you are going to do it by articles like that you sent to The Current.  The qualities which I think will bring it to you, you don&#x27;t seem to value at all.  They are your dramatic eye.  I mean your quick perception of character and of the way character shows itself in looks, tones, dress, etc., and in your keen sympathy--with all kinds of people--Now, these are the requisites for a novelist.  Added to that your humour. You ought to make a novelist of the first class.  But you must not expect to do it this week or next.  A lasting, real success takes time, and patient, steady work.  Read Boz&#x27;s first sketches of &quot;London Life&quot; and compare them with &quot;Sydney Carton&quot; or &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and you will see what time and hard work will do to develop genius. I suppose you will wonder why I am moved to say all this?  It is, I think, because of your saying &quot;the article sent to St. Nicholas was the best you would be able to do for years to come&quot; and I saw you were going to make it a crucial test of your ability.  That is, forgive me, nothing but nonsense.  Whatever the article may be, you may write one infinitely superior to it next week or month.  Just in proportion as you feel more deeply, or notice more keenly, and as you acquire the faculty of expressing your feelings or observations more delicately and powerfully which faculty must come into practice.  It is not inspiration--it never was that--without practice, with any writer from Shakespeare down. me.  I don&#x27;t say, like Papa, stop writing.  God forbid.  I would almost as soon say stop breathing, for it is pretty much the same thing.  But only to remember that you have not yet conquered your art.  You are a journeyman not a master workman, so if you don&#x27;t succeed, it does not count.  The future is what I look to, for you.  I had to stop my work to say all this, so good-bye dear old chum. Yours, MOTHER. If anything worried Richard at all at this period, I think it was his desire to get down to steady newspaper work, or indeed any kind of work that would act as the first step of his career and by which he could pay his own way in the world.  It was with this idea uppermost in his mind in the late spring of 1886, and without any particular regret for the ending of his college career, that he left Baltimore and, returning to his home in Philadelphia, determined to accept the first position that presented itself.  But instead of going to work at once, he once more changed his plans and decided to sail for Santiago de Cuba with his friend William W. Thurston, who as president of the Bethlehem Steel Company, was deeply interested in the iron mines of that region.  Here and then it was that Richard first fell in love with Cuba--a love which in later years became almost an obsession with him.  Throughout his life whenever it was possible, and sometimes when it seemed practically impossible, my brother would listen to the call of his beloved tropics and, casting aside all responsibilities, would set sail for Santiago.  After all it was quite natural that he should feel as he did about this little Cuban coast town, for apart from its lazy life, spicy smells, waving palms and Spanish cooking, it was here that he found the material for his first novel and greatest monetary success, &quot;Soldiers of Fortune.&quot;  Apart from the many purely pleasure trips he made to Santiago, twice he returned there to work--once as a correspondent during the Spanish-American War, and again when he went with Augustus Thomas to assist in the latter&#x27;s film version of the play which years before Thomas had made from the novel. CHAPTER III FIRST NEWSPAPER EXPERIENCES In the late summer of 1886 Richard returned from Cuba and settled down in Philadelphia to write an article about his experiences at Santiago and to look for regular newspaper work.  Early in September he wrote his mother: September, 1886. DEAR MOTHER: I saw the Record people to-day.  They said there was not an opening but could give me &quot;chance&quot; work, that is, I was to report each day at one and get what was left over.  I said I would take it as I would have my mornings free to write the article and what afternoons I did not have newspaper work besides.  This is satisfactory.  They are either doing all they can to oblige Dad or else giving me a trial trip before making an opening.  The article is progressing but slowly.  To paraphrase Talleyrand, what&#x27;s done is but little and that little is not good.  However, since your last letter full of such excellent &quot;tips&quot; I have rewritten it and think it is much improved.  I will write to Thurston concerning the artist to-morrow.  He is away from B. at present.  On the whole the article is not bad. Your boy, DICK. Richard&#x27;s stay on The Record, however, was short-lived.  His excuse for the brevity of the experience was given in an interview some years later.  &quot;My City Editor didn&#x27;t like me because on cold days I wore gloves.  But he was determined to make me work, and gave me about eighteen assignments a day, and paid me $7. a week.  At the end of three months he discharged me as incompetent.&quot; From The Record Richard went to The Press, which was much more to his liking, and, indeed it was here that he did his first real work and showed his first promise.  For nearly three years he did general reporting and during this time gained a great deal more personal success than comes to most members of that usually anonymous profession.  His big chance came with the Johnstown flood, and the news stories he wired to his paper showed the first glimpse of his ability as a correspondent.  Later on, disguised as a crook, he joined a gang of yeggmen, lived with them in the worst dives of the city, and eventually gained their good opinion to the extent of being allowed to assist in planning a burglary.  But before the actual robbery took place, Richard had obtained enough evidence against his crook companions to turn them over to the police and eventually land them in prison.  It was during these days that he wrote his first story for a magazine, and the following letter shows that it was something of a milestone in his career. PHILADELPHIA. August, 1888. DEAR FAMILY: The St. Nicholas people sent me a check for $50 for the &quot;pirate&quot; story.  It would be insupportable affectation to say that I was not delighted.  Jennings Crute and I were waiting for breakfast when I found the letter.  I opened it very slowly, for I feared they would bluff me with some letter about illustrations or revision, or offering me a reduced subscription to the magazine.  There was a letter inside and a check.  I read the letter before I looked at the check, which I supposed would be for $30, as the other story was valued at $20.  The note said that a perfect gentleman named Chichester would be pleased if I would find enclosed a check for $50.  I looked at Jenny helplessly, and said, &quot;It&#x27;s for fifty, Jenny.&quot;  Crute had an insane look in his eyes as he murmured &quot;half a hundred dollars, and on your day off, too.&quot;  Then I sat down suddenly and wondered what I would buy first, and Crute sat in a dazed condition, and abstractedly took a handful of segars out of the box dear old Dad gave me.  As I didn&#x27;t say anything, he took another handful, and then sat down and gazed at the check for five minutes in awe.  After breakfast I calculated how much I would have after I paid my debts.  I still owe say $23, and I have some shoes to pay for and my hair to cut.  I had a wild idea of going over to New York and buying some stocks, but I guess I&#x27;ll go to Bond&#x27;s and Baker&#x27;s instead. I&#x27;m going down street now to see if Drexel wants to borrow any ready money-on the way down I will make purchases and pay bills so that my march will be a triumphal procession. I got a story on the front page this morning about an explosion at Columbia Avenue Station--I went out on it with another man my senior in years and experience, whom Watrous expected to write the story while I hustled for facts.  When we got back I had all the facts, and what little he had was incorrect--so I said I would dispense with his services and write the story myself.  I did it very politely, but it queered the man before the men, and Watrous grew very sarcastic at his expense.  Next time Andy will know better and let me get my own stories alone. Your Millionaire Son, DICK. I&#x27;m still the &quot;same old Dick&quot;; not proud a bit. This was my mother&#x27;s reply: Thursday. August 1888. DEAR DICK: Your letter has just come and we are all delighted.  Well done for old St. Nicholas!  I thought they meant to wait till the story was published.  It took me back to the day when I got $50. for &quot;Life in the Iron Mills.&quot;  I carried the letter half a day before opening it, being so sure that it was a refusal. I had a great mind to read the letter to Davis and Cecile who were on the porch but was afraid you would not like it. I did read them an extremely impertinent enclosure which was so like the letter I sent yesterday.  That I think you got it before writing this. . . .  Well I am glad about that cheque!  Have you done anything on Gallagher?  That is by far the best work you&#x27;ve done--oh, by far--Send that to Gilder.  In old times The Century would not print the word &quot;brandy.&quot;  But those days are over. Two more days--dear boy-- MOTHER. In addition to his work on The Press, Richard also found time to assist his friend, Morton McMichael, 3d, in the editing of a weekly publication called The Stage.  In fact with the exception of the services of an office boy, McMichael and Richard were The Stage.  Between them they wrote the editorials, criticisms, the London and Paris special correspondence, solicited the advertisements, and frequently assisted in the wrapping and mailing of the copies sent to their extremely limited list of subscribers.  During this time, however, Richard was establishing himself as a star reporter on The Press, and was already known as a clever news-gatherer and interviewer.  It was in reply to a letter that Richard wrote to Robert Louis Stevenson enclosing an interview he had had with Walt Whitman, that Stevenson wrote the following letter--which my brother always regarded as one of his greatest treasures: Why, thank you so much for your frank, agreeable and natural letter.  It is certainly very pleasant that all you young fellows should enjoy my work and get some good out of it and it was very kind in you to write and tell me so.  The tale of the suicide is excellently droll, and your letter, you may be sure, will be preserved.  If you are to escape unhurt out of your present business you must be very careful, and you must find in your heart much constancy.  The swiftly done work of the journalist and the cheap finish and ready made methods to which it leads, you must try to counteract in private by writing with the most considerate slowness and on the most ambitious models.  And when I say &quot;writing&quot;--O, believe me, it is rewriting that I have chiefly in mind.  If you will do this I hope to hear of you some day. Please excuse this sermon from Your obliged ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. In the spring of 1889 Richard as the correspondent of the Philadelphia Telegraph, accompanied a team of Philadelphia cricketers on a tour of Ireland and England, but as it was necessary for him to spend most of his time reporting the matches played in small university towns, he saw only enough of London to give him a great longing to return as soon as the chance offered.  Late that summer he resumed his work on The Press, but Richard was not at all satisfied with his journalistic progress, and for long his eyes had been turned toward New York.  There he knew that there was not only a broader field for such talent as he might possess, but that the chance for adventure was much greater, and it was this hope and love of adventure that kept Richard moving on all of his life. On a morning late in September, 1889, he started for New York to look for a position as reporter on one of the metropolitan newspapers.  I do not know whether he carried with him any letters or that he had any acquaintances in the journalistic world on whose influence he counted, but, in any case, he visited a number of offices without any success whatever.  Indeed, he had given up the day as wasted, and was on his way to take the train back to Philadelphia.  Tired and discouraged, he sat down on a bench in City Hall Park, and mentally shook his fist at the newspaper offices on Park Row that had given him so cold a reception.  At this all-important moment along came Arthur Brisbane, whom Richard had met in London when the former was the English correspondent of The Sun.  Brisbane had recently been appointed editor of The Evening Sun, and had already met with a rather spectacular success.  On hearing the object of Richard&#x27;s visit to New York, he promptly offered him a position on his staff and  Richard as promptly accepted.  I remember that the joyous telegram he sent to my mother, telling of his success, and demanding that the fatted calf be killed for dinner that night was not received with unalloyed happiness.  To my mother and father it meant that their first-born was leaving home to seek his fortune, and that without Richard&#x27;s love and sympathy the home could never be quite the same.  But the fatted calf was killed, every one pretended to be just as elated as Richard was over his good fortune, and in two days he left us for his first adventure. The following note to his mother Richard scribbled off in pencil at the railway-station on his way to New York: I am not surprised that you were sad if you thought I was going away for good.  I could not think of it myself.  I am only going to make a little reputation and to learn enough of the business to enable me to live at home in the centre of the universe with you.  That is truth.  God bless you. DICK. CHAPTER IV NEW YORK Of the many completely happy periods of Richard&#x27;s life there were few more joyous than the first years he spent as a reporter in New York.  For the first time he was completely his own master and paying his own way--a condition which afforded him infinite satisfaction.  He was greatly attached to Brisbane and as devoted to the interests of The Evening Sun as if he had been the editor and publisher.  In return Brisbane gave him a free rein and allowed him to write very much what and as he chose.  The two men were constantly together, in and out of office hours, and planned many of the leading features of the paper which on account of the brilliancy of its news stories and special articles was at that time attracting an extraordinary amount of attention.  Richard divided his working hours between reporting important news events, writing specials (principally about theatrical people), and the Van Bibber stories, nearly all of which were published for the first time in The Evening Sun.  These short tales of New York life soon made a distinct hit, and, while they appeared anonymously, it was generally known that Richard was their author.  In addition to his newspaper work my brother was also working on short stories for the magazines, and in 1890 scored his first real success in this field, with &quot;Gallegher,&quot; which appeared in Scribner&#x27;s.  This was shortly followed by &quot;The Other Woman,&quot;  &quot;Miss Catherwaite&#x27;s Understudy,&quot;  &quot;A Walk up the Avenue,&quot;  &quot;My Disreputable Friend, Mr. Raegen,&quot;  &quot;An Unfinished Story,&quot; and other stories that soon gave him an established reputation as a writer of fiction.  But while Richard&#x27;s success was attained in a remarkably short space of time and at an extremely early age, it was not accomplished without an enormous amount of hard work and considerable privation.  When he first went to New York his salary was but thirty dollars a week, and while he remained on The Evening Sun never over fifty dollars, and the prices he received for his first short stories were extremely meagre.  During the early days on The Evening Sun he had a room in a little house at 108 Waverly Place, and took his meals in the neighborhood where he happened to find himself and where they were cheapest.  He usually spent his week-ends in Philadelphia, but his greatest pleasure was when he could induce some member of his family to visit him in New York.  I fear I was the one who most often accepted his hospitality, and wonderful visits they were, certainly to me, and I think to Richard as well.  The great event was our Saturday-night dinner, when we always went to a little restaurant on Sixth Avenue.  I do not imagine the fifty-cent table d&#x27;hote (vin compris) the genial Mr. Jauss served us was any better than most fifty-cent table-d&#x27;hote dinners, but the place was quaint and redolent of strange smells of cooking as well as of a true bohemian atmosphere.  Those were the days when the Broadway Theatre was given over to the comic operas in which Francis Wilson and De Wolfe Hopper were the stars, and as both of the comedians were firm friends of Richard, we invariably ended our evening at the Broadway.  Sometimes we occupied a box as the guests of the management, and at other times we went behind the scenes and sat in the star&#x27;s dressing-room.  I think I liked it best when Hopper was playing, because during Wilson&#x27;s regime the big dressing-room was a rather solemn sort of place, but when Hopper ruled, the room was filled with pretty girls and he treated us to fine cigars and champagne. Halcyon nights those, and then on Sunday morning we always breakfasted at old Martin&#x27;s on University Place eggs a la Martin and that wonderful coffee and pain de menage.  And what a wrench it was when I tore myself away from the delights of the great city and scurried back to my desk in sleepy Philadelphia.  Had I been a prince royal Richard could not have planned more carefully than he did for these visits, and to meet the expense was no easy matter for him.  Indeed, I know that to pay for all our gayeties he usually had to carry his guitar to a neighboring pawn-broker where the instrument was always good for an eight-dollar loan.  But from the time Richard first began to make his own living one of the great pleasures of his life was to celebrate, or as he called it, to &quot;have a party.&quot;  Whenever he had finished a short story he had a party, and when the story had been accepted there was another party, and, of course, the real party was when he received the check.  And so it was throughout his life, giving a party to some one whom a party would help, buying a picture for which he had no use to help a struggling artist, sending a few tons of coal to an old lady who was not quite warm enough, always writing a letter or a check for some one of his own craft who had been less fortunate than he--giving to every beggar that he met, fearing that among all the thousand fakers he might refuse one worthy case.  I think this habit of giving Richard must have inherited from his father, who gave out of all proportion to his means, and with never too close a scrutiny to the worthiness of the cause.  Both men were too intensely human to do that, but if this great desire on the part of my father and brother to help others gave the recipients pleasure I&#x27;m sure that it caused in the hearts of the givers an even greater happiness.  The following letters were chosen from a great number which Richard wrote to his family, telling of his first days on The Evening Sun, and of his life in New York. YORK Evening Sun--1890 DEAR MOTHER: Today is as lovely and fresh as the morning, a real spring day, and I feel good in consequence.  I have just come from a couple of raids, where we had a very lively time, and some of them had to pull their guns.  I found it necessary to punch a few sports myself.  The old sergeant from headquarters treats me like a son and takes the greatest pride in whatever I do or write.  He regularly assigns me now to certain doors, and I always obey orders like the little gentleman that I am.  Instead of making me unpopular, I find it helps me with the sports, though it hurts my chances professionally, as so many of them know me now that I am no use in some districts.  For instance, in Mott and Pell streets, or in the Bowery, I am as safe as any precinct detective.  I tell you this to keep you from worrying.  They won&#x27;t touch a man whom they think is an agent or an officer.  Only it spoils my chances of doing reportorial-detective work.  For instance, the captain of the Bowery district refused me a detective the other morning to take the Shippens around the Chinese and the tougher quarters because he said they were as safe with me as with any of the other men whose faces are as well known.  To-night I am going to take a party to the headquarters of the fire department, where I have a cinch on the captain, a very nice fellow, who is unusually grateful for something I wrote about him and his men.  They are going to do the Still Alarm act for me. These clippings all came out in to-day&#x27;s paper.  The ladies in the Tombs were the Shippens, of course; and Mamie Blake is a real girl, and the story is true from start to finish.  I think it is a pathetic little history. Give my love to all.  I will bring on the story I have finished and get you to make some suggestions.  It is quite short.  Since Scribner&#x27;s have been so civil, I think I will give them a chance at the great prize.  I am writing a comic guide book and a history of the Haymarket for the paper; both are rich in opportunities.  This weather makes me feel like another person.  I will be so glad to get home.  With lots of love and kisses for you and Nora. DICK-O. NEW YORK--1890. DEAR CHAS: Brisbane has suggested to me that the Bradley story would lead anyone to suppose that my evenings were spent in the boudoirs of the horizontales of 34th Street and has scared me somewhat in consequence.  If it strikes you and Dad the same way don&#x27;t show it to Mother.  Dad made one mistake by thinking I wrote a gambling story which has made me nervous.  It is hardly the fair thing to suppose that a man must have an intimate acquaintance with whatever he writes of intimately.  A lot of hunting people, for instance, would not believe that I had written the &quot;Traver&#x27;s Only Ride&quot; story because they knew I did not hunt.  Don&#x27;t either you or Dad make any mistake about this. DICK. As a matter of fact they would not let me in the room, and I don&#x27;t know whether it abounded in signed etchings or Bougereau&#x27;s nymphs. NEW YORK--1890. DEAR FAMILY: Today has been more or less feverish.  In the morning&#x27;s mail I received a letter from Berlin asking permission to translate &quot;Gallegher&quot; into German, and a proof of a paragraph from The Critic on my burlesque of Rudyard Kipling, which was meant to please but which bored me.  Then the &quot;Raegen&quot; story came in, making nine pages of the Scribner&#x27;s, which at ten dollars a page ought to be $90.  Pretty good pay for three weeks&#x27; work, and it is a good story.  Then at twelve a young man came bustling into the office, stuck his card down on the desk and said, &quot;I am S. S. McClure.  I have sent my London representative to Berlin and my New York man to London.  Will you take charge of my New York end?&quot; If he thought to rattle me he was very much out of it, for I said in his same tone and manner, &quot;Bring your New York representative back and send me to London, and I&#x27;ll consider it.  As long as I am in New York I will not leave The Evening Sun.&quot; &quot;Edmund Gosse is my London representative,&quot; he said; &quot;you can have the same work here.  Come out and take lunch.&quot; I said, &quot;Thank you, I can&#x27;t; I&#x27;ll see you on Tuesday.&quot; &quot;All right,&quot; he said.  &quot;I&#x27;ll come for you.  Think of what I say.  I&#x27;ll make your fortune.  Bradford Merrill told me to get you.  You won&#x27;t have anything to do but ask people to write novels and edit them.  I&#x27;ll send you abroad later if you don&#x27;t like New York.  Can you write any children&#x27;s stories for me?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;see you Tuesday.&quot; This is a verbal report of all and everything that was said.  I consider it a curious interview.  It will raise my salary here or I go.  What do YOU think? DICK. NEW YORK--1890. DEAR FAMILY: The more I thought of the McClure offer the less I thought of it.  So I told him last night I was satisfied where I was, and that the $75 he offered me was no inducement.  Brisbane says I will get $50 about the first of October, which is plenty and enough for a young man who intends to be good to his folks.  I cannot do better than stay where I am, for it is understood between Brisbane and Laffan that in the event of the former&#x27;s going into politics I shall take his place, which will suit very well until something better turns up.  Then there is the chance of White&#x27;s coming back and my going to Lunnon, which would please me now more for what I think I could make of it than what I think others have made of it.  If I had gone to McClure I would have been shelved and side-tracked, and I am still in the running, and learning every day.   Brisbane and I have had our first serious difficulty over Mrs. R----, who is staying with Mrs. &quot;Bill.&quot;  There is at present the most desperate rivalry, and we discuss each other&#x27;s chances with great anger.  He counts on his transcontinental knowledge, but my short stories hit very hard, and he is not in it when I sing &quot;Thy Face Will Lead Me On&quot; and &quot;When Kerrigan Struck High C.&quot;  She has a fatal fondness for Sullivan, which is most unfortunate, as Brisbane can and does tell her about him by the half hour.  Yesterday we both tried to impress her by riding down in front of the porch and showing off the horses and ourselves.  Brisbane came off best, though I came off quickest, for my horse put his foot in a hole and went down on his knees, while I went over his head like the White Knight in &quot;Alice.&quot;  I would think nothing of sliding off a roof now.  But I made up for this mishap by coming back in my grey suit and having it compared with the picture in The Century.  It is a very close fight, and, while Brisbane is chasing over town for photographs of Sullivan, I am buying books of verses of which she seems to be fond.  As soon as she gets her divorce one of us is going to marry her.  We don&#x27;t know which.  She is about as beautiful a woman as I ever saw, and very witty and well-informed, but it would cost a good deal to keep her in diamonds.  She wears some the Queen gave her, but she wants more. DICK. NEW YORK--1890. DEAR MOTHER (LATE MA): I am well and with lots to do.  I went up to see Hopper the other night, which was the first time in three months that I have been back of a theater, and it was like going home.  There is a smell about the painty and gassy and dusty place that I love as much as fresh earth and newly cut hay, and the girls look so pretty and bold lying around on the sets, and the men so out of focus and with such startling cheeks and lips.  They were very glad to see me and made a great fuss.  Then I&#x27;ve been to see Carmencita dance, which I enjoyed remarkably, and I have been reading Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short stories, and I think it is disgusting that a boy like that should write such stories.  He hasn&#x27;t left himself anything to do when he gets old.  He reminds me of Bret Harte and not a bit of Stevenson, to whom some of them compare him. I am very glad you liked the lady in mid-air story so much, but it wasn&#x27;t a bit necessary to add the MORAL from a MOTHER.  I saw it coming up before I had read two lines; and a very good moral it is, too, with which I agree heartily.  But, of course, you know it is not a new idea to me.  Anything as good and true as that moral cannot be new at this late date.  I went to the Brooklyn Handicap race yesterday.  It is one of the three biggest races of the year, and a man stood in front of me in the paddock in a white hat.  Another man asked him what he was &quot;playing.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I fancy Fides myself.&quot; &quot;Fides!&quot; said his friend, &quot;why, she ain&#x27;t in it.  She won&#x27;t see home.  Raceland&#x27;s the horse for your money; she&#x27;s favorite, and there isn&#x27;t any second choice.  But Fides!  Why, she&#x27;s simply impossible.  Raceland beat HER last Suburban.&quot; &quot;Yes, I remember,&quot; said the man in the white hat, &quot;but I fancy Fides.&quot; Then another chap said to him, &quot;Fides is all good enough on a dust track on a sunny, pleasant day, but she can&#x27;t ran in the mud.  She hasn&#x27;t got the staying powers.  She&#x27;s a pretty one to look at, but she&#x27;s just a `grandstand&#x27; ladies&#x27; choice.  She ain&#x27;t in it with Raceland or Erica.  The horse YOU want is not a pretty, dainty flyer, but a stayer, that is sure and that brings in good money, not big odds, but good money.  Why, I can name you a dozen better&#x27;n Fides.&quot; &quot;Still, somehow, I like Fides best,&quot; said the obstinate man in the white hat. &quot;But Fides will take the bit in her mouth and run away, or throw the jock or break into the fence.  She isn&#x27;t steady.  She&#x27;s all right to have a little bet on, just enough for a flyer, but she&#x27;s not the horse to plunge on.  If you&#x27;re a millionaire with money to throw away, why, you might put some of it up on her, but, as it is, you want to put your money where it will be sure of a `place,&#x27; anyway.  Now, let me mark your card for you?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the man, &quot;what you all say is reasonable, I see that; but, somehow, I rather fancy Fides best.&quot; I&#x27;ve forgotten now whether Fides won or not, and whether she landed the man who just fancied her without knowing why a winner or sent him home broke.  But, in any event, that is quite immaterial, the story simply shows how obstinate some men are as regards horses and--other uncertain critters.  I have no doubt but that the Methodist minister&#x27;s daughter would have made Hiram happy if he had loved her, but he didn&#x27;t.  No doubt Anne ----, Nan ----, Katy ---- and Maude ---- would have made me happy if they would have consented to have me and I had happened to love them, but I fancied Fides. But now since I have scared you sufficiently, let me add for your peace of mind that I&#x27;ve not enough money to back any horses just at present, and before I put any money up on any one of them for the Matrimonial stakes, I will ask you first to look over the card and give me a few pointers.  I mayn&#x27;t follow them, you know, but I&#x27;ll give you a fair warning, at any rate. &quot;You&#x27;re my sweetheart, I&#x27;m your beau.&quot; DICK. NEW YORK, May 29, 1890. This is just a little good night note to say how I wish I was with you down at that dear old place and how much I love you and Nora who is getting lovelier and sweeter and prettier everyday and I know a pretty girl when I see &#x27;em, Fides, for instance.  But I won&#x27;t tease you about that any more. I finished a short silly story to night which I am in doubt whether to send off or not.  I think I will keep it until I read it to you and learn what you think. Mr. Gilder has asked me to stay with them at Marion, and to go to Cambridge with Mrs. Gilder and dear Mrs. Cleveland and Grover Cleveland, when he reads the poem before D. K. E. I have bought a book on decorations, colored, and I am choosing what I want, like a boy with a new pair of boots. Good-night, my dearest Mama. DICK. In addition to his regular work on The Evening Sun, my brother, as I have already said, was devoting a great part, of his leisure moments to the writing of short stories, and had made a tentative agreement with a well-known magazine to do a series of short sketches of New York types.  Evidently fearful that Richard was writing too much and with a view to pecuniary gain, my mother wrote the following note of warning: PHILADELPHIA, 1890. DEAR DICK: I wouldn&#x27;t undertake the &quot;types.&quot;  For one thing, you will lose prestige writing for ----&#x27;s paper.  For another, I dread beyond everything your beginning to do hack work for money.  It is the beginning of decadence both in work and reputation for you.  I know by my own and a thousand other people.  Begin to write because it &quot;is a lot of money&quot; and you stop doing your best work.  You make your work common and your prices will soon go down.  George Lewes managed George Eliot wisely. He stopped her hack work.  Kept her at writing novels and soon one each year brought her $40,000.  I am taking a purely mercenary view of the thing.  There is another which you understand better than I-- Mind your Mother&#x27;s advice to you--now and all the time is &quot;do only your best work--even if you starve doing it.&quot;  But you won&#x27;t starve.  You&#x27;ll get your dinner at Martin&#x27;s instead of Delmonico&#x27;s, which won&#x27;t hurt you in the long run.  Anyhow, $1000. for 12,500 words is not a great price. That was a fine tea you gave.  I should like to have heard the good talk.  It was like the regiment of brigadier generals with no privates. Your MOTHER. This is a letter written by my father after the publication of Richard&#x27;s story &quot;A Walk up the Avenue.&quot;  Richard frequently spoke of his father as his &quot;kindest and severest critic.&quot; PHILADELPHIA, July 22nd, 1890. 10.30 P. M. MY DEAR Boy: You can do it; you have done it; it is all right.  I have read A Walk up the Avenue.  It is far and away the best thing you have ever done--Full of fine subtle thought, of rare, manly feeling. I am not afraid of Dick the author.  He&#x27;s all right.  I shall only be afraid--when I am afraid--that Dick the man will not live up to the other fellow, that he may forget how much the good Lord has given him, and how responsible to the good Lord and to himself he is and will be for it.  A man entrusted with such talent should carry himself straighter than others to whom it is denied.  He has great duties to do; he owes tribute to the giver. Don&#x27;t let the world&#x27;s temptations in any of its forms come between you and your work.  Make your life worthy of your talent, and humbly by day and by night ask God to help you to do it. I am very proud of this work.  It is good work, with brain, bone, nerve, muscle in it.  It is human, with healthy pulse and heartsome glow in it.  Remember, hereafter, you have by it put on the bars against yourself preventing you doing any work less good.  You have yourself made your record, you can&#x27;t lower it.  You can only beat it. Lovingly, DAD. In the latter part of December, 1890, Richard left The Evening Sun to become the managing editor of Harper&#x27;s Weekly.  George William Curtis  was then its editor, and at this time no periodical had a broader or greater influence for the welfare of the country.  As Richard was then but twenty-six, his appointment to his new editorial duties came as a distinct honor.  The two years that Richard had spent on The Evening Sun had been probably the happiest he had ever known.  He really loved New York, and at this time Paris and London held no such place in his affections as they did in later years.  And indeed there was small reason why these should not have been happy years for any young man.  At twenty-six Richard had already accomplished much, and his name had become a familiar one not only to New Yorkers but throughout the country.  Youth and health he had, and many friends, and a talent that promised to carry him far in the profession he loved.  His new position paid him a salary considerably larger than he had received heretofore, and he now demanded and received much higher terms for his stories.  All of which was well for Richard because as his income grew so grew his tastes.  I have known few men who cared less for money than did my brother, and I have known few who cared more for what it could buy for his friends and for himself.  Money to him, and, during his life he made very large sums of it, he always chose to regard as income but never capital.  A bond or a share of stock meant to him what it would bring that day on the Stock Exchange.  The rainy day which is the bugaboo for the most of us, never seemed to show on his horizon.  For a man whose livelihood depended on the lasting quality of his creative faculties he had an infinite faith in the future, and indeed his own experience seemed to show that he was  justified in this belief.  It could not have been very long  after his start as a fiction writer that he received  as high a price for his work as any of his contemporaries;  and just previous to his death, more than twenty years  later, he signed a contract to write six stories at a figure which, so far as I know, was the highest ever offered an American author.  In any case, money or the lack of it certainly never caused Richard any worriment during the early days of which I write.  For what he made he worked extremely hard, but the reputation and the spending of the money that this same hard work brought him caused him infinite happiness.  He enjoyed the reputation he had won and the friends that such a reputation helped him to make; he enjoyed entertaining and being entertained, and he enjoyed pretty much all of the good things of life.  And all of this he enjoyed with the naive, almost boyish enthusiasm that only one could to whom it had all been made possible at twenty-six.  Of these happy days Booth Tarkington wrote at the time of my brother&#x27;s death: &quot;To the college boy of the early nineties Richard Harding Davis was the `beau ideal of jeunesse doree,&#x27; a sophisticated heart of gold.  He was of that college boy&#x27;s own age, but already an editor--already publishing books!  His stalwart good looks were as familiar to us as were those of our own football captain; we knew his face as we knew the face of the President of the United States, but we infinitely preferred Davis&#x27;s.  When the Waldorf was wondrously completed, and we cut an exam. in Cuneiform Inscriptions for an excursion to see the world at lunch in its new magnificence, and Richard Harding Davis came into the Palm Room--then, oh, then, our day was radiant!  That was the top of our fortune; we could never have hoped for so much.  Of all the great people of every continent, this was the one we most desired to see.&quot; Richard&#x27;s intimate friends of these days were Charles Dana Gibson, who illustrated a number of my brother&#x27;s stories, Robert Howard Russell, Albert La Montagne, Helen Benedict, now Mrs. Thomas Hastings, Ethel Barrymore, Maude Adams, E. H. Sothern, his brother,  Sam, and Arthur Brisbane.  None of this little circle was married at the time, its various members were seldom apart, and they extracted an enormous amount of fun out of life.  I had recently settled in New York, and we had rooms at 10 East Twenty-eighth Street, where we lived very comfortably for many years.  Indeed Richard did not leave them until his marriage in the summer of 1899.  They were very pleasant, sunny rooms, and in the sitting-room, which Richard had made quite attractive, we gave many teas and supper-parties.  But of all the happy incidents I can recall at the Twenty-eighth Street house, the one I remember most distinctly took place in the hallway the night that Richard received the first statement and check for his first book of short stories, and before the money had begun to come in as fast as it did afterward.  We were on our way to dinner at some modest resort when we saw and at once recognized the long envelope on the mantel.  Richard guessed it would be for one hundred and ninety dollars, but with a rather doubting heart I raised my guess to three hundred.  And when, with trembling fingers, Richard had finally torn open the envelope and found a check for nine hundred and odd dollars, what a wild dance we did about the hall-table, and what a dinner we had that night!  Not at the modest restaurant as originally intended, but at Delmonico&#x27;s! It was during these days that Seymour Hicks and his lovely wife Ellaline Terriss first visited America, and they and Richard formed a mutual attachment that lasted until his death. Richard had always taken an intense interest in the drama, and at the time he was managing editor of Harper&#x27;s Weekly had made his first efforts as a playwright.  Robert Hilliard did a one-act version of Richard&#x27;s short story, &quot;Her First Appearance,&quot; which under the title of &quot;The Littlest Girl&quot; he played in vaudeville for many years.  E. H. Sothern and Richard had many schemes for writing a play together, but the only actual result they ever attained was a one-act version Sothern did at the old Lyceum of my brother&#x27;s story, &quot;The Disreputable Mr. Raegen.&quot;  It was an extremely tense and absorbing drama, and Sothern was very fine in the part of Raegen, but for the forty-five minutes the playlet lasted Sothern had to hold the stage continuously alone, and as it preceded a play of the regulation length, the effort proved too much for the actor&#x27;s strength, and after a few performances it was taken off.  Although it was several years after this that my brother&#x27;s first long play was produced he never lost interest in the craft of playwriting, and only waited for the time and means to really devote himself to it. BOSTON, January 22nd, 1891. DEAR FAMILY:-- This is just to say that I am alive and sleepy, and that my head is still its normal size, although I have at last found one man in Boston who has read one of my stories, and that was Barrymore from New York.  The Fairchilds&#x27; dinner was a tremendous affair, and I was conquered absolutely by Mr. Howells, who went far, far out of his way to be as kind and charming as an old man could be.  Yesterday Mrs. Whitman gave a tea in her studio.  I thought she meant to have a half dozen young people to drink a cup with her, and I sauntered in in the most nonchalant manner to find that about everybody had been asked to meet me.  And everybody came, principally owing to the &quot;Harding Davis&quot; part of the name for they all spoke of mother and so very dearly that it made me pretty near weep.  Everybody came from old Dr. Holmes who never goes any place, to Mrs. &quot;Jack&quot; Gardner and all the debutantes.  &quot;I was on in that scene.&quot;  In the evening I went with the Fairchilds to Mrs. Julia Ward Howe&#x27;s to meet the S----s but made a point not to as he was talking like a cad when I heard him and Mrs. Fairchild and I agreed to be the only people in Boston who had not clasped his hand.  There were only a few people present and Mrs. Howe recited the Battle Hymn of the Republic, which I thought very characteristic of the city.  To-day I posed again and Cumnock took me over Cambridge and into all of the Clubs where I met some very nice boys and felt very old.  Then we went to a tea Cushing gave in his rooms and to night I go to Mrs. Deland&#x27;s.  But the mornings with the Fairchilds are the best. DICK. In the spring of 1891 my mother and sister, Nora, went abroad for the summer, and the following note was written to Richard just before my mother sailed: DEAR DICK: This is just to give my dearest love to you my darling.  Some day at sea when I cannot hear you nor see you, whenever it is that you get it--night or morning---you may be sure that we are all loving and thinking of you. Keep close to the Lord.  Your Lord who never has refused to hear a prayer of yours. Just think that I have kissed you a thousand times. MOTHER. FRANKLIN SQUARE, NEW YORK. June, 1891. DEAR MOTHER: Your letters are a great delight to me but I think you are going entirely too quickly.  You do not feel it now but you are simply hurrying through the courses of your long dinner so rapidly that when dessert comes you will not be up to it.  A day or two&#x27;s rest and less greed to see many things would be much more fun I should think, and you will enjoy those days more to look back to when you wandered around some little town by yourselves and made discoveries than those you spent doing what you feel you ought to do.  Excuse this lecture but I know that when I got to Paris I wanted to do nothing but sit still and read and let &quot;sights&quot; go-- You will soon learn not to duplicate and that one cathedral will answer for a dozen.  And I am disappointed in your mad desire to get to Edinboro to get letters from home, as though you couldn&#x27;t get letters from me every day of your life and as if there were not enough of you together to keep from getting homesick.  I am ashamed of you.  But that is all the scolding I have to do for I do not know what has given me more pleasure than your letters and Nora&#x27;s especially.  They tell me the best news in the world and that is, that you are all getting as much happiness out of it as I have prayed you would.  I may go over in September myself.   But I would only go to London.  Now, then for Home news.   I have sold the &quot;Reporter Who Made Himself King&quot; to  McClure&#x27;s for $300. to be published in the syndicate in  August.  I have finished &quot;Her First Appearance&quot; and Gibson  is doing the illustrations, three.  I got $175. for it. I am now at work on a story about Arthur Cumnock, Harvard&#x27;s football captain who was the hero of Class Day.  It will come out this week and will match Lieut. Grant&#x27;s chance.  In July I begin a story called the &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Tale&quot; which will be used in the November Harper.  That is all _I_ am doing. So far the notices of &quot;Gallegher&quot; have been very good, I mean the English ones. I went up to Class Day on Friday and spent the day with Miss Fairchild and Miss Howells and with Mr. H. for chaperone.  He is getting old and says he never deserved the fuss they made over him.  We had a pretty perfect day although it threatened rain most of the time.  We wandered around from one spread to another meeting beautifully dressed girls everywhere and &quot;lions&quot; and celebrities.  Then the fight for the roses around the tree was very interesting and picturesque and arena like and the best of all was sitting in the broad window seats of the dormitories with a Girl or two, generally &quot;a&quot; girl and listening to the glee club sing and watching the lanterns and the crowds of people as beautiful as Redfern could make them. Half of Seabright was burnt down last week but not my half, although the fire destroyed all the stores and fishermen&#x27;s houses and stopped only one house away from Pannachi&#x27;s, where I will put up.  I am very well and content and look forward to much pleasure this summer at Seabright and much work.  I find I have seldom been so happy as when working hard and fast as I have been forced to do these last two weeks and so I will keep it up.  Not in such a way as to hurt me but just enough to keep me happy. DICK. NEW YORK, August 1891. From The Pall Mall Budget Gazette. &quot;The Americans are saying, by the way, that they have discovered a Rudyard Kipling of their own.  This is Mr. Richard Harding Davis, a volume of whose stories has been published this week by Mr. Osgood.  Mr. Davis is only twenty-six, was for sometime on the staff of the New York Evening Sun.  He is now the editor of Harper&#x27;s Weekly.&quot; That is me.  I have also a mother and sister who once went to London and what do you think they first went to see, in London, mind you.  They got into a four wheeler and they said &quot;cabby drive as fast as you can,&quot; not knowing that four wheelers never go faster than a dead march--&quot; to--&quot; where do you think? St. Paul&#x27;s, the Temple, the Abbey, their lodgings, the Houses of Parliament--the Pavilion Music Hall--the Tower--no to none of these--&quot;To the Post Office.&quot;  That is what my mother and sister did!  After this when they hint that they would like to go again and say &quot;these muffins are not English muffins&quot; and &quot;do you remember the little Inn at Chester, ah, those were happy days,&quot; I will say, &quot;And do you remember the Post Office in Edinburgh and London.  We have none such in America.&quot;  And as they only go abroad to get letters they will hereafter go to Rittenhouse Square and I will write letters to them from London.  All this shows that a simple hurriedly written letter from Richard Harding Davis is of more value than all the show places of London.  It makes me quite PROUD.  And so does this: &quot;`Gallegher&#x27; is as good as anything of Bret Harte&#x27;s, although it is in Mr. Davis&#x27;s own vein, not in the borrowed vein of Bret Harte or anybody else.  `The Cynical Miss Catherwaight&#x27; is very good, too, and `Mr. Raegen&#x27; is still better.&quot; But on the other hand, it makes me tired, and so does this: &quot;`The Other Woman&#x27; is a story which offends good taste in more than one way.  It is a blunder to have written it, a greater blunder to have published it, and a greater blunder STILL to have republished it.&quot; I suppose now that Dad has crossed with Prince George and Nora has seen the Emperor, that you will be proud too.  But you will be prouder of your darling boy Charles, even though he does get wiped out at Seabright next week and you will be even prouder when he writes great stories for The Evening Sun. RICHARD. The Players, 16 Gramercy Park. 24th,  1891. DEAR FAMILY: I had a great day at the game and going there and coming back.  I met a great many old football men and almost all of them spoke of the &quot;Out of the Game&quot; story.  Cumnock, Camp, Poe, Terry and lots more whose names mean nothing to you, so ignorant are you, were there and we had long talks. I went to see Cleveland yesterday about a thing of which I have thought much and talked less and that was going into politics in this country.  To say he discouraged me in so doing would be saying the rain is wet.  He seemed to think breaking stones as a means of getting fame and fortune was quicker and more genteel.  I also saw her and the BABY.  She explained why she had not written you and also incidentally why she HAD written Childs.  I do not know as what Cleveland said made much impression upon me--although I found out what I could expect from him--that is nothing here but apparently a place abroad if I wanted it.  But he thought Congress was perfectly feasible but the greatest folly to go there. DICK. CHAPTER V FIRST TRAVEL ARTICLES For Richard these first years in New York were filled to overflowing with many varied interests, quite enough to satisfy most young men of twenty-seven.  He had come and seen and to a degree, so far as the limitation of his work would permit, had conquered New York, but Richard thoroughly realized that New York was not only a very small part of the world but of his own country, and that to write about his own people and his own country and other people and other lands he must start his travels at an early age, and go on travelling until the end.  And for the twenty-five years that followed that was what Richard did.  Even when he was not on his travels but working on a novel or a play at Marion or later on at Mount Kisco, so far as it was possible he kept in touch with events that were happening and the friends that he had made all over the globe.  He subscribed to most of the English and French illustrated periodicals and to one London daily newspaper which every day he read with the same interest that he read half a dozen New York newspapers and the interest was always that of the trained editor at work.  Richard was not only physically restless but his mind practically never relaxed.  When others, tired after a hard day&#x27;s work or  play, would devote the evening to cards or billiards  or chatter, Richard would write letters or pore over some strange foreign magazine, consult maps, make notes, or read the stories of his contemporaries.  He practically read every American magazine from cover to cover--advertisements were a delight to him, and the finding of a new writer gave him as much pleasure as if he had been the fiction editor who had accepted the first story by the embryo genius.  The official organs of our army and navy he found of particular interest.  Not only did he thus follow the movements of his friends in these branches of the service but if he read of a case wherein he thought a sailor or a soldier had been done an injustice he would promptly take the matter up with the authorities at Washington, and the results he obtained were often not only extremely gratifying to the wronged party but caused Richard no end of pleasure. According to my brother&#x27;s arrangement with the Harpers, he was to devote a certain number of months of every year to the editing of The Weekly, and the remainder to travel and the writing of his experiences for Harper&#x27;s Monthly.  He started on the first of these trips in January, 1892, and the result was a series of articles which afterward appeared under the title of &quot;The West from a Car Window.&quot; January, 1892. (Some place in Texas) I left St. Louis last night, Wednesday, and went to bed and slept for twelve hours.  To-day has been most trying and I shall be very glad to get on dry land again.  The snow has ceased although the papers say this is the coldest snap they have had in San Antonio in ten years.  It might have waited a month for me I think.  It has been a most dreary trip from  a car window point of view.  Now that the snow has gone, there is mud and ice and pine trees and colored people, but no cowboys as yet.  They talk nothing but Chili and war and they make such funny mistakes.  We have a G. A. R. excursion on the train, consisting of one fat and prosperous G. A. R., the rest of the excursion having backed out on account of Garza who the salient warriors imagine as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.  One old chap with white hair came on board at a desolate station and asked for &quot;the boys in blue&quot; and was very much disgusted when he found that &quot;that grasshopper Garza&quot; had scared them away-- He had tramped five miles through the mud to greet a possible comrade and was much chagrined.  The excursion shook hands with him and they took a drink together.  The excursion tells me he is a glass manufacturer, an owner of a slate quarry and the best embalmer of bodies in the country.  He says he can keep them four years and does so &quot;for specimens&quot; those that are left on his hands and others he purchases from the morgue.  He has a son who is an actor and he fills me full of the most harrowing tales of Indian warfare and the details of the undertaking business.  He is SO funny about the latter that I weep with laughter and he cannot see why-- Joe Jefferson and I went to a matinee on Wednesday and saw Robson in &quot;She stoops to Conquer.&quot;  The house was absolutely packed and when Joe came in the box they yelled and applauded and he nodded to them in the most fatherly, friendly way as though to say &quot;How are you, I don&#x27;t just remember your name but I&#x27;m glad to see you--&quot; It was so much sweeter than if he had got up and bowed as I would have done. SAN ANTONIO I knew more about Texas than the Texans and when they told me I would find summer here I smiled knowingly-- That is all the smiling I have done---Did you ever see a stage set for a garden or wood scene by daylight or Coney Island in March--that is what the glorious, beautiful baking city of San Antonio is like.  There is mud and mud and mud--in cans, in the gardens of the Mexicans and snow around the palms and palmettos-- Does the sun shine anywhere?  Are people ever warm-- It is raw, ugly and muddy, the Mexicans are merely dirty and not picturesque.  I am greatly disappointed.  But I have set my teeth hard and I will go on and see it through to the bitter end-- But I will not write anything for publication until I can take a more cheerful view of it.  I already have reached the stage where I admit the laugh is on me-- But there is still London to look forward to and this may get better when the sun comes out---I went to the fort to-day and was most courteously received.  But they told me I should go on to Laredo, if I expected to see any campaigning-- There is no fighting nor is any expected but they say they will give me a horse and I can ride around the chaparral as long as I want.  I will write you from Laredo, where I go to-morrow, Saturday-- DICK. At Laredo Richard left the beaten track of the traveller, and with Trooper Tyler, who acted as his guide, joined Captain Hardie in his search for Garza.  The famous revolutionist was supposed to be in hiding this side of the border, and the Mexican Government had asked the United States to find him and return him to the officials of his own country. In Camp, February 2nd. DEAR MOTHER:-- We have stopped by the side of a trail for a while and I will take the chance it gives me to tell you what I have been doing.  After Tyler and I returned to camp, we had a day of rest before Captain Hardie arrived.  He is a young, red-moustached, pointed-bearded chap with light blue eyes, rough with living in the West but most kind hearted and enthusiastic.  He treats me as though I were his son which is rather absurd as he is only up to my shoulder.  It is so hot I cannot make the words go straight and you must not mind if I wander.  We are hugging a fence for all the shade there is and the horses and men have all crawled to the dark side of it and are sleeping or swearing at the sun.  It is about two o&#x27;clock and we have been riding since half-past seven.  I have had a first rate time but I do not see that there has been much in it to interest any one but myself and where Harper Brothers or the &quot;gentle reader&quot; comes in, I am afraid I cannot see, and if I cannot see it I fear he will be in a bad way.  It has pleased and interested me to see how I could get along under difficult circumstances and with so much discomfort but as I say I was not sent out here to improve my temper or my health or to make me more content with my good things in the East.  If we could have a fight or something that would excuse and make a climax for all this marching and reconnoitering and discomfort the story would have a suitable finale and a raison d&#x27;etre.  However, I may get something out of it if only to abuse the Government for their stupidity in chasing a jack rabbit with a brass band or by praising the men for doing their duty when they know there is no duty to be done.  This country is more like the ocean than anything else and drives one crazy with its monotony and desolation.  And to think we went to war with Mexico for it-- To-day is my tenth day with the troops in the camp and in the field and I will leave them as soon as this scout is over which will be in three days at the most.  Then I will go to Corpus Christi and from there to the ranches but I will wait until I get baths, hair cuts and a dinner and cool things to drink-- One thing has pleased me very much and that is that I, with Tyler and the Mexican Scout made the second best riding record of the troop since they have been in the field this winter.  The others rode 115 miles in 32 hours, four of them under the first Sergeant, after revolutionists, and we made 110 miles in 33 hours.  The rest of the detachment made 90 miles and our having the extra thirty to our credit was an accident.  On the 31st Hardie sent out the scout and two troopers, of which Tyler was one, to get a trail and as I had been resting and loafing for three days, I went out with them.  We left at eight after breakfast and returned at seven, having made thirty miles.  When we got in we found that a  detachment was going out on information sent in while we were out.  Tyler was in it and so we got fresh horses and put out at nine o&#x27;clock by moonlight.  That was to keep the people in the ranch from knowing we were going out.  We rode until half-past three in the morning and then camped at the side of the road until half--past six, when we rode on until five in the afternoon.  The men who were watching to see me give up grew more and more interested as the miles rolled out and the First Sergeant was very fearful for his record for which he has been recommended for the certificate of merit.  The Captain was very much pleased and all the men came and spoke to me.  It must have been a good ride for Tyler who is a fifth year man was so tired that he paid a man to do his sentry duty.  We slept at Captain Hunter&#x27;s camp that last night and we both came on this morning, riding thirty miles up to two o&#x27;clock to-day.  From here we go on into the brush again.  I am very proud of that riding record and of my beard which is fine.  I will finish this when we get near a post-office. DICK. February 4th-- We rode forty miles through the brush but saw nothing of Garza, who was supposed to be in it.  But we captured 3 revolutionists, one of whom ran away but the scout got him.  Hardie, Tyler, who is his orderly, and the scout and I took them in because the rest of the column was lagging in the rear and the Lieutenant got bally hooly for it.  Tyler disarmed one and I took away the other chaps things.  Then we took a fourth in and let them all go for want of evidence and after some of the ranch men had identified them. CORPUS CHRISTI, February 6. We ended our scout yesterday, and camped at Captain Hunter&#x27;s last night-- Mother can now rest her soul in peace as I have done with scoutings and have replaced the free and easy belt and revolver for the black silk suspenders and the fire badge of civilization.  I am still covered with 11 days dirt but will get lots of good things to eat and drink and smoke at Corpus Christi to night, where I will stay for two days.  I am writing this on the car and a ranger is shooting splinters out of the telegraph poles from the window in front and has a New York drummer in a state of absolute nervous prostration.  I met the Rangers last night as we came into camp and find them quite the most interesting things yet.  They are just what I expected to find here and have not disappointed me.  Everything else is either what we know it to be and know all about or else is disappointingly commonplace.  I mean we know certain things are picturesque and I find them so but they have been &quot;done&quot; to death and new material seems so scarce.  I am sometimes very fearful of the success of the letters-- However, the Rangers I simply loved.  They were gentle voiced and did not swear as the soldiers do and some of them were as handsome men as I ever saw and SO BIG.  And such children.  They showed me all their tricks at the request of the Adjutant General, who looks upon them as his special property.  They shot four shots into a tree with a revolver, going at full gallop, hit a mark with both hands at once, shot with the pistol upside down and the Captain put eight shots into a board with a Winchester, while I was putting two into the field around it.  We got along very well indeed and they were quite keen for me to go back and chase Garza.  They are sure they have him now.  I gave the Captain permission to put four shots into my white helmet.  He only put two and the rest of the company thinking their reputations were at stake whipped out their guns and snatched up their rifles and blazed away until they danced the hat all over the ranch.  Then remorse overcame them and they proposed taking up a collection to get me a sombrero, which I stopped.  So Nora&#x27;s hat is gone but I am going to get another and save myself from sunstroke again.  The last part of the ride was enlivened by the presence of three Mexican murderers handcuffed and chained with iron bands around the neck, that is Texas civilization isn&#x27;t it-- I have had my dinner and a fine dinner it was with fresh fish and duck and oysters and segars which I have not had for a week.  I am finishing this at Constantine&#x27;s and will be here for two days to write things and will then go on to King&#x27;s ranch and from there to San Antonio, where I will also rest a week.  I will just about get through my schedule in the ten weeks at this rate.  I had a good time in the bush and am enjoying it very much though it is lonely now and then-- Still, it is very interesting and if the stories amount to anything I will be pleased but I am constantly wondering how on earth Chas stood it as he did.  He is a hero to me for I have some hope of getting back and he had not-- He is a sport-- How I will sleep to night--a real bed and sheets and pajamas, after the ground and the same clothes for eleven days. of love. DICK. While Richard was travelling in the West, his second volume of short stories, &quot;Van Bibber and Others,&quot; was published.  The volume was dedicated to my father, who wrote Richard the following letter: PHILADELPHIA, February 15, 1892. MY DEAR OWN DICK: I have not been the complete letter writer I should have been, as I told you on Saturday, but I know you will  understand.  Your two good letters came this evening, one to Mamma and one to Nora.  They were a good deal to us all, most, of course, to your dear mother and sister, who have a fond, foolish fancy or love for you--strange--isn&#x27;t it?  Yes, dear boy, I liked the new story very, very much.  It was in your best book and in fine spirit, and I liked, too, the dedication of the book--its meaning and its manner.  I am glad to be associated with my dear boy and with his work even in that brief way.  You may not yet thought about it after this fashion, but I have thought a good deal about it.  Reports come to me of you from many sources, and they are all good, and they all reflect honor upon me-- Upon me as I&#x27;m getting ready to salute the world, as our French friends say.  It is very pleasant to me as I think it over to feel and to know that my boy has honored my name, that he has done something good and useful in the world and for the world.  I have something more than pride in you.  I am grateful to you.  If this is a little prosie, dear old fellow, forgive it.  It is late at night and I am a little tired, and being tired stupid.  You saw The Atlantic notice of your work.  I wish you could have heard Nora on the author of it, who would not have been happy in his mind if he had unhappily heard her.  She went for that Heathen Chinee like a wild cat.  No disrespect to her, but, all the same, like a wild cat.  To me it was interesting.  I did not agree with it, but here and there I saw the flash of truth even in the adverse praise.  I should have had more respect for the author&#x27;s opinion if he had liked that vital speck, Raegen.  If he could not see the divine, human spark in that--a flash from Calvary, what is the use of considering him?  My greatest pride in you, that which has added some sweetness and joy to my life, has been the recognition that something of the divine element was given you, and that your voice rang out sweet and pure at a time when other voices were sounding the fascinations of impurity.  That, like Christ, you taught humanity.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of being thought &quot;fresh,&quot; fear to be thought &quot;knowing.&quot;  Life isn&#x27;t much worth at best,--it is worth nothing at all unless some good be done in it---the more, the better.  Don&#x27;t make it too serious either.  Enjoy it as you go, but after a fashion that will bring no reproach to your manhood.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to preach the truth and above all the religion of humanity.  Good night, dear boy.  I&#x27;m a little tired to night.  With great love, DAD. ANADARKO-February 26th, 1892. DEAR FAMILY:-- I could not write you before as I have been traveling from pillars to posts, (a joke), in a stage, night and day.  I went to Fort Reno from Oklahoma City where they drove me crazy almost with town lots and lot sites and homestead holdings.  It was all raw and mean, and greedy for money and a man is much better off in every way in a tenement on Second Avenue than the &quot;owner of his own home&quot; in one of these mushroom cities-- So I think.  I went to Fort Reno by stage and it seemed to me that I was really in the West for the first time-- The rest has been as much like the oil towns around Pittsburgh  as anything else.  But here there are rolling prairie lands with millions of prairie dogs and deep canons and bluffs of red clay that stand out as clear as a razor hollowed and carved away by the water long ago.  And the grass is as high as a stirrup and the trees very plentiful after the plains of Texas.  The men at Fort Reno were the best I have met, indeed I am just a little tired of trying to talk of things of interest to the Second Lieutenant&#x27;s intellect.  But I had to leave there because I had missed the beef issue and had to see it and as it was due here I pushed on.  This post is very beautiful but the men are very young and civil appointments mainly, which means that they have not been to West Point but had fathers and have friends with influence and they are fresh.  But the scenery around the post is delightfully wild and big and there is an Indian camp at the foot of the hill on which the fort is stuck.  Mother, instead of going to Europe, should come here and see her Indians.  Only if she did she would bring a dozen or more of the children back with her.  They are the brightest spot in my trip and I spend the mornings and afternoons trying to get them to play with me.  They are very shy and pretty and beautifully barbaric and wear the most gorgeous trappings.  The women, the older ones, are the ugliest women I ever saw.  But the men are fine.  I never saw such color as they give to the landscape and one always thinks they have dressed up just to please you.  I have spent most of my time and money in buying things from them but they are very dear because the Indians take long to make them and do not like to part with them.  I have had rough times lately but I think I would be content to remain in the west six months if I could.  It is the necessity of leaving places I like and pushing on to places I don&#x27;t, I dislike.  Reno was fine with a band and lots of fine fellows.  This post is not so queer but they are so young-- It makes a great bit of color though with the yellow capes of the cavalry and the soldiers wig--waging red and white flags at other soldiers eight miles away on other mountains and the Indians in yellow buckskin and blankets and their faces painted too.  I went to the beef issue to-day--it was not a pretty sight and most barbarous and cruel.  I also went to a council at which the chiefs were protesting against the cutting down of their rations which is Commissioner Morgan&#x27;s doing and which it is expected will lead to war-- We went in out of curiosity and without knowing it was a Council and were very much ashamed when one of the Chiefs rose and said he was glad to see the officers present as they were the best friends the Indians had and the only men they could respect in times of peace as a friend, or in times of war as an enemy.  At which we took off our hats and sat it through.  Mother&#x27;s blood would rise if she could hear the stories they tell, and they are so dignified and polite.  They have an Indian troop here, like the one described in The Weekly, which you should read and the Captain told them I was a great Chief from the East, whereat all the soldiers who were of noble lineage claimed their privilege of shaking hands with me, which had a demoralizing effect upon the formation and the white privates were either convulsed with mirth or red with indignation.  But you cannot treat them like white men who do not know their ancestors-- Dad&#x27;s letter was the best I have ever got from him and he had always better write when he is tired.  I will always keep it. DICK. DENVER--March 7, 1892. DEAR FAMILY: I arrived in Denver Friday night and realized that I was  in a city again where the more you order people about the more they do for you, being civilized and so understanding that you mean to tip them.  I found my first letter on the newsstand and was very much pleased with it, and with the way they put it out.  The proof was perfect and if there had been more pictures I would have been entirely satisfied, as it was I was very much pleased.  My baggage had not come, so covered with mud and dust and straw from the stages and generally disreputable I went to see a burlesque, and said &quot;Front row, end seat,&quot; just as naturally as though I was in evening dress and high hat--and then I sank into a beautiful deep velvet chair and saw Amazon marches and ladies in tights and heard the old old jokes and the old old songs we know so well and sing so badly.  The next morning I went for my mail and the entire post office came out to see me get it.  It took me until seven in the evening to finish it, and I do not know that it will ever be answered.  The best of it was that you were all pleased with my letters.  That put my mind at rest.  Then there was news of deaths and marriages and engagements and the same people doing the same things they did when I went away.  I did not intend to present any letters as I was going away that night to Creede, but I found I could not get any money unless some one identified me so I presented one to a Mr. Jerome who all the bankers said they would be only too happy to oblige.  After one has been variously taken for a drummer, photographer and has been offered so much a line to &quot;write up&quot; booming towns, it is a relief to get back to a place where people know you.--I told Mr. Jerome I had a letter of introduction and that I was Mr. Davis and he shook hands and then looked at the letter and said &quot;Good Heavens are you that Mr. Davis&quot; and then rushed off and brought back the entire establishment brokers, bankers and mine owners and they all sat around and told me funny stories and planned more things for me to do and eat than I could dispose of in a month. I am now en route to Creede.  Creede when you first see it in print looks like creede but after you have been in Denver or Colorado even for one day it reads like C R E E D E.  All the men on this car think they are going to make their fortunes, and toward that end they have on new boots and flannel shirts, and some of them seeing my beautiful clothing and careful array came over and confided to me that they were really not so tough as they looked and had never worn a flannel shirt before.  This car is typical of what they told me I would find at Creede.  There are rich mine owners who are pointed out by the conductor as the fifth part owner of the &quot;Pot Luck&quot; mine, and dudes in astrakan fur coats over top boots and new flannel shirts, and hardened old timers with their bedding and tin pans, who have prospected all over the state and women who are smoking and drinking. I feel awfully selfish whenever I look out of the car window.  Switzerland which I have never seen is a spot on the map compared to this.  The mountains go up with snow on one side and black rows of trees and rocks on the other, and the clouds seem packed down between them.  The sun on the snow and the peaks peering above the clouds is all new to me and so very beautiful that I would like to buy a mountain and call it after my best girl.  I will finish this when I get to Creede.  I expect to make my fortune there. DICK. CREEDE, March 7. A young man in a sweater and top boots met me at the depot and said that I was Mr. Davis and that he was a young man whose life I had written in &quot;There was 90 and 9.&quot;  He was from Buffalo and was editing a paper in Creede.  He said I was to stop with him-- Creede is built of new pine boards and lies between two immense mountains covered with pines and snow.  The town is built in the gulley and when the spring freshets come will be a second Johnstown.  Faber, the young man, took me to the Grub State Cabin where I found two most amusing dudes and thoroughbred sports from Boston, Harvard men living in a cabin ten by eight with four bunks and a stove, two banjos and H O P E.  They own numerous silver mines, lots, and shares, but I do not believe they have five dollars in cash amongst them.  They have a large picture of myself for one of the ORNAMENTS and are great good fellows.  We sat up in our bunks until two this morning talking and are planning to go to Africa and Mexico and Asia Minor together.--Lots of love. DICK. Very happy indeed to be back in his beloved town, Richard returned to New York late in March, 1892, and resumed his editorial duties.  But on this occasion his stay was of particularly short duration, and in May, he started for his long-wished-for visit to London.  The season there was not yet in full swing, and after spending a few days in town, journeyed to Oxford, where he settled down to amuse himself and collect material for his first articles on English life as he found it.  In writing of this visit to Oxford, H. J. Whigham, one of Richard&#x27;s oldest friends, and who afterward served with him in several campaigns, said: &quot;When we first met Richard Harding Davis he was living, to all practical purposes, the life of an undergraduate at Balliol College, Oxford.  Anyone at all conversant with the customs of universities, especially with the idiosyncrasies of Oxford, knows that for a person who is not an undergraduate to share the life of undergraduates on equal terms, to take part in their adventures, to be admitted to their confidence is more difficult than it is for the camel to pass through the eye of a needle or for the rich man to enter heaven.  It was characteristic of Davis that although he was a few years older than the average university &quot;man&quot; and came from a strange country and, moreover, had no official reason for being at Oxford at all, he was accepted as one of themselves by the Balliol undergraduates, in fact, lived in Balliol for at least a college term, and happening to fall in with a somewhat enterprising generation of Balliol men he took the lead in several escapades which have been written into Oxford history.  There is in the makeup of the best type of college undergraduate a wonderful spirit of adventure, an unprejudiced view of life, an almost Quixotic feeling for romance, a disdain of sordid or materialistic motives, which together make the years spent at a great university the most golden of the average man&#x27;s career.  These characteristics Davis was fortunate enough to retain through all the years of his life.  The same spirit that took him out with a band of Oxford youths to break down an iron barrier set by an insolent landowner across the navigable waters of Shakespeare&#x27;s Avon carried him, in after years, to the battlefields where Greece fought against the yoke of Turkey, to the insurrecto camps of Cuba, to the dark horrors of the Congo, to Manchuria, where gallant Japan beat back the overwhelming power of Russia, to Belgium, where he saw the legions of Germany trampling over the prostrate bodies of a small people.  Romance was never dead while Davis was alive.&quot; That Richard lost no time in making friends at Oxford as, indeed, he never failed to do wherever he went, the following letters to his mother would seem to show: OXFORD--May, 1892. DEAR FAMILY: I came down here on Saturday morning with the Peels, who gave an enormous boating party and luncheon on a tiny little island.  The day was beautiful with a warm brilliant sun, and the river was just as narrow and pretty as the head of the Squan river, and with old walls and college buildings added.  We had the prettiest Mrs. Peel in our boat and Mrs. Joseph Chamberlain, who was Miss Endicott and who is very sweet and pretty.  We raced the other punts and rowboats and soon, after much splashing and exertion, reached the head of the river.  Then we went to, tea in New College and to see the sights of the different colleges now on the Thames.  The barges of the colleges, painted different colors and gilded like circus band-wagons and decorated with coats of arms and flying great flags, lined the one shore for a quarter of a mile and were covered by girls in pretty frocks and under-grads in blazers.  Then the boats came into sight one after another with the men running alongside on the towpath.  This was one of the most remarkable sights of the country so far.  There were over six hundred men coming six abreast, falling and stumbling and pushing, shouting and firing pistols.  It sounded like a cavalry charge and the line seemed endless.  The whole thing was most theatrical and effective.  Then we went to the annual dinner of the Palmerston Club, where I made a speech which was, as there is no one else to tell you, well received, &quot;being frequently interrupted with applause,&quot; from both the diners and the ladies in the gallery.  It was about Free Trade and the way America was misrepresented in the English papers, and composed of funny stories which had nothing to do with the speech.  I did not know I was going to speak until I got there, and considering the fact, as Wilson says, that your uncle was playing on a strange table with a crooked cue he did very well.  The next morning we breakfasted with the Bursar of Trinity and had luncheon with the Viscount St. Cyres to meet Lord and Lady Coleridge.  St. Cyres is very shy and well-bred, and we would have had a good time had not the M. P.&#x27;s present been filled with awe of the Lord Chief Justice and failed to draw him out.  As it was he told some very funny stories; then we went to tea with Hubert Howard, in whose rooms I live and am now writing, and met some stupid English women and shy girls.  Then we dined with the dons at New College, so--called because it is eight hundred years old.  We sat at a high table in a big hall hung with pictures and lit by candles.  The under-grads sat beneath in gowns and rattled pewter mugs.  We all wore evening dress and those that had them red and white fur collars.  After dinner we left the room according to some process of selection, carrying our napkins with us.  We entered a room called the Commons, where we drank wines and ate nuts and raisins.  It was all very solemn and dull and very dignified.  Outside it was quite light although nine o&#x27;clock.  Then we marched to another room where there were cigars and brandy and soda, but Arthur Pollen and I had to go and take coffee with the Master of Balliol, the only individual of whom Pollen stands in the least awe.  He was a dear old man who said, &quot;O yes, you&#x27;re from India,&quot; and on my saying &quot;No, from America&quot;; he said, &quot;O yes, it&#x27;s the other one.&quot;  I found the other one was an Indian princess in a cashmere cloak and diamonds, who looked so proud and lovely and beautiful that I wanted to take her out to one of the seats in the quadrangle and let her weep on my shoulder.  How she lives among these cold people I cannot understand.  We were all to go to a concert in the chapel, and half of the party started off, but the Master&#x27;s wife said, &quot;Oh, I am sure the Master expects them to wait for him in the hall.  It is always done.&quot;  At which all the women made fluttering remarks of sympathy and the men raced off to bring the others back.  Only the Indian girl and I remained undisturbed and puzzled.  The party came back, but the Master saw them and said, &quot;Well, it does not matter, but it is generally done.&quot;  At which we all felt guilty.  When we got to the chapel everybody stood up until the Master&#x27;s party sat down, but as it was broken in the middle of the procession, they sat down, and then, seeing we had not all passed, got up again, so that I felt like saying, &quot;As you were, men,&quot; as they do out West in the barracks.  Then Lord Coleridge in taking off his overcoat took off his undercoat, too, and stood unconscious of the fact before the whole of Oxford.  The faces of the audience which packed the place were something wonderful to see; their desire to laugh at a tall, red-faced man who looks like a bucolic Bill Nye struggling into his coat, and then horror at seeing the Chief Justice in his shirt-sleeves, was a terrible effort--and no one would help him, on the principle, I suppose, that the Queen of Spain has no legs. He would have been struggling yet if I had not, after watching him and Lady Coleridge struggling with him, for a full minute, taken his coat and firmly pulled the old gentleman into it, at which he turned his head and winked. I will go back to town by the first to see the Derby and will get into lodgings there.  I AM HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME AND AM VERY WELL.  The place is as beautiful as one expects and yet all the time startling one with its beauty. DICK. When the season at Oxford was over Richard returned to London and took a big sunny suite of rooms in the Albany.  Here he settled down to learn all he could of London, its ways and its people.  In New York he had already met a number of English men and women distinguished in various walks of life, and with these as a nucleus he soon extended his circle of friends until it became as large as it was varied.  In his youth, and indeed throughout his life, Richard had the greatest affection for England and the English.  No truer American ever lived, but he thought the United States and Great Britain were bound by ties that must endure always.  He admired British habits, their cosmopolitanism and the very simplicity of their mode of living.  He loved their country life, and the swirl of London never failed to thrill him.  During the last half of his life Richard had perhaps as many intimate friends in London as in New York.  His fresh point of view, his very eagerness to understand theirs, made them welcome him more as one of their own people than as a stranger.   LONDON, June 3, 1892. DEAR FAMILY: I went out to the Derby on Wednesday and think it is the most interesting thing I ever saw over here.  It is SO like these people never to have seen it.  It seems to be chiefly composed of costermongers and Americans.  I got a box-seat on a public coach and went out at ten.  We rode for three hours in a procession of donkey shays, omnibuses, coaches, carriages, vans, advertising wagons; every sort of conveyance stretching for sixteen miles, and with people lining the sides to look on.  I spent my time when I got there wandering around over the grounds, which were like Barnum&#x27;s circus multiplied by thousands.  It was a beautiful day and quite the most remarkable sight of my life.  Much more wonderful than Johnstown, so you see it must have impressed me.  We were five hours getting back, the people singing all the way and pelting one another and saying funny impudent things. My rooms are something gorgeous.  They are on the first floor, looking into Piccadilly from a court, and they are filled with Hogarth&#x27;s prints, old silver, blue and white china, Zulu weapons and fur rugs, and easy chairs of India silk.  You never saw such rooms!  And a very good servant, who cooks and valets me and runs errands and takes such good care of me that last night Cust and Balfour called at one to get some supper and he would not let them in.  Think of having the Leader of the House of Commons come to ask you for food and having him sent away.  Burdett-Coutts heard of my being here in the papers and wrote me to dine with him tonight.  I lunched with the Tennants today; no relation to Mrs. Stanley, and it was informal and funny rather.  The Earl of Spender was there and Lord Pembroke and a lot of women.  They got up and walked about and changed places and seemed to know one another better than we do at home.  I think I will go down to Oxford for Whitsuntide, which is a heathen institution here which sends everyone away just as I want to meet them. I haven&#x27;t written anything yet.  I find it hard to do so.  I think I would rather wait until I get home for the most of it.  Chas. will be here in less than a week now and we will have a good time.  I have planned it out for days.  He must go to Oxford and meet those boys, and then, if he wishes, on to Eastnor, which I learn since my return is one of the show places of England.  I am enjoying myself, it is needless to say, very much, and am well and happy. DICK. During these first days in England Richard spent much of his time at Eastnor, Lady Brownlow&#x27;s place in Lincolnshire, and one of the most beautiful estates in England.  Harry Cust, to whom my brother frequently refers in his letters, was the nephew of Lady Brownlow, and a great friend of Richard&#x27;s.  At that time Cust was the Conservative nominee for Parliament from Lincolnshire, and Richard took a most active part in the campaign.  Happily, we were both at Lady Brownlow&#x27;s during its last few tense days, as well as on the day the votes were counted, and Cust was elected by a narrow margin.  Of our thrilling adventures Richard afterward wrote at great length in &quot;Our English Cousins.&quot; LONDON, July 6, 1892. DEAR MOTHER: On the Fourth of July, Lady Brownlow sent into town and  had a big American flag brought out and placed over  the house, which was a great compliment, as it was seen  and commented on for miles around.  Cushing of Boston, a very nice chap and awfully handsome, is there, too.  The same morning I went out to photograph the soldiers, and Lord William Frederick, who is their colonel, charged them after me whenever I appeared.  It seems he has a sense of humor and liked the idea of making an American run on the Fourth of July from Red-coats.  I doubt if the five hundred men who were not on horseback thought it as funny.  They chased me till I thought I would die.  The Conservative member for the county got in last night and we rejoiced greatly, as the moral effect will help Harry Cust greatly.  His election takes place next Monday.  The men went in to hear the vote declared after dinner, and so did two of the girls, who got Lady Brownlow&#x27;s consent at dinner, and then dashed off to change their gowns before she could change her mind.  As we were intent on seeing the fun and didn&#x27;t want them, we took them just where we would have gone anyway, which was where the fighting was.  And they showed real sporting blood and saw the other real sort.  There were three of us to each girl, and it was most exciting, with stones flying and windows crashing and cheers and groans.  A political meeting or election at home is an afternoon tea to the English ones.  When we came back the soldiers were leaving the Park to stop the row, and as we flew past, the tenants ran to the gate and cheered for the Tory victory in &quot;good old lopes.&quot;  When we got to the house the servants ran cheering all over the shop and rang the alarm bell and built fires, and we had a supper at one-fifteen.  What they will do on the night of Cust&#x27;s election, I cannot imagine-- burn the house down probably.  Cushing and I enjoy it immensely.  We know them well enough now to be as funny as we like without having them stare.  They are nice when you know them, but you&#x27;ve GOT to know them first.  I had a great dinner at Farrar&#x27;s.  All the ecclesiastical lights of England in knee-breeches were there, and the American Minister and Phillips Brooks.  It was quite novel and fun.  Lots of love.  I have all the money I want. DICK. With Cust properly elected, Richard and I returned to the Albany and settled down to enjoy London from many angles.  Although my brother had been there but a few weeks, his acquaintances among the statesmen, artists, social celebrities, and the prominent actors of the day was quite as extraordinary as his geographical and historical knowledge of the city.  We gave many jolly parties, and on account of Richard&#x27;s quickly acquired popularity were constantly being invited to dinners, dances, and less formal but most amusing Bohemian supper-parties.  During these days there was little opportunity for my brother to do much writing, but he was very busy making mental notes not only for his coming book on the English people, but for a number of short stories which he wrote afterward in less strenuous times.  We returned to New York in August, and Richard went to Marion to rest from his social activities, and to work on his English articles. CHAPTER VI THE MEDITERRANEAN AND PARIS It was, I think, the year previous to this that my mother and father had deserted Point Pleasant as a place to spend their summer vacations in favor of Marion, on Cape Cod, and Richard and I, as a matter of course, followed them there.  At that time Marion was a simple little fishing village where a few very charming people came every summer and where the fishing was of the best.  In all ways the life was most primitive, and happily continued so for many years.  In, these early days Grover Cleveland and his bride had a cottage there, and he and Joseph Jefferson, who lived at Buzzard&#x27;s Bay, and my father went on daily fishing excursions.  Richard Watson Gilder was one of the earliest settlers of the summer colony, and many distinguished members of the literary and kindred professions came there to visit him.  It was a rather drowsy life for those who didn&#x27;t fish--a great deal of sitting about on one&#x27;s neighbor&#x27;s porch and discussion of the latest novel or the newest art, or of one&#x27;s soul, and speculating as to what would probably become of it.  From the first Richard formed a great affection for the place, and after his marriage adopted it as his winter as well as his summer home.  As a workshop he had two rooms in one of the natives&#x27; cottages, and two more charming rooms it would be hard to imagine.  The little shingled cottage was literally covered with honeysuckle,  and inside there were the old wall-papers, the open  hearths, the mahogany furniture, and the many charming  things that had been there for generations, and all of which helped to contribute to the quaint peaceful atmosphere of the place.  Dana Gibson had a cottage just across the road, and around the corner Gouverneur Morris lived with his family.  At this time neither of these friends of Richard, nor Richard himself, allied themselves very closely to the literary colony and its high thoughts, but devoted most of their time to sailing about Sippican Harbor, playing tennis and contributing an occasional short story or an illustration to a popular magazine.  But after the colony had taken flight, Richard often remained long into the fall, doing really serious work and a great deal of it.  At such times he had to depend on a few friends who came to visit him, but principally on the natives to many of whom he was greatly attached.  It was during these days that he first met his future wife, Cecil Clark, whose father, John M. Clark of Chicago, was one of the earliest of the summer colonists to build his own home at Marion.  A most charming and hospitable home it was, and it was in this same house where we had all spent so many happy hours that Richard was married and spent his honeymoon, and for several years made his permanent home.  Of the life of Marion during this later period, he became an integral part, and performed his duties as one of its leading citizens with much credit to the town and its people.  For Marion Richard always retained a great affection, for there he had played and worked many of his best years.  He had learned to love everything of which the quaint old town was possessed, animate and inanimate, and had I needed any further proof of how deeply the good people of Marion loved Richard, the letters I received from many of them at the time of his death would show. In the early fall of 1892 Richard returned to his editorial work on Harper&#x27;s Weekly, and one of the first assignments he gave was to despatch himself to Chicago to report the Dedication Exercises of the World&#x27;s Fair.  That the trip at least started out little to my brother&#x27;s liking the following seems to show.  However, Richard&#x27;s moods frequently changed with the hour, and it is more than possible that before the letter was sent he was enjoying himself hugely and regarding Chicago with his usual kindly eyes. Chicago Club, DEAR FAMILY:                          October 2, 1892. Though lost to sight I am still thinking of you sadly.  It seems that I took a coupe after leaving you and after living in it for a few years I grew tired and got out on the prairie and walked along drinking in the pure air from the lakes and reading Liebig&#x27;s and Cooper&#x27;s advs.  After a brisk ten mile walk I reentered my coupe and we in time drew up before a large hotel inhabited by a clerk and a regular boarder.  I am on the seventh floor without a bathroom or electric button--I merely made remarks and then returned to town in a railroad train which runs conveniently near.  After gaining civilization I made my way through several parades or it may have been the same one to the reviewing stand.  My progress was marked by mocking remarks by the police who asked of each other to get on to my coat and on several occasions I was mistaken by a crowd of some thousand people for the P----e of W----s, and tumultuously cheered.  At last I found an inspector of police on horseback, who agreed to get me to the stand if it took a leg.  He accordingly charged about 300 women and clubbed eight men--I counted them--and finally got me in.  He was very drunk but he was very good to me. Once back from Chicago Richard divided his time between his desk at Franklin Square, his rooms on Twenty-eighth Street, and in quickly picking up the friendships and the social activities his trip to England had temporarily broken off.  Much as he now loved London, he was still an enthusiastic New Yorker, and the amount of work and play he accomplished was quite extraordinary.  Indeed it is difficult to understand where he found the time to do so much.  In addition to his work on Harper&#x27;s he wrote many short stories and special articles, not only because he loved the mere writing of them, but because he had come to so greatly enjoy the things he could buy with the money his labors now brought him.  His pleasures had increased as steadily as the prices he could now command for his stories, and in looking back on those days it is rather remarkable when one considers his age, the temptations that surrounded him, and his extraordinary capacity for enjoyment, that he never seems to have forgotten the balance between work and play, and stuck to both with an unswerving and unceasing enthusiasm.  However, after four months of New York, he decided it was high time for him to be off again, and he arranged with the Harpers to spend the late winter and the spring in collecting material for the two sets of articles which afterward appeared in book form under the titles of &quot;The Rulers of the Mediterranean&quot; and &quot;About Paris.&quot;  He set sail for Gibraltar the early part of February, 1893, and the following letters describe his leisurely progress about the Mediterranean ports. NEW YORK, February 3, 1893. DEAREST MOTHER: This is a little present for you and a goodby.  Your packing-case is what I need and what I shall want, and I love it because you made it.  But as YOU say, we understand and do not have to write love letters; you have given me all that is worth while in me, and I love you so that I look forward already over miles and miles and days and months, and just see us sitting together at Marion and telling each other how good it is to be together again and holding each other&#x27;s hands.  I don&#x27;t believe you really know how HAPPY I am in loving you, dear, and in having you say nice things about me.  God bless you, dearest, and may I never do anything to make you feel less proud of your wicked son. DICK. Off Gibraltar, DEAR MOTHER:                        February 12, 1893. Today is Sunday.  We arrive at Gibraltar at five tomorrow morning and the boat lies there until nine o&#x27;clock.  Unless war and pestilence have broken out in other places, I shall go over to Tangiers in a day or two, and from there continue on my journey as mapped out when I left.  I have had a most delightful trip and the most enjoyable I have ever taken by sea.  These small boats are as different from the big twin-screw steamers as a flat from a Broadway hotel. Everyone gets to know everything about everyone else, and it has been more like a yacht than a passenger steamer.  When I first came on board I thought I would not find in any new old country I was about to visit anything more foreign than the people, and I was right, but they are most amusing and I have learned a great deal.  They are different from any people I know, and are the Americans we were talking about.  The ones of whom I used to read in The Atlantic and Blackwood&#x27;s, as traveling always and sinking out of sight whenever they reached home.  They, with the exception of a Boston couple, know none of my friends or my haunts, and I have learned a great deal in meeting them.  It has been most BROADENING and the change has been SUCH a rest.  I had no idea of how tired I was of talking about the theater of Arts and Letters and Miss Whitney&#x27;s debut and my Soul.  These people are simple and unimaginative and bourgeois to a degree and as kind-hearted and apparent as animal alphabets.  I do not think I have had such a complete change or rest in years, and I am sure I have not laughed so much for as long.  Of course, the idea of a six months&#x27; holiday is enough to make anyone laugh at anything, but I find that besides that I was a good deal harassed and run down, and I am glad to cut off from everything and start fresh.  I feel miserably selfish about it all the time. These Germans run everything as though you were the owner of the line.  The discipline is like that of the German Army or of a man-of-war, everything moves by the stroke of a bell, and they have had dances and speeches and concerts and religious services and lectures every other minute.  Into all of these I have gone with much enthusiasm.  We have at the captain&#x27;s table Dr. Field, the editor of The Evangelist, John Russell, a Boston Democrat, who was in Congress and who has been in public life for over forty years.  A Tammany sachem, who looks like and worships Tweed, and who says what I never heard an American off the stage say:  &quot;That&#x27;s me.  That&#x27;s what I do,&quot; he says.  &quot;When I have insomnia, I don&#x27;t believe in your sleeping draughts.  I get up and go round to Jake Stewart&#x27;s on Fourteenth Street and eat a fry or a porterhouse steak and then I sleep good---that&#x27;s me.&quot;  There is also a lively lady from Albany next to me and her husband, who tells anecdotes of the war just as though it had happened yesterday.  Indeed, they are all so much older than I that all their talk is about things I never understood the truth about, and it is most interesting.  I really do not know when I have enjoyed my meal time so much.  The food is very good, although queer and German, and we generally take two hours to each sitting.  Dr. Field is my especial prey and he makes me laugh until I cry.  He is just like James Lewis in &quot;A Night Off,&quot; and is always rubbing his hands and smacking his lips over his own daring exploits.  I twist everything he says into meaning something dreadful, and he is instantly explaining he did not really see a bullfight, but that he walked around the outside of the building.  I have promised to show him life with a capital L, and he is afraid as death of me.  But he got back at me grandly last night when he presented a testimonial to the captain, and referred to the captain&#x27;s wife and boy whom he is going to see after a two years&#x27; absence, at which the captain wept and everybody else wept.  And Field, seeing he had made a point, waved his arms and cried, &quot;I have never  known a man who amounted to anything who had not a good wife to care for--except YOU--&quot; he shouted, pointing at me, &quot;and no woman will ever save YOU.&quot;  At which the passengers, who fully appreciated how I had been worrying him, applauded loudly, and the Doctor in his delight at having scored on me forgot to give the captain his testimonial. There are two nice girls on board from Chicago and a queer Southern girl who paints pictures and sings and writes poetry, and who is traveling with an odd married woman who is an invalid and who like everyone else on board has apparently spent all her life away from home.  I have spent my odd time in writing the story I told Dad the night before I sailed and I think it in some ways the best, quite the best, I have written.  I read it to the queer girl and her queer chaperon and they weep whenever they speak of it, which they do every half hour.  All the passengers apparently laid in a stock of &quot;Gallegher&quot; and &quot;The West&quot; before starting, and young women in yachting caps are constantly holding me up for autographs and favorite quotations.  Yesterday we passed the Azores near enough to see the windows in the houses, and we have seen other islands at different times, which is quite refreshing.  Tomorrow I shall post this and the trip will be over.  It has been a most happy start.  I am not going to write letters often, but am going head over ears into this new life and let the old one wait awhile.  You cannot handle Africa and keep up your fences in New York at the same time.  I am now going out to talk to the Boston couple, or to propose a lion hunt to Dr. Field. Since I wrote that last I have seen Portugal.  It made me seem suddenly very far away from New York. Portugal is a high hill with a white watch tower on it flying signal flags.  It is apparently inhabited by one man who lives in a long row of yellow houses with red roofs, and populated by sheep who do grand acts of balancing on the side of the hill.  There is also a Navy of a brown boat with a leg-of-mutton sail and a crew of three men in the boat--not to speak of the dog.  It is a great thing to have a traveled son.  None of you ever saw Portugal, yah! I am now in Gibraltar.  It is a large place and there does not seem to be room in this letter, in which to express my feelings about Moors in bare legs and six thousand Red-coats and to hear Englishmen speak again.  When I woke up Gibraltar was a black silhouette against the sky, but toward the south there was a low line of mountains with a red sky behind them, dim and mysterious and old, and that was Africa.  Then Spain turned up all amethyst and green, and the Mediterranean as blue as they tell you it is.  They wouldn&#x27;t let me take my gun into Gibraltar. They know my reputation for war. DICK. GIBRALTAR. February 14th, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: The luck of the British Army which I am modestly fond of comparing with my own took a vacation yesterday as soon as I had set foot on land.  In the first place Egypt had settled down to her sluggish Nile like calm and cholera had quarantined the ship I wanted to take to Algiers, shutting off Algiers and what was more important Tunis.  The Governor was ill shutting off things I wanted and his adjutant was boorish and proud and haughty.  Then I determined to go to Spain but found I had arrived just one day too late for the last of the three days of the Mardi Gras and too early for bull fights.  Had I taken Saavedra&#x27;s letters I should have gone to Madrid and met the Queen and other proud folks.  So on the whole I was blue.  But I have now determined to take a boat for Tangier at once where I have letters to the Duke de Tnas who is the Master of the Hounds there and a great sport and they say it is very amusing and exciting.  In a fortnight I shall go to Malta.  I called on Harry Cust&#x27;s brother and told him who I was and he took me in and put me at the head of the table of young subalterns in grand uniforms and we had marmalade and cold beef and beer and I was happy to the verge of tears to hear English as she is spoke.  Then we went to a picnic and took tea in a smuggler&#x27;s cave and all the foxterriers ran over the table cloth and the Captain spilt hot water over his white flannels and jumped around on one leg.  After which we played a handkerchief game sitting in a row and pelting the girls with a knotted handkerchief and then fighting for it-- During one of these scrimmages Mulvaney, two others and Learoyd came by and with eyes front and hands at their caps marched on with stolid countenances, but their officers were embarrassed.  It is hard to return a salute with your face in the sand and a stout American sitting on your neck and pulling your first lieutenant&#x27;s leg.  I am now deeply engaged for dinners and dances and teas and rides and am  feeling very cheerful again.  I am also very well thank you and have no illnesses of any sort.  You told me to be sure and put that in-- As you see, I have cut out half of my trip to avoid the cholera, so you need not worry about THAT.  To-day I am going over the ramparts as much as they will allow and to-morrow I go to Tangier where I expect to have some boar hunting.  I would suggest your getting The Evangelist in a week or two as Dr. Field&#x27;s letters cover all I have seen.  I do not tell you anything about the place because you will read that in the paper to the H. W. but I can assure you the girls are very pretty and being garrison girls are not as shy as those at home in England.  I am the first American they ever met they assure me every hour and we get on very well notwithstanding. You can imagine what it is like when Spaniards, Moors and English Soldiers are all crowded into one long street with donkeys and geese and priests and smugglers and men in polo clothes and soldiers in football suits and sailors from the man-of-war.  Of course, the Rock is the best story of it all.  It is a fair green smiling hill not a fortress at all.  No more a fortress to look at than Fairmont Park water works, but the joke of it is that under every bush there is a gun and every gun is painted green and covered with hanging curtains of moss and every promenade is undermined and the bleakest face of the rock is tunnelled with rooms and halls.  Every night we are locked in and the soldiers carry the big iron keys clanking through the streets.  It is going to make interesting reading. DICK. GIBRALTAR. DEAR MOTHER:                       February 23rd, 1893. AEneas who &quot;ran the round of so many chances&quot; in this neighborhood was a stationary stay at home to what I have to do.  If I ever get away from the Rock I shall be a traveller of the greatest possible experience. I came here intending to stay a week and to write my letter on Gib. and on Tangier quietly and peacefully like a gentleman and then to go on to Malta.  I love this place and there is something to do and see every minute of the time but what happened was this:  All the boats that ever left here stopped running, broke shafts, or went into quarantine or just sailed by, and unless I want to spend two weeks on the sea in order to have one at Malta, which is only a military station like this, I must go off to-morrow with my articles unwritten, my photos undeveloped and my dinner calls unpaid.  I am now waiting to hear if I can get to Algiers by changing twice from one steamer to another along the coast of Spain.  It will be a great nuisance but I shall be able to see Algiers and Tunis and Malta in the three weeks which would have otherwise been given to Malta alone.  And Tunis I am particularly keen to see.  While waiting for a telegram from Spain about the boats, I shall tell you what I have been doing.  Everybody was glad to see me after my return from Tangier.  I dined with the Governor on Monday, in a fine large room lined with portraits of all the old commanders and their coats-of-arms like a little forest of flags and the Governor&#x27;s daughter danced a Spanish dance for us after it was over.  Miss Buckle, Cust&#x27;s fiancee, dances almost as well as Carmencita, all the girls here learn it as other girls do the piano.  On Tuesday Cust and Miss B. and another girl and I went over into Spain to see the meet and we had a short run after a fox who went to earth, much to my relief, in about three minutes and before I had been thrown off.  There are no fences but the ground is one mass of rocks and cactus and ravines down which these English go with an ease that makes me tremble  with admiration.  We had not come out to follow, so we, being quite soaked through and very hungry, went to an inn and it was such an inn as Don Quixote used to stop at, with the dining-room over the stable and a lot of drunken muleteers in the court and beautiful young women to wait on us.  It is a beautiful country Spain, with every sort of green you ever dreamed of.  We had omelettes and native wine and black bread and got warm again and then trotted home in the rain and got wet again, so we stopped at the guard house on the outside of the rock and took tea with the officer in charge and we all got down on our knees around his fire and he hobbled around dropping his eyeglasses in his hot water and very much honored and exceedingly embarrassed.  I amused myself by putting on all the uniforms he did not happen to have on and the young ladies drank tea and thawed.  This is the most various place I ever came across.  You have mountains and seashore and allamandas like Monte Carlo in their tropical beauty and soldiers day and night marching and drilling and banging brass bands and tennis and guns firing so as to rattle all the windows, and picnics and teas.  I am engaged way ahead now but I must get off tomorrow.  On Washington&#x27;s birthday I gave a luncheon because it struck me as the most inappropriate place in which one could celebrate the good man&#x27;s memory and the Governor would not think of coming at first, but I told him I was not a British subject and that if I could go to his dinner he could come to my lunch, so that, or the fact that the beautiful Miss Buckle was coming decided him to waive etiquette and he came with his A. D. C. and his daughter and officers and girls came and I had American flags and English flags and a portrait of Washington and of the Queen and I ransacked the markets for violets and banked them all up in the middle.  It was fine.  I turned the hotel upside down and all the servants wore their best livery and everybody stood up in a row and saluted His Excellency and I made a speech and so did his Excellency and the chef did himself proud.  I got it up in one morning.  Helen Benedict could not have done it better. I had a funny adventure the morning I left Tangier-- There was a good deal of talk about Field (confound him) and my getting into the prison and The Herald and Times correspondents were rather blue about it and some of the English residents said that I had not been shown the whole of the prison, that the worst had been kept from us.  Field who only got into the prison because I had worked at it two days, said there was an additional ward I had not seen.  I went back into this while he and the guard were getting the door open to go out and saw nothing, but to make sure that the prison was as I believed an absolute square, I went back on the morning of my departure and climbed a wall and crawled over a house top and photographed the top of the prison.  Then a horrible doubt came to me that this house upon which I was standing and which adjoined the prison might be the addition of which the English residents hinted.  There was an old woman in the garden below jumping up and down and to whom I had been shying money to keep her quiet.  I sent the guide around to ask her what was the nature of the building upon which I had trespassed and which seemed to worry her so much-- He came back to tell me that I was on the top of a harem and the old woman thought I was getting up a flirtation with the gentleman&#x27;s wives.  So I dropped back again. It will be a couple of months at least before my first story comes out in The Weekly.  I cannot judge of them but I think they are up to the average of the Western stories, the material is much richer I know, but I am so much beset by the new sights that I have not the patience or the leisure I had in the West-- Then there were days in which writing was a relief, now there is so much to see that it seems almost a shame to waste it. By the grace of Providence I cannot leave here until the 28th, much to my joy and I have found out that I can do better by going direct to Malta and then to Tunis, leaving Algiers which I did not want to see out of it-Hurrah.  I shall now return to the calm continuation of my story and to writing notes which Chas will enjoy. DICK. GIBRALTAR-February 1893. DEAR MOTHER: Morocco as it is is a very fine place spoiled by civilization.  Not nice civilization but the dregs of it, the broken down noblemen of Spain and cashiered captains of England and the R---- L----&#x27;s of America.  They hunt and play cricket and gamble and do nothing to maintain what is best in the place or to help what is worst.  I love the Moors and the way they hate the Christian and the scorn and pride they show.  They seem to carry all the mystery and dignity of Africa and of foreign conquests about them, and they are wonderfully well made and fine looking and self-respecting.  The color is very beautiful, but the foreign element spoils it at every turn.  One should really go inland but I shall not because I mean to do that when I reach Cairo.  Everybody goes inland from here and Bonsal has covered it already.  He is a great man here among all classes. I have bought two long guns and three pistols three feet long and a Moorish costume for afternoon teas.  I shall look fine.  My guide&#x27;s idea of pleasing me is to kick everybody out of the way which always brings down curses on me so I have to go back and give them money and am so gradually becoming popular and much sought after by blind beggars.  You can get three pounds of copper for a franc and it lasts all day throwing it right and left all the time.  I made a great tear in Bonsal&#x27;s record today by refusing to pay a snake charmer all he wanted and then when he protested I took one of the snakes out of his hands and swung it around my head to the delight of the people.  I wanted to show him he was a fakir to want me to pay for what I would do myself.  It was a large snake about four feet long.  Then my horse and another horse got fighting in the principal street in the city standing up on their hind legs and boxing like men and biting and squealing.  It was awful and I got mine out of the way and was trod on and had my arm nearly pulled off and the crowd applauded and asked my guide whether I was American or English.  They do not like the English.  So with the lower classes I may say that I am having a social success. DICK. Off Malta--March 1, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: I have been having a delightful voyage with moonlight all night and sunlight all day.  Africa kept in sight most of the time and before that we saw beautiful mountains in Spain covered with snow and red in the sunset.  There were a lot of nice English people going out to India to meet their husbands and we have &quot;tiffin&quot; and &quot;choota&quot; and &quot;curry,&quot; so it really seemed oriental.  The third night out we saw Algiers sparkling like Coney Island.  I play games with myself and pretend I am at my rooms reading a story which is very hard to pretend as I never read in my rooms and then I look up and exclaim &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m not in New York, that&#x27;s Algiers.&quot;  The thing that has impressed me most is how absolutely small the world is and how childishly easy it is to go around it.  You and Nora MUST take this trip; as for me I think Willie Chanler is the most sensible individual I have yet met. All the fascination of King Solomon&#x27;s Mines seems to be behind those great mountains and this I may add is a bit of advance work for mother, an entering wedge to my disappearing from sight for years and years in the Congo.  Which, seriously, I will not do; only it is disappointing to find the earth so small and so easily encompassed that you want to go on where it is older, and new.  The worst of it is that it is hard leaving all the nice people you meet and then must say good-bye to.  The young ladies and Capt. Buckle and Cust came down to see me off and Buckle brought me a photo four feet long of Gib, an official one which I had to smuggle out with a great show of secrecy and now I shall be sorry to leave these people.  Just as I wrote that one of the officers going out to join his regiment came to the door and blushing said the passengers were getting up a round robin asking me to stop on and go to Cairo. Since writing the above lots of things have happened.  I bid farewell to everyone at Malta and yet in four hours I was back again bag and baggage and am now on my way to Cairo.  Tunis and the Bey are impossible.  As soon as I landed at Malta I found that though I could go to Tunis I could not go away without being quarantined for ten days and if I remained in Malta I must stay a week.  On balancing a week of Egypt against a week of Malta I could not do it so I put back to this steamer again and here I am. Tomorrow we reach Brindisi and we have already passed Sicily and had a glimpse of the toe of Italy and it is the coldest sunny Italy that I ever imagined.  I am bitterly disappointed about Tunis.  I have no letters to big people in Cairo only subalterns but I shall probably get along.  I always manage somehow with my &quot;artful little Ikey ways.&quot;  It was most gratifying to mark my return to this boat.  One young woman danced a Kangaroo dance and the Captain wept and all the stewards stood in a line and grinned.  I sing Chevalier&#x27;s songs and they all sit in the dining room below and forget to lay out the plates and last night some of the Royal Berkshire with whom I dined at Malta came on board and after hearing the Old Kent Road were on the point of Mutiny and refused to return to barracks.  Great is the Power of Chevalier and great is his power for taking you back to London with three opening bars.  Malta was the queerest place I ever got into.  It was like a city, country and island made of cheese, mouldy cheese, and fresh limburger cheese with holes in it.  You sailed right up to the front door as it were and people were hanging out of the windows smoking pipes and looking down on the deck as complacently as though having an ocean steamer in the yard was as much a matter of course as a perambulator.  There were also women with black hoods which they wear as a penance because long ago the ladies of Malta got themselves talked about.  I was on shore about five hours and saw some interesting things and with that and Brindisi and the voyage I can make a third letter but Tunis is writ on my heart like Calais. Today Cleveland is inaugurated and I took all the passengers down at the proper time and explained to them that at that moment a great man was being made president and gave them each an American cocktail to remember it by and in which to toast him I am getting to be a great speech maker and if there are any more anniversaries in America I shall be a second Depew. It is late but it is still the season here and it will be gay, but what I want to do now is to go off on a little trip inland although Cairo is the worst of all for it is surrounded by deserts and nothing to shoot but antelope and foxes and those I SCORN.  I want Zulus and lions.  I shall be greatly disappointed if I do not have something to do outside of Cairo for I have had no adventures at all.  It is just as civilized as Camden only more exciting and beautiful although Camden is exciting when you have to get there and back in time for the last edition.  From what I have already seen I am ready to spend a month in Cairo and then confess to knowing nothing of it.  But we shall see.  There may be a W A R or a lion hunt or something yet if there is not I shall come back here again.  I must fire that Winchester off at least once just for all the trouble it has given me at custom houses.  Something exciting must happen or I shall lose faith in the luck of the British army which marches shoulder to shoulder with mine.  If I don&#x27;t have any adventures I shall write essays on art after this like Mrs. Van.  Love and lots of it. DICK. CAIRO, March 11, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: In a famous book this line occurs, &quot;He determined to go to that hotel in Cairo where they were to have spent their honeymoon,&quot; or words like that.  He is now at that hotel and you can buy the famous book across the street.  It is called &quot;Gallegher.&quot;  So--in this way everything comes to him who waits and he comes to it.  &quot;Gallegher&quot; is not the only thing you buy in Egypt.  You ride to the Pyramids on a brake with a man in a white felt hat blowing a horn, and the bugler of the Army of Occupation is as much in evidence as the priest who calls them to prayer from the minaret.  I left the people I liked on the Sultey last Thursday in the Suez Canal and came on here in a special train.  It is very cold here, and it is not a place where the cold is in keeping with the surroundings.  You see people in white helmets and astrakan overcoats.  It is an immense city and intensely interesting, especially the bazaars, but you feel so ignorant about it all that it rather angers you.  I wish I was not such a very bad hand at languages.  That is ONE THING I cannot do, that and ride.  I need it very much, traveling so much, and I shall study very hard while I am in Paris.  Our consul-general here is a very young man, and he showed me a Kansas paper when I called on him, which said that I was in the East and would probably call on &quot;Ed&quot; L.  He is very civil to me and gives me his carriages and outriders with gold clothes and swords whenever I will take them. It is so beastly cold here that it spoils a lot of things, and there are a lot of Americans who say, &quot;I had no idea you were so young a man,&quot; and that, after being five years old for a month and playing children&#x27;s games with English people who didn&#x27;t know or care anything about you except that you made them laugh, is rather trying.  I am disappointed so far in the trip because it has developed nothing new beyond the fact that going around the world is of no more importance than going to breakfast, and I am selfish in my sightseeing and want to see things others do not.  And if you even do see more than those who are not so fortunate and who have to remain at home, still you are so ignorant in comparison with those who have lived here for years and to whom the whole of Africa is a speculation in land or railroads, it makes you feel like such a faker and as if it were better to turn correspondent for the N. Y. Herald, Paris edition, and send back the names of those who are staying at the hotels.  That is really all you can speak with authority about.  When you have Gordon and Stanley dishes on the bill-of-fare, you feel ashamed to say you&#x27;ve been in Egypt.  Anyway, I am a faker and I don&#x27;t care, and I proved it today by being photographed on a camel in front of the Pyramids, and if that wasn&#x27;t impertinence I do not know its name.  I accordingly went and bought a lot of gold dresses for Nora as a penance. As a matter of fact, unless I get into the interior for a month and see something new, I shall consider the trip a failure, except as a most amusing holiday for one, and that was not exactly what I wanted or all I wanted.  After this I shall go to big cities only and stay there.  Everybody travels and everybody sees as much as you do and says nothing of it, certainly does not presume to write a book about it.  Anyway, it has been great fun, so I shall put it down to that and do some serious work to make up for it.  I&#x27;d rather have written a good story about the Inauguration than about Cairo. I am well, as usual, and having a fine loaf, only I don&#x27;t think much of what I have written--that&#x27;s all. DICK. CAIRO, March 19th, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: I went up the Pyramids yesterday and I am very sore today.  It sounds easy because so many people do it, but they do it because they don&#x27;t know.  I have been putting it off, and putting it off, until I felt ashamed to such a degree that I had to go.  Little had never been either, so we went out together and met Stanford White and the Emmetts there, and we all went up.  I would rather go into Central Africa than do it again.  I am getting fat and that&#x27;s about it--and I had to half pull a much fatter man than myself who pretended to help me.  I finally told them I&#x27;d go alone unless the fat man went away, so the other two drove him off.  Going down is worse.  It&#x27;s like looking over a precipice all the time.  I was so glad when I got down that I sang with glee.  I hate work like that, and to make it worse I took everybody&#x27;s picture on top of the Pyramid, and forgot to have one of them take me, so there is no way to prove I ever went up.  Little and I hired two donkeys and called them &quot;Gallegher&quot; and &quot;Van Bibber&quot; and raced them.  My donkey was so little that they couldn&#x27;t see him--only his ears.  Gallegher won.  The donkey-boys called it Von Bebey, so I don&#x27;t think it will help the sale of the book. Today we went to call on the Khedive.  It was very informal and too democratic to suit my tastes.  We went through a line of his bodyguard in the hall, and the master of ceremonies took us up several low but wide stairways to a hall.  In the hall was a little fat young man in a frock coat and a fez, and he shook hands with us, and walked into another room and we all sat down on chairs covered with white muslin.  I talked and Little talked about me and the Khedive pretended to be very much honored, and said the American who had come over after our rebellion had done more for the officers in his army than had anyone else, meaning the English.  He did not say that because we were Americans, but because he hates the English.  He struck me as being stubborn, which is one side of stupidness and yet not stupid, and I occasionally woke him to bursts of enthusiasm over the Soudanese.  His bursts were chiefly &quot;Ali.&quot;  Little seemed to amuse him very much, and Little treated him exactly like a little boy who needed to be cheered up.  I think in one way it was the most curious contrast I ever saw.  &quot;Ed&quot; Little of Abilene, Kansas, telling the ruler of Egypt not to worry, that he had plenty of years in which to live and that he would get ahead of them all yet.  Those were not his words, but that was the tone, he was perfectly friendly and sincere about it. This place appeals to me as about the best place with which to get mixed up with that I know, and I&#x27;ve gone over a great many maps since I left home and know just how small the world is.  So, I sent the Khedive my books after having asked his permission, and received the most abject thanks.  And as Cromer called on me, I am going to drop around on him with a few of them.  Some day there will be fine things going on here, and there is only one God, and Lord Cromer is his Prophet in this country.  They think that Mohammed is but they are wrong.  He is a very big man.  The day he sent his ultimatum to the Khedive telling him to dismiss Facta Pasha and put back Riaz Pasha, he went out in full view of the Gezerik drive and played lawn tennis.  Any man who can cable for three thousand more troops to Malta and stop a transport full of two thousand more at Aden with one hand, and bang tennis balls about with the other, is going in the long run to get ahead of a stout little boy in a red fez.  It is getting awfully hot here, almost hot enough for me, and I can lay aside my overcoat by ten o&#x27;clock in the morning.  Everyone else has been in flannels and pith helmets, but as they had to wear overcoats at night I could not see the advantage of the costume. DICK. I open this to say that ALL of your letters have just come, so I have intoxicated myself with them for the last hour and can go over them again tomorrow.  I cannot tell you, dearest, what a delight your letters are and how I enjoy the clippings.  I think of you all the time and how you would love this Bible land and seeing the places where Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter found Moses, and hearing people talk of St. Paul and the plagues of Egypt and Joseph and Mary just as though they had lived yesterday.  I have seen two St. Johns already, with long hair and melancholy wild eyes and bare breasts and legs, with sheepskin covering, eating figs and preaching their gospel.  Yesterday two men came running into town and told one of the priests that they had seen the new moon in a certain well, and the priest proclaimed a month of fasting, and the men who pulled us up the Pyramid had to rest because they had not eaten or drunk all day.  At six a sheik called from the village and all the donkey--boys and guides around the Sphinx ran to get water and coffee and food.  Think of that--of two men running through the street to say that they had seen the new moon in a well, when every shop sells Waterbury watches and the people who passed them were driving dogcarts with English coachmen in top-boots behind.  Is there any other place as incongruous as this, as old and as new? DICK. ATHENS, March 30, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: I am now in Athens, how I got here is immaterial.  Suffice it to say that never in all my life was I so ill as I was in the two days crossing from Alexandria to Piraeus, which I did with two other men in the same cabin more ill than I and praying and swearing and groaning all the time.  &quot;It was awful.&quot; &quot;I have crossed in many ships upon the seas           And some of them were good and some were not;           In German, P &amp; O&#x27;s and Genoese,           But the Khedive&#x27;s was the worst one of the lot.           We never got a moment&#x27;s peace in her           For everybody&#x27;d howl or pray or bellow;           She threw us on our heads or on our knees,           And turned us all an unbecoming yellow.&quot; Athens is a small town but fine.  It is chiefly yellow houses with red roofs, and mountains around it, which remind you of pictures you have seen when a youth.  Also olive trees and straight black pines and the Acropolis.  There is not much of it left as far as I can see from the city, but what there is is enough to make you wish you had brushed up your Greek history.  I have now reached the place where Pan has a cave, where the man voted against Aristides because he was humanly tired of hearing him called the Just and where the Minotaur ate young women. What was in the Isle of Crete but the rock from which the father of Theseus threw himself--is still here!  Also the hill upon which Paul stood and told the Athenians they were too superstitious.  You can imagine my feelings at finding all of these things are true.  After this I am going to the North Pole to find Santa Claus and so renew my youth. I regret to say that it is raining very hard and Athens is not set for a rainstorm.  It is also cold but as I have not been warm since I crossed the North River with Chas. amid cakes of ice that is of no consequence.  When I come here again I come in the summer.  The good old rule that it is cold in winter and warm in summer is a good enough rule to follow.  You have only to travel to find out how universally cold winter is.  last night I was in Cairo, I got in a carriage and drove out alone to the Pyramids.  It was beautiful moonlight.  I got a donkey and rode up around them and then walked over to the Sphinx.  I had never understood or seen it before.  It was the creepiest and most impressive thing I ever had happen to me, I do believe.  There was no one except the two donkey-boys and myself and the Sphinx.  All about was the desert and above it the purple sky and the white stars and the great negro&#x27;s head in front of you with its paws stretched out, and the moonlight turning it into shadows and white lines.  I think I stood there so long that I got sort of dizzy.  It was just as if I had been the first man to stumble across it, and I felt that I was way back thousands of years and that the ghosts of Caesar and Napoleon and Cleopatra and the rest were in the air.  That was worth the entire trip to me.  This place promises to be most exciting, the New York artists are all here, they are the most jauntily dull people I ever met.  Do you know what I mean?  They are very nice but so stupid.  I don&#x27;t let them bother me.  Who was the chap who wrote about the bottle of Malvoisie? because I got a bottle of it for BREAKFAST and it is NO GOOD.  It is like sweet port.  But on account of the poem and its being vin du pays I got it. Dear Mother, I wish you were here now and enjoying all these beautiful things.  I got you a present in Cairo that will amuse you.  Had I stayed on in Cairo I should have had much and many marks of distinction from the English.  Lady Gower-Browne, who found out from them that I had called and that they had done nothing except to be rude, raised a great hue and cry and everything changed.  What she said of me I don&#x27;t know but it made a most amusing difference.  General Walker galloped a half mile across the desert to give me his own copy of the directions for the sham battle, and I was to have met Cromer at dinner tete-a-tete, and General Kitchener sent apologies by two other generals and all the subalterns called on me in a body.  That was the day before I left.  I don&#x27;t know what Lady Gower-Browne said, but it made a change which I am sorry I could not avail myself of as I want politics as well as memories. The next time I come I shall go to even fewer places and see more people. If the Harpers don&#x27;t look out our interests will clash.  I look at it like this.  I can always see the old historical things and take my children up the Nile, but I want now to make friends with the Mammon of unrighteousness and the men of the hour.  I may want to occupy an hour or two myself some day and they can help me.  If America starts in annexing islands she will need people to tell her how it is generally done and it is generally done, I find, by the English.  I may give up literature and start annexing things like Alexander and Caesar and Napoleon.  They say there will be another crisis in Cairo in a month or so.  If that be true I am all right and solid with both parties.  But it has got to be worth while of course or I won&#x27;t go back.  There is a king living in a fine palace across the square from my window, one of his officers is now changing the guard in the rain.  I hope to call on the king because I like his guard.  They wear petticoats and toes turned up in front.  Don&#x27;t you mind what I say about liking politics and don&#x27;t think I am not enjoying the show things.  I have a capacity for both that is so far unsatisfied, and I am now going out in the rain to try and find the post-office.  Lots of love. DICK. I am well and have been well (except sea sick) since February P. S.--A funeral is just passing the window with the corpse exposed to view as is the quaint custom here, to add to its horror they rouge the face of the corpse and everybody kisses it.  In the Greek church they burn candles for people and the number of candles I have burnt for you would light St. Paul&#x27;s, and you ought to be good with so much war being expended all over Athens for you.  You buy candles instead of tipping the verger or putting it in the poor box, or because you are superstitious and think it will do some good, as I do. Orient Express.  Somewhere in Bulgaria on the way to London. April 14th, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: Tuesday I wrote you a letter in the club at Constantinople telling you how glad I would be to get out of that City on April 17th on the Orient Express which only leaves twice a week on Thursdays and Mondays.  So any one who travels by the Orient is looked upon first as a millionaire and second, if he does not break the journey at Vienna, as a greater traveller than Col. Burnaby on his way to Khiva.  Imagine a Kansas City man breaking the journey to New York.  After I wrote you that letter I went in the next room and read of the Nile Expedition in search of Gordon--this went through three volumes of The Graphic and took some time, so that when I had reached the picture which announced the death of Gordon it was half past five and I had nothing more to do for four days-- It was raining and cold and muddy and so I just made up my mind I would get up and get out and I jumped about for one hour like a kangaroo and by seven I was on the Orient with two Cook men to help me and had shaken my fist at the last minaret light of that awful city.  So, now it is all over and it is done-- I have learned a great deal in an imperfect way of the juxtaposition of certain countries and of the ease with which one can travel without speaking any known languages and of the absolute necessity for speaking one, French.  I am still disappointed about the articles but selfishly I have made a lot out of the trip.  You have no idea how hard it is not to tell about strange things and yet you know people do not care half as much for them as things they know all about-- No matter, it is done and with the exception of the last week it was F I N E. &quot;I&#x27;m going back to London, to `tea&#x27; and long frock coats      I&#x27;m done with Cook and seeing sights      I&#x27;m done with table d&#x27;hotes      So clear the track you signal man      From Sofia to Pless, I&#x27;m going straight for London      On the Orient Express. I&#x27;m going straight for London O&#x27;er Bulgaria&#x27;s heavy sands To Rotten Row and muffins, soles, Chevalier and Brass Bands Ho&#x27; get away you bullock man You&#x27;ve heard the whistle blowed a locomotive coming down the Grand Trunk Road.&quot; This is a great country and I want to ask all the natives if they know &quot;Stenie&quot; Bonsal.  They are all his friends and so are the &quot;Balkans,&quot; and all the little Balkans.  Nobody wears European clothes here.  They are all as foreign and native and picturesque as they can be, the women with big silver plates over their stomachs and the men in sheepskin and tights and the soldiers are grand.  We have been passing all day between snow covered mountains and between herds of cattle and red roofed, mud villages and long lakes of ice and snow-- It is a beautiful day and I am very happy. (Second day out) 15th---We are now in Hungary and just outside of Buda Pesth &quot;the wickedest city in the world,&quot; still in spite of that fact I am going on.  I am very glad I came this way-- The peasants and soldiers are most amusing and like German picture-papers with black letter type-- I shall stop a day in Paris now that I have four extra days. DICK. In sight of Paris--April 16--1893. DEAREST MOTHER: has been the most beautiful day since February 4th.  It is the first day in which I have been warm.  All through I have had a varnish of warmth every now and again but no real actual internal warmth--I am now in sight of Paris and it is the 16th of April, in the eleven weeks which have elapsed since the 4th of February I have been in Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, Egypt and Morocco.  I have sat on the Rock of Gibraltar, sailed on the Nile and the Suez Canal and crossed through the Dardanelles, over the Balkans, the steppes of Hungary and the Danube and Rhine.  I have seen the sphinx by moonlight, the Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower and in two days more I shall have seen St. Paul&#x27;s.  What do you think I should like to see best now?  YOU.  I have been worrying of late as to whether or not I should not come home now and leave Paris for another time because it seems so rough on you to leave you without either of your younger sons for so long.  But I have thought it over a great deal and I think it better that I should do Paris now and leave myself clear for the rest of the year.  I promise you one thing however that I shall not undertake to stay away so long again; it is too long and one grows out of things.  But nothing I feel, will be so easy or so amusing as Paris and I intend to get through with it soon and trot home to you by the middle of August AT THE VERY LATEST.  So, please write me a deceitful letter and say you do not miss me at all and that my being so near as Paris makes a great difference and that I am better out of the way and if Chas goes to London I shall be near him in case he forgets to put on his overshoes or involves us in a war with G. B.  Now, mother dear, do write me a cheerful letter and say that you do not mind waiting until the middle of August for me and when I come back this time I shall make a long stay with you at Marion and tell you lots of things I have not written you and I shall not go away again for ever so long and if I do go I shall only stay a little while.  You have no idea how interesting this rush across the continent has been.  I started in snow and through marshes covered with ice and long horned cattle and now we are in such a beautiful clean green land with green fields and green trees and flowering bushes which you can smell as the train goes by.  I now think that instead of being a cafe-chantant singer I should rather be an Austrian baron and own a castle on a hill with a red roofed village around it.  I have spent almost all of the trip sitting on the platform and enjoying the sight of the queer peasants and the soldiers and old villages.  Tonight I shall be in &quot;Paris, France&quot; as Morton used to say and I shall get clean and put on my dress clothes but whether I shall go see Yvette Guilbert or Rusticana again I do not know.  Perhaps I shall just paddle around the fountain in the Place de la Concorde and make myself thoroughly at home.  With a great deal of love to Dad and Nora and Chas and all. DICK. At the time that Richard&#x27;s first travel articles appeared some of his critics took umbrage at the fact that he was evidently under the delusion that he had discovered London, Gibraltar, Athens, Paris, and the other cities he had visited, and that no one else had ever written about them.  As a matter of fact no one could have been more keenly conscious of what an oft-told tale were the places that he had chosen to describe.  If Richard took it for granted that the reader was totally unacquainted with the peoples of these cities and their ways, it was because he believed that that was the best way to write a descriptive article, always had believed it, and believed it so long as he wrote.  And whatever difference of opinion may have existed among the critics and the public as to Richard&#x27;s fiction, I think it is safe to say that as a reporter his work of nearly thirty years stood at least as high as that of any of his contemporaries or perhaps as that of the reporters of all time.  As an editor, when he gave out an assignment to a reporter to write an article on some well-worn subject and the reporter protested, Richard&#x27;s answer was the same:  &quot;You must always remember that that story hasn&#x27;t been written until YOU write it.&quot;  And when he suggested to an editor that he would like to write an article on Broadway, or the Panama Canal, or the ruins of Rome and the editor disapproved, Richard&#x27;s argument was:  &quot;It hasn&#x27;t been done until _I_ do it.&quot;  And it was not because he believed for a moment that he could do it better or as well as it had been done.  It was simply because he knew the old story was always a good story, that is, if it was seen with new eyes and from a new standpoint.  At twenty-eight he had written a book about England and her people, and the book had met with much success both in America and England.  At twenty-nine, equally unafraid, he had &quot;covered&quot; the ancient cities that border the Mediterranean, and now Paris lay before him!  This thought--indeed few thoughts--troubled Richard very much in those days of his early successes.  He had youth, friends, a marvellous spirit of adventure, and besides there are many worse fates than being consigned to spending a few months in Paris, having a thoroughly joyous time, taking a few mental notes, and a little later on transferring them to paper in the quiet of a peaceful summer home at Marion. Chief among his friends in Paris at this time was Charles Dana Gibson, who was living in a charming old house in the Latin Quarter, and where the artist did some of his best work and made himself extremely popular with both the Parisians and the American colony.  In addition to Gibson there were Kenneth Frazier, the portrait-painter, and Tina, Newton, and James Eustis, the daughter and sons of James B. Eustis, who at that time was our ambassador to France, a most genial and kindly host, who made much of Richard and his young friends. PARIS, May 5, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: It is a narrow street with apartment houses of gray stone and iron balconies along either side of it.  The sun sets at one end of the street at different times during the day and we all lean out on the balconies to look.  On the house, one below mine, on the other side of our street, is a square sign that says: ALFRED DE MUSSET EST MORT DANS CETTE MAISON A great many beautiful ladies with the fashionable red shade of hair still call there, as they used to do when the proper color was black and it was worn in a chignon and the Second Empire had but just begun.  While they wait they stretch out in their carriages and gaze up at the balconies until they see me, and as I wear a gold and pink silk wrapper and not much else, they concentrate all their attention on the wrapper and forget to drop a sigh for the poet.  There are two young people on the sixth floor opposite, who come out on the balcony after dinner and hold on to each other and he tells her all about the work of the day.  Below there is a woman who sews nothing but black dresses, and who does that all day and all night by the light of a lamp.  And below the concierge stands all day in a lace cap and black gown and blue, and looks up the street and down the street like the woman in front of Hockley&#x27;s.  BUT on the floor opposite mine there is a beautiful lady in a pink and white wrapper with long black hair and sleepy black eyes.  She does not take any interest in my pink wrapper, but contents herself with passing cabs and stray dogs and women with loaves of bread and bottles in their hands who occasionally stray into our street.  At six she appears in another gown and little slippers and a butterfly for a hat and says &quot;Good-by&quot; to the old concierge and trips off to dinner.  Lots of love to all. DICK. PARIS, May llth, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: I am still somewhat tentative as regards my opinion of the place, what it will bring me in the way of material I cannot tell.  So far, &quot;Paris Decadent&quot; would be a good title for anything I should write of it.  It is not that I have seen only the worst side of it but that that seems to be so much the most prominent.  They worship the hideous Eiffel Tower and they are a useless, flippant people who never sleep and yet do nothing while awake.  To-morrow I am going to a pretty inn surrounded by vines and trees to see a prize fight with all the silly young French men and their young friends in black and white who ape the English manners and customs even to &quot;la box.&quot;  To night at the Ambassadeurs the rejected lover of some actress took a gang of bullies from Montmartre there and hissed and stoned her.  I turned up most innocently and greatly bored in the midst of it but I was too far away to pound anybody-- I collected two Englishmen and we went in front to await her re-appearance but she had hysterics and went off in a cab and so we were not given a second opportunity of showing them they should play fair.  It is a typical incident of the Frenchman and has made me wrathy.  The women watching the prize fight will make a good story and so will the arms of the red mill, &quot;The Moulin Rouge&quot; they keep turning and turning and grinding out health and virtue and souls. I dined to night with the C-----s and P----s, the Ex-Minister and disagreed with everybody and found them all very middle class as to intellect.  An old English lady next to me said apropos of something &quot;that is because you are not clever like Mr. ---- and do not have to work with your brains.&quot;  To which I said, I did not mind not being clever as my father was a many times millionaire,&quot; at which she became abjectly polite.  Young Rothenstein is going to do a picture of me to-morrow morning.  There is nothing much more to tell except that a horse stood on his fore legs in the Bois the other day and chucked me into space.  I was very sore but I went on going about as it was the Varnishing day at the new salon and I wished to see it.  I am over my stiffness now and if &quot;anybody wants to buy a blooming bus&quot; I have one for sale and five pairs of riding breeches and two of ditto boots.  No more riding for me--- The boxing bag is in good order now and I do not need for exercise.  The lady across the street has a new wrapper in which she is even more cold and haughty than before.  &quot;I sing Tarrara boom deay and she keeps from liking me.&quot; DICK. PARIS, May 14th, 1893. DEAR NORA: Things are getting more interesting here and I shall probably have something to write about after all, although I shall not know the place as I did London.  Will Rothenstein has drawn a picture of me that I like very much and if mother likes it VERY, VERY much she may have it as a loan but she may not like it.  I did not like to take it so I bought another picture of him, one of Coquelin cadet and now I have two.  Coquelin gave him his first commission when he was nineteen, two years ago, and then asked him to do two sketches.  After these were done Coquelin told him by letter that he would give him half what they had agreed upon for the big picture for the two sketches and begged the big picture as a gift.  So Rothenstein cut the head and shoulders out of the big one and sent him the arms and legs.  It is the head he cut out that I have.  When Rothenstein and I and Coquelin become famous, that will make a good story.  I have also indulged myself in the purchase of several of Cherets works of art.  They cost three francs apiece.  We have had some delightful lunches at the Ambassadeurs with Cushing and other artists and last night I went out into the Grande Monde to a bal masque for charity at the palace of the Comtesse de la Ferrondeux.  It was very stupid and the men outnumbered the women 30 to 1, which are interesting odds.  To-day we went to Whistler&#x27;s and sat out in a garden with high walls about it and drank tea and laughed at Rothenstein.  The last thing he said was at the Ambassadeurs when one of the students picking up a fork said, &quot;These are the same sort of forks I have.&quot;  Rothenstein said &quot;yes, I did not know you dined here that often.&quot;  Some one asked him why he wore his hair long, &quot;To test your manners&quot; he answered.  He is a disciple of Whistler&#x27;s and Wilde&#x27;s and said &quot;yes, I defend them at the risk of their lives.&quot;  Did I tell you of his saying &quot;It is much easier to love one&#x27;s family than to like them.&quot;  And when some one said &quot;Did you hear how Mrs. B. treated Mr. C., (a man he dislikes) he said, &quot;no, but I&#x27;m glad she did.&quot;  It was lovely at Whistler&#x27;s and such a contrast to the other American salon I went to last Sunday.  It was so quiet, and green and pretty and everybody was so unobtrusively polite. Rothenstein wore my rosette and made a great sensation and I was congratulated by Whistler and Abbey and Pennell.  Rothenstein said he was going to have a doublebreasted waistcoat made with rosettes of decorations for buttons.  Tomorrow Lord Dufferin has asked me to breakfast at the Embassy.  He was at the masked ball last night and was very nice.  He reminds me exactly of Disraeli in appearance.  It is awfully hot here and a Fair for charity has asked me to put my name in &quot;Gallegher&quot; to have it raffled for.  &quot;Dear&quot; Bonsal arrives here next Sunday, so I am in great anticipation.  I am very well, tell mother, and amused.  Lots of love. DICK. PARIS, June 13, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: There is nothing much to say except that things still go on.  I feel like one of those little India rubber balls in the jet of a fountain being turned and twisted and not allowed to rest.  Today I have been to hear Yvette Guilbert rehearse and thought her all Chas thinks her only her songs this season are beneath the morals of a medical student.  It is very hot and it is getting hotter.  I had an amusing time at the Grand Prix where Tina won a lot of money on a tip I gave her which I did not back myself.  In the evening Newton took me to dinner and to the Jardin de Paris where they had 10 franc admittance and where every thing went that wasn&#x27;t nailed.  The dudes put candles on their high hats and the girls snuffed them out with kicks and at one time the crowd mobbed the band stand and then the stage and played on all the instruments.  The men were all swells in evening dress and the women in beautiful ball dresses and it was a wonderful sight.  It only happens once a year like the Yale-Princeton night at Koster and Bials except that the women are all very fine indeed.  They rode pig-a-back races and sang all the songs.  I had dinner with John Drew last night.  I occasionally sleep and if Nora doesn&#x27;t come on time I shall be a skeleton and have no money left.  As a matter of fact I am fatter than ever and can eat all sorts of impossible things here that I could never eat at home.  I lunch every day with the Eustises and we dine out almost every night.  I consort entirely with the poorest of art students or the noblest of princesses and so far have kept out of mischief, but you can never tell for this is a wicked city they say, or it strikes me as most amusing at present only I cannot see what Harper and Bros. are going to get out of it.  I said that of London so I suppose it will all straighten out by the time I get back. DICK. CHAPTER VII FIRST PLAYS When the season in Paris had reached its end, Richard returned to London and later on to Marion, where he spent the late summer and early fall, working on his Mediterranean and Paris articles, and completing his novel &quot;Soldiers of Fortune.&quot;  In October he returned to New York and once more assumed his editorial duties and took his usual active interest in the winter&#x27;s gayeties. The first of these letters refers to a dinner of welcome given to Sir Henry Irving.  The last two to books by my mother and Richard, and which were published simultaneously. NEW YORK, November 27, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: The dinner was very fine.  I was very glad I went.  Whitelaw Reid sat on one side of Sir Henry Irving and Horace Porter on the other.  Howells and Warner came next.  John Russell Young and Mark Twain, Millet, Palmer, Hutton, Gilder and a lot more were there.  There were no newspaper men, not even critics nor actors there, which struck me as interesting.  The men were very nice to me.  Especially Young, Reid, Irving and Howells.  Everybody said when I came in, &quot;I used to know you when you were a little boy,&quot; so that some one said finally, &quot;What a disagreeable little boy you MUST have been.&quot; I sat next a chap from Brazil who told me lots of amusing things.  One story if it is good saves a whole day for me.  One he told was of a German explorer to whom Don Pedro gave an audience.  The Emperor asked him, with some touch of patronage, if he had ever met a king before.  &quot;Yes,&quot; the German said thoughtfully; &quot;five, three wild and two tame.&quot; Mark Twain told some very funny stories, and captured me because I never thought him funny before, and Irving told some about Stanley, and everybody talked interestingly.  Irving said he was looking forward to seeing Dad when he reached Philadelphia.  &quot;It is nice to have seen you,&quot; he said, &quot;but I have still to see your father,&quot; as though I was not enough. DICK. NEW YORK, 1893. DEAREST MOTHER: I cannot tell you how touched and moved I was by the three initials in the book.  It was a genuine and complete surprise and when I came across it while I was examining the letterpress with critical approbation and with no idea of what was to come, it left me quite breathless-- It was so sweet of you-- You understand me and I understand you and you know how much that counts to me-- I think the book is awfully pretty and in such good taste-- It is quite a delight to the eye and I am much more keen about it than over any of my own-- I have sent it to some of my friends but I have not read it yet myself, as I am waiting until I get on the boat where I shall not be disturbed-- Then I shall write you again-- It was awfully good of you, and I am so pleased to have it to give away.  I never had anything to show people when they asked for one of your other books and this comes in such an unquestionable form-- With lots of love. DICK. NEW YORK, 1893. DEAR MOTHER: I got your nice letter and one from Dad.  Both calling me many adjectives pleasing to hear although they do not happen to fit.  So you are in a third edition are you?  These YOUNG writers are crowding me to the wall.  I feel thrills of pride when I see us sitting cheek by jowl on the news-stands. Lots of love. In February, 1894, Richard was forced by a severe attack of sciatica to give up temporarily the gayeties of New York and for a cure he naturally chose our home in Philadelphia, where he remained for many weeks.  Although unable to leave his bed, he continued to do a considerable amount of work, including the novelette &quot;The Princess Aline,&quot; in the writing of which I believe my brother took more pleasure than in that of any story or novel he ever wrote.  The future Empress of Russia was the heroine of the tale, and that she eventually read the story and was apparently delighted with it caused Richard much human happiness. PHILADELPHIA. March 5th. DEAR CHAS: I am getting rapidly better owing to regular hours and light literature and home comforts.  I am not blue as I was and my morbidness has gone and I only get depressed at times.  I am still however feeling tired and I think I will take quite a rest before I venture across the seas.  But across them I will come no matter if all the nerves on earth jump and pull.  Still, I think it wiser for all concerned that I get thoroughly well so that when I do come I won&#x27;t have to be cutting back home again as I did last time.  We are young yet and the world&#x27;s wide and there&#x27;s a new farce comedy written every minute and I have a great many things to do myself so I intend to get strong and then do them.  I enclose two poems.  I am going to have them printed for my particular pals later.  I am writing one to all of you folks over there. DICK. TAKE ME BACK TO BROADWAY, WHERE THE  ORCHIDS GROW WITH APOLOGIES TO THE WESTERN DIALECT POETS &quot;I have wandered up and down somewhat in many different lands I have been to Fort Worth, Texas, and I&#x27;ve tramped through Jersey sands, I have seen Pike&#x27;s Peak by Moonlight, and I&#x27;ve visited the Fair And to save enumeration I&#x27;ve been nearly everywhere. But no matter where I rested and no matter where I&#x27;d go, I have longed to be on Broadway Where                          the                               Orchids                                    Grow. Some people love the lilies fair that hide in mossy dells Some folks are fond of new mown hay, before the rainy spells But give to me the orchids rare that hang in Thorley&#x27;s store, And in Fleischman&#x27;s at the Hoffman, and in half a dozen more And when I see them far from home they make my heart&#x27;s blood glow    For they take me back to Broadway Where                          the                               Orchids                                    Grow. Let Paris boast of boulevards where one can sit and drink There is no such chance on Broadway, at the Brower House,      `I don&#x27;t think.&#x27; And where else are there fair soubrettes in pipe clayed tennis shoes, And boys in silken sashes promenading by in twos Oh you can boast of any street of which you&#x27;re proud to know But give me sleepy Broadway Where                          the                               Orchids                                    Grow. Let poets sing of chiming bells and gently lowing kine I like the clanging cable cars like fire engines in line And I never miss the sunset and for moonlight never sigh When `Swept by Ocean Breezes.&#x27; flashes out against the sky. And when the Tenderloin awakes, and open theatres glow I want to be on Broadway Where                     the                          Orchids                               Grow.&quot; A VOUS, JOHN DREW &quot;John Drew, I am your debtor For a very pleasant letter And a lot of cabinet photos Of the `Butterflies&#x27; and you And I think it very kind That you kept me so in mind And pitied me in exile So I do, John Drew. 2 John Drew, &#x27;twixt you and me Precious little I can see Of that good there is in Solitude That poets say they view. For _I_ hate to be in bed With a candle at my head Sitting vis a vis with Conscience. So would you, John Drew. 3 John Drew, then promise me That as soon as I am free I may sit in the first entrance As Lamb always lets me do. And watch you fume and fret While the innocent soubrette Takes the centre of the stage a-- Way from you, John Drew.&quot; R. H. D. In the summer of 1894 Richard went to London for a purely social visit, but while he was there President Carnot was assassinated, and he went to Paris to write the &quot;story&quot; of the funeral and of the election of the new President. VERSAILLES, June 24, 1894. I am out here to see the election of the new President.  I jumped on the mail coach and came off in a hurry without any breakfast, but I had a pretty drive out, and the guard and I talked of London.  The palace is closed and no one is admitted except by card, so I have seen only the outside of it.  It is most interesting.  There is not a ribbon or a badge; not a banner or a band.  The town is as quiet as always, and there are not 200 people gathered at the gate through which the deputies pass.  Compared to an election convention in Chicago, it is most interesting.  How lively it is inside of the chamber where the thing is going on I cannot say.  I shall not wait to hear the result, but will return on the coach. Nothing could be more curious than the apparent indifference of the people of Paris to the assassination of the President.  Two days after he died there was not a single flag at half mast among the private residences.  The Government buildings, the hotels and the stores were all that advertised their grief.  I shall have an interesting story to write of it for the Parisian series.  Dana Gibson and I will wait until after the funeral and then go to Andorra.  If he does not go, I may go alone, but perhaps I shall go back to London at once.  This has been an interesting time here, but only because it is so different from what one would expect.  It reads like a burlesque to note the expressions of condolence from all over the world, and to mark the self-satisfaction of the French at attracting so much sympathy, and their absolute indifference to the death of Carnot.  It is most curious.  We have an ideal time.  Never before have I had such jolly dinners, with such good talk and such amusing companions. DICK. LONDON, July 15, 1894. DEAR MOTHER: Mr. Irving gave a supper last night to Mme. Bernhardt and Mme. Rejane.  There were about twenty people, and we ate in the Beefsteak Room of the Lyceum Theater, which is so called after the old Beefsteak Club which formerly met there.  I had a most delightful time, and talked to all the French women and to Miss Terry, who sent her love to Dad.  She said, &quot;I did not SEE him this last visit; that is, I saw him but I did not see him.&quot;  Her daughter is a very sweet girl, and the picture Miss Terry made on her knees looking up at Bernhardt and Rejane when they chattered in French was wonderful.  Neither she nor Irving could speak a word of French, and whenever any one else tried, the crowd all stood in a circle and applauded and guyed them.  After it was over, at about three in the morning, Miss Terry offered me a lift home in her open carriage, so she and her daughter and I rode through the empty streets in the gray light for miles and miles, as, of course, I did not get out of such company any sooner than I had to do.  They had taken Irving&#x27;s robe of cardinal red and made it into cloaks, and they looked very odd and eerie with their yellow hair and red capes, and talking as fast as they could. DICK. CHAPTER VIII CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA About January 1, 1895, Richard accompanied by his friends Somers Somerset and Lloyd C. Griscom, afterward our minister to Tokio and ambassador to Brazil and Italy, started out on a leisurely trip of South and Central America.  With no very definite itinerary, they sailed from New Orleans, bent on having a good time, and as many adventures as possible, which Richard was to describe in a series of articles.  These appeared later on in a volume entitled &quot;Three Gringos in Venezuela.&quot; January, 1895. DEAR FAM: On board Breakwater at anchor.  You will be pleased to hear that I am writing this in a fine state of perspiration in spite of the fact that I have light weight flannels, no underclothes and all the windows open.  It is going to storm and then it will be cooler.  We have had a bully time so far although the tough time is still to come, that will be going from Puerto Cortez to Tegucigalpa.  At Belize the Governor treated us charmingly and gave us orderlies and launches and lunches and advice and me a fine subject for a short story.  For nothing has struck me as so sad lately as did Sir Anthony Moloney K. C. M. G. watching us go off laughing and joking in his gilded barge to wherever we pleased and leaving him standing alone on his lawn with some papers to sign and then a dinner tete-a-tete with his Secretary and so on to the end of his life.  It was pathetic to hear him listen to all the gossip from the outside world and to see how we pleased him when we told him we were getting more bald than he was and that he would make a fine appearance in the Row at his present weight.  He had not heard of Trilby!! We struck a beautiful place today called Livingston where we went ashore and photographed the army in which there was no boy older than eighteen and most of them under ten.  It was quite like Africa, the homes were all thatched and the children all naked and the women mostly so.  We took lots of photographs and got on most excellently with the natives who thought we were as funny as we thought them.  Almost every place we go word has been sent ahead and agents and consuls and custom house chaps come out to meet me and ask what they can do.  This is very good and keeps Griscom and Somerset in a proper frame of awe.  But seriously I could not ask for better companions, they are both enormously well informed and polite and full of fun.  The night the Governor asked Somers to dinner and did not ask us we waited up for him and then hung him out over the side of the boat above the sharks until he swore he would never go away from us again.  Griscom is more aggravatingly leisurely but he has a most audacious humor and talks to the natives in a way that fills them with pleasure but which nearly makes Somers and I expose the whole party by laughing.  Today we lie here taking in banannas and tomorrow I will see Conrad, Conrad, Conrad!!  Send this to the Consul.  Lots of love. DICK. SAN PEDRO--SULA--February, 1895. MY DEAR FAMILY: The afternoon of the day we were in Puerto Cortez the man of war Atlanta steamed into the little harbor and we all cheered and the lottery people ran up the American flag.  Then I and the others went out to her as fast as we could be rowed and I went over the side and the surprise of the officers was very great.  They called Somers and Griscom to come up and we spent the day there.  They were a much younger and more amusing lot of fellows than those on the Minneapolis and treated us most kindly.  It was a beautiful boat and each of us confessed to feeling quite tempted to go back again to civilization after one day on her.  Their boat had touched at Tangier and so they claimed that she was the one meant in the Exiles.  They told me that the guide Isaac Cohen whom I mentioned in Harper&#x27;s Weekly carries it around as an advertisement and wanted to ship with them as cabin boy.  We left the next day on the railroad and the boys finding that two negroes sat on the cowcatcher to throw sand on the rails in slippery places bribed them for their places and I sat on the sand box.  I never took a more beautiful drive.  We did not go faster than an ordinary horse car but still it was exciting and the views and vistas wonderful.  Sometimes we went for a half mile under arches of cocoanut palms and a straight broad leafed palm called the manaca that rises in separate leaves sixty feet from the ground.  Imagine a palm such as we put in pots at weddings and teas as high as Holy Trinity Church and hundreds and hundreds of them.  The country is very like Cuba but more luxuriant in every way.  There are some trees with marble like trunks and great branches covered with oriole nests and a hundred orioles flying in and out of them or else plastered with orchids.  If Billy Furness were to see in what abundance they grew he would be quite mad.  It is a great pity he did not come with us.  This little town is the terminus of the railroad and we have been here four days while Jeffs the American Colonel in the Hondurean Army is getting our outfit.  It has been very pleasant and we are in no hurry which is a good thing for us.  It is a most exciting country and as despotic as all uncivilized and unstable governments must be.  But we have called on the Governor of the district with Jeffs and he gave us a very fine letter to all civil and unmilitary authorities in the district calling on them to aid and protect us in every way.  I am getting awfully good material for my novel and for half a dozen stories to boot only I am surprised to find how true my novel was to what really exists here.  About ten years ago ---- disappeared, having as I thought drunk himself to death.  He came up to me here on my arrival with a lot of waybills in his hand and I learned that he had been employed in this hole in the ground by a railroad for two years.  I remembered meeting him at Newport when I was still at Lehigh, and last night he asked me to dinner and told me what he had been doing which included everything from acting in South America to blacking boots in Australia.  His boss was a Pittsburgh engineer who is apparently licking him into shape and who told me to tell his father that he had stopped drinking absolutely.  His colored &quot;missus&quot; sat with us at the table and played with a beetle during the three hours I stayed there during which time he asked me about ---- who he said had ruined him.  He told me of how ---- had done and said this, and the contrast to the thatched roof and the mud floor and the Scotch American engineer and the mulatto girl was rather striking.  I never had more luck in any trip than I have had on this one and the luck of R. H. D. of which I was fond of boasting seems to hold good.  That man of war, for instance, was the only American one that had touched at Puerto Cortez in TEN years and it came the day we did and left the day we did.  We saw a big lithograph of Eddie Sothern in a palm hut here so we went before a notary and swore to it and had three seals put on the paper and sent it him as a joke.  We start tomorrow the 22nd so you see we are behind our schedule and I suppose you people are all worried to death about us.  We will be much longer than six days on our way to Tegucigalpa as we are going shooting and also to pay our respects to Bogran the ex-president and the man who is getting up the next revolution.  But we take care to tell everyone we are travelling for pleasure and are great admirers of Bonilla the present president.  Somers and I are getting on famously.  He is a very fine boy with a great sense of humor and apparently very fond of me. We had five men counting Jeffs who we call our military attache and Charwood and four drivers and eleven mules so it is quite an outfit.  In Ecuador with one more man it would constitute a revolution. DICK. DEAR FAM:            SANTA BARBARA--January 25, 1895. We are not at Tegucigalpa as you observe but travelling in this country.  &quot;As you see it on Broadway &quot; and as you see it here are two different things.  We have had five days of it so far and rested here today in order to pay our respects to General Bogran the ex-president of the Republic.  It is still six days to Tegucigalpa.  The trip across Central America will certainly be one of the most interesting experiences of my life.  It is the most beautiful country I have seen and the most barbarous.  It is also the hottest and the most insect-ious and the dirtiest.  This latter seems a little view to take of it but it means a great deal as the insects prevent your doing anything in a natural way; as for instance sitting on the grass or sleeping on the ground or hunting through the bushes.  It is pretty much as you imagine it is from what you have read, that covers it, and I have discovered nothing new by coming to see it.  I only verify what others have seen.  The people are most uninteresting chiefly because they are surly to Americans and do not make you feel welcome.  I do not mean that I did not do well to come for I am more glad that I did than I can say only I have not, as I have been able to do before, found something that others have not seen.  I never expect to see such a country again unless in Africa.  If you leave the path for ten yards you would never get back to it except by accident and you could not get that far away unless you cut yourself a trail.  In some places the mail route which we follow and over which the mail is carried on the backs of runners is cut in the rock and we go down steps as even as those of the City Hall and for hours we travel over rough rocks and stones and a path so narrow that your knees catch in the vines at the side.  The mules are wonderfully sure footed and never slip although they are very little, and I am pretty heavy.  The heat is something awful.  It bakes you and will dry your pith helmet in ten minutes after you have soaked it in water.  But the scenery is magnificent, sometimes we ride above the clouds and look down into valleys stretching fifty miles away and see the buzzards half a mile below us.  Then we go through forests of manaca palms that spread out on a single stem sideways and form arches over our heads with the leaves hanging in front of us like portiers or we cross great plains of grass and cactus and rock.  The best fun is the baths we take in the mountain streams.  They are almost as cool as one could wish and we shoot the rapids and lie under the waterfalls and come out with all the soreness rubbed out of us as though we had been massaged.  We went shooting for two days but as they had no dogs we did not do much.  I got the best shot of the trip and missed it. It was a large wild cat and he turned his side full on but I fired over him.  Somers and I spent most of the time firing chance shots at alligators, but they never gave us a good chance as the birds warn them when they are in danger.  One old fellow fifteen feet long beat us for some time and then Somers and I started across the river to catch him asleep.  It was like the taking of Lungtepen.  We had our money belts around our necks and our shoes in one hand and rifles in the other.  The rapids ran very fast and the last I saw of Somerset he was sitting on the bank he had started from counting out wet bank notes and blowing the water out of his gun barrel.  I got across all right by sticking my feet between rocks and put on my shoes and crawled up on the old Johnnie.  He smelt of musk so strong that you could have found him in the dark.  I had, a beautiful shot at him at fifty yards but I was too greedy and ran around some rocks to get nearer and he heard me and dived.  I shot a macaw, one of those overgrown parrots with tail feathers three feet from tip to tip.  I got him with a rifle and as Griscom had got his with a shotgun I came out all right as a marksman although I was very sore at missing the wild cat.  We sleep in hats and we sleep precious little for the dogs and pigs and insects all help to keep us awake and I cannot get used to a hammock.  The native beds are made of matting such as they put over tea chests, or bull&#x27;s hide stretched.  Last night I slept in a hut with a woman and her three daughters all over fifteen and they sat up and watched me prepare for bed with great interest.  I would not have missed this trip for any other I know.  I wanted to rough it and we&#x27;ve roughed it and we will have another week of it too.  We have some remarkable photographs and the article ought to be most interesting.  Bogran proved to be a very handsome and remarkable man and we had a very interesting talk with him.  From Tegucigalpa we will probably go directly to Venezuela across the Isthmus of Panama and not visit another Republic.  We have all travelled too much to care to duplicate, and that is what we would be doing by remaining longer in Central America.  A month of it will be enough of it and we will not get away from Amapala before the first of February.  We are all well and happy and dirty and sing and laugh and tell stories and listen to Griscom&#x27;s anecdotes of the aristocracy as we pick our way along.  So goodbye and God bless you all. DICK. TEGUCIGALPA,  CENTRAL  AMERICA. February lst, 1895. 4th, 1895. DEAR FAMILY-- Here we are at last, the trip from Santa Barbara where I  last wrote you was made in six days.  It was not so  interesting as the first part because it was very high up and the tropical scenery gave way to immensely tall pines and other trees that might have been in California, or the Rockies.  The Corderillas which is the name of the mountains we crossed are a continuation, by the way, of the Rockies, and the Andes but are not more than 4,000 feet high.  We had two very hot days of it in the plains of Comgaqua where there was once a city of 60,000 founded by Cortez but where there are not now more than 6,000.  The heat was awful.  We peeled all over our faces and hands and dodged and ducked our heads as though some one were biting at us.  My saddle and clothes were so hot that I could not place my hand on them.  At one village we heard that a bull fight was to be given at the next fifteen miles away, so we rode on there and arrived in time to take part.  They had enclosed the plaza with a barricade of logs seven feet high, bound together with vines.  They roped a big bull and lassoed him all over and then a man got on his back with spurs on his bare feet and held on by the ropes around the bull&#x27;s body and by his toes and threw a cloak over the bull&#x27;s eyes when ever it got too near any one-- They stuck it with spears until it was mad and then let the lassoes slip and the bull started off to tear out the torreadors.  I thought it would be a great sporting act to kodak a bull while it was charging you and so we all volunteered to act as torreadors and it was most exciting and funny.  It was rather late to get good results but I got some pretty good pictures of the bull coming at me with his head down and then I&#x27;d skip into a hole in the wall.  The best pictures I got were of Somers and Griscom scrambling over the seven foot barriers with the bull in hot chase.  We all looked so funny in our high boots and helmets and so much alike that the savages yelled with delight and thought we had been engaged especially for their pleasure.  Our &quot;mosers,&quot; or mule drivers treated us most insolently but we could not do anything because Jeffs. had engaged them and we did not want to interfere with his authority but at a place the last day out one of them told Jeffs. he lied and that we all lied.  He had lost or stolen a canteen of Griscom&#x27;s and they had said we had not given it to him.  Jeffs. went at him right and left and knocked him all over the shop.  There were half a dozen drunken mule drivers at the place and we thought they would take a hand but they did not.  That night Jeffs. thought to try us to see what we would have done and left us bathing in a mountain stream and rode on ahead and hid himself behind a rock in a canon and lay in ambush for us.  We were jogging along in the moonlight and Somerset was reciting the &quot;Walrus and the Carpenter,&quot; when suddenly Jeffs. let out a series of yells in Spanish and opened fire on us over our heads.  Somerset was riding my mule and I had no weapons, so I yelled at him to shoot and he fell off his mule and ran to mine and let go at the rock behind which Jeffs. was with the carbines.  So that in about five seconds Jeffs.&#x27; curiosity was perfectly satisfied as to what we would do, and he shouted for mercy.  We thought it was a sentry or brigands and were greatly disappointed when it turned out to be Jeffs.  We got here last night and a dirtier or more dismal place you never saw.  We had telegraphed ahead for rooms but nothing was in order and we were lodged much worse than we had been several times in the interior where there was occasionally a clean floor.  This morning we wrote direct to the President, asking for an interview or audience and did not ask our Consul to help us because Jeffs. had asked him in our presence to come meet us and he said he would after he had done talking to some other men, but he never came.  Before we heard from Bonilla however, we learned that the Vice-president who has the same name was to be sworn in so we went to the palace along with the populace in their bare feet.  We sat out of sight but the English Consul who was the finest looking person in the chamber--all over gold lace--saw us and asked that we be given places in front, which the minister of something asked us to take but we objected on account of our clothes.  Somers had on a flannel suit that looked exactly like pajamas and lawn tennis shoes.  But as soon as the ceremony was over they insisted on our going in to the banquet hall and in spite of our objections we were there conveyed and presented to Bonilla who behaved very well and after saying he had received our letters but had not had time to read them left us and avoided us, which was what we wanted for we looked like the devil.  We met everybody else though and took the English and Guatemalian Consuls back to our rooms and gave them drinks and then we went to their rooms, so the day went very pleasantly.  The President sent us a funny printed card appointing an audience at eleven to-morrow.  It is exactly what you would imagine it would be, the soldiers are barefooted except about fifty and the President leaned out of the window in his shirt sleeves after the review and they have not plastered up the holes in his palace that his cannon made in it just a year ago to-day, when he was fighting Vasquez, and Vasquez was then on the inside and Bonilla on the hills.  I forgot to tell you that this morning a boy about sixteen years old, with a policeman&#x27;s badge and club came to our window and talked pleasantly with us or at us rather, while we shaved and guyed him in English.  Finally we found that he had come to arrest Jeffs. so we told him where Jeffs. was but he preferred to watch us shave and we finished it under his custody.  Then we went to the Commandante and found that the mosers had had Jeffs. arrested for not paying them on their arrival at Tegucigalpa, as we had distinctly told them we would not do but at San Pedro from where we took them, on their return.  It was only a spite case suggested by Jeffs. thrashing their leader.  The Commandante gave them a scolding and we went out in triumph. February 4th-- Your cable received all right.  We were very glad to hear.  We have decided to go on by mules to Manaqua, the Capital of Nicaragua, and from there either to Corinto or to Lemon on the Atlantic side.  We had to do this or wait here ten days for the boat going south at Amapala.  It is moonlight now so that we can avoid the heat of the day.  Yesterday we went out riding with the President, who put a gold revolver in his hip pocket before he started and made us feel that uneasy lies the head that rules in this country.  He had two horses that had never been ridden before, as a compliment to our powers, the result was that the Vice-president&#x27;s horse almost killed him, which I guess the President intended it should and the horse Griscom rode backed all over the town.  He was a stallion and had never been ridden before that day.  Mine was a gentle old gee-gee and yet I felt good when we were all on the ground again.  The British consul gave Somers a fine reception and raised the flag for him and had the band there to play &quot;God Save the Queen,&quot; which he had spent the whole morning in teaching them.  Griscom and I called on our Consul and played his guitar.  We bought one for ourselves for the rest of the trip. I want you to do something for me: keep all the unfavorable notices you get.  I know Mother won&#x27;t do it, so I shall expect Nora to make a point of saving them from the waste-paper basket.  If there is not a lot of them when I get back, I will raise a row. DICK. MANAQUA-NICARAGUA-February 13, 1895. DEAR FAM: I had a great deal to tell you, but we have just received copies of the Panama Star and have read of the trolley riots in Brooklyn, a crisis in France, War in the Balkans, a revolution in Honolulu and another in Colombia.  The result is that we feel we are not in it and we are all kicking and growling and abusing our luck.  How Claiborne and Russell will delight over us and in telling how the militia fired on the strikers and how Troop A fought nobly.  Never mind our turn will come someday and we may see something yet.  We have had the deuce of a time since we left Tegucigalpa.  Now we are in a land where there are bull hide beds and canvas cots instead of hammocks and ice and railroads and direct communication with steamship lines.  Hereafter all will be merely a matter of waiting until the boat sails or the train starts and the uncertainties of mules and cat boats are at an end.  It is hard to explain about our difficulties after we left Tegucigalpa but they were many.  We gave up our idea of riding here direct because they assured us we could get a steam launch from Amapala to Corinto so we rode three days to San Lorenzo on the Pacific side and took an open boat from there to Amapala.  It was rowed by four men who walked up a notched log and then fell back dragging the sweeps back, with the weight of their bodies. It was a moonlight night and they looked very picturesque rising and sinking back and outlined against the sky.  They were naked to the waist and rowed all night and I had a good chance to see them as I had to lie on the bottom of the boat on three mahogany logs.  By ten the next day we were too cramped to stand it, so we put ashore on a deserted island and played Robinson Crusoe.  We had two biscuits and a box of sardines among five of us but we found oysters on the rocks and knocked a lot off with clubs and stones and the butts of our guns.  They were very good.  We also had a bath until a fish ran into me about three feet long and cut two gashes in my leg.  We reached Amapala about four in the afternoon.  It was an awful place; dirt and filth and no room to move about, so we chartered an open boat to sail or row to Corinto sixty miles distant.  You see, we could not go back to Tegucigalpa until the steamer arrived which is to take us South of Panama and we could not go to Manaqua either and for the same reason that we had sent back our mule train and we would not wait in Amapala partly because of fever which had been there and partly because we wanted to get to Corinto where they have ice and to see Manaqua.  The boat was about as long as the Vagabond and twice as deep and a foot or two more across her beam.  There were four of us, five of the crew and two natives who wanted to make the trip and who we took with us.  It was pretty awful.  The old tub rocked like a milk shake and I was never so ill in my life, we all lay packed together on the ribs of the boat and could not move and the waves splashed over us but we were too ill to care.  The next day the sun beat in on us and roasted us like an open furnace.  The boat was a pit of heat and outside the swell of the Pacific rose and fell and reflected the sun like copper.  We reached Corinto in about twenty four hours and I was never so glad to get any place before.  The town turned out to greet us and some Englishmen ran to ask from what boat we had been ship wrecked.  They would not believe we had taken the trip for any other reason.  They helped us very kindly and would not let us drink all the iced water we wanted and sent us in to bathe in a place surrounded by piles to keep out the sharks and by a roof to shelter one from the sun.  Corinto proved to be all that Amapala was not; clean, cool with very excellent food and broad beds of matting.  I liked it better than any place at which we have been, we came on here the next day to see the President and found the city hot, dusty and of no interest.  There is an excellent hotel however and we had a talk with the President who was a much better chap than Bonilla being older and more civilized.  Of course there is absolutely no reason or excuse for us if we do not get control of this canal.  If only that it would allow our ships of war to pass from Ocean to Ocean instead of going around the horn.  The women are really beautiful but that has nothing to do with the canal.  Tomorrow morning we return to Corinto as Somers and I like it best.  Griscom would like to go on across by the route of the canal which would be a good thing were we certain of meeting a steamer at Simon or Greytown, but the Minister who went last month that way had to wait there sixteen days.  So, we will probably leave Corinto on the 17th or 20th, there are two steamers, one that stops at ports and one that does not.  They both arrive together.  I do not know which we will take but--this letter will go with me. Up to date I think the trip will make a good story but it will have to be a personal one about the three of us for the country as it stands is uninteresting to the general reader for the reason that it DUPLICATES itself in everything.  But with our photographs and a humorous story, it ought to be worth reading and I have picked enough curious things to make it of some value. February 15,--Corinto. We are back here now and rid of that dusty, dirty city.  You would be amused if you saw this place and tried to understand why we prefer it to any place we have seen.  There is surf bathing at a half mile distant and a good hotel with a great bar where a Frenchman gives us ice and the sea captains and agents for mines and plantations in the interior gather to play billiards.  Outside there are rows of handsome women with decollete gowns and shining black hair and colored silk scarfs selling fruit and down the one street which faces the bay are a double row of palms and the store where two American boys have a phonograph.  They are the only Americans I have met who have or are taking a dollar out of this country.  They play the guitar and banjo very well.  One of them was on the Princeton glee club and their stories of how they have toured Central America are very amusing.  Lots of Love. DICK. S. S. Barracouta--Off San Juan February 21, 1895. DEAR MOTHER: Today I believe is the 21st.  We are out two days from Corinto off San Juan on the boundary of Costa Rica and lie here some hours.  Then we go on without stopping to Panama arriving there about the 25th.  On the 28th we take the steamer to Caracas.  We will be at Caracas a week and then go straight home.  But in the meanwhile we will have got one mail at Colon when we go there to take the boat for Caracas and glad I will be to get it.  We have had a summary of the news in the Panama Star and a bundle of Worlds telling all about the trolley strike and that is all except Dad&#x27;s cable at Tegucigalpa that we have heard in nearly two months. I am very sorry that the distances have turned out so much longer than we expected and that we had that unfortunate ten days wait for the steamer.  I know you want me home and I would like to be there but I do not think I ought to go without seeing Caracas.  It helps the book so much too if one runs it into South America for no one in the States thinks much of Central and does not want to read about it.  At least I know I never did.  We have had a most amusing time with the two phonograph chaps.  One of them has been an advertising agent and a deputy sheriff and chased stage coach robbers and kept a hard-ware store and is only twenty-five and the other has not had quite as much experience but has been to Princeton, he is 23.  The mixture of narratives which change from tricks of the hard-ware trade to dances at Buckingham Palace and anecdotes of Cliff House supper parties at San Francisco are very interesting.  I am going to write a book for them and call it &quot;Through Central America with a Phonograph&quot; or &quot;Who We Did, and How We Done Them.&quot;  We sing the most beautiful medleys and contribute to the phonograph.  I had to protest against them announcing &quot;Her Golden Hair was Hanging Down her Back&quot; by Richard Harding Davis and Somerset kicked at their introducing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; as sung by &quot;His Grace the Duke of Bedford&quot; which they insist in thinking his real title and his name; if he would only confess the truth.  You cannot have any idea of how glad I am that I took this trip, just this particular trip, not for any interest it will be to the gentle reader but for the benefit it has been to me.  All the things I was nervous about have been done and should I get nerves again as I suppose I always will in one form or another I can get rid of them by remembering how I got rid of them before during this most peculiar excursion.  For though I and we all told the truth about being well, we were in a most trying place at times and the ride we took and the sail to get away from possible fever was very much of a strain.  I do not see how Griscom kept up as he did for he was an invalid and very nervous when he started.  But he showed great sporting blood.  It was much better having three than two and he furnished us with much amusement at which he never complains.  His artlessness and his bad breaks which keep us filled with terror make the most entertaining narratives and he tells them on himself and then keeps on making new ones.  One night Jeffs came down with fever through bathing in the mountain streams, a practice which did not hurt us but which natives of the country cannot do in safety, and I confess I was scared.  Jeffs pulled through in a few days.  It was odd that the man who had lived here eleven years should have been the only one to give up throughout the whole trip and he was a good sport, too. I will have the Central American stories all done or nearly so by the time we reach New York which is one of the comforts of this over abundance of sea voyages.  I have the lottery story nearly written and am wondering now if Bissell will let me publish it.  Would it not be a good idea to have Dad, if he knows him, explain about how I went South to write it and just what it is and get his official sanction or shall I write or get the Harper&#x27;s to write when I get back.  The lottery people in joke offered  $10,000 if they could write the story themselves.  And sometimes I wish they would for it is the hardest kind of work.  I do not want to advertise their old game and yet I cannot help doing it, in a way.  We put in at Punta Arenas and I found a woman looking at us with an opera glass and shortly after she sent out to say she knew me and that she wanted me to come up.  It seemed I met her in Elizabeth, New Jersey with Eddie Coward where she was playing in private theatricals.  Since then as a punishment no doubt she has lived here and her husband is Minister of the Navy with one gun boat.  This trip is very hot and I sleep on deck and look up at the stars and the light on the jib and the smoke spoiling the firmament.  It makes you feel terribly far away from the centre of civilization in front of the fire and you all trying to make out where we are at.  I hope you know more about it than we do. It is the worst country for getting about that I ever heard of.  It has revived my interest and belief in all such beautiful things as buried treasures and hidden cities and shooting men against stone walls and filibusters.  There are not many of these stories but every man tells them differently so they have all the freshness of a new tale.  There is no ice on this boat or lemons or segars.  It is the first time so they say that it has happened in twelve months, but after this it must be better.  At Panama they fine the ice man $1000 every day his machine breaks and so we have hopes.  I feel so very, very selfish off down here and leaving you all alone and it makes me lose my temper more than usual when all these delays occur but I promise to be good hereafter and we will be together soon now by the end of March sure and I hope you will not miss me too much, as much as I miss all of you.  Sometimes I wish you could see some of these islands and the long shadowy sharks and the turtles, there are thousands of turtles as big as tubs just floating around like empty bottles, but I have never on the whole taken a trip when I so seldom wished that the family were around to enjoy it.  It used to hurt me during the Mediterranean trip but there is not much that would please you in this outfit.  I like it because I am satisfied to go dirty for weeks at a time and to talk to the engineer or the queer passengers and to pick up stories and improve my geography but I do not think the scenery would compensate either Nora or you or Dad for the lack of necessities and CLEANTH.  When we were crossing the continent I don&#x27;t believe I had a spot on me as big as a nickel without three bites on it, all sorts of bites, they just swarmed over you all sizes, colors and varieties.  They came from dogs, from  the sand, from trees, from the grass, from the air.   The worst were little red bugs that lay under the leaves called carrapati&#x27;s and that came off on you in a hundred at a time.  And there were also &quot;jiggers&quot; that get under your nails and leave eggs there.  Some times we could not sleep at all for the bites and you had to carry a brush to brush the carripats off every time you passed through bushes.  It&#x27;s the damnedest country I was ever in now that I have time to think of it.  The other day I was going in to bathe and the sand was so hot that I could not get to the breakers and so I went yelling and jumping back to the grass and the grass was just one mass of burrs, so I gave another yell and leaped on to a big log and the log was full of thorns.  That&#x27;s the sort of country it is.  And then after you do make a dash for the surf a shark makes a dash for you and you don&#x27;t know what you are here for anyway.  It had its humorous side and it was very funny, especially as it never turned out otherwise, to see the men scamper when the sharks came in.  They never scented us for ten minutes or so and then they would swim up and we would give a yell and all make for the shore head over heels and splashing and shrieking and scared and excited.  There would always be one man who was further out than the rest and he could not hear on account of the waves and we would all line up on the beach and yell and dance up and down and try to attract his attention.  But you would see him go on diving and playing along in horrible loneliness until he turned to speak to some one and found the man gone and then he would look for the others and when he saw us all on the shore he would give one wild whoop out of him and go falling over himself with his hair on end and his eyes and mouth wide open.  I saw one shark ten feet long but we would have died of the heat if we had not bathed so we thought it was worth it.  That&#x27;s over now because we cannot get any more sea bathing.  Just around Panama.  Finest place seen yet. RICHARD. PANAMA, February 28th, 1895. DEAR MOTHER: Griscom has awakened to the fact that he is a Press correspondent and is interviewing rebels who come stealthily by night followed by spies of the government and sit in Griscom&#x27;s room with the son of the Consul General, as interpreter.  Somerset and I refuse to be implicated and sit in the plaza waiting for a file of soldiers to carry Griscom off which is our cue for action.  There is a man-of-war, the Atlanta, the one we made friends with at Puerto Cortez, lying at Colon and so we feel safe.  We may now be said to be absorbing local color.  That is about all we have done since we left Amapala.  And if it were not that you are all alone up there, I would not mind it.  I would probably continue on.  We know it now as we do London or Paris.  We can distinguish sea captains, lawyers in politics, commandantes, oldest residents, gentlemenly good for nothings, shipping agents and commission dealers, coffee planters and men who are &quot;on the beach&quot; with unerring eye.  We know the story of each before he tells it, or it is told by some one else.  The Commandante shot a lot of men by the side of a road during the last revolution, first allowing them to dig their own graves and is here now so  that he can pay himself by stealing the custom dues, the lawyer politician has been to Cornell and taken a medical degree in Paris and aspires to be a deputy and only remembers New York as the home of Lillian Russell.  The commission merchants are all Germans and the coffee planters are all French.  They point with pride to little bare-foot boys selling sea shells and cocoanuts as their offspring, although they cannot remember their names.  The sea captains you can tell by their ready made clothes of a material that would be warm in Alaska and by them wearing Spanish dollars for watch guards and by the walk which is rolling easily when sober and pitching heavily toward the night.  The oldest resident always sits in front of the hotel and in the same seat, with a tortoise shell cane and remembers when Vasquez or Mendoza or Barrios, or Bonilla occupied the Cathedral and fired hot shot into the Palace and everybody took refuge in the English Consulate and he helped guard the bank all night with a Springfield rifle.  The men who are on the beach have just come out of the hospital where they have had yellow fever and they want food.  This story is intended to induce you to get rid of them hurriedly by a small token.  Sometimes out of this queer combination you will get a good story but generally they want to show you a ruined abbey or a document as old as the Spanish occupation or to make you acquainted with a man who has pearls to sell, or a coffee plantation or a collection of unused stamps which he stole while a post-office employee.  Our chief sport now is to go throw money at the prisoners who are locked up in a row of dungeons underneath the sea wall.  The people walk and flirt and enjoy the sea breeze above them and the convicts by holding a mirror between the bars of the dungeons can see who is leaning over the parapet above them.  Then they hold out their hands and you drop nickels and they fail to catch them and the sentry comes up and teases them by holding the money a few inches beyond their reach.  They climb all over the crossbars in their anxiety to get the money and look like great monkeys.  At night it is perfectly tremendous for their is only a light over their heads and they crawl all over the bars beneath this, standing on each other&#x27;s shoulders and pushing and fighting and yelling half naked and wholey black and covered with sweat.  As a matter of fact they are better content to stay in jail than out and when the British Consul offered to send eight of them back to Jamaica they refused to go and said they would rather serve out their sentence of eight years.  This is the way the place looks and I am going to introduce it in a melodrama and have some one lower files down to the prisoners. DICK. After some not very eventful or pleasant days at Caracas, Richard sailed for home and from the steamer wrote the following letter: March 26th--On board S. S. Caracas. DEAR CHAS: Off the coast of God&#x27;s country.  Hurrah!  H---- did not come near us until the morning of our departure when he arrived at the Station trembling all over and in need of a shave.  But in the meanwhile the consul at Caracas picked Griscom and myself up in the street and took us in to see Crespo who received us with much dignity and politeness.  So we met him after all and helped the story out that much. There is not much more to tell except that I was never so glad to set my face home as I am now and even the roughness of this trip cannot squelch my joy.  It seems to me as if years had passed since we left and to think we are only three days off from Sandy Hook seems much too wonderfully good to be possible.  Some day when we have dined alone together at Laurent&#x27;s I will tell you the long story of how Somers and Gris came to be decorated with the Order of the Bust of Bolivar the Liberator of Venezuela of the 4th class but at present I will only say that there is a third class of the order still coming to me in Caracas, as there is 20 minutes still coming to Kelly in Brooklyn.  It was a matter of either my getting the third class, which I ought to have had anyway having the third class of another order already, and THEIR GETTING NOTHING, or our all getting the 4th or 5th class and of course I choose that they should get something and so they did and for my aimable unselfishness in the matter they have frequently drunken my health.  I was delighted when Somers got his for he was happier over it than I have ever seen him over anything and kept me awake nights talking about it.  I consider it the handsomest order there is after the Legion of Honor and I have become so crazy about Bolivar who was a second Washington and Napoleon that I am very glad to have it, although I still sigh for the third class with its star and collar. The boys are especially glad because we have organized a Traveller&#x27;s Club of New York of which we expect great things and they consider that it starts off well in having three of the members possessors of a foreign order.  We formed the club while crossing Honduras in sight of the Pacific Ocean and its object is to give each other dinners and to present a club medal to people who have been nice to and who have helped members of the club while they were in foreign parts.  It is my idea and I think a good one as there are lots of things one wants to do for people who help you and this will be as good as any.  Members of the club are the only persons not eligible to any medal bestowed by the club and the eligibility for membership is determined by certain distances which a man must have travelled.  Although the idea really is to keep it right down to our own crowd and make each man justify the smallness of the club&#x27;s membership by doing something worth while.  I am President.  Bonsal is vice president.  Russell treasurer and Griscom Secretary.  Somerset is the solitary member.  You and Sam and Helen and Elizabeth Bisland are at present the only honorary members.  We are also giving gold medals to the two chaps who crossed Asia on bicycles, to Willie Chanler and James Creelman, but that does not make them members.  It only shows we as a club think they have done a sporting act.  I hope you like the idea.  We have gone over it for a month and considered it in every way and I think we are all well enough known to make anybody pleased to have us recognize what they did whether it was for any of us personally or for the public as explorers.  On this trip for instance we would probably send the club medals in silver to Admiral Meade, to Kelly, to Royas the Venezuelan Minister for the orders to the Governor of Belize, to the consul at La Guayra and to one of the phonograph chaps.  In the same way if you would want to send a medal to any man or woman prince or doctor who had been kind, courteous, hospitable or of official service to you you would just send in a request to the committee.  Write me soon and with lots of love DICK. In April, 1895, Richard was back in New York, at work on his South and Central American articles, and according to the following letters, having a good time with his old friends. NEW YORK, April 27, 1895. DEAR CHAS: I read in the paper the other morning that John Drew was in Harlem, so I sent him a telegram saying that I was organizing a relief expedition, and would bring him out of the wilderness in safety.  At twelve I sent another reading, &quot;Natives from interior of Harlem report having seen Davis Relief Expeditionary Force crossing Central Park, all well.  Robert Howard Russell.&quot;  At two I got hold of Russell, and we telegraphed &quot;Relief reached Eighty-fifth street; natives peacefully inclined, awaiting rear column, led by Griscom; save your ammunition and provisions.&quot;  Just before the curtain fell we sent another, reading:  &quot;If you can hold the audience at bay for another hour, we guarantee to rescue yourself and company and bring you all back to the coast in safety.  Do not become disheartened.&quot;  Then we started for Harlem in a cab with George and another colored man dressed as African warriors, with assegai daggers and robes of gold and high turbans and sashes stuck full of swords.  I wore my sombrero and riding breeches, gauntlets and riding boots, with cartridge belts full of bum cartridges over my shoulder and around the waist.  Russell had my pith helmet and a suit of khaki and leggins.  Griscom was in one of my coats of many pockets, a helmet and boots.  We all carried revolvers, canteens and rifles.  We sent George in with a note saying we were outside the zareba and could not rescue him because the man on watch objected to our guns.  As soon as they saw George they rushed out and brought us all in.  Drew was on the stage, so we tramped into the first entrance, followed by all the grips, stage hands and members of the company.  The old man heard his cue just as I embraced him, and was so rattled that when he got on the stage he could not say anything, and the curtain went down without any one knowing what the plot was about.  When John came off, I walked up to him, followed by the other four and the entire company, and said:  &quot;Mr. Drew, I presume,&quot; and he said:  &quot;Mr. Davis, I believe.  I am saved!&quot;  Helen Benedict happened to be in Maude Adams&#x27; dressing-room, and went off into a fit, and the company was delighted as John would have been had he been quite sure we were not going on the stage or into a box.  We left them after we had had a drink, although the company besought us to stay and protect them, and got a supper ready in Russell&#x27;s rooms, at which Helen, Ethel Barrymore, John and Mrs. Drew, Maude Adams and Griscom were present. DICK. NEW YORK, November, 1895. DEAR MOTHER:-- The china cups have arrived all right and are a beautiful addition to my collection and to my room, in which Daphne still holds first place. What do you think Sir Henry sent me?  The medal and his little black pipe in a green velvet box about as big as two bricks laid side by side with a heavy glass top with bevelled edges and the medal and pipe lying on a white satin bed, bound down with silver--and a large gold plate with the inscription &quot;To Richard Harding Davis with the warmest greetings from Gregory Brewster--1895&quot;-- You have no idea how pretty it is, Bailey, Banks and Biddle made it-- It is just like him to do anything so sweet and thoughtful and it has attracted so many people that I have had it locked up-- No Burden jewel robbers here-- My friend, the Russian O---- lady still pursues me and as she has no sense of humor and takes everything seriously, she frightens me-- I am afraid she will move in at any moment-- She has asked me to spend the summer with her at Paris and Monte Carlo, and at her country place in Norfolk and bombards me with invitations to suppers and things in the meantime.  She has just sent me a picture of herself two feet by three, with writing all over it and at any moment, I expect her to ring the bell and order her trunks taken up stairs-- I am too attractive-- Last night I dined with Helen and Maude Adams, who is staying with her.  I want them to board me too.  Maude sang for us after dinner and then went off to see Yvette Guilbert at a &quot;sacred concert&quot; to study her methods.  I went to N----&#x27;s box to hear Melba and we chatted to the accompaniment of Melba, Nordica and Plancon in a trio--the Ogre, wore fur, pearls, white satin and violets.  It was a pink silk box.  Then I went down to a reception at Mrs. De Koven&#x27;s and found it was a play.  Everybody was seated already so I squatted down on the floor in front of Mrs. De Koven and a tall woman in a brocade gown cut like a Japanese woman&#x27;s-- It was very dark where the audience was, so I could not see her face but when the pantomime was over I looked up and saw it was Yvette Guilbert.  So I grabbed Mrs. De Koven and told her to present me and Guilbert said in English-- &quot;It is not comfortable on the floor is it?&quot; and I said, &quot;I have been at your feet for three years now, so I am quite used to it&quot;--for which I was much applauded-- Afterwards I told some one to tell her in French that I had written a book about Paris and about her and that I was going to mark it and send it and before the woman could translate, Guilbert said, &quot;No, send me the Van Bippere book&quot;-- So we asked her what she meant and she said, &quot; M. Bourget told me to meet you and to read your Van Bippere Book, you are Mr. Davis, are you not?&quot;-- So after that I owned the place and refused to meet Mrs. Vanderbilt. Yvette has offered to teach me French, so I guess I won&#x27;t go to Somerset&#x27;s wedding, unless O---- scares me out of the country.  I got my $2,000 check and have paid all my debts.  They were not a third as much as I thought they were, so that&#x27;s all right. Do come over mother, as soon as you can and we will meet at Jersey City, and have a nice lunch and a good talk.  Give my bestest love to Dad and Nora.  How would she like Yvette for a sister-in-law?  John Hare has sent me seats for to night-- He is very nice-- I have begun the story of the &quot;Servants&#x27; Ball&quot; and got well into it. and lots of love. DICK. The following letter was written to me at Florence.  The novel referred to was &quot;Soldiers of Fortune,&quot; which eventually proved the most successful book, commercially, my brother ever wrote.  Mrs. Hicks, to whom Richard frequently refers, is the well-known English actress Ellaline Terriss, the wife of Seymour Hicks.  Somerset is Somers Somerset, the son of Lady Henry Somerset, and the Frohman referred to is Daniel Frohman, who was the manager of the old Lyceum Theatre. Early in November, William R. Hearst asked my brother to write a description of the Yale-Princeton football game for The Journal.  Richard did not want to write the &quot;story&quot; and by way of a polite refusal said he could not undertake it for less than $500.00.  Greatly to his surprise Hearst promptly accepted the offer.  At the time, I imagine this was by far the largest sum ever paid a writer for reporting a single event. December 31st, 1895. New York. The Players. New Year&#x27;s Eve. DEAR CHAS: I am not much of a letter writer these days, but I have finished the novel and that must make up for it.  It goes to the Scribners for $5,000 which is not as much as I think I should have got for it.  I am now lying around here until the first of February, when I expect to sail to Somerset&#x27;s wedding, reaching you in little old Firenzi in March.  We will then paint it.  After that I do not know what I shall do.  The Journal is after me to do almost anything I want at my own figure, as a correspondent.  They have made Ralph London correspondent and their paper is the only one now to stick to.  They are trying to get all the well known men at big prices. I have had such a good time helping Mrs. Hicks in Seymour&#x27;s absence.  She had about everything happen to her that is possible and she is just the sort of little person you love to do things for.  She finally sailed and I am now able to attend to my own family. The Central American and Venezuelan book comes out on February lst.  Several of the papers here jokingly alluded to the fact that my article on the Venezuelan boundary had inspired the President&#x27;s message.  Of course you get garbled ideas of things over there and exaggerated ones, as for instance, on the Coxey army.  But you never saw anything like the country after that war message. It was like living with a British fleet off Sandy Hook.  Everybody talked of it and of nothing else.  I went to a dinner of 300 men all of different callings and I do not believe one of them spoke of anything else.  Cabmen, car conductors, barkeepers, beggars and policemen.  All talked war and Venezuela and the Doctrine of Mr. Monroe.  In three days the country lost one thousand of millions of dollars in values, which gives you an idea how expensive war is.  It is worse than running a newspaper.  Now, almost everyone is for peace, peace at any price.  I do not know of but one jingo paper, The Sun, and war talk is greeted with jeers.  It was as if the people had suddenly had their eyes opened to what it really meant and having seen were wiser and wanted no more of it.  Your brother, personally, looks at it like this.  Salisbury was to blame in the first place for being rude and not offering to arbitrate as he had been asked to do.  When he said to Cleveland, &quot;It&#x27;s none of your business&quot; the only answer was &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll make it my business&quot; but instead of stopping there, Cleveland uttered a cast iron ultimatum instead of leaving a loophole for diplomacy and a chance for either or both to back out.  That&#x27;s where I blame him as does every one else. Sam Sothern is in Chicago and we all wrote him guying letters about the war.  Helen said she was going to engage &quot;The Heart of Maryland&quot; company to protect her front yard, while Russell and I have engaged &quot;The Girl I Left Behind Me&quot; company with Blanch Walsh and the original cast. We sent Somerset a picture of himself riddled with bullets.  And Mrs. Hicks made herself famous by asking if it was that odious Dunraven they were going to war about. My article was a very lucky thing and is greatly quoted and in social gatherings I am appealed to as a final authority. The football story, by the way, did me a heap of good with the newspapers and the price was quoted as the highest ever paid for a piece of reporting.  People sent for it so that the edition was exhausted.  The Journal people were greatly pleased. Yvette Guilbert is at Hammerstein&#x27;s and crowds the new music hall nightly, at two dollars a seat.  Irving and Miss Terry have been most friendly to me and to the family.  Frohman is going to put &quot;Zenda&quot; on in New York because he has played a failure, which will of course kill it for next year for Eddie, when he comes out as a star.  I have never seen such general indignation over a private affair.  Barrymore called it a case of Ollaga Zenda.  They even went to Brooklyn when Eddie was playing there and asked him to stage the play for them and how he made his changes and put on his whiskers.  Poor Eddie, he lacks a business head and a business manager--and Sam talks and shakes his head but is little better.  Lots of love and best wishes for the New Year. DICK. CHAPTER IX MOSCOW, BUDAPEST, LONDON The years 1896--1897 were probably the most active of Richard&#x27;s very active life.  In the space of twelve months he reported the Coronation at Moscow, the Millennial Celebration at Budapest, the Spanish-Cuban War, the McKinley Inauguration, the Greek-Turkish War and the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee.  Although this required a great deal of time spent in travelling, Richard still found opportunity to do considerable work on his novel &quot;Captain Macklin,&quot; to which he refers in one of his letters from London. As correspondent of the New York American, then The Journal, Richard went from Florence, where he was visiting me, to Moscow.  He was accompanied by Augustus Trowbridge, an old friend of my brother&#x27;s and a rarely good linguist.  The latter qualification proved of the greatest possible assistance to Richard in his efforts to witness the actual coronation ceremony.  To have finally been admitted to the Kremlin my brother always regarded as one of his greatest successes as a correspondent. En route--May 1896. DEAR CHAS: The night is passed and with the day comes &quot;a hope&quot; but during the blackness I had &quot;a suffer&quot;-- I read until two--five hours--and then slept until five when the middle man who had slept on my shoulder all night left the train and the second one to whom Bernardi was so polite left me alone and had the porter fit me up a bed so that I slept until seven again-- Then the Guardian Angel returned for his traps and I bade him a sleepy adieu and was startled to see two soldiers standing shading their eyes in salute in the doorway and two gentlemen bowing to my kind protector with the obsequiousness of servants-- He sort of smiled back at me and walked away with the soldiers and 13 porters carrying his traps.  So I rung up the conductor and he said it was the King&#x27;s Minister with his eyes sticking out of his head--the conductor&#x27;s eyes--not the Minister&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t know what a King&#x27;s Minister is but he liked your whiskey-- I am now passing through the Austrian Tyrol which pleases me so much that I am chortling with joy-- None of the places for which my ticket call are on any map--but don&#x27;t you care, I don&#x27;t care-- I wish I could adequately describe last night with nothing but tunnels hours in length so that you had to have all the windows down and the room looked like a safe and full of tobacco smoke and damp spongey smoke from the engine, and bad air.  That first compartment I went in was filled later with German women who took off their skirts and the men took off their shoes.  Everybody in the rear of the car is filthy dirty but I had a wash at the Custom house and now I am almost clean and quite happy.  The day is beautiful and the compartment is all my own-- I am absolutely enchanted with the Tyrol-- I have never seen such quaint picture book houses and mills with wheels like that in the Good for Nothing and crucifixes wonderfully carved and snow mountains and dark green forests-- The sky is perfect and the air is filled with the sun and the train moves so smoothly that I can see little blue flowers, baby blue, Bavarian blue flowers, in the Spring grass.  Such dear old castles like birds nests and such homelike old mills and red-faced millers with feathers in their caps you never saw out of a comic opera-- The man in here with me now is a Russian, of course, and saw the last Coronation and knows that my suite is on the principal Street and attends to my changing money and getting an omelette-- I can survive another night now having had an omelette not so good as Madam Masi&#x27;s but still an omelette-- I have now left Munich and the Russian and a conductor whom I mistook for a hereditary prince of Bavaria, with tassels down his back, has assured me he is going to Berlin, and that I am going to Berlin and much else to which I smile knowingly and say mucho gracia, wee wee, ya ya, ich ich limmer and other long speeches ending with &quot;an er--&quot; DICK. May 15th, 1896.  Moscow. DEAR CHAS: We left Berlin Monday night at eleven and slept well in a wagon-lit.  That was the only night out of the five that I spent in the cars that I had my clothes off, although I was able to stretch out on the seats, so I am cramped and tired now.  At seven Monday morning the guard woke us and told us to get ready for the Custom House and I looked out and saw a melancholy country of green hills and black pines and with no sign of human life.  It was raining and dreary looking and then I saw as we passed them a line of posts painted in black and white stripes a half mile apart on each side of the train and I knew we had crossed the boundary and that the line of posts stretched from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea and from the Pacific to the Caucasus Mountains and the Pamirs.  It gave me a great thrill but I have had so many to-day, that I had almost forgotten that one.  For two days we jogged along through a level country with meanthatched huts and black crows flying continually and peasants in sheepskin coats, full in the skirt and tight at the waist, with boots or thongs of leather around their feet.  The women wore boots too and all the men who were not soldiers had their hair cropped short like mops.  We could not find any one who understood any language, so as we never knew when we would stop for food, we ate at every station and I am of the opinion that for months I have been living on hot tea and caviar and hash sandwiches.  The snow fell an inch deep on Wednesday and dried up again in an hour and the sun shone through it all.  So on the whole it was a good trip and most interesting.  But here we are now in a perfect pandemonium and the Czar has not yet come nor one-fifth even of the notables.  It is a great city, immense and overpowering in its extent.  The houses are ugly low storied and in hideous colors except the churches which are like mosques and painted every color.  I confess I feel beaten to night by the noise and rush and roar and by so many strange figures and marvellous costumes.  Our rooms are perfect that is one thing and the situation is the very best.  If the main street were Fifth Avenue and Madison Square the Governor&#x27;s Square, his palace would be Delmonico&#x27;s and our rooms would be the corner rooms of the Brunswick, so you can see how well we are placed.  We can sit in our windows and look down and up the main street and see every one who leaves or calls upon the Governor.  We are now going out for a dinner and to one of many cafe-chantants and I will tell you the rest to-morrow, when I get sleep, for after five nights of it I feel done up, but I feel equally sure it is going to be a great experience and I cannot tell you how glad 1 am that I came.  Love to you all and to dear Florence in which Trowbridge, who is a brick, joins me. DICK. Moscow--May 1896. DEAR CHAS: There was a great deal to tell when I shut down last night, but I thought I would have had things settled by this time and waited, but it looks now as though there was to be no rest for the weary until the Czar has put his crown on his head.  The situation is this: there are ninety correspondents, and twelve are to get into the coronation, two of these will be Americans.  There are five trying for it. Count Daschoff, the Minister of the Court, has the say as to who gets in of those five.  T. and I called on him with my credentials just as he was going out.  Never have I seen such a swell.  He made us feel like dudes from Paterson, New Jersey.  He had three diamond eagles in an astrakan cap, a white cloak, a gray uniform, top boots and three rows of medals.  He spoke English perfectly, with the most politely insolent manner that I have ever had to listen to; and eight servants, each of whom we had, in turn, mistaken for a prince royal, bowed at him all the brief time he talked over our heads.  He sent us to the bureau for correspondents, where they gave me a badge and a pocketbook, with my photo in it.  They are good for nothing, except to get through the police lines.  No one at the bureau gave us the least encouragement as to my getting in at the coronation.  We were frantic, and I went back to Breckenridge, our Minister, and wrote him a long letter explaining what had happened, and that what I wrote would &quot;live,&quot; that I was advertised and had been advertised to write this story for months.  I dropped The Journal altogether, and begged him to represent me as a literary light of the finest color.  This he did in a very strong letter to Daschoff, and I presented it this morning, but the Minister, like Edison, said he would let me know when he could see me.  Then I wrote Breck a letter of thanks so elegant and complimentary that he answered with another, saying if his first failed he would try again.  That means he is for me, and at the bureau they say whichever one he insists on will get in, but they also say he is so good-natured that he helps every one who comes.  I told him this, and he has promised to continue in my behalf as soon as we hear from Daschoff. The second thing of importance is the getting the story, IF WE GET IT, on the wire.  That, I am happy to say, we are as assured of as I could hope to be.  I own the head of the Telegraph Bureau soul, body and mind.  He loves the ground T. and I spurn, and he sent out my first cable today, one of interrogation merely, ahead of twelve others; he has also given us the entree to a private door to his office, all the other correspondents having to go to the press-rooms and undergo a sort of press censorship, which entails on each man the cutting up of his story into three parts, so as to give all a chance.  I gave T. three dictums to guide him; the first was that we did not want a fair chance--we wanted an unfair advantage over every one else.  Second, to never accept a &quot;No&quot; or a &quot;Yes&quot; from a subordinate, but to take everything from head-quarters.  Third, to use every mouse, and not to trust to the lions.  He had practise on the train.  When he told me we would be in Moscow in ten hours, I would say, &quot;Who told you that,&quot; and back he would go to the Herr Station Director in a red gown, and return to say that we would get there in twenty hours.  By this time I will match him against any newspaper correspondent on earth.  He flatters, lies, threatens and bribes with a skill and assurance that is simply beautiful, and his languages and his manners pull me out of holes from which I could never have risen.  With it all he is as modest as can be, and says I am the greatest diplomat out of office, which I really think he believes, but I am only using old reporters&#x27; ways and applying the things other men did first. My best stroke was to add to my cable to The Journal, &quot;Recommend ample recognition of special facilities afforded by telegraph official&quot;--and then get him to read it himself under the pretext of wishing to learn if my writing was legible.  He grinned all over himself, and said it was.  After my first story is gone I will give him 200 roubles for himself in an envelope and say Journal wired me to do it.  That will fix him for the coronation story, as it amounts to six months&#x27; wages about.  But, my dear brother, in your sweet and lovely home, where the sun shines on the Cascine and the workmen sleep on the bridges, and dear old ladies knit in the streets, that is only one of the thousand things we have had to do.  It would take years to give you an account of what we have done and why we do it.  It is like a game of whist and poker combined and we bluff on two flimsy fours, and crawl the next minute to a man that holds a measly two-spot.  There is not a wire we have not pulled, or a leg, either, and we go dashing about all day in a bath-chair, with a driver in a bell hat and a blue nightgown, leaving cards and writing notes and giving drinks and having secretaries to lunch and buying flowers for wives and cigar boxes for husbands, and threatening the Minister with Cleveland&#x27;s name. John A. Logan, Jr., is coming dressed in a Russian Uniform, and he wore it on the steamer, and says he is the special guest of the Czar and the Secretary of the visiting mission.  Mrs. P. P. is paying $10,000 for a hotel for one week.  That is all the gossip there is.  We lunched with the McCooks today and enjoyed hearing American spoken, and they were apparently very glad to have us, and made much of T. and of me. We only hope they can help us; and I am telling the General the only man to meet is Daschoff, and when he does I will tell him to tell Daschoff I am the only man to be allowed in the coronation.  I wish I could tell you about the city, but we see it only out of the corner of our eyes as we dash to bureau after bureau and &quot;excellency&quot; and &quot;royal highness&quot; people, and then dash off to strengthen other bridges and make new friends.  It is great fun, and I am very happy and T. is having the time of his life.  He told me he would rather be with me on this trip than travel with the German Emperor, and you will enjoy to hear that he wrote Sarah I was the most &quot;good-natured&quot; man he ever met.  God bless you all, and dear, dear Florence.  Lots of love. DICK. Moscow--May, 1896. DEAR CHAS: I have just sent off my coronation story, and the strain of this thing, which has really been on me for six months, is off.  You can imagine what a relief it is, or, rather, you cannot, for no one who has not been with us these last ten days can know what we have had to do.  The story I sent is not a good one.  It was impossible to tell it by cable, and the first one on the entry was a much better one.  I do not care much, though; of course, I do care, as I ought to have made a great hit with it, but there was no time, and there was so much detail and minutia that I could not treat it right.  However, after the awful possibility, or rather certainty, that we have had to face of not getting any story at all, I am only too thankful.  I would not do it again for ten thousand dollars.  Edwin Arnold, who did it for The Telegraph, had  $25,000, and if I told you of the way Hearst acted and Ralph interfered with impertinent cables, you would wonder I am sane.  They never sent me a cent for the cables until it was so late that I could not get it out of the bank, and we have spent and borrowed every penny we have.  Imagine having to write a story and to fight to be allowed a chance to write it, and at the same time to be pressed for money for expenses and tolls so that you were worn out by that alone.  The brightest side of the whole thing was the way everybody in this town was fighting for me.  The entire town took sides, and even men who disliked me, and who I certainly dislike, like C. W. and R---- of the Paris Embassy, turned in and fought for my getting in like relations.  And the women--I had grand dukes and ambassadors and princes, whom I do not know by sight, moving every lever, and as Stanhope of The Herald, testified &quot;every man, woman and child in the visiting and resident legation is crazy on the subject of getting Davis into the coronation.&quot;  They made it a personal matter, and when I got my little blue badge, the women kissed me and each other, and cheered, and the men came to congratulate me, and acted exactly as though they had got it themselves. It was a beautiful sight; the Czarina much more beautiful and more sad-looking than ever before.  But it was not solemn enough, and the priests groaned and wailed and chanted and sang, and every one stood still and listened.  All that the Czar and Czarina did was over ten minutes after they entered the chapel, and then for three hours the priests took the center of the stage and groaned.  I was there from seven until one.  Six solid hours standing and writing on my hat.  It was a fine hat, for we were in court costume, I being a distinguished visitor, as well as a correspondent.  That was another thing that annoyed me, because Breckinridge, who has acted like a brick, did not think he could put me on both lists, so I chose the correspondents&#x27; list, of course, in hopes of seeing the ceremony, but knowing all the time that that meant no balls or functions, so that had I lost the ceremony I would have had nothing; but he arranged it so that I am on both lists.  Not that I care now.  For I am tired to death; and Trowbridge did not get on either list, thanks to the damned Journal and to his using all his friends to help me, so that I guess I will get out and go to Buda Pest and meet you in Paris.  Do not consider this too seriously, for I am writing it just after finishing my cable and having spent the morning on my toes in the chapel.  I will feel better tomorrow.  Anyway, it is done and I am glad, as it was the sight of the century, and I was in it, and now I can spend my good time and money in gay Paree.  Love to all. DICK. From Moscow Richard went direct to Buda Pest, where he wrote an article on the Hungarian Millennial. BUDA PEST CHAS:                              May 8th, 1896. I have just returned from the procession of the Hungarian Nobles.  It was even more beautiful and more interesting than the Czar&#x27;s entry than which I would not have believed anything could have been more impressive-- But the first was military, except for the carriages, which were like something out of fairyland--to-day, the costumes were all different and mediaeval, some nine hundred years old and none nearer than the 15th Century.  The mis en scene was also much better.  Buda is a clean, old burgh, with yellow houses rising on a steep green hill, red roofs and towers and domes, showing out of the trees-- It is very high but very steep and the procession wound in and out like a fairy picture-- I sat on the top of the hill, looking down it to the Danube, which separates Buda from Pest-- The Emperor sat across the square about 75 yards from our tribune in the balcony of his palace.  We sat in the Palace yard and the procession passed and turned in front of us-- There were about 1,500 nobles, each dressed to suit himself, in costumes that had descended for generations--of brocade, silk, fur, and gold and silver cloth-- Each costume averaged, with the trappings of the horse, 5,000 dollars.  Some cost $1,000, some  $15,000.  Some wore complete suits of chain armor, with bearskins and great black eagle feathers on their spears just as they were when they invaded Rome-- Others wore gold chain armor and  leopard or wolf skins and their horses were studded with  turquoises and trappings of gold and silver and smothered in silver coins-- It would have been ridiculous if they had not been the real thing in every detail and if you had not known how terribly in earnest the men were.  There is no other country in the world where men change from the most blase and correct of beings, to fairy princes in tights and feathers and jewelled belts and satin coats-- They were an hour in passing and each one seemed more beautiful than the others-- I am very glad I came although I was disappointed at missing the accident at Moscow.  It must have been more terrible than Johnstown.  I found the ----s quite converted into the most awful snobs but the people they worship are as simple and well bred as all gentle people are and I have had the most delightful time with them.  It is so small and quiet after Moscow, and instead of being lost in an avalanche of embassies and suites and missions, I have a distinct personality, as &quot;the American,&quot; which I share with &quot;the&quot; Frenchman and four Englishmen.  We are the only six strangers and they give us the run of all that is going on-- At night we dine at the most remarkable club in the world, on the border of the Park, where the best of all the Gypsey musicians plays for us-- The music is alone worth having come to hear, and the dear souls who play it, having been told that I like it follow me all around the terrace and sit down three feet away and fix their eyes on you, and then proceed to pull your nerves and heart out of you for an hour at a time-- One night a man here dipped a ten thousand franc note in his champagne and pasted it on the leader&#x27;s violin and bowed his thanks, and the leader bowed in return and the next morning sent him the note back in an envelope, saying that the compliment was worth more than the money-- The leader&#x27;s name is Berchey and the Hungarians have never allowed him to leave the country for fear he would not be allowed to come back-- He is a fat, half drunken looking man, with his eyes full of tears half the time he plays.  He looks just like a setter dog and he is so terribly in earnest that when he fixes me with his eyes and plays at me, the court ladies all get up and move their chairs out of his way just as though he were a somnambulist-- I leave here Wednesday and reach Paris Friday MORNING the eleventh-- You must try to meet me at the Cafe de la Paix at half past nine-- Wait in the corner room if you don&#x27;t wish to sit outside and as soon as I get washed I will join you for coffee.  It will be fine to see you again and to be done with jumping about from hotel to hotel and to be able to read the signs and to know how to ask for food.  Russian, German and Hungarian have made French seem like my mother tongue-- DICK. CHAPTER X CAMPAIGNING IN CUBA AND GREECE In December, 1896, Richard and Frederic Remington, the artist, were commissioned by the New York Journal to visit Cuba which was then at war with Spain.  It was their intention to go from Key West in the Vamoose, a very fast but frail steam-launch, and to make a landing at some uninhabited point on the Cuban coast.  After this their plans seem to have been to trust to luck and the kindliness of the revolutionists.  After waiting for some time at Key West for favorable weather, they at last started out on a dark night to make the crossing.  A few hours after the Vamoose had left Key West a heavy storm arose--apparently much too violent for the slightly built launch.  The crew struck and the captain finally refused to go on to Cuba and put back to Key West.  Shortly after this Remington and my brother reached Havana by a more simple and ostentatious route.  This was my brother&#x27;s first effort as a war correspondent, and I presume it was this fact and the very indefiniteness of the original plan that caused his mother and father so much uneasiness.  And, indeed, it did prove eventually a hazardous exploit. way to Key West. December 19, 1896. DEAR MOTHER: I hope you won&#x27;t be cross with me for going off and not letting you know, but I thought it was better to do it that way as there was such delay in our getting started.  I am going to Cuba by way of Key West with Frederic Remington and Michaelson, a correspondent who has been there for six months.  We are to be taken by the Vamoose the fastest steam yacht made to Santa Clara province where the Cubans will meet us and take us to Gomez.  We will stay a month with him, the yacht calling for copy and sketches once a week, and finally for us in a month.  I get all my expenses and The Journal pays me  $3,000 for the month&#x27;s work.  The Harper&#x27;s Magazine also takes a story at six hundred dollars and Russell will reprint Remington&#x27;s sketches and my story in book form, so I shall probably clear $4,000 in the next month or six weeks.  I was a week in getting information on the subject so I know all about it from the men who have just been there and I want you to pay attention to what I tell you they told me and not to listen to any stray visitor who comes in for tea and talks without any tact or knowledge.  There is no danger in the trip except the problem of getting there and getting away again, and that is now removed by The Journal&#x27;s yacht.  I would have gone earlier had any of the periodicals that asked me to go shown me any way to get there-- THERE IS NO FEVER THIS TIME OF YEAR and as you know fever never touches me.  It got all the others in Central America and never worried me at all.  There is no danger of getting shot, as the province into which we go, the Santa Clara province, is owned and populated and patrolled by the Cubans.  It is no more Spanish than New Jersey and the Spaniards cannot get in there.  We have the strongest possible letters from the Junta, and I have from Lamont, Bayard and Olney and credentials in every language.  We will sit around the Gomez camp and send messengers back to the coast.  It is a three days trip and as Gomez may be moving from place to place you may not hear from us for a month and we may not hear from you but remember it was a much longer time than that before you heard from me when I went to Honduras.  Also keep in mind that I am going as a correspondent only and must keep out of the way of fighting and that I mean to do so, as Chamberlain says we want descriptive stories not brave deeds-- Major Flint who has arranged the trip for us was down there with Maceo as a correspondent.  He saw six fights and never shot off his gun once because as he said it was not his business to kill people and he has persuaded me that he is right, so I won&#x27;t do anything but look on-- I have bought at The Journal&#x27;s expense a fifty dollar field glass which is a new invention and the best made.  I have marked it so that you can see a man five miles off and as soon as I see him I mean to begin to ride or run the other way--no one loves himself more than I do so you leave me to take care of myself.  I wish I could give you any idea of the contempt the four returned correspondents who talked to me, have for the Spaniards.  They have seen them shoot 2,500 rounds without hitting men at 200 yards and they run away if the enemy begins on them first.  However, you trust to Richard-- We have a fine escort arranged for us and Michaelson speaks Spanish perfectly and has been six months scouting over the country. DICK. KEY West, December 26, 1896. DEAR FAMILY: I got your letters late last night and they made me pretty solemn.  It is an awfully solemn thing to have people care for you like that and to care for them as I do.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love you.  You don&#x27;t know how much the pain of worrying you for a month has meant to me, but I have talked it all out with myself, and left it to God and I am sure I am doing right.  As Mrs. Crown said, &quot;There&#x27;s a whole churchful up here praying for you,&quot; and I guess that will pull me through.  Of course, dear, dear Mother thought she was cross with me.  She could not be cross with me, and her letter told me how much she cared, that was all, and made me be extra careful.  But I need not promise you to be careful.  You have an idea I am a wild, filibustering, hot-headed young man.  I am not.  I gave the guides to understand their duty was to keep us out of danger if we had to walk miles to avoid it.  We are men of peace, going in, as real estate agents and coffee-planters and drummers are going in on every steamer, to attend to our especial work and get out again quick.  I have just as strong a prejudice against killing a man as I have against his killing me. Lots and lots of love.  Don&#x27;t get scared if you don&#x27;t hear for a month, although we will try to get our stories back once a week, but you know we are at the convenience of the Cubans who will pocket our despatches and money and not take the long trip back.  Thank dear Dad for his letter full of good advice.  It was excellent.  Remington and Michelson are good men and I like them immensely.  Already we are firm friends. Love, KEY WEST--January 1, 1897. DEAR MOTHER: As you will know by my telegram we are either off on a safe sea going boat or waiting for one.  There is no turning back from here and the only reason I thought of doing so was the knowledge of the way you would suffer and worry.  I argued it out that it was selfish in me to weigh my getting laughed at and paragraphed as the war correspondent that always Turned Back against a month of uneasiness for you, but later I saw I could not do it much as I love you for the element of danger to me is non-existent; it is merely an exciting adventure and you will have to believe me and not worry but be a Spartan mother.  I would not count being laughed at and the loss of my own self respect if I really thought there was great danger, but I do not.  You will not lose me and if I go now I can sit still next time and say &quot;I have done better things than that.&quot;  If I had not gone it would have meant that I would have had to have done just that much harder a stunt next time to make people forget that I had failed in this one.  Now do cheer up and believe in the luck of Richard Harding Davis and the British Army.  We have carte blanche from The Journal to buy or lease any boat on the coast and I rocked them for $1000 in advance payment because of the delay over the Vamoose. I am so happy at thinking I am going, I could not have faced anyone had I not, although we had nothing to do with the failure, we tried to cross fairly in the damn tub and it was her captain who put back.  I lay out on the deck and cried when he refused to go ahead, we had waited so long.  The Cubans and Remington and Michelson had put on all their riding things but fortunately I had not and so was spared that humiliation.  What I don&#x27;t know about the Fine Art of Filibustering now is unnecessary.  I find many friends of my Captain Boynton or &quot;Capt. Burke.&quot;  Tonight the officers of the Raleigh give me a grand dinner at which I wear a dress suit and make speeches--they are the best chaps I ever met in the Navy.  Lots of love and best wishes to Dad and to Nora for a happy, happy New Year.  You know me and you know my conscience but it would not let me go back in order to save you anxiety so you won&#x27;t think me selfish.  God bless you. DICK. KEY WEST, January 2nd, 1897. DEAR FAMILY: I have learned here that the first quality needed to make a great filibuster is Patience, it is not courage, or resources or a knowledge of the Cuban Coast line, it is patience.  Anybody can run a boat into a dark bayou and dump rifles on the beach and scurry away to sea again but only heroes can sit for a month on a hotel porch or at the end of a wharf, and wait.  That is all we do and that is my life at Key West.  I get up and half dress and take a plunge in the bay and then dress fully and have a greasy breakfast and then light a huge Key West cigar, price three cents and sit on the hotel porch with my feet on a rail-- Nothing happens after that except getting one&#x27;s boots polished as the two industries of this place are blacking boots and driving cabs.  I have two boys to black mine at the same time every morning and pay the one who does his the better of the two-- It generally ends in a fight so that affords diversion-- Then a man comes along, any man, and says, &quot;Remmington&#x27;s looking for you&quot; and I get up and look for Remington.  There is only a triangle of streets where one can find him and I call at &quot;Josh&quot; Curry&#x27;s first and then at Pendleton&#x27;s News Store and read all the back numbers of  the Police Gazette for the hundredth time and then call here at the Custom House and then look in at the Cable office, where Michaelson lives sending telegrams about anything or nothing and that brings me back to the hotel porch again, where I have my boots shined once more and then go into mid-day dinner.  In the meanwhile Remington is looking for me a hundred yards in the rear.  He generally gets to &quot;Josh&#x27;s&quot; as I leave the Custom House-- In the afternoon I study Spanish out of a text book and at three take a bicycle ride, at five I call at the garrison to take tea with the doctor and his wife, who is sweeter than angel&#x27;s ever get to be with a miniature angel of a baby called Martha.  I wait until retreat is sounded and the gun is fired at sunset and having commented unfavorably on the way the soldiers let the flag drop on the grass instead of catching it on the arms as a bluejacket does, I ride off to the bay for another bath-- Then I take the launch to the Raleigh and dine with the officers and rejoice in the clean fresh paint and brass and decks and the lights and black places of a great ship of war, than which nothing is more splendid.  We sit on the quarter-deck and smoke and play the guitar and I go home again, in time for bed.  I vary this programme occasionally by spending the morning on the end of a wharf watching another man fish and reading old novels and the &quot;Lives of Captain Walker&quot; and &quot;Captain Fry of the Virginius,&quot; two great books from each of which I am going to write a short story like the one of the Alamo or of the Jameson Raid-- The life of Walker I found on the Raleigh and the life of Captain Fry with all the old wood cuts and the newspaper comments of the time at a book store here.  I don&#x27;t know when we shall get away but it is no use kicking about it, Michaelson is doing all he can and the new tug will be along in a week anyway.  I shall be so glad to get to Cuba that I will dance with glee. DICK. MATANZAS, January 15th, 1897. DEAR MOTHER: I sent you a note by Remington which he will mail in the States-- From here I go to Sagua La Grande.  It is on the northern coast.  I think from there I shall cross over to Cienfuegos on the Southern coast and then if I can catch a steamer go to Santiago to see my old friends, at the Juraqua mines and MacWilliams&#x27; ore road and &quot;the Palms&quot;-- Everywhere I am treated well on account of Weyler&#x27;s order and I am learning a great deal and talking very little, my Spanish being bad.  There is war here and no mistake and all the people in the fields have been ordered in to the fortified towns where they are starving and dying of disease.  Yesterday I saw the houses of these people burning on both sides of the track-- They gave shelter to the insurgents and so very soon they found their houses gone.  I am so relieved at getting old Remington to go as though I had won $5000.  He was a splendid fellow but a perfect kid and had to be humored and petted all the time.  I shall if I have luck be through with this in a few weeks but it has had such a set back at the start that I am afraid it can never make a book and I doubt if I can write a decent article even.  I am so anxious not to keep you worrying any longer than is necessary and so I am hurrying along taking only a car window view of things.  Address me care of Consul General Lee, Havana and confine your remarks to what is going on at home.  I know what is going on here.  I don&#x27;t believe half I hear but I am being slowly converted.  Remington is more excitable than I am, so don&#x27;t misunderstand if he starts in violently.  I am getting details and verifying things.  He is right on a big scale but every one has lied so about this island that I do not want to say anything I do not believe is true.  This is a beautiful little city and after Jaruco, where we slept two days ago, it is Paris.  There we slept off the barnyard and cows and chickens walked all over the floor and fleas all over us.  It was like Honduras only filthier.  Speaking of Paris, tell the Kid I expect to go over to him soon after I return to New York. of love. DICK. CARDENAS--North Coast of Cuba. January 16th, 1897. DEAR MOTHER: It is very funny not knowing what sort of a place you are to sleep in next and taking things out of a grab bag, as it were-- In Europe you can always guess what the well known towns will give you for you have a guide book, but here it is all luck.  Matanzas was a pretty city but the people were awful, the hotel was Spanish and the proprietor insolent, though I was spending more of Willie Hearst&#x27;s money than all of the officers spend in a week, the Consul could not talk English or Spanish, he said he hadn&#x27;t come there &quot;to go to school to no Spaniard&quot; and he gloried in the fact he had been there three years without knowing a word of the language.  His vice-Consul was worse and everything went wrong generally.  Every one I met was an Alarmist and that is polite for liar.  They asked Remington if he was the man who manufactured the rifles and gave us the Iowa Democrat to read.  To night I reached here after a six hours ride through blazing fields of sugar cane and stopped on my way to the hotel to ask the Consul when the next boat went to Saqua la Grande-- I had no letter of introduction to him as I had to the Matanzas consul, but as soon as he saw my card he got out of his chair and shook hands again and was as hearty and well bred and delightful as Charley himself and unlike Chas he did not ask me 14 francs for looking on him.  He is out now chasing around to get me a train for to-morrow.  But I won&#x27;t go to-morrow.  My hotel looks on the plaza and the proprietor and the whole suite of attendants are my slaves.  It is just as different as can be.  My interpreter does it, he calls himself MY VALET, although I point out to him that two shirts and twelve collars do not constitute a wardrobe even with a rubber coat thrown in.  But he likes to play at my being a distinguished stranger and I can&#x27;t say I object.  Only when you remember the way I was invited to see Cuba and expected to see it, and now the way I am seeing it from car windows with A VALET.  What would the new school of yellow kid journalists say if they knew that.  For the first time on this trip I have wished you were both with me, that was to night.  I never see anything really beautiful but that it instantly makes me feel selfish and wish you could see it too.  It has happened again and again and to night I wish you could be here with me on this balcony.  The town runs down a slope to the bay and in the middle of it is the Plaza with me on the balcony which lets out of my sleeping room-- &quot;the room&quot; so the proprietor tells me, &quot;reserved only for the Capitain General.&quot;  It is just like the description in that remarkable novel of mine where Clay and Alice sit on the balcony of the restaurant.  I have the moonlight and the Cathedral with the open doors and the bronze statue in the middle and the royal palms moving in the breeze straight from the sea and the people walking around the plaza below.  If it was in any way as beautiful as this Clay and Alice would have ended the novel that night. I got a grand lot of letters to-day which Otto, my interpreter brought back from Havana after having conducted Remington there in safety.  I must say you are writing very cheerfully now, but I don&#x27;t wonder you worried at first but now that I am a commercial traveller with an order from Weyler which does everything when I find it necessary, you really must not worry any more but just let me continue on my uneventful journey and then come home.  I shall have been gone so long and my friends, judging from Russell and Dana and Irene&#x27;s letters, will be so glad to see me, that they will have forgotten I went out to do other things than coast around in trains.  As a matter of fact this is a terribly big problem and most difficult to get the truth of, I find myself growing to be the opposite of the alarmist, whatever that is, although you would think the picturesque and dramatic and exciting thing would be the one I would rather believe because I want to believe it, but I find that that is not so, I see a great deal on both sides and I do not believe half I am told.  As we used to say at college, &quot;it is against history,&quot; and it is against history for men to act as I am told they are acting here-- They show me the pueblo huddled together around the fortified towns, living in palm huts but I know that they have always lived in palm huts, the yellow kid reporters don&#x27;t know that or consider it, but send off word that the condition of the people is terrible, that they have only leaves to cover them, and it sounds very badly.  That is an instance of what I mean.  In a big way there is no doubt that the process going on here is one of extermination and ruin.  Two years ago the amount  of sugar shipped from the port of Matanzas to the U. S. was valued at 11 millions a year.  This last year just over shows that sugar to the amount of  $800,000 was sent out.  In &#x27;94, 154 vessels touched at Matanzas on their way to America.  In &#x27;95 there were 80 and in &#x27;96 there are 16.  I always imagined that houses were destroyed during a war because they got in the way of cannon balls or they were burned because they might offer shelter to the enemy, but here they are destroyed, with the purpose of making the war horrible and hurrying up the end.  The insurgents began first by destroying the sugar mills, some of which were worth millions of dollars in machinery, and now the Spaniards are burning the homes of the people and herding them in around the towns to starve out the insurgents and to leave them without shelter or places to go for food or to hide the wounded.  So all day long where ever you look you see great heavy columns of smoke rising into this beautiful sky above the magnificent palms the most noble of all palms, almost of all trees-- It is the most beautiful country I have ever visited.  I had no recollection of how beautiful it was or else I had not the knowledge of other places with which to compare it.  Nothing out of the imagination can approach it in its great waterfalls and mossy rocks and grand plains and forests of white pillars with plumes waving above them.  Only man is vile here and it is cruel to see the walls of the houses with blind eyes, with roofs gone and gardens burned, every church but one that I have seen was a fortress with hammocks swung from the altars and rude barricades thrown up around the doorways-- If this is war I am of the opinion that it is a senseless wicked institution made for soldiers, lovers and correspondents for different reasons, and for no one else in the world and it is too expensive for the others to keep it going to entertain these few gentlemen-- I have seen very little of it yet and I probably won&#x27;t see much more, but I have seen all I want.  Remington had his mind satisfied even sooner--but then he is an alarmist and exaggerates things-- The men who wear the red badge of courage, I don&#x27;t feel sorry for, they have their reward in their bloody bandages and the little cross on their tunic but those you meet coming back sick and dying with fever are the ones that make fighting contemptible--poor little farmers, poor little children with no interest in Cuba or Spain&#x27;s right to hold it, who have been sent out to die like ants before they have learned to hold a mauser, and who are going back again with the beards that have grown in the field hospitals on their cheeks and their eyes hollow, and too weak to move or speak.  Six of them died while I was in Jaroco, a town as big as Marion and that had been the average for two months, think of that, six people dying in Marion every day through July and August-- I didn&#x27;t stay in that town any longer than the train did-- Well I have been writing editorials here instead of cheering you up but I guess I&#x27;m about right and when I see a little more I&#x27;ll tell it over again to The Journal-- It is not as exciting reading as deeds of daring by our special correspondent and I haven&#x27;t changed my name or shaved my eyebrows or done anything the other men have done but I believe I am getting near the truth.  They have shut off provisions going or coming from the towns, they have huddled hundreds of people who do not know what a bath means around these towns, and this is going to happen-- As soon as the rains begin the yellow fever and smallpox will set in and all vessels leaving Cuban ports will be quarantined and the island will be one great plague spot.  The insurgents who are in the open fields will live and the soldiers will die for their officers know nothing of sanitation or care nothing.  The little Consul has just been here to see me and we have had a long talk and I got back at him.  He told me he had seen the Franco-German war as a correspondent of The Tribune and Iasked him if he had ever met another correspondent of The Tribune at that time a German student named Hans who cabled the story of the battle of Gravellote and who Archibald Forbes says was the first correspondent to use the cable.  The Consul who looks like William D. Howells wriggled around in his chair and said &quot;I guess you mean me but I was not a German student, I was born and raised in Philadelphia and Forbes got my name wrong, it is Hance.&quot;  So then I got up and shook hands with him in my turn and told him I had always wanted to meet that correspondent and did not expect to do so in Cardenas, on the coast of Cuba. Thank you all for your letters.  I am glad you liked the Jameson book.  I thought you knew I was a F. R. G. S.  It was George Curzon proposed me and as he is a gold medallist of the Society it was easy getting in.  Lots of love. DICK. Richard returned to New York from Cuba in February, 1897, but the following month started for Florence to pay me a long-promised visit.  On his way he stopped for a few days in London and Paris. ABASSADE DES ETATS-UNIS 59 Rue Galilee, Paris, April 1st, 1897. DEAR FAMILY: I got over here to-day after the heaviest weather I ever tackled on this channel.  Stephen Crane came with me.  I gave him a lunchon Wednesday.  Anthony Hope, McCarthy, Harold Frederic and Barrie came.  Sir Evelyn Wood instead of coming was detained at the war office and sent instead a lance Sergeant on horseback with a huge envelope marked &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Service,&quot; which was to be delivered into my hands-- The entire Savoy was upset and it was generally supposed that war had been declared and that I was being ordered to the front-- The whole hotel hung over us until I had receipted for the package and the soldier had saluted and clanked away.  I gave Crane the letter as a souvenir.  I also saw Seymour Hicks&#x27; first night and recognized 15 American songs in it. The London Times offered me the position of correspondent on the Greek frontier.  Every one in London thought it an enormous compliment and Harold Frederic, Ralph, Ballard Smith and the rest were very envious.  I told them I could not go, but I was glad to have had the compliment paid me.  Barrie has made out a scenario of the &quot;Soldiers&quot; for dramatic purposes and has asked the Haymarket management to consider it.  So, that I guess that it must be good-- So, I also guess I had better finish it-- I leave for Florence to night.  I am having a fine, fine time and I am so glad you are all well. Lots of love, DICK. Of the many happy days we have spent together, I do not believe there were any much more happy than the three weeks Richard remained with me.  It was his first long visit to Italy and from the day of his arrival he loved the old town and its people who gave him a most friendly welcome.  He had come at a time when Florence was at its best, its narrow quaint streets filled with sunshine and thronged with idling natives and the scurrying tourists that always came with the first days of spring.  The Cascine and the pink-walled roads of the environs were ablaze with wild roses and here, after his rather strenuous experience in Cuba, Richard gave himself up to long days of happy idleness.  Together we took voyages of discovery to many of the little walled and forgotten towns where the tourists seldom set foot.  Once we even wandered so far as Monte Carlo, where my brother tried very hard to break the bank and did not succeed.  But the Richard Harding Davis luck did not fail him completely and I remember I greatly envied him the huge pile of gold and notes that represented his winnings and which we did our very best to spend before we left the land of the Prince of Monaco.  However, having had his first taste of war, Richard felt that he must leave the peace and content of Florence to see how the Greeks, with whom he had much sympathy, were faring with their enemies the Turks.  As it happened, this expedition proved but a short interruption, and in less than a month he was once more back with his new-found friends in Florence. April 28, 1897 On the Way to Patras on a Steamer. DEAR FAMILY: It has been a week since I wrote you last, when I sent you the Inauguration article.  Since then I have been having the best time I ever had any place ALONE.  I have had more fun with a crowd, but never have been so happy by myself.  What I would have been had I taken some other chap with me I cannot imagine.  But the people of this part of Greece have been so kind that I cannot say I have been alone.  I never met with strangers anywhere who were so hospitable, so confiding and polite.  After that slaughter-yard and pest place of Cuba, which is much more terrible to me now than it was when I was there, or before I had seen that war can be conducted like any other evil of civilization, this opera bouffe warfare is like a duel between two gentlemen in the Bois.  Cuba is like a slave-holder beating a slave&#x27;s head in with a whip.  I am a war correspondent only by a great stretch of the imagination; I am a peace correspondent really, and all the fighting I have seen was by cannon at long range.  (I was at long range, not the cannon.)  I am doing this campaign in a personally conducted sense with no regard to the Powers or to the London Times.  I did send them an article called &quot;The Piping Times of War.&quot;  If they do not use it I shall illustrate it with the photos I have taken and sell it, for five times the sum they would give, to the Harpers who are ever with us.  As I once said in a noted work, &quot;Greece, Mrs. Morris, restores all your lost illusions.&quot;  For the last week I have been back in the days of Conrad, the Corsair, and &quot;Oh, Maid of Athens, ere We Part.&quot;  I have been riding over wind-swept hills and mountains topped with snow, and with sheep and goats and wild flowers of every color spreading for acres, and in a land where every man dresses by choice like a grand opera brigand, and not only for photographic purposes.  I have been on the move all the time, chasing in the rear of armies that turn back as soon as I approach and apologize for disappointing me of a battle, or riding to the scene of a battle that never comes off, or hastening to a bombardment that turns out to be an attack on an empty fort. I live on brown bread and cheese and goat&#x27;s milk and sleep like a log in shepherds&#x27; huts.  It is so beautiful that I almost grudge the night.  Nora and Mother could take this trip as safely as a regiment and would see things out of fairyland.  And such adventures!  Late in life I am at last having adventures and honors heaped upon me.  I was elected a captain of a band of brigands who had been watching a mountain pass for a month, and as it showed no signs of running away had taken to dancing on the green.  I caught them at this innocent pastime and they allowed me to photograph them and give them wine at eight cents a quart which we drank out of a tin stovepipe.  They drank about four feet of stovepipe or thirty-six cents&#x27; worth, then they danced and sang for me in a circle, old men and boys, then drilled with their carbines, and I showed them my revolver and field-glasses and themselves in the finder of the camera; and when I had to go they took me on their shoulders and marched me around waving their rifles.  Then the old men kissed me on the cheek and we all embraced and they wept, and I felt as badly as though I were parting from fifty friends.  They told my guide that if I would come back they would get fifty more &quot;as brave as they&quot; and I could be captain.  I could not begin to tell you all the amusing things that have happened in this one week.  I did not want to come at all, only a stern sense of duty made me.  For I wanted to write the play in Charley&#x27;s gilded halls and get to Paris and London.  But I can never cease rejoicing that I took this trip.  And it will make the book, &quot;A Year from a Reporter&#x27;s Diary,&quot; as complete as it can be.  That was why I came.  Now I have the Coronation of the Czar, the Millennial at Hungary, the Inauguration at Washington, the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee, the War in Cuba, and the Greco-Turkish War.  That is a good year&#x27;s work and I mean to loaf after it.  You will laugh and say that that is what I always say, but if you knew how I had to kick myself out of Florence and the Cascine to come here you would believe me. I want a rest and I am cutting this very short. Don&#x27;t fail to cut anything Dad and Mother don&#x27;t like out of the Inauguration article.  You will have me with you this winter on my little bicycle and going to dances and not paying board to anyone.  Remember how I used to threaten to go to Greece when the coffee was not good.  It seems too funny now, for I never was in a better place, or had more fun or saw less of war or the signs of war. DICK. May 7, 1897. 10 East Twenty-Eighth Street-NIT Sponitza. DEAR CHAS. This is one of the places out of Phroso, but as you never  read Phroso I will cut all that-- I hate to say it so  soon again but this is the most beautiful country to travel over I have seen-- It is a fairy theatrical grand opera country where everybody dresses in petticoats and gold braided vests and carry carbines to tend sheep with-- I rode from Santa Maura (see map) to a spot opposite Prevesa where they said there was going to be bombarding-- There was not of course but I had I think the most beautiful ride of my life.  I was absolutely happy--little lambs bleated and kids butted each other and peasants in fur cloaks without sleeves and in tights like princes sat on rocks and played pipes and the sky was blue, the mountains covered with snow and the fields and hills full of purple bushes and yellow and blue flowers and sheep-- There was a cable station of yellow adobe.  It was the only building and it looked across at Prevesa but nobody bombarded.  The general gave me cognac and the cable operator played a guitar for me and the preyor sang a fine bass, the corporal not to be out done gave me chocolate and the army stood around in the sun and joined in the conversation correcting the general and each other and taking off their hats to all the noble sentiments we toasted.  It was just like a comic opera.  After a while when I had finished a fine hunck of cheese and hard eggs and brown bread I took a photograph of the General and the cable operator and the officer with the bass voice and half of the army-- The other half was then sent to escort me to this place.  It walked and I rode and there were many halts for drinks and cigarettes.  They all ran after a stray colt and were lost for some time but we re-mobilized and advanced with great effect into this town.  I was here taken in charge by at least fifty sailors and as many soldiers and comic opera brigands in drawers and white petticoats,  who conducted me to a house on the hill where the innkeeper brought me a live chicken to approve of for dinner.  Then the mayor of the town turned up in gold clothes and Barrison Sister skirts and said the General had telegraphed about me and that I was his-- The innkeeper wept and said he had seen me first and the chorus of soldiers, sailors and brigands all joined in.  I kept out of it but I knew the Mayor would win and he did.  Then we went out to a man-of-war the size of the Vagabond and were solemnly assured there would be bombarding of Prevesa to-morrow-- I go to sleep in that hope.  We leave here at seven crossing the river and ride after the Greeks who are approaching Prevesa from the land side while the men-of-war bombard it from the river.  At least that is what they say.  I think it is the mildest war on both sides I ever heard of and I certainly mean to be a Times correspondent next time I play at going to war-- After being insulted and frightened to death all over Cuba, this is the pleasantest picnic I was ever on-- They seriously apologized for not bombarding while I was there and I said not to mention it-- With lots of love, old man, and to the family DICK. FLORENCE May 16, 1897. DEAR FAMILY: Here I am safe and sound again in the old rooms in Florence.  I was gone twenty-three days and was traveling nineteen of them, walking, riding; in sailboats, in the cars, and on steamers.  I have had more experiences and adventures than I ever had before in three months and quite enough to last me for years.   After my happy ride through Turkey and the retreat of the Greek army in Arta, of which I wrote you last, I have been in Thessaly where I saw the two days&#x27; battle of Velestinos from the beginning up to the end.  It was the one real battle of the war and the Greeks fought well from the first to the last.  I left Athens on the 29th of April with John Bass, a Harvard graduate, and a most charming and attractive youth who is, or was, in charge of the Journal men; Stephen Crane being among the number.  He seems a genius with no responsibilities of any sort to anyone, and I and Bass left him at Velestinos after traveling with him for four days.  Crane went to Volo, as did every other correspondent, leaving Bass and myself in Velestinos.  As the villagers had run away, we burglarized the house of the mayor and made it our habitation while the courier hunted for food.  It was like &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson,&quot; and we rejoiced over the discovery of soap and tablecloths and stray knives and forks, just as though we had been cast on a desert island.  Bass did the cooking and I laid the table and washed up and made the beds, which were full of fleas.  But we had been sleeping on chairs and on the floor for a week so we did not mind much. The second day we were awakened by cannon and you can imagine our joy and excitement.  We had it all to ourselves for eight hours, as it took the other correspondents that long to arrive.  It was an artillery and infantry battle and about 20,000 men were engaged on both sides.  The Greeks fought from little trenches on the hills back of the town and the Turks advanced across a great green prairie.  It was very long  range and only twice did they get to within a quarter of  a mile of our trenches.  Bass and I went all over the Greek lines, for you were just as safe in one place as in another, which means that it wasn&#x27;t safe anywhere, so we gave up considering that and followed the fight as best we could from the first trench, which was the only one that gave an uninterrupted view of the Turkish forces.  It was a brilliantly clear day but opened with a hail storm, which enabled the Turks to crawl up half a mile in the sudden darkness.  It also gave me the worst attack of sciatica I ever had.  Fortunately, it did not come on badly until I reached Volo, when it suddenly took hold of me so that I could not walk.  The trenches were wet with the rain and we had no clothes to change to, and two more showers kept us more or less wet all day.  We had a fine view of everything and I learned a lot. We were under a heavy fire for thirteen hours and certainly had some very close escapes.  At times the firing was so fierce that if you had raised your arm above your head, the hand would have been instantly torn off.  We had to lie on our stomachs with our chins in the dirt and not so much as budge.  This was when the Turkish fire happened to be directed on our trench.  At such times all the other trenches would fire so as to draw the attack away, and we would have to wait until it was over.  The shells sounded like the jarring sound of telegraph wires when one hits the pole they hang from with a stone; and when the shells were close they sounded like the noise made by two trains passing in opposite directions when the wind is driven between the cars.  The bullets were much worse than the shells as you could always hear them coming, and the bullets slipped up and passed you in a sneaking way with a noise like rustling silk, or if some one had torn a silk handkerchief with a sharp pull.  One shell struck  three feet from me and knocked me over with the dirt and stones and filled my nose and mouth with pebbles.  I went back and dug it out of the ground while it was still hot and have it as a souvenir.  I swore terribly at the bullets and Bass used to grin in a sickly way.  It made your hair creep when they came very close.  One man next me got a shot through the breast while he was ramming his cleaner down the barrel, and there were three killed within the limits of our fifty yards.  We could not get back because there was a cross fire that swept a place we had to pass through, just about the way the wind comes around the City Hall in the times of a blizzard.  We called it Dead Man&#x27;s Curve, after that at Fourteenth Street and Union Square, because it was sprinkled with dead ammunition, mules and soldiers.  We came through it the first time without knowing what we were getting into and we had no desire to go back again.  So we waited until the sun set.  I took some of the finest photographs and probably the only ones ever taken of a battle at such close range.  Whenever the men fired, I would shoot off the camera and I expect I have some pretty great pictures.  Bass took some of me so if there is any question as to whether I was at the Coronation, there will be none as to whether I was at Velestinos. Our house was hit with two shells and bullets fell like the gentle rain from heaven all over the courtyard, so we would have been no safer there than behind the trenches.  We sent off the first account of the battle written by anybody by midday, and stayed on until the next day at four when the place was evacuated in good order because, as usual,  the Crown Prince was running away--from Pharsalia this time.   They say in Greece &quot;Lewes, the peasant, won the race from Marathon, but Constantine the prince, won the race from Larissa.&quot; I was all right until I got to Volo when my right leg refused absolutely to do its act and I had to be carried on a donkey.  A Greek thought I looked funny sitting groaning on the little donkey; which I did--I looked ridiculous.  So he laughed, and Bass and a French journalist batted him over the face and left me clinging to the donkey&#x27;s neck and howling to them to come back and hold me up.  But they preferred to fight, and a policeman came along and arrested the unhappy Greek and beat him over the head, just for luck, and marched him off to jail, just for laughing. They took me to the hospital ship which was starting, and I came to Athens that way with one hundred and sixteen wounded; the man on my right had his ankles gone and the man on the left had a bullet in his side.  They groaned all night and so did I.  Then when the sun rose they sang, which was worse.  I never saw anything more beautiful than the red-cross nurses, and I guess that is the most beautiful picture I shall ever see--those sweet-faced girls in blue and white bending over the dirty frightened little peasant boys and taking care of their wounds.  I made love to all of them and asked three to marry me.  I was in bed for two days after I got to Athens but had a fine time, as all the officers from the San Francisco, from the admiral down, came to see me, and the minister, consul and the rest did all that could have been done.  I am now all right and was bicycling in the dear old Cascine this morning.  On the whole it was a most successful trip.  Sylvester Scovel and Phillips of The World arrived just as  it was all over, and so Bass and I are about the only two Americans who were in it. The train from Brindisi stopped at Rome on the way back and I went to see the Pages.  They took me out and showed me Rome by moonlight in one hour.  It was like a cinematograph.  They are here now and coming to dinner tonight.  Last night the consul had all our friends to dinner to welcome me back, and maybe I was not glad.  I had been living on cheese and brown bread and cold lamb for two weeks, with no tobacco, and sleeping five hours a night on floors and sofas.  Sometimes the officers and men fought for food, and we never got anything warm to eat except occasionally tinned things which we cooked in my kit.  It was the most satisfactory trip all round I ever had.  I have been twenty years trying to be in a battle and it will be twenty years more before I will want to be in another. On the eighteenth I start for London, stopping one day in Paris to see the Clarks and Eustises.  It is going to be bigger than the Coronation for crowds, and Mother need not worry, I shall keep out of it.  The Minister to Russia sent me word that the Czar&#x27;s prime minister has given him my article and that the Czar said thank him very much.  So that is all right.  Also Hay is to present me to the Prince at the levee on the 3tst of May, and I shall send him a copy, too.  I am looking forward to London with such joy.  Tell Mother to send me the Bookbuyer with her article in it.  I have only read the reviews of it, and they are so enthusiastic that I must have the whole thing quick.  It was such a fine thing to do about Poe, and to give those other two fetishes the coup de grace.  It reads splendidly and I want it all.  What did Dad think of the Inauguration article?  I send you all my dearest love and will have lots to tell you when I get back this time. God bless you all. DICK. Richard left Florence the latter part of May, and went to London where he had made arrangements to report the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee.  He began his round of gayeties by being presented at Court.  The Miss Groves and Miss Wather to whom he refers in the following letter were the clerks at Cox&#x27;s hotel. LONDON, June 2nd, 1897. DEAR FAMILY: I was a beautiful sight at the Levee.  I wore a velvet suit made especially for me but no dearer for that and steel buttons and a beautiful steel sword and a court hat with silver on the side and silk stockings that I wore at Moscow and pumps with great buckles.  I was too magnificent for words and so you would have said.  I waited a long time in a long hall crowded with generals and sea captains and highlanders and volunteers and cavalry men and judges and finally was admitted past a rope and then past another rope and then rushed along into the throne room where I saw beefeaters and life guardsmen and chamberlains with white wands and I gave one my card and he read out &quot;R. H. D. of the United States by the American Ambassador&quot; and then I bowed to the Prince and Duke of York, Connaught and Edinburgh and to the American Ambassador and then Henry White and Spencer Eddy, the two Secretaries and the naval attache all shook hands with me and I went around in a hansom in the bright sunshine in hopes of finding some one who would know me.  But no one did so I went to Cox&#x27;s Hotel and showed myself to Miss Groves and Miss Wather.  I went on the Terrace yesterday with the Leiters and at O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s invitation brought them to tea.  Labouchere was there and Dillon just out of jail and it was most interesting.  I am very, very busy doing nothing and having a fine time-- DICK. LONDON, June 21, 1897. DEAR MOTHER: Words cannot tell at least not unless I am well paid for it what London is like to-day.  In the first place it is so jammed that no one can move and it is hung with decorations so that no one can see.  Royal carriages get stuck just as do the humble drayman or Pickford&#x27;s Van and royalties are lodging in cheap hotels with nothing but a couple of Grenadier&#x27;s in sentry boxes to show they are any better blooded than the rest of the lodgers.  I also added to the confusion by giving a lunch to the Ambassador and Miss Hay in return for the presentation.  Lady Henry and Mrs. Asquith sat on either side of him and Mrs. Clark had Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood to talk to-- There was also Anthony Hope, the beautiful Julia Neilson and her husband Fred Terry and Lady Edward Cecil and Lord Lester-- It went off fine and the Savoy people sent in an American Eagle of ice, decorated with American flags and dripping icy tears from its beak.  It cost me five shillings a head and looked as though it cost that in pounds-- To night I dine with the Goulds and then go to a musical where Melba sings, Padewreski plays and then walk the streets if I can until daybreak as I think of making the night before the procession the greater part of the story.  I send you a plan showing my seat which cost me twenty-five dollars, the advertised price being $125. but there has been a terrible slump in seats.  Love to dear Dad and Nora. DICK. LONDON. 89 Jermyn Street, June 25th, 1897. DEAR MOTHER: The Jubilee turned out to be the easiest spectacle to get at and to get away from that I ever witnessed.  Experience in choosing a place and police regulations made it so simple that we went straight to our seats and got away again without as much trouble as it would have taken to have gone to a matinee.  The stage management of the thing almost impressed me more than anything else.  For grandeur and show it about equalled the procession of the Czar and in many ways it was more interesting because it was concerned with our own people and with our own part of the world.  Next to the Queen, Lord Roberts got all of the applause.  He rode a little white pony that had been with him in six campaigns and had carried him on his march to Candahar.  It had all the campaign medals presented to it by the War Department and wore them in a line on its forehead, and walked just as though he knew what a great occasion it was.  After Roberts came in popularity a Col. Maurice Clifford with the Rhodesian Horse in sombrero&#x27;s and cartridge belts and khaki suits.  He had lost his arm and was easily recognized.  Wilfred Laurier the French Premier of Canada and the Lord Mayor were the other favourites.  The scene in front of St. Paul&#x27;s was ab solutely magnificent with the sooty pillars behind the groups of diplomats, bishops and choir boys in white, University men in pink silk gowns, and soldiers, beef eaters, gentlemen at arms and the two Archbishops.  The best moment was when the collected troops; negroes, Chinamen, East Indians, West Indians, African troopers, Canadian Mounted Police, Australians, Borneo police and English Grenadiers all sang the doxology together in the beautiful sunshine and under the shadow of that great facade of black and white marble.  Also when the Archbishop of Canterbury without any warning suddenly after kissing the Queen&#x27;s hand threw up his arm and cried out so that you could have heard him a hundred yards off &quot;Three Cheers for Her Majesty&quot; and the diplomats, and foreign rajahs and bishops and Salvation Army captains waved their hats and mortar boards and the soldiers ran their bearskins and helmets on their bayonets and spun them around in the air.  The weather was absolutely perfect and there were no accidents.  Last night the carriages were allowed to parade the streets and for hours the route was blocked with omnibuses hired by private parties, coster carts, private carriages, court carriages and the hansoms.  The procession formed by these was two hours in going one mile.  They passed my windows in Jermyn Street for three hours and a party of us sat inside and guyed the life out of them until one in the morning.  We got very clever at it finally and very impudent and as the people were only two yards from us my windows being on a level with the tops of the buses and as we had a flaring illumination that lit up the street completely we had lots of fun with them especially with the busses, as we pretended to believe that the advertisements referred to the people on the top, and we would ask anxiously which lady was &quot;Lottie Collins&quot; and which gentleman had been brought up on &quot; Mellin&#x27;s Food&quot;-- We had even more fun with the swells coming home from the Gala night at the opera and hemmed in between costers and Pickford&#x27;s vans loaded down with women and children. They called on us for speeches and matches and segars and we kept the procession supplied with food and drink.  Nobody got mad and they answered back but we were prepared with numerous repartees and they were apparently so surprised by finding a party of ladies and gentlemen engaged in chaffing court officials that they would forget to reply until they had moved on.  One bus driver said &quot;Oh, you can larff, cause your at &#x27;ome.  We are &#x27;unting for Jensen on a North Pole Expedition.  We won&#x27;t be home for three years yet--&quot; Charley seems very happy and he got a most hearty welcome.  I shall follow him over.  I do not think I shall go when he does as that would mean seeing people and getting settled and I must get the Greek war done by the 12th of July and the Jubilee by the 15th of August.  I know you will not mind, but I have been terribly interrupted by the Jubilee and by so many visitors.  They are running in all the time, so I shall try to get the Greek war article done before I sail and also have a little peaceful view of London.  I have seen nothing of it really yet.  It has been like living in a circus, and moving about on an election night.  I am well as can be except for occasional twinges of sciatica but I have not had to go to bed with it and some times it disappears for a week.  A little less rain and more sun will stop it.  I hope you do not mind my not returning but we will all be together for many months this Fall and I really feel that I have not had a quiet moment here for pleasure and work.  It has been such a rush.  I do wish to see dear Dad.  I am so very sorry about his being ill, and I hope he is having lots of fishing.  Love to all at Marion--and God bless you. RICHARD.</div></div></div><div class="loadMoreContainer_g32O"><button class="loadMoreButton_oUeV">See more</button></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container
