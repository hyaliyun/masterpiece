ENCHIRIDION translated and edited by ALBERT C. OUTLER AUGUSTINE&#x27;S TESTIMONY CONCERNING THE CONFESSIONS I.  THE Retractations, II, 6 (A.D.  427) 1.  My Confessions, in thirteen books, praise the righteous  and good God as they speak either of my evil or good, and they are  meant to excite men&#x27;s minds and affections toward him.  At least  as far as I am concerned, this is what they did for me when they  were being written and they still do this when read.  What some  people think of them is their own affair [ipse viderint];  but I  do know that they have given pleasure to many of my brethren and  still do so.  The first through the tenth books were written about  myself; the other three about Holy Scripture, from what is written  there, In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,[2]  even as far as the reference to the Sabbath rest.[3]       2.  In Book IV, when I confessed my soul&#x27;s misery over the  death of a friend and said that our soul had somehow been made one  out of two souls, &quot;But it may have been that I was afraid to die,  lest he should then die wholly whom I had so greatly loved&quot; (Ch.  VI, 11) -- this now seems to be more a trivial declamation than a  serious confession, although this inept expression may be tempered  somewhat by the &quot;may have been&quot; [forte]  which I added.  And in  Book XIII what I said -- &quot;The firmament was made between the  higher waters (and superior) and the lower (and inferior) waters&quot;  -- was said without sufficient thought.  In any case, the matter  is very obscure.      This work begins thus: &quot;Great art thou, O Lord.&quot;       II.  De Dono Perseverantiae, XX, 53 (A.D.  428) Which of my shorter works has been more widely known or given  greater pleasure than the [thirteen] books of my Confessions?    And, although I published them long before the Pelagian heresy had  even begun to be, it is plain that in them I said to my God, again  and again, &quot;Give what thou commandest and command what thou wilt.&quot;  When these words of mine were repeated in Pelagius&#x27; presence at  Rome by a certain brother of mine (an episcopal colleague), he  could not bear them and contradicted him so excitedly that they  nearly came to a quarrel.  Now what, indeed, does God command,  first and foremost, except that we believe in him?  This faith,  therefore, he himself gives; so that it is well said to him, &quot;Give  what thou commandest.&quot; Moreover, in those same books, concerning  my account of my conversion when God turned me to that faith which  I was laying waste with a very wretched and wild verbal assault,[4  ]do you not remember how the narration shows that I was given as a  gift to the faithful and daily tears of my mother, who had been  promised that I should not perish?  I certainly declared there  that God by his grace turns men&#x27;s wills to the true faith when  they are not only averse to it, but actually adverse.  As for the  other ways in which I sought God&#x27;s aid in my growth in  perseverance, you either know or can review them as you wish (PL,  45, c.  1025).       III.  Letter to Darius (A.D.  429) Thus, my son, take the books of my Confessions and use them  as a good man should -- not superficially, but as a Christian in  Christian charity.  Here see me as I am and do not praise me for  more than I am.  Here believe nothing else about me than my own  testimony.  Here observe what I have been in myself and through  myself.  And if something in me pleases you, here praise Him with  me -- him whom I desire to be praised on my account and not  myself.  &quot;For it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves.&quot;[5]   Indeed, we were ourselves quite lost; but he who made us, remade  us [sed qui fecit, refecit].  As, then, you find me in these  pages, pray for me that I shall not fail but that I may go on to  be perfected.  Pray for me, my son, pray for me! (Epist. CCXXXI,  PL, 33, c.  1025). The Confessions of Saint Augustine BOOK ONE In God&#x27;s searching presence, Augustine undertakes to plumb  the depths of his memory to trace the mysterious pilgrimage of  grace which his life has been -- and to praise God for his  constant and omnipotent grace.  In a mood of sustained prayer, he  recalls what he can of his infancy, his learning to speak, and his  childhood experiences in school.  He concludes with a paean of  grateful praise to God. CHAPTER I 1.  &quot;Great art thou, O Lord, and greatly to be praised; great  is thy power, and infinite is thy wisdom.&quot;[6]  And man desires to  praise thee, for he is a part of thy creation; he bears his  mortality about with him and carries the evidence of his sin and  the proof that thou dost resist the proud.  Still he desires to  praise thee, this man who is only a small part of thy creation.   Thou hast prompted him, that he should delight to praise thee, for  thou hast made us for thyself and restless is our heart until it  comes to rest in thee.  Grant me, O Lord, to know and understand  whether first to invoke thee or to praise thee; whether first to  know thee or call upon thee.  But who can invoke thee, knowing  thee not?  For he who knows thee not may invoke thee as another  than thou art.  It may be that we should invoke thee in order that  we may come to know thee.  But &quot;how shall they call on him in whom  they have not believed?  Or how shall they believe without a  preacher?&quot;[7]  Now, &quot;they shall praise the Lord who seek him,&quot;[8]  for &quot;those who seek shall find him,&quot;[9] and, finding him, shall  praise him.  I will seek thee, O Lord, and call upon thee.  I call  upon thee, O Lord, in my faith which thou hast given me, which  thou hast inspired in me through the humanity of thy Son, and  through the ministry of thy preacher.[10] CHAPTER II 2.  And how shall I call upon my God -- my God and my Lord?   For when I call on him I ask him to come into me.  And what place  is there in me into which my God can come?  How could God, the God  who made both heaven and earth, come into me?  Is there anything  in me, O Lord my God, that can contain thee?  Do even the heaven  and the earth, which thou hast made, and in which thou didst make  me, contain thee?  Is it possible that, since without thee nothing  would be which does exist, thou didst make it so that whatever  exists has some capacity to receive thee?  Why, then, do I ask  thee to come into me, since I also am and could not be if thou  wert not in me?  For I am not, after all, in hell -- and yet thou  art there too, for &quot;if I go down into hell, thou art there.&quot;[11]   Therefore I would not exist -- I would simply not be at all --  unless I exist in thee, from whom and by whom and in whom all  things are.  Even so, Lord; even so.  Where do I call thee to,  when I am already in thee?  Or from whence wouldst thou come into  me?  Where, beyond heaven and earth, could I go that there my God  might come to me -- he who hath said, &quot;I fill heaven and  earth&quot;?[12] CHAPTER III 3.  Since, then, thou dost fill the heaven and earth, do they  contain thee?  Or, dost thou fill and overflow them, because they  cannot contain thee?  And where dost thou pour out what remains of  thee after heaven and earth are full?  Or, indeed, is there no  need that thou, who dost contain all things, shouldst be contained  by any, since those things which thou dost fill thou fillest by  containing them?  For the vessels which thou dost fill do not  confine thee, since even if they were broken, thou wouldst not be  poured out.  And, when thou art poured out on us, thou art not  thereby brought down; rather, we are uplifted.  Thou art not  scattered; rather, thou dost gather us together.  But when thou  dost fill all things, dost thou fill them with thy whole being?   Or, since not even all things together could contain thee  altogether, does any one thing contain a single part, and do all  things contain that same part at the same time?  Do singulars  contain thee singly?  Do greater things contain more of thee, and  smaller things less?  Or, is it not rather that thou art wholly  present everywhere, yet in such a way that nothing contains thee  wholly? CHAPTER IV 4.  What, therefore, is my God?  What, I ask, but the Lord  God?  &quot;For who is Lord but the Lord himself, or who is God besides  our God?&quot;[13]  Most high, most excellent, most potent, most  omnipotent; most merciful and most just; most secret and most  truly present; most beautiful and most strong; stable, yet not  supported; unchangeable, yet changing all things; never new, never  old; making all things new, yet bringing old age upon the proud,  and they know it not; always working, ever at rest; gathering, yet  needing nothing; sustaining, pervading, and protecting; creating,  nourishing, and developing; seeking, and yet possessing all  things.  Thou dost love, but without passion; art jealous, yet  free from care; dost repent without remorse; art angry, yet  remainest serene.  Thou changest thy ways, leaving thy plans  unchanged; thou recoverest what thou hast never really lost.  Thou  art never in need but still thou dost rejoice at thy gains; art  never greedy, yet demandest dividends.  Men pay more than is  required so that thou dost become a debtor; yet who can possess  anything at all which is not already thine?  Thou owest men  nothing, yet payest out to them as if in debt to thy creature, and  when thou dost cancel debts thou losest nothing thereby.  Yet, O  my God, my life, my holy Joy, what is this that I have said?  What  can any man say when he speaks of thee?  But woe to them that keep  silence -- since even those who say most are dumb. CHAPTER V 5.  Who shall bring me to rest in thee?  Who will send thee  into my heart so to overwhelm it that my sins shall be blotted out  and I may embrace thee, my only good?  What art thou to me?  Have  mercy that I may speak.  What am I to thee that thou shouldst  command me to love thee, and if I do it not, art angry and  threatenest vast misery?  Is it, then, a trifling sorrow not to  love thee?  It is not so to me.  Tell me, by thy mercy, O Lord, my  God, what thou art to me.  &quot;Say to my soul, I am your  salvation.&quot;[14]  So speak that I may hear.  Behold, the ears of my  heart are before thee, O Lord; open them and &quot;say to my soul, I am  your salvation.&quot; I will hasten after that voice, and I will lay  hold upon thee.  Hide not thy face from me.  Even if I die, let me  see thy face lest I die.      6.  The house of my soul is too narrow for thee to come in to  me; let it be enlarged by thee.  It is in ruins; do thou restore  it.  There is much about it which must offend thy eyes; I confess  and know it.  But who will cleanse it?  Or, to whom shall I cry  but to thee?  &quot;Cleanse thou me from my secret faults,&quot; O Lord,  &quot;and keep back thy servant from strange sins.&quot;[15]  &quot;I believe,  and therefore do I speak.&quot;[16]  But thou, O Lord, thou knowest.   Have I not confessed my transgressions unto thee, O my God; and  hast thou not put away the iniquity of my heart?[17]  I do not  contend in judgment with thee,[18] who art truth itself; and I  would not deceive myself, lest my iniquity lie even to itself.  I  do not, therefore, contend in judgment with thee, for &quot;if thou,  Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?&quot;[19] CHAPTER VI 7.  Still, dust and ashes as I am, allow me to speak before  thy mercy.  Allow me to speak, for, behold, it is to thy mercy  that I speak and not to a man who scorns me.  Yet perhaps even  thou mightest scorn me; but when thou dost turn and attend to me,  thou wilt have mercy upon me.  For what do I wish to say, O Lord  my God, but that I know not whence I came hither into this life- in-death.  Or should I call it death-in-life?  I do not know.  And  yet the consolations of thy mercy have sustained me from the very  beginning, as I have heard from my fleshly parents, from whom and  in whom thou didst form me in time -- for I cannot myself  remember.  Thus even though they sustained me by the consolation  of woman&#x27;s milk, neither my mother nor my nurses filled their own  breasts but thou, through them, didst give me the food of infancy  according to thy ordinance and thy bounty which underlie all  things.  For it was thou who didst cause me not to want more than  thou gavest and it was thou who gavest to those who nourished me  the will to give me what thou didst give them.  And they, by an  instinctive affection, were willing to give me what thou hadst  supplied abundantly.  It was, indeed, good for them that my good  should come through them, though, in truth, it was not from them  but by them.  For it is from thee, O God, that all good things  come -- and from my God is all my health.  This is what I have  since learned, as thou hast made it abundantly clear by all that I  have seen thee give, both to me and to those around me.  For even  at the very first I knew how to suck, to lie quiet when I was  full, and to cry when in pain -- nothing more.      8.  Afterward I began to laugh -- at first in my sleep, then  when waking.  For this I have been told about myself and I believe  it -- though I cannot remember it -- for I see the same things in  other infants.  Then, little by little, I realized where I was and  wished to tell my wishes to those who might satisfy them, but I  could not!  For my wants were inside me, and they were outside,  and they could not by any power of theirs come into my soul.  And  so I would fling my arms and legs about and cry, making the few  and feeble gestures that I could, though indeed the signs were not  much like what I inwardly desired and when I was not satisfied --  either from not being understood or because what I got was not  good for me -- I grew indignant that my elders were not subject to  me and that those on whom I actually had no claim did not wait on  me as slaves -- and I avenged myself on them by crying.  That  infants are like this, I have myself been able to learn by  watching them; and they, though they knew me not, have shown me  better what I was like than my own nurses who knew me.      9.  And, behold, my infancy died long ago, but I am still  living.  But thou, O Lord, whose life is forever and in whom  nothing dies -- since before the world was, indeed, before all  that can be called &quot;before,&quot; thou wast, and thou art the God and  Lord of all thy creatures; and with thee abide all the stable  causes of all unstable things, the unchanging sources of all  changeable things, and the eternal reasons of all non-rational and  temporal things -- tell me, thy suppliant, O God, tell me, O  merciful One, in pity tell a pitiful creature whether my infancy  followed yet an earlier age of my life that had already passed  away before it.  Was it such another age which I spent in my  mother&#x27;s womb?  For something of that sort has been suggested to  me, and I have myself seen pregnant women.  But what, O God, my  Joy, preceded _that_ period of life?  Was I, indeed, anywhere, or  anybody?  No one can explain these things to me, neither father  nor mother, nor the experience of others, nor my own memory.  Dost  thou laugh at me for asking such things?  Or dost thou command me  to praise and confess unto thee only what I know?      10.  I give thanks to thee, O Lord of heaven and earth,  giving praise to thee for that first being and my infancy of which  I have no memory.  For thou hast granted to man that he should  come to self-knowledge through the knowledge of others, and that  he should believe many things about himself on the authority of  the womenfolk.  Now, clearly, I had life and being; and, as my  infancy closed, I was already learning signs by which my feelings  could be communicated to others.      Whence could such a creature come but from thee, O Lord?  Is  any man skillful enough to have fashioned himself?  Or is there  any other source from which being and life could flow into us,  save this, that thou, O Lord, hast made us -- thou with whom being  and life are one, since thou thyself art supreme being and supreme  life both together.  For thou art infinite and in thee there is no  change, nor an end to this present day -- although there is a  sense in which it ends in thee since all things are in thee and  there would be no such thing as days passing away unless thou  didst sustain them.  And since &quot;thy years shall have no end,&quot;[20]  thy years are an ever-present day.  And how many of ours and our  fathers&#x27; days have passed through this thy day and have received  from it what measure and fashion of being they had?  And all the  days to come shall so receive and so pass away.  &quot;But thou art the  same&quot;![21]  And all the things of tomorrow and the days yet to  come, and all of yesterday and the days that are past, thou wilt  gather into this thy day.  What is it to me if someone does not  understand this?  Let him still rejoice and continue to ask, &quot;What  is this?&quot;  Let him also rejoice and prefer to seek thee, even if  he fails to find an answer, rather than to seek an answer and not  find thee! CHAPTER VII 11.  &quot;Hear me, O God!  Woe to the sins of men!&quot;  When a man  cries thus, thou showest him mercy, for thou didst create the man  but not the sin in him.  Who brings to remembrance the sins of my  infancy?  For in thy sight there is none free from sin, not even  the infant who has lived but a day upon this earth.  Who brings  this to my remembrance?  Does not each little one, in whom I now  observe what I no longer remember of myself?  In what ways, in  that time, did I sin?  Was it that I cried for the breast?  If I  should now so cry -- not indeed for the breast, but for food  suitable to my condition -- I should be most justly laughed at and  rebuked.  What I did then deserved rebuke but, since I could not  understand those who rebuked me, neither custom nor common sense  permitted me to be rebuked.  As we grow we root out and cast away  from us such childish habits.  Yet I have not seen anyone who is  wise who cast away the good when trying to purge the bad.  Nor was  it good, even in that time, to strive to get by crying what, if it  had been given me, would have been hurtful; or to be bitterly  indignant at those who, because they were older -- not slaves,  either, but free -- and wiser than I, would not indulge my  capricious desires.  Was it a good thing for me to try, by  struggling as hard as I could, to harm them for not obeying me,  even when it would have done me harm to have been obeyed?  Thus,  the infant&#x27;s innocence lies in the weakness of his body and not in  the infant mind.  I have myself observed a baby to be jealous,  though it could not speak; it was livid as it watched another  infant at the breast.      Who is ignorant of this?  Mothers and nurses tell us that  they cure these things by I know not what remedies.  But is this  innocence, when the fountain of milk is flowing fresh and  abundant, that another who needs it should not be allowed to share  it, even though he requires such nourishment to sustain his life?   Yet we look leniently on such things, not because they are not  faults, or even small faults, but because they will vanish as the  years pass.  For, although we allow for such things in an infant,  the same things could not be tolerated patiently in an adult.      12.  Therefore, O Lord my God, thou who gavest life to the  infant, and a body which, as we see, thou hast furnished with  senses, shaped with limbs, beautified with form, and endowed with  all vital energies for its well-being and health -- thou dost  command me to praise thee for these things, to give thanks unto  the Lord, and to sing praise unto his name, O Most High.[22]  For  thou art God, omnipotent and good, even if thou hadst done no more  than these things, which no other but thou canst do -- thou alone  who madest all things fair and didst order everything according to  thy law.      I am loath to dwell on this part of my life of which, O Lord,  I have no remembrance, about which I must trust the word of others  and what I can surmise from observing other infants, even if such  guesses are trustworthy.  For it lies in the deep murk of my  forgetfulness and thus is like the period which I passed in my  mother&#x27;s womb.  But if &quot;I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin my  mother nourished me in her womb,&quot;[23] where, I pray thee, O my  God, where, O Lord, or when was I, thy servant, ever innocent?   But see now, I pass over that period, for what have I to do with a  time from which I can recall no memories? CHAPTER VIII 13.  Did I not, then, as I grew out of infancy, come next to  boyhood, or rather did it not come to me and succeed my infancy?   My infancy did not go away (for where would it go?).  It was  simply no longer present; and I was no longer an infant who could  not speak, but now a chattering boy.  I remember this, and I have  since observed how I learned to speak.  My elders did not teach me  words by rote, as they taught me my letters afterward.  But I  myself, when I was unable to communicate all I wished to say to  whomever I wished by means of whimperings and grunts and various  gestures of my limbs (which I used to reinforce my demands), I  myself repeated the sounds already stored in my memory by the mind  which thou, O my God, hadst given me.  When they called some thing  by name and pointed it out while they spoke, I saw it and realized  that the thing they wished to indicate was called by the name they  then uttered.  And what they meant was made plain by the gestures  of their bodies, by a kind of natural language, common to all  nations, which expresses itself through changes of countenance,  glances of the eye, gestures and intonations which indicate a  disposition and attitude -- either to seek or to possess, to  reject or to avoid.  So it was that by frequently hearing words,  in different phrases, I gradually identified the objects which the  words stood for and, having formed my mouth to repeat these signs,  I was thereby able to express my will.  Thus I exchanged with  those about me the verbal signs by which we express our wishes and  advanced deeper into the stormy fellowship of human life,  depending all the while upon the authority of my parents and the  behest of my elders. CHAPTER IX 14.  O my God!  What miseries and mockeries did I then  experience when it was impressed on me that obedience to my  teachers was proper to my boyhood estate if I was to flourish in  this world and distinguish myself in those tricks of speech which  would gain honor for me among men, and deceitful riches!  To this  end I was sent to school to get learning, the value of which I  knew not -- wretch that I was.  Yet if I was slow to learn, I was  flogged.  For this was deemed praiseworthy by our forefathers and  many had passed before us in the same course, and thus had built  up the precedent for the sorrowful road on which we too were  compelled to travel, multiplying labor and sorrow upon the sons of  Adam.  About this time, O Lord, I observed men praying to thee,  and I learned from them to conceive thee -- after my capacity for  understanding as it was then -- to be some great Being, who,  though not visible to our senses, was able to hear and help us.   Thus as a boy I began to pray to thee, my Help and my Refuge, and,  in calling on thee, broke the bands of my tongue.  Small as I was,  I prayed with no slight earnestness that I might not be beaten at  school.  And when thou didst not heed me -- for that would have  been giving me over to my folly -- my elders and even my parents  too, who wished me no ill, treated my stripes as a joke, though  they were then a great and grievous ill to me.      15.  Is there anyone, O Lord, with a spirit so great, who  cleaves to thee with such steadfast affection (or is there even a  kind of obtuseness that has the same effect) -- is there any man  who, by cleaving devoutly to thee, is endowed with so great a  courage that he can regard indifferently those racks and hooks and  other torture weapons from which men throughout the world pray so  fervently to be spared; and can they scorn those who so greatly  fear these torments, just as my parents were amused at the  torments with which our teachers punished us boys?  For we were no  less afraid of our pains, nor did we beseech thee less to escape  them.  Yet, even so, we were sinning by writing or reading or  studying less than our assigned lessons.      For I did not, O Lord, lack memory or capacity, for, by thy  will, I possessed enough for my age.  However, my mind was  absorbed only in play, and I was punished for this by those who  were doing the same things themselves.  But the idling of our  elders is called business; the idling of boys, though quite like  it, is punished by those same elders, and no one pities either the  boys or the men.  For will any common sense observer agree that I  was rightly punished as a boy for playing ball -- just because  this hindered me from learning more quickly those lessons by means  of which, as a man, I could play at more shameful games?  And did  he by whom I was beaten do anything different?  When he was  worsted in some small controversy with a fellow teacher, he was  more tormented by anger and envy than I was when beaten by a  playmate in the ball game. CHAPTER X 16.  And yet I sinned, O Lord my God, thou ruler and creator  of all natural things -- but of sins only the ruler -- I sinned, O  Lord my God, in acting against the precepts of my parents and of  those teachers.  For this learning which they wished me to acquire  -- no matter what their motives were -- I might have put to good  account afterward.  I disobeyed them, not because I had chosen a  better way, but from a sheer love of play.  I loved the vanity of  victory, and I loved to have my ears tickled with lying fables,  which made them itch even more ardently, and a similar curiosity  glowed more and more in my eyes for the shows and sports of my  elders.  Yet those who put on such shows are held in such high  repute that almost all desire the same for their children.  They  are therefore willing to have them beaten, if their childhood  games keep them from the studies by which their parents desire  them to grow up to be able to give such shows.  Look down on these  things with mercy, O Lord, and deliver us who now call upon thee;  deliver those also who do not call upon thee, that they may call  upon thee, and thou mayest deliver them. CHAPTER XI 17.  Even as a boy I had heard of eternal life promised to us  through the humility of the Lord our God, who came down to visit  us in our pride, and I was signed with the sign of his cross, and  was seasoned with his salt even from the womb of my mother, who  greatly trusted in thee.  Thou didst see, O Lord, how, once, while  I was still a child, I was suddenly seized with stomach pains and  was at the point of death -- thou didst see, O my God, for even  then thou wast my keeper, with what agitation and with what faith  I solicited from the piety of my mother and from thy Church (which  is the mother of us all) the baptism of thy Christ, my Lord and my  God.  The mother of my flesh was much perplexed, for, with a heart  pure in thy faith, she was always in deep travail for my eternal  salvation.  If I had not quickly recovered, she would have  provided forthwith for my initiation and washing by thy life- giving sacraments, confessing thee, O Lord Jesus, for the  forgiveness of sins.  So my cleansing was deferred, as if it were  inevitable that, if I should live, I would be further polluted;  and, further, because the guilt contracted by sin after baptism  would be still greater and more perilous.      Thus, at that time, I &quot;believed&quot; along with my mother and the  whole household, except my father.  But he did not overcome the  influence of my mother&#x27;s piety in me, nor did he prevent my  believing in Christ, although he had not yet believed in him.  For  it was her desire, O my God, that I should acknowledge thee as my  Father rather than him.  In this thou didst aid her to overcome  her husband, to whom, though his superior, she yielded obedience.   In this way she also yielded obedience to thee, who dost so  command.      18.  I ask thee, O my God, for I would gladly know if it be  thy will, to what good end my baptism was deferred at that time?   Was it indeed for my good that the reins were slackened, as it  were, to encourage me in sin?  Or, were they not slackened?  If  not, then why is it still dinned into our ears on all sides, &quot;Let  him alone, let him do as he pleases, for he is not yet baptized&quot;?   In the matter of bodily health, no one says, &quot;Let him alone; let  him be worse wounded; for he is not yet cured&quot;!  How much better,  then, would it have been for me to have been cured at once -- and  if thereafter, through the diligent care of friends and myself, my  soul&#x27;s restored health had been kept safe in thy keeping, who gave  it in the first place!  This would have been far better, in truth.   But how many and great the waves of temptation which appeared to  hang over me as I grew out of childhood!  These were foreseen by  my mother, and she preferred that the unformed clay should be  risked to them rather than the clay molded after Christ&#x27;s  image.[24] CHAPTER XII 19.  But in this time of childhood -- which was far less  dreaded for me than my adolescence -- I had no love of learning,  and hated to be driven to it.  Yet I was driven to it just the  same, and good was done for me, even though I did not do it well,  for I would not have learned if I had not been forced to it.  For  no man does well against his will, even if what he does is a good  thing.  Neither did they who forced me do well, but the good that  was done me came from thee, my God.  For they did not care about  the way in which I would use what they forced me to learn, and  took it for granted that it was to satisfy the inordinate desires  of a rich beggary and a shameful glory.  But thou, Lord, by whom  the hairs of our head are numbered, didst use for my good the  error of all who pushed me on to study: but my error in not being  willing to learn thou didst use for my punishment.  And I --  though so small a boy yet so great a sinner -- was not punished  without warrant.  Thus by the instrumentality of those who did not  do well, thou didst well for me; and by my own sin thou didst  justly punish me.  For it is even as thou hast ordained: that  every inordinate affection brings on its own punishment. CHAPTER XIII 20.  But what were the causes for my strong dislike of Greek  literature, which I studied from my boyhood?  Even to this day I  have not fully understood them.  For Latin I loved exceedingly --  not just the rudiments, but what the grammarians teach. For those  beginner&#x27;s lessons in reading, writing, and reckoning, I  considered no less a burden and pain than Greek.  Yet whence came  this, unless from the sin and vanity of this life?  For I was &quot;but  flesh, a wind that passeth away and cometh not again.&quot;[25]  Those  first lessons were better, assuredly, because they were more  certain, and through them I acquired, and still retain, the power  of reading what I find written and of writing for myself what I  will.  In the other subjects, however, I was compelled to learn  about the wanderings of a certain Aeneas, oblivious of my own  wanderings, and to weep for Dido dead, who slew herself for love.   And all this while I bore with dry eyes my own wretched self dying  to thee, O God, my life, in the midst of these things.      21.  For what can be more wretched than the wretch who has no  pity upon himself, who sheds tears over Dido, dead for the love of  Aeneas, but who sheds no tears for his own death in not loving  thee, O God, light of my heart, and bread of the inner mouth of my  soul, O power that links together my mind with my inmost thoughts?   I did not love thee, and thus committed fornication against  thee.[26]  Those around me, also sinning, thus cried out: &quot;Well  done!  Well done!&quot;  The friendship of this world is fornication  against thee; and &quot;Well done!  Well done!&quot;  is cried until one  feels ashamed not to show himself a man in this way.  For my own  condition I shed no tears, though I wept for Dido, who &quot;sought  death at the sword&#x27;s point,&quot;[27] while I myself was seeking the  lowest rung of thy creation, having forsaken thee; earth sinking  back to earth again.  And, if I had been forbidden to read these  poems, I would have grieved that I was not allowed to read what  grieved me.  This sort of madness is considered more honorable and  more fruitful learning than the beginner&#x27;s course in which I  learned to read and write.      22.  But now, O my God, cry unto my soul, and let thy truth  say to me: &quot;Not so, not so!  That first learning was far better.&quot;  For, obviously, I would rather forget the wanderings of Aeneas,  and all such things, than forget how to write and read.  Still,  over the entrance of the grammar school there hangs a veil.  This  is not so much the sign of a covering for a mystery as a curtain  for error.  Let them exclaim against me -- those I no longer fear  -- while I confess to thee, my God, what my soul desires, and let  me find some rest, for in blaming my own evil ways I may come to  love thy holy ways.  Neither let those cry out against me who buy  and sell the baubles of literature.  For if I ask them if it is  true, as the poet says, that Aeneas once came to Carthage, the  unlearned will reply that they do not know and the learned will  deny that it is true.  But if I ask with what letters the name  Aeneas is written, all who have ever learned this will answer  correctly, in accordance with the conventional understanding men  have agreed upon as to these signs.  Again, if I should ask which  would cause the greatest inconvenience in our life, if it were  forgotten: reading and writing, or these poetical fictions, who  does not see what everyone would answer who had not entirely lost  his own memory?  I erred, then, when as a boy I preferred those  vain studies to these more profitable ones, or rather loved the  one and hated the other.  &quot;One and one are two, two and two are  four&quot;: this was then a truly hateful song to me.  But the wooden  horse full of its armed soldiers, and the holocaust of Troy, and  the spectral image of Creusa were all a most delightful -- and  vain -- show![28]      23.  But why, then, did I dislike Greek learning, which was  full of such tales?  For Homer was skillful in inventing such  poetic fictions and is most sweetly wanton; yet when I was a boy,  he was most disagreeable to me.  I believe that Virgil would have  the same effect on Greek boys as Homer did on me if they were  forced to learn him.  For the tedium of learning a foreign  language mingled gall into the sweetness of those Grecian myths.   For I did not understand a word of the language, and yet I was  driven with threats and cruel punishments to learn it.  There was  also a time when, as an infant, I knew no Latin; but this I  acquired without any fear or tormenting, but merely by being alert  to the blandishments of my nurses, the jests of those who smiled  on me, and the sportiveness of those who toyed with me.  I learned  all this, indeed, without being urged by any pressure of  punishment, for my own heart urged me to bring forth its own  fashioning, which I could not do except by learning words: not  from those who taught me but those who talked to me, into whose  ears I could pour forth whatever I could fashion.  From this it is  sufficiently clear that a free curiosity is more effective in  learning than a discipline based on fear.  Yet, by thy ordinance,  O God, discipline is given to restrain the excesses of freedom;  this ranges from the ferule of the schoolmaster to the trials of  the martyr and has the effect of mingling for us a wholesome  bitterness, which calls us back to thee from the poisonous  pleasures that first drew us from thee. CHAPTER XV 24.  Hear my prayer, O Lord; let not my soul faint under thy  discipline, nor let me faint in confessing unto thee thy mercies,  whereby thou hast saved me from all my most wicked ways till thou  shouldst become sweet to me beyond all the allurements that I used  to follow.  Let me come to love thee wholly, and grasp thy hand  with my whole heart that thou mayest deliver me from every  temptation, even unto the last.  And thus, O Lord, my King and my  God, may all things useful that I learned as a boy now be offered  in thy service -- let it be that for thy service I now speak and  write and reckon.  For when I was learning vain things, thou didst  impose thy discipline upon me: and thou hast forgiven me my sin of  delighting in those vanities.  In those studies I learned many a  useful word, but these might have been learned in matters not so  vain; and surely that is the safe way for youths to walk in. CHAPTER XVI 25.  But woe unto you, O torrent of human custom!  Who shall  stay your course?  When will you ever run dry?  How long will you  carry down the sons of Eve into that vast and hideous ocean, which  even those who have the Tree (for an ark)[29] can scarcely pass  over?  Do I not read in you the stories of Jove the thunderer --  and the adulterer?[30]  How could he be both?  But so it says, and  the sham thunder served as a cloak for him to play at real  adultery.  Yet which of our gowned masters will give a tempered  hearing to a man trained in their own schools who cries out and  says: &quot;These were Homer&#x27;s fictions; he transfers things human to  the gods.  I could have wished that he would transfer divine  things to us.&quot;[31]  But it would have been more true if he said,  &quot;These are, indeed, his fictions, but he attributed divine  attributes to sinful men, that crimes might not be accounted  crimes, and that whoever committed such crimes might appear to  imitate the celestial gods and not abandoned men.&quot;      26.  And yet, O torrent of hell, the sons of men are still  cast into you, and they pay fees for learning all these things.   And much is made of it when this goes on in the forum under the  auspices of laws which give a salary over and above the fees.  And  you beat against your rocky shore and roar: &quot;Here words may be  learned; here you can attain the eloquence which is so necessary  to persuade people to your way of thinking; so helpful in  unfolding your opinions.&quot; Verily, they seem to argue that we  should never have understood these words, &quot;golden shower,&quot;  &quot;bosom,&quot; &quot;intrigue,&quot; &quot;highest heavens,&quot; and other such words, if  Terence had not introduced a good-for-nothing youth upon the  stage, setting up a picture of Jove as his example of lewdness and  telling the tale   &quot;Of Jove&#x27;s descending in a golden shower       Into Danae&#x27;s bosom...With a woman to intrigue.&quot;      See how he excites himself to lust, as if by a heavenly  authority, when he says:   &quot;Great Jove,       Who shakes the highest heavens with his thunder;       Shall I, poor mortal man, not do the same?      I&#x27;ve done it, and with all my heart, I&#x27;m glad.&quot;[32]      These words are not learned one whit more easily because of  this vileness, but through them the vileness is more boldly  perpetrated.  I do not blame the words, for they are, as it were,  choice and precious vessels, but I do deplore the wine of error  which was poured out to us by teachers already drunk.  And, unless  we also drank we were beaten, without liberty of appeal to a sober  judge.  And yet, O my God, in whose presence I can now with  security recall this, I learned these things willingly and with  delight, and for it I was called a boy of good promise. CHAPTER XVII 27.  Bear with me, O my God, while I speak a little of those  talents, thy gifts, and of the follies on which I wasted them.   For a lesson was given me that sufficiently disturbed my soul, for  in it there was both hope of praise and fear of shame or stripes.   The assignment was that I should declaim the words of Juno, as she  raged and sorrowed that she could not   &quot;Bar off Italy      From all the approaches of the Teucrian king.&quot;[33]      I had learned that Juno had never uttered these words.  Yet  we were compelled to stray in the footsteps of these poetic  fictions, and to turn into prose what the poet had said in verse.   In the declamation, the boy won most applause who most strikingly  reproduced the passions of anger and sorrow according to the  &quot;character&quot; of the persons presented and who clothed it all in the  most suitable language.  What is it now to me, O my true Life, my  God, that my declaiming was applauded above that of many of my  classmates and fellow students?  Actually, was not all that smoke  and wind?  Besides, was there nothing else on which I could have  exercised my wit and tongue?  Thy praise, O Lord, thy praises  might have propped up the tendrils of my heart by thy Scriptures;  and it would not have been dragged away by these empty trifles, a  shameful prey to the spirits of the air.  For there is more than  one way in which men sacrifice to the fallen angels. CHAPTER XVIII 28.  But it was no wonder that I was thus carried toward  vanity and was estranged from thee, O my God, when men were held  up as models to me who, when relating a deed of theirs -- not in  itself evil -- were covered with confusion if found guilty of a  barbarism or a solecism; but who could tell of their own  licentiousness and be applauded for it, so long as they did it in  a full and ornate oration of well-chosen words.  Thou seest all  this, O Lord, and dost keep silence -- &quot;long-suffering, and  plenteous in mercy and truth&quot;[34] as thou art.  Wilt thou keep  silence forever?  Even now thou drawest from that vast deep the  soul that seeks thee and thirsts after thy delight, whose &quot;heart  said unto thee, ?I have sought thy face; thy face, Lord, will I  seek.&#x27;&quot;[35] For I was far from thy face in the dark shadows of  passion.  For it is not by our feet, nor by change of place, that  we either turn from thee or return to thee.  That younger son did  not charter horses or chariots, or ships, or fly away on visible  wings, or journey by walking so that in the far country he might  prodigally waste all that thou didst give him when he set out.[36]  A kind Father when thou gavest; and kinder still when he returned  destitute!  To be wanton, that is to say, to be darkened in heart  -- this is to be far from thy face.      29.  Look down, O Lord God, and see patiently, as thou art  wont to do, how diligently the sons of men observe the  conventional rules of letters and syllables, taught them by those  who learned their letters beforehand, while they neglect the  eternal rules of everlasting salvation taught by thee.  They carry  it so far that if he who practices or teaches the established  rules of pronunciation should speak (contrary to grammatical  usage) without aspirating the first syllable of &quot;hominem&quot;  [&quot;ominem,&quot; and thus make it &quot;a &#x27;uman being&quot;], he will offend men  more than if he, a human being, were to _hate_ another human being  contrary to thy commandments.  It is as if he should feel that  there is an enemy who could be more destructive to himself than  that hatred which excites him against his fellow man; or that he  could destroy him whom he hates more completely than he destroys  his own soul by this same hatred.  Now, obviously, there is no  knowledge of letters more innate than the writing of conscience --  against doing unto another what one would not have done to  himself.      How mysterious thou art, who &quot;dwellest on high&quot;[37] in  silence.  O thou, the only great God, who by an unwearied law  hurlest down the penalty of blindness to unlawful desire!  When a  man seeking the reputation of eloquence stands before a human  judge, while a thronging multitude surrounds him, and inveighs  against his enemy with the most fierce hatred, he takes most  vigilant heed that his tongue does not slip in a grammatical  error, for example, and say inter hominibus [instead of inter  homines], but he takes no heed lest, in the fury of his spirit, he  cut off a man from his fellow men [ex hominibus].      30.  These were the customs in the midst of which I was cast,  an unhappy boy.  This was the wrestling arena in which I was more  fearful of perpetrating a barbarism than, having done so, of  envying those who had not.  These things I declare and confess to  thee, my God.  I was applauded by those whom I then thought it my  whole duty to please, for I did not perceive the gulf of infamy  wherein I was cast away from thy eyes.For in thy eyes, what was more infamous than I was already,  since I displeased even my own kind and deceived, with endless  lies, my tutor, my masters and parents -- all from a love of play,  a craving for frivolous spectacles, a stage-struck restlessness to  imitate what I saw in these shows?  I pilfered from my parents&#x27;  cellar and table, sometimes driven by gluttony, sometimes just to  have something to give to other boys in exchange for their  baubles, which they were prepared to sell even though they liked  them as well as I.  Moreover, in this kind of play, I often sought  dishonest victories, being myself conquered by the vain desire for  pre-eminence.  And what was I so unwilling to endure, and what was  it that I censured so violently when I caught anyone, except the  very things I did to others?  And, when I was myself detected and  censured, I preferred to quarrel rather than to yield.  Is this  the innocence of childhood?  It is not, O Lord, it is not.  I  entreat thy mercy, O my God, for these same sins as we grow older  are transferred from tutors and masters; they pass from nuts and  balls and sparrows, to magistrates and kings, to gold and lands  and slaves, just as the rod is succeeded by more severe  chastisements.  It was, then, the fact of humility in childhood  that thou, O our King, didst approve as a symbol of humility when  thou saidst, &quot;Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.&quot;[38] CHAPTER XIX 31.  However, O Lord, to thee most excellent and most good,  thou Architect and Governor of the universe, thanks would be due  thee, O our God, even if thou hadst not willed that I should  survive my boyhood.  For I existed even then; I lived and felt and  was solicitous about my own well-being -- a trace of that most  mysterious unity from whence I had my being.[39]  I kept watch, by  my inner sense, over the integrity of my outer senses, and even in  these trifles and also in my thoughts about trifles, I learned to  take pleasure in truth.  I was averse to being deceived; I had a  vigorous memory; I was gifted with the power of speech, was  softened by friendship, shunned sorrow, meanness, ignorance.  Is  not such an animated creature as this wonderful and praiseworthy?   But all these are gifts of my God; I did not give them to myself.   Moreover, they are good, and they all together constitute myself.   Good, then, is he that made me, and he is my God; and before him  will I rejoice exceedingly for every good gift which, even as a  boy, I had.  But herein lay my sin, that it was not in him, but in  his creatures -- myself and the rest -- that I sought for  pleasures, honors, and truths.  And I fell thereby into sorrows,  troubles, and errors.  Thanks be to thee, my joy, my pride, my  confidence, my God -- thanks be to thee for thy gifts; but do thou  preserve them in me.  For thus wilt thou preserve me; and those  things which thou hast given me shall be developed and perfected,  and I myself shall be with thee, for from thee is my being. BOOK TWO       He concentrates here on his sixteenth year, a year of idleness,  lust, and adolescent mischief.  The memory of stealing some pears  prompts a deep probing of the motives and aims of sinful acts.  &quot;I  became to myself a wasteland.&quot; CHAPTER I 1.  I wish now to review in memory my past wickedness and the  carnal corruptions of my soul -- not because I still love them,  but that I may love thee, O my God.  For love of thy love I do  this, recalling in the bitterness of self-examination my wicked  ways, that thou mayest grow sweet to me, thou sweetness without  deception!  Thou sweetness happy and assured!  Thus thou mayest  gather me up out of those fragments in which I was torn to pieces,  while I turned away from thee, O Unity, and lost myself among &quot;the  many.&quot;[40]  For as I became a youth, I longed to be satisfied with  worldly things, and I dared to grow wild in a succession of  various and shadowy loves.  My form wasted away, and I became  corrupt in thy eyes, yet I was still pleasing to my own eyes --  and eager to please the eyes of men. CHAPTER II 2.  But what was it that delighted me save to love and to be  loved?  Still I did not keep the moderate way of the love of mind  to mind -- the bright path of friendship.  Instead, the mists of  passion steamed up out of the puddly concupiscence of the flesh,  and the hot imagination of puberty, and they so obscured and  overcast my heart that I was unable to distinguish pure affection  from unholy desire.  Both boiled confusedly within me, and dragged  my unstable youth down over the cliffs of unchaste desires and  plunged me into a gulf of infamy.  Thy anger had come upon me, and  I knew it not.  I had been deafened by the clanking of the chains  of my mortality, the punishment for my soul&#x27;s pride, and I  wandered farther from thee, and thou didst permit me to do so.  I  was tossed to and fro, and wasted, and poured out, and I boiled  over in my fornications -- and yet thou didst hold thy peace, O my  tardy Joy!  Thou didst still hold thy peace, and I wandered still  farther from thee into more and yet more barren fields of sorrow,  in proud dejection and restless lassitude.      3.  If only there had been someone to regulate my disorder  and turn to my profit the fleeting beauties of the things around  me, and to fix a bound to their sweetness, so that the tides of my  youth might have spent themselves upon the shore of marriage!   Then they might have been tranquilized and satisfied with having  children, as thy law prescribes, O Lord -- O thou who dost form  the offspring of our death and art able also with a tender hand to  blunt the thorns which were excluded from thy paradise![41]  For  thy omnipotence is not far from us even when we are far from thee.   Now, on the other hand, I might have given more vigilant heed to  the voice from the clouds: &quot;Nevertheless, such shall have trouble  in the flesh, but I spare you,&quot;[42] and, &quot;It is good for a man not  to touch a woman,&quot;[43] and, &quot;He that is unmarried cares for the  things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he  that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he  may please his wife.&quot;[44]  I should have listened more attentively  to these words, and, thus having been &quot;made a eunuch for the  Kingdom of Heaven&#x27;s sake,&quot;[45] I would have with greater happiness  expected thy embraces.      4.  But, fool that I was, I foamed in my wickedness as the  sea and, forsaking thee, followed the rushing of my own tide, and  burst out of all thy bounds.  But I did not escape thy scourges.   For what mortal can do so?  Thou wast always by me, mercifully  angry and flavoring all my unlawful pleasures with bitter  discontent, in order that I might seek pleasures free from  discontent.  But where could I find such pleasure save in thee, O  Lord -- save in thee, who dost teach us by sorrow, who woundest us  to heal us, and dost kill us that we may not die apart from thee.   Where was I, and how far was I exiled from the delights of thy  house, in that sixteenth year of the age of my flesh, when the  madness of lust held full sway in me -- that madness which grants  indulgence to human shamelessness, even though it is forbidden by  thy laws -- and I gave myself entirely to it?  Meanwhile, my  family took no care to save me from ruin by marriage, for their  sole care was that I should learn how to make a powerful speech  and become a persuasive orator. CHAPTER III 5.  Now, in that year my studies were interrupted.  I had  come back from Madaura, a neighboring city[46] where I had gone to  study grammar and rhetoric; and the money for a further term at  Carthage was being got together for me.  This project was more a  matter of my father&#x27;s ambition than of his means, for he was only  a poor citizen of Tagaste.To whom am I narrating all this?  Not to thee, O my God, but  to my own kind in thy presence -- to that small part of the human  race who may chance to come upon these writings.  And to what end?   That I and all who read them may understand what depths there are  from which we are to cry unto thee.[47]  For what is more surely  heard in thy ear than a confessing heart and a faithful life?Who did not extol and praise my father, because he went quite  beyond his means to supply his son with the necessary expenses for  a far journey in the interest of his education?  For many far  richer citizens did not do so much for their children.  Still,  this same father troubled himself not at all as to how I was  progressing toward thee nor how chaste I was, just so long as I  was skillful in speaking -- no matter how barren I was to thy  tillage, O God, who art the one true and good Lord of my heart,  which is thy field.[48]       6.  During that sixteenth year of my age, I lived with my  parents, having a holiday from school for a time -- this idleness  imposed upon me by my parents&#x27; straitened finances.  The  thornbushes of lust grew rank about my head, and there was no hand  to root them out.  Indeed, when my father saw me one day at the  baths and perceived that I was becoming a man, and was showing the  signs of adolescence, he joyfully told my mother about it as if  already looking forward to grandchildren, rejoicing in that sort  of inebriation in which the world so often forgets thee, its  Creator, and falls in love with thy creature instead of thee --  the inebriation of that invisible wine of a perverted will which  turns and bows down to infamy.  But in my mother&#x27;s breast thou  hadst already begun to build thy temple and the foundation of thy  holy habitation -- whereas my father was only a catechumen, and  that but recently.  She was, therefore, startled with a holy fear  and trembling: for though I had not yet been baptized, she feared  those crooked ways in which they walk who turn their backs to thee  and not their faces.      7.  Woe is me!  Do I dare affirm that thou didst hold thy  peace, O my God, while I wandered farther away from thee?  Didst  thou really then hold thy peace?  Then whose words were they but  thine which by my mother, thy faithful handmaid, thou didst pour  into my ears?  None of them, however, sank into my heart to make  me do anything.  She deplored and, as I remember, warned me  privately with great solicitude, &quot;not to commit fornication; but  above all things never to defile another man&#x27;s wife.&quot; These  appeared to me but womanish counsels, which I would have blushed  to obey.  Yet they were from thee, and I knew it not.  I thought  that thou wast silent and that it was only she who spoke.  Yet it  was through her that thou didst not keep silence toward me; and in  rejecting her counsel I was rejecting thee -- I, her son, &quot;the son  of thy handmaid, thy servant.&quot;[49]  But I did not realize this,  and rushed on headlong with such blindness that, among my friends,  I was ashamed to be less shameless than they, when I heard them  boasting of their disgraceful exploits -- yes, and glorying all  the more the worse their baseness was.  What is worse, I took  pleasure in such exploits, not for the pleasure&#x27;s sake only but  mostly for praise.  What is worthy of vituperation except vice  itself?  Yet I made myself out worse than I was, in order that I  might not go lacking for praise.  And when in anything I had not  sinned as the worst ones in the group, I would still say that I  had done what I had not done, in order not to appear contemptible  because I was more innocent than they; and not to drop in their  esteem because I was more chaste.      8.  Behold with what companions I walked the streets of  Babylon!  I rolled in its mire and lolled about on it, as if on a  bed of spices and precious ointments.  And, drawing me more  closely to the very center of that city, my invisible enemy trod  me down and seduced me, for I was easy to seduce.  My mother had  already fled out of the midst of Babylon[50] and was progressing,  albeit slowly, toward its outskirts.  For in counseling me to  chastity, she did not bear in mind what her husband had told her  about me.  And although she knew that my passions were destructive  even then and dangerous for the future, she did not think they  should be restrained by the bonds of conjugal affection -- if,  indeed, they could not be cut away to the quick.  She took no heed  of this, for she was afraid lest a wife should prove a hindrance  and a burden to my hopes.  These were not her hopes of the world  to come, which my mother had in thee, but the hope of learning,  which both my parents were too anxious that I should acquire -- my  father, because he had little or no thought of thee, and only vain  thoughts for me; my mother, because she thought that the usual  course of study would not only be no hindrance but actually a  furtherance toward my eventual return to thee.  This much I  conjecture, recalling as well as I can the temperaments of my  parents.  Meantime, the reins of discipline were slackened on me,  so that without the restraint of due severity, I might play at  whatsoever I fancied, even to the point of dissoluteness.  And in  all this there was that mist which shut out from my sight the  brightness of thy truth, O my God; and my iniquity bulged out, as  it were, with fatness![51] CHAPTER IV 9.  Theft is punished by thy law, O Lord, and by the law  written in men&#x27;s hearts, which not even ingrained wickedness can  erase.  For what thief will tolerate another thief stealing from  him?  Even a rich thief will not tolerate a poor thief who is  driven to theft by want.  Yet I had a desire to commit robbery,  and did so, compelled to it by neither hunger nor poverty, but  through a contempt for well-doing and a strong impulse to  iniquity.  For I pilfered something which I already had in  sufficient measure, and of much better quality.  I did not desire  to enjoy what I stole, but only the theft and the sin itself.      There was a pear tree close to our own vineyard, heavily  laden with fruit, which was not tempting either for its color or  for its flavor.  Late one night -- having prolonged our games in  the streets until then, as our bad habit was -- a group of young  scoundrels, and I among them, went to shake and rob this tree.  We  carried off a huge load of pears, not to eat ourselves, but to  dump out to the hogs, after barely tasting some of them ourselves.   Doing this pleased us all the more because it was forbidden.  Such  was my heart, O God, such was my heart -- which thou didst pity  even in that bottomless pit.  Behold, now let my heart confess to  thee what it was seeking there, when I was being gratuitously  wanton, having no inducement to evil but the evil itself.  It was  foul, and I loved it.  I loved my own undoing.  I loved my error  -- not that for which I erred but the error itself.  A depraved  soul, falling away from security in thee to destruction in itself,  seeking nothing from the shameful deed but shame itself. CHAPTER V 10.  Now there is a comeliness in all beautiful bodies, and  in gold and silver and all things.  The sense of touch has its own  power to please and the other senses find their proper objects in  physical sensation.  Worldly honor also has its own glory, and so  do the powers to command and to overcome: and from these there  springs up the desire for revenge.  Yet, in seeking these  pleasures, we must not depart from thee, O Lord, nor deviate from  thy law.  The life which we live here has its own peculiar  attractiveness because it has a certain measure of comeliness of  its own and a harmony with all these inferior values.  The bond of  human friendship has a sweetness of its own, binding many souls  together as one.  Yet because of these values, sin is committed,  because we have an inordinate preference for these goods of a  lower order and neglect the better and the higher good --  neglecting thee, O our Lord God, and thy truth and thy law.  For  these inferior values have their delights, but not at all equal to  my God, who hath made them all.  For in him do the righteous  delight and he is the sweetness of the upright in heart.      11.  When, therefore, we inquire why a crime was committed,  we do not accept the explanation unless it appears that there was  the desire to obtain some of those values which we designate  inferior, or else a fear of losing them.  For truly they are  beautiful and comely, though in comparison with the superior and  celestial goods they are abject and contemptible.  A man has  murdered another man -- what was his motive?  Either he desired  his wife or his property or else he would steal to support  himself; or else he was afraid of losing something to him; or  else, having been injured, he was burning to be revenged.  Would a  man commit murder without a motive, taking delight simply in the  act of murder?  Who would believe such a thing?  Even for that  savage and brutal man [Catiline], of whom it was said that he was  gratuitously wicked and cruel, there is still a motive assigned to  his deeds.  &quot;Lest through idleness,&quot; he says, &quot;hand or heart  should grow inactive.&quot;[52]  And to what purpose?  Why, even this:  that, having once got possession of the city through his practice  of his wicked ways, he might gain honors, empire, and wealth, and  thus be exempt from the fear of the laws and from financial  difficulties in supplying the needs of his family -- and from the  consciousness of his own wickedness.  So it seems that even  Catiline himself loved not his own villainies, but something else,  and it was this that gave him the motive for his crimes. CHAPTER VI 12.  What was it in you, O theft of mine, that I, poor  wretch, doted on -- you deed of darkness -- in that sixteenth year  of my age?  Beautiful you were not, for you were a theft.  But are  you anything at all, so that I could analyze the case with you?   Those pears that we stole were fair to the sight because they were  thy creation, O Beauty beyond compare, O Creator of all, O thou  good God -- God the highest good and my true good.[53]  Those  pears were truly pleasant to the sight, but it was not for them  that my miserable soul lusted, for I had an abundance of better  pears.  I stole those simply that I might steal, for, having  stolen them, I threw them away.  My sole gratification in them was  my own sin, which I was pleased to enjoy; for, if any one of these  pears entered my mouth, the only good flavor it had was my sin in  eating it.  And now, O Lord my God, I ask what it was in that  theft of mine that caused me such delight; for behold it had no  beauty of its own -- certainly not the sort of beauty that exists  in justice and wisdom, nor such as is in the mind, memory senses,  and the animal life of man; nor yet the kind that is the glory and  beauty of the stars in their courses; nor the beauty of the earth,  or the sea -- teeming with spawning life, replacing in birth that  which dies and decays.  Indeed, it did not have that false and  shadowy beauty which attends the deceptions of vice.      13.  For thus we see pride wearing the mask of high- spiritedness, although only thou, O God, art high above all.   Ambition seeks honor and glory, whereas only thou shouldst be  honored above all, and glorified forever.  The powerful man seeks  to be feared, because of his cruelty; but who ought really to be  feared but God only?  What can be forced away or withdrawn out of  his power -- when or where or whither or by whom?  The enticements  of the wanton claim the name of love; and yet nothing is more  enticing than thy love, nor is anything loved more healthfully  than thy truth, bright and beautiful above all.  Curiosity prompts  a desire for knowledge, whereas it is only thou who knowest all  things supremely.  Indeed, ignorance and foolishness themselves go  masked under the names of simplicity and innocence; yet there is  no being that has true simplicity like thine, and none is innocent  as thou art.  Thus it is that by a sinner&#x27;s own deeds he is  himself harmed.  Human sloth pretends to long for rest, but what  sure rest is there save in the Lord?  Luxury would fain be called  plenty and abundance; but thou art the fullness and unfailing  abundance of unfading joy.  Prodigality presents a show of  liberality; but thou art the most lavish giver of all good things.   Covetousness desires to possess much; but thou art already the  possessor of all things.  Envy contends that its aim is for  excellence; but what is so excellent as thou?  Anger seeks  revenge; but who avenges more justly than thou?  Fear recoils at  the unfamiliar and the sudden changes which threaten things  beloved, and is wary for its own security; but what can happen  that is unfamiliar or sudden to thee?  Or who can deprive thee of  what thou lovest?  Where, really, is there unshaken security save  with thee?  Grief languishes for things lost in which desire had  taken delight, because it wills to have nothing taken from it,  just as nothing can be taken from thee.      14.  Thus the soul commits fornication when she is turned  from thee,[54] and seeks apart from thee what she cannot find pure  and untainted until she returns to thee.  All things thus imitate  thee -- but pervertedly -- when they separate themselves far from  thee and raise themselves up against thee.  But, even in this act  of perverse imitation, they acknowledge thee to be the Creator of  all nature, and recognize that there is no place whither they can  altogether separate themselves from thee.  What was it, then, that  I loved in that theft?  And wherein was I imitating my Lord, even  in a corrupted and perverted way?  Did I wish, if only by gesture,  to rebel against thy law, even though I had no power to do so  actually -- so that, even as a captive, I might produce a sort of  counterfeit liberty, by doing with impunity deeds that were  forbidden, in a deluded sense of omnipotence?  Behold this servant  of thine, fleeing from his Lord and following a shadow!  O  rottenness!  O monstrousness of life and abyss of death!  Could I  find pleasure only in what was unlawful, and only because it was  unlawful? CHAPTER VII 15.  &quot;What shall I render unto the Lord&quot;[55] for the fact  that while my memory recalls these things my soul no longer fears  them?  I will love thee, O Lord, and thank thee, and confess to  thy name, because thou hast put away from me such wicked and evil  deeds.  To thy grace I attribute it and to thy mercy, that thou  hast melted away my sin as if it were ice.  To thy grace also I  attribute whatsoever of evil I did _not_ commit -- for what might  I not have done, loving sin as I did, just for the sake of  sinning?  Yea, all the sins that I confess now to have been  forgiven me, both those which I committed willfully and those  which, by thy providence, I did not commit.  What man is there  who, when reflecting upon his own infirmity, dares to ascribe his  chastity and innocence to his own powers, so that he should love  thee less -- as if he were in less need of thy mercy in which thou  forgivest the transgressions of those that return to thee?  As for  that man who, when called by thee, obeyed thy voice and shunned  those things which he here reads of me as I recall and confess  them of myself, let him not despise me -- for I, who was sick,  have been healed by the same Physician by whose aid it was that he  did not fall sick, or rather was less sick than I.  And for this  let him love thee just as much -- indeed, all the more -- since he  sees me restored from such a great weakness of sin by the selfsame  Saviour by whom he sees himself preserved from such a weakness. CHAPTER VIII 16.  What profit did I, a wretched one, receive from those  things which, when I remember them now, cause me shame -- above  all, from that theft, which I loved only for the theft&#x27;s sake?   And, as the theft itself was nothing, I was all the more wretched  in that I loved it so.  Yet by myself alone I would not have done  it -- I still recall how I felt about this then -- I could not  have done it alone.  I loved it then because of the companionship  of my accomplices with whom I did it.  I did not, therefore, love  the theft alone -- yet, indeed, it was only the theft that I  loved, for the companionship was nothing.  What is this paradox?   Who is it that can explain it to me but God, who illumines my  heart and searches out the dark corners thereof?  What is it that  has prompted my mind to inquire about it, to discuss and to  reflect upon all this?  For had I at that time loved the pears  that I stole and wished to enjoy them, I might have done so alone,  if I could have been satisfied with the mere act of theft by which  my pleasure was served.  Nor did I need to have that itching of my  own passions inflamed by the encouragement of my accomplices.  But  since the pleasure I got was not from the pears, it was in the  crime itself, enhanced by the companionship of my fellow sinners. CHAPTER IX 17.  By what passion, then, was I animated?  It was  undoubtedly depraved and a great misfortune for me to feel it.   But still, what was it?  &quot;Who can understand his errors?&quot;[56]      We laughed because our hearts were tickled at the thought of  deceiving the owners, who had no idea of what we were doing and  would have strenuously objected.  Yet, again, why did I find such  delight in doing this which I would not have done alone?  Is it  that no one readily laughs alone?  No one does so readily; but  still sometimes, when men are by themselves and no one else is  about, a fit of laughter will overcome them when something very  droll presents itself to their sense or mind.  Yet alone I would  not have done it -- alone I could not have done it at all.      Behold, my God, the lively review of my soul&#x27;s career is laid  bare before thee.  I would not have committed that theft alone.   My pleasure in it was not what I stole but, rather, the act of  stealing.  Nor would I have enjoyed doing it alone -- indeed I  would not have done it!  O friendship all unfriendly!  You strange  seducer of the soul, who hungers for mischief from impulses of  mirth and wantonness, who craves another&#x27;s loss without any desire  for one&#x27;s own profit or revenge -- so that, when they say, &quot;Let&#x27;s  go, let&#x27;s do it,&quot; we are ashamed not to be shameless. CHAPTER X 18.  Who can unravel such a twisted and tangled knottiness?   It is unclean.  I hate to reflect upon it.  I hate to look on it.   But I do long for thee, O Righteousness and Innocence, so  beautiful and comely to all virtuous eyes -- I long for thee with  an insatiable satiety.  With thee is perfect rest, and life  unchanging.  He who enters into thee enters into the joy of his  Lord,[57] and shall have no fear and shall achieve excellence in  the Excellent.  I fell away from thee, O my God, and in my youth I  wandered too far from thee, my true support.  And I became to  myself a wasteland. BOOK THREE The story of his student days in Carthage, his discovery of  Cicero&#x27;s  Hortensius, the enkindling of his philosophical  interest, his infatuation with the Manichean heresy, and his  mother&#x27;s dream which foretold his eventual return to the true  faith and to God. CHAPTER I 1.  I came to Carthage, where a caldron of unholy loves was  seething and bubbling all around me.  I was not in love as yet,  but I was in love with love; and, from a hidden hunger, I hated  myself for not feeling more intensely a sense of hunger.  I was  looking for something to love, for I was in love with loving, and  I hated security and a smooth way, free from snares.  Within me I  had a dearth of that inner food which is thyself, my God --  although that dearth caused me no hunger.  And I remained without  any appetite for incorruptible food -- not because I was already  filled with it, but because the emptier I became the more I  loathed it.  Because of this my soul was unhealthy; and, full of  sores, it exuded itself forth, itching to be scratched by scraping  on the things of the senses.[58]  Yet, had these things no soul,  they would certainly not inspire our love.      To love and to be loved was sweet to me, and all the more  when I gained the enjoyment of the body of the person I loved.   Thus I polluted the spring of friendship with the filth of  concupiscence and I dimmed its luster with the slime of lust.   Yet, foul and unclean as I was, I still craved, in excessive  vanity, to be thought elegant and urbane.  And I did fall  precipitately into the love I was longing for.  My God, my mercy,  with how much bitterness didst thou, out of thy infinite goodness,  flavor that sweetness for me!  For I was not only beloved but also  I secretly reached the climax of enjoyment; and yet I was joyfully  bound with troublesome tics, so that I could be scourged with the  burning iron rods of jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and strife. CHAPTER II 2.  Stage plays also captivated me, with their sights full of  the images of my own miseries: fuel for my own fire.  Now, why  does a man like to be made sad by viewing doleful and tragic  scenes, which he himself could not by any means endure?  Yet, as a  spectator, he wishes to experience from them a sense of grief, and  in this very sense of grief his pleasure consists.  What is this  but wretched madness?  For a man is more affected by these actions  the more he is spuriously involved in these affections.  Now, if  he should suffer them in his own person, it is the custom to call  this &quot;misery.&quot; But when he suffers with another, then it is called  &quot;compassion.&quot; But what kind of compassion is it that arises from  viewing fictitious and unreal sufferings?  The spectator is not  expected to aid the sufferer but merely to grieve for him.  And  the more he grieves the more he applauds the actor of these  fictions.  If the misfortunes of the characters -- whether  historical or entirely imaginary -- are represented so as not to  touch the feelings of the spectator, he goes away disgusted and  complaining.  But if his feelings are deeply touched, he sits it  out attentively, and sheds tears of joy.      3.  Tears and sorrow, then, are loved.  Surely every man  desires to be joyful.  And, though no one is willingly miserable,  one may, nevertheless, be pleased to be merciful so that we love  their sorrows because without them we should have nothing to pity.   This also springs from that same vein of friendship.  But whither  does it go?  Whither does it flow?  Why does it run into that  torrent of pitch which seethes forth those huge tides of loathsome  lusts in which it is changed and altered past recognition, being  diverted and corrupted from its celestial purity by its own will?   Shall, then, compassion be repudiated?  By no means!  Let us,  however, love the sorrows of others.  But let us beware of  uncleanness, O my soul, under the protection of my God, the God of  our fathers, who is to be praised and exalted -- let us beware of  uncleanness.  I have not yet ceased to have compassion.  But in  those days in the theaters I sympathized with lovers when they  sinfully enjoyed one another, although this was done fictitiously  in the play.  And when they lost one another, I grieved with them,  as if pitying them, and yet had delight in both grief and pity.   Nowadays I feel much more pity for one who delights in his  wickedness than for one who counts himself unfortunate because he  fails to obtain some harmful pleasure or suffers the loss of some  miserable felicity.  This, surely, is the truer compassion, but  the sorrow I feel in it has no delight for me.  For although he  that grieves with the unhappy should be commended for his work of  love, yet he who has the power of real compassion would still  prefer that there be nothing for him to grieve about.  For if good  will were to be ill will -- which it cannot be -- only then could  he who is truly and sincerely compassionate wish that there were  some unhappy people so that he might commiserate them.  Some grief  may then be justified, but none of it loved.  Thus it is that thou  dost act, O Lord God, for thou lovest souls far more purely than  we do and art more incorruptibly compassionate, although thou art  never wounded by any sorrow.  Now &quot;who is sufficient for these  things?&quot;[59]      4.  But at that time, in my wretchedness, I loved to grieve;  and I sought for things to grieve about.  In another man&#x27;s misery,  even though it was feigned and impersonated on the stage, that  performance of the actor pleased me best and attracted me most  powerfully which moved me to tears.  What marvel then was it that  an unhappy sheep, straying from thy flock and impatient of thy  care, I became infected with a foul disease?  This is the reason  for my love of griefs: that they would not probe into me too  deeply (for I did not love to suffer in myself such things as I  loved to look at), and they were the sort of grief which came from  hearing those fictions, which affected only the surface of my  emotion.  Still, just as if they had been poisoned fingernails,  their scratching was followed by inflammation, swelling,  putrefaction, and corruption.  Such was my life!  But was it life,  O my God? CHAPTER III 5.  And still thy faithful mercy hovered over me from afar.   In what unseemly iniquities did I wear myself out, following a  sacrilegious curiosity, which, having deserted thee, then began to  drag me down into the treacherous abyss, into the beguiling  obedience of devils, to whom I made offerings of my wicked deeds.   And still in all this thou didst not fail to scourge me.  I dared,  even while thy solemn rites were being celebrated inside the walls  of thy church, to desire and to plan a project which merited death  as its fruit.  For this thou didst chastise me with grievous  punishments, but nothing in comparison with my fault, O thou my  greatest mercy, my God, my refuge from those terrible dangers in  which I wandered with stiff neck, receding farther from thee,  loving my own ways and not thine -- loving a vagrant liberty!      6.  Those studies I was then pursuing, generally accounted as  respectable, were aimed at distinction in the courts of law -- to  excel in which, the more crafty I was, the more I should be  praised.  Such is the blindness of men that they even glory in  their blindness.  And by this time I had become a master in the  School of Rhetoric, and I rejoiced proudly in this honor and  became inflated with arrogance.  Still I was relatively sedate, O  Lord, as thou knowest, and had no share in the wreckings of &quot;The  Wreckers&quot;[60] (for this stupid and diabolical name was regarded as  the very badge of gallantry) among whom I lived with a sort of  ashamed embarrassment that I was not even as they were.  But I  lived with them, and at times I was delighted with their  friendship, even when I abhorred their acts (that is, their  &quot;wrecking&quot;) in which they insolently attacked the modesty of  strangers, tormenting them by uncalled-for jeers, gratifying their  mischievous mirth.  Nothing could more nearly resemble the actions  of devils than these fellows.  By what name, therefore, could they  be more aptly called than &quot;wreckers&quot;? -- being themselves wrecked  first, and altogether turned upside down.  They were secretly  mocked at and seduced by the deceiving spirits, in the very acts  by which they amused themselves in jeering and horseplay at the  expense of others. CHAPTER IV 7.  Among such as these, in that unstable period of my life,  I studied the books of eloquence, for it was in eloquence that I  was eager to be eminent, though from a reprehensible and  vainglorious motive, and a delight in human vanity.  In the  ordinary course of study I came upon a certain book of Cicero&#x27;s,  whose language almost all admire, though not his heart.  This  particular book of his contains an exhortation to philosophy and  was called Hortensius.[61]  Now it was this book which quite  definitely changed my whole attitude and turned my prayers toward  thee, O Lord, and gave me new hope and new desires.  Suddenly  every vain hope became worthless to me, and with an incredible  warmth of heart I yearned for an immortality of wisdom and began  now to arise that I might return to thee.  It was not to sharpen  my tongue further that I made use of that book.  I was now  nineteen; my father had been dead two years,[62] and my mother was  providing the money for my study of rhetoric.  What won me in it  [i.e., the Hortensius] was not its style but its substance.      8.  How ardent was I then, my God, how ardent to fly from  earthly things to thee!  Nor did I know how thou wast even then  dealing with me.  For with thee is wisdom.  In Greek the love of  wisdom is called &quot;philosophy,&quot; and it was with this love that that  book inflamed me.  There are some who seduce through philosophy,  under a great, alluring, and honorable name, using it to color and  adorn their own errors.  And almost all who did this, in Cicero&#x27;s  own time and earlier, are censored and pointed out in his book.   In it there is also manifest that most salutary admonition of thy  Spirit, spoken by thy good and pious servant: &quot;Beware lest any man  spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition  of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ:  for in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily.&quot;[63]   Since at that time, as thou knowest, O Light of my heart, the  words of the apostle were unknown to me, I was delighted with  Cicero&#x27;s exhortation, at least enough so that I was stimulated by  it, and enkindled and inflamed to love, to seek, to obtain, to  hold, and to embrace, not this or that sect, but wisdom itself,  wherever it might be.  Only this checked my ardor: that the name  of Christ was not in it.  For this name, by thy mercy, O Lord,  this name of my Saviour thy Son, my tender heart had piously drunk  in, deeply treasured even with my mother&#x27;s milk.  And whatsoever  was lacking that name, no matter how erudite, polished, and  truthful, did not quite take complete hold of me. CHAPTER V 9.  I resolved, therefore, to direct my mind to the Holy  Scriptures, that I might see what they were.  And behold, I saw  something not comprehended by the proud, not disclosed to  children, something lowly in the hearing, but sublime in the  doing, and veiled in mysteries.  Yet I was not of the number of  those who could enter into it or bend my neck to follow its steps.   For then it was quite different from what I now feel.  When I then  turned toward the Scriptures, they appeared to me to be quite  unworthy to be compared with the dignity of Tully.[64]  For my  inflated pride was repelled by their style, nor could the  sharpness of my wit penetrate their inner meaning.  Truly they  were of a sort to aid the growth of little ones, but I scorned to  be a little one and, swollen with pride, I looked upon myself as  fully grown. CHAPTER VI 10.  Thus I fell among men, delirious in their pride, carnal  and voluble, whose mouths were the snares of the devil -- a trap  made out of a mixture of the syllables of thy name and the names  of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the Paraclete.[65]  These names  were never out of their mouths, but only as sound and the clatter  of tongues, for their heart was empty of truth.  Still they cried,  &quot;Truth, Truth,&quot; and were forever speaking the word to me.  But the  thing itself was not in them.  Indeed, they spoke falsely not only  of thee -- who truly art the Truth -- but also about the basic  elements of this world, thy creation.  And, indeed, I should have  passed by the philosophers themselves even when they were speaking  truth concerning thy creatures, for the sake of thy love, O  Highest Good, and my Father, O Beauty of all things beautiful.      O Truth, Truth, how inwardly even then did the marrow of my  soul sigh for thee when, frequently and in manifold ways, in  numerous and vast books, [the Manicheans] sounded out thy name  though it was only a sound!  And in these dishes -- while I  starved for thee -- they served up to me, in thy stead, the sun  and moon thy beauteous works -- but still only thy works and not  thyself; indeed, not even thy first work.  For thy spiritual works  came before these material creations, celestial and shining though  they are.  But I was hungering and thirsting, not even after those  first works of thine, but after thyself the Truth, &quot;with whom is  no variableness, neither shadow of turning.&quot;[66]  Yet they still  served me glowing fantasies in those dishes.  And, truly, it would  have been better to have loved this very sun -- which at least is  true to our sight -- than those illusions of theirs which deceive  the mind through the eye.  And yet because I supposed the  illusions to be from thee I fed on them -- not with avidity, for  thou didst not taste in my mouth as thou art, and thou wast not  these empty fictions.  Neither was I nourished by them, but was  instead exhausted.  Food in dreams appears like our food awake;  yet the sleepers are not nourished by it, for they are asleep.   But the fantasies of the Manicheans were not in any way like thee  as thou hast spoken to me now.  They were simply fantastic and  false.  In comparison to them the actual bodies which we see with  our fleshly sight, both celestial and terrestrial, are far more  certain.  These true bodies even the beasts and birds perceive as  well as we do and they are more certain than the images we form  about them.  And again, we do with more certainty form our  conceptions about them than, from them, we go on by means of them  to imagine of other greater and infinite bodies which have no  existence.  With such empty husks was I then fed, and yet was not  fed.      But thou, my Love, for whom I longed in order that I might be  strong, neither art those bodies that we see in heaven nor art  thou those which we do not see there, for thou hast created them  all and yet thou reckonest them not among thy greatest works.  How  far, then, art thou from those fantasies of mine, fantasies of  bodies which have no real being at all!  The images of those  bodies which actually exist are far more certain than these  fantasies.  The bodies themselves are more certain than the  images, yet even these thou art not.  Thou art not even the soul,  which is the life of bodies; and, clearly, the life of the body is  better than the body itself.  But thou art the life of souls, life  of lives, having life in thyself, and never changing, O Life of my  soul.[67]       11.  Where, then, wast thou and how far from me?  Far,  indeed, was I wandering away from thee, being barred even from the  husks of those swine whom I fed with husks.[68]  For how much  better were the fables of the grammarians and poets than these  snares [of the Manicheans]!  For verses and poems and &quot;the flying  Medea&quot;[69] are still more profitable truly than these men&#x27;s &quot;five  elements,&quot; with their various colors, answering to &quot;the five caves  of darkness&quot;[70] (none of which exist and yet in which they slay  the one who believes in them).  For verses and poems I can turn  into food for the mind, for though I sang about &quot;the flying Medea&quot;  I never believed it, but those other things [the fantasies of the  Manicheans] I did believe.  Woe, woe, by what steps I was dragged  down to &quot;the depths of hell&quot;[71] -- toiling and fuming because of  my lack of the truth, even when I was seeking after thee, my God!   To thee I now confess it, for thou didst have mercy on me when I  had not yet confessed it.  I sought after thee, but not according  to the understanding of the mind, by means of which thou hast  willed that I should excel the beasts, but only after the guidance  of my physical senses.  Thou wast more inward to me than the most  inward part of me; and higher than my highest reach. I came upon  that brazen woman, devoid of prudence, who, in Solomon&#x27;s obscure  parable, sits at the door of the house on a seat and says, &quot;Stolen  waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.&quot;[72]   This woman seduced me, because she found my soul outside its own  door, dwelling on the sensations of my flesh and ruminating on  such food as I had swallowed through these physical senses. CHAPTER VII 12.  For I was ignorant of that other reality, true Being.   And so it was that I was subtly persuaded to agree with these  foolish deceivers when they put their questions to me: &quot;Whence  comes evil?&quot;  and, &quot;Is God limited by a bodily shape, and has he  hairs and nails?&quot;  and, &quot;Are those patriarchs to be esteemed  righteous who had many wives at one time, and who killed men and  who sacrificed living creatures?&quot;  In my ignorance I was much  disturbed over these things and, though I was retreating from the  truth, I appeared to myself to be going toward it, because I did  not yet know that evil was nothing but a privation of good (that,  indeed, it has no being)[73]; and how should I have seen this when  the sight of my eyes went no farther than physical objects, and  the sight of my mind reached no farther than to fantasms?  And I  did not know that God is a spirit who has no parts extended in  length and breadth, whose being has no mass -- for every mass is  less in a part than in a whole -- and if it be an infinite mass it  must be less in such parts as are limited by a certain space than  in its infinity.  It cannot therefore be wholly everywhere as  Spirit is, as God is.  And I was entirely ignorant as to what is  that principle within us by which we are like God, and which is  rightly said in Scripture to be made &quot;after God&#x27;s image.&quot;      13.  Nor did I know that true inner righteousness -- which  does not judge according to custom but by the measure of the most  perfect law of God Almighty -- by which the mores of various  places and times were adapted to those places and times (though  the law itself is the same always and everywhere, not one thing in  one place and another in another).  By this inner righteousness  Abraham and Isaac, and Jacob and Moses and David, and all those  commended by the mouth of God were righteous and were judged  unrighteous only by foolish men who were judging by human judgment  and gauging their judgment of the mores of the whole human race by  the narrow norms of their own mores.  It is as if a man in an  armory, not knowing what piece goes on what part of the body,  should put a greave on his head and a helmet on his shin and then  complain because they did not fit.  Or as if, on some holiday when  afternoon business was forbidden, one were to grumble at not being  allowed to go on selling as it had been lawful for him to do in  the forenoon.  Or, again, as if, in a house, he sees a servant  handle something that the butler is not permitted to touch, or  when something is done behind a stable that would be prohibited in  a dining room, and then a person should be indignant that in one  house and one family the same things are not allowed to every  member of the household.  Such is the case with those who cannot  endure to hear that something was lawful for righteous men in  former times that is not so now; or that God, for certain temporal  reasons, commanded then one thing to them and another now to  these: yet both would be serving the same righteous will.  These  people should see that in one man, one day, and one house,  different things are fit for different members; and a thing that  was formerly lawful may become, after a time, unlawful -- and  something allowed or commanded in one place that is justly  prohibited and punished in another.  Is justice, then, variable  and changeable?  No, but the times over which she presides are not  all alike because they are different times.  But men, whose days  upon the earth are few, cannot by their own perception harmonize  the causes of former ages and other nations, of which they had no  experience, and compare them with these of which they do have  experience; although in one and the same body, or day, or family,  they can readily see that what is suitable for each member,  season, part, and person may differ.  To the one they take  exception; to the other they submit.      14.  These things I did not know then, nor had I observed  their import.  They met my eyes on every side, and I did not see.   I composed poems, in which I was not free to place each foot just  anywhere, but in one meter one way, and in another meter another  way, nor even in any one verse was the same foot allowed in all  places.  Yet the art by which I composed did not have different  principles for each of these different cases, but the same law  throughout.  Still I did not see how, by that righteousness to  which good and holy men submitted, all those things that God had  commanded were gathered, in a far more excellent and sublime way,  into one moral order; and it did not vary in any essential  respect, though it did not in varying times prescribe all things  at once but, rather, distributed and prescribed what was proper  for each. And, being blind, I blamed those pious fathers, not only  for making use of present things as God had commanded and inspired  them to do, but also for foreshadowing things to come, as God  revealed it to them. CHAPTER VIII 15.  Can it ever, at any time or place, be unrighteous for a  man to love God with all his heart, with all his soul, and with  all his mind; and his neighbor as himself?[74]  Similarly,  offenses against nature are everywhere and at all times to be held  in detestation and should be punished.  Such offenses, for  example, were those of the Sodomites; and, even if all nations  should commit them, they would all be judged guilty of the same  crime by the divine law, which has not made men so that they  should ever abuse one another in that way.  For the fellowship  that should be between God and us is violated whenever that nature  of which he is the author is polluted by perverted lust.  But  these offenses against customary morality are to be avoided  according to the variety of such customs.  Thus, what is agreed  upon by convention, and confirmed by custom or the law of any city  or nation, may not be violated at the lawless pleasure of any,  whether citizen or stranger.  For any part that is not consistent  with its whole is unseemly.  Nevertheless, when God commands  anything contrary to the customs or compacts of any nation, even  though it were never done by them before, it is to be done; and if  it has been interrupted, it is to be restored; and if it has never  been established, it is to be established.  For it is lawful for a  king, in the state over which he reigns, to command that which  neither he himself nor anyone before him had commanded.  And if it  cannot be held to be inimical to the public interest to obey him  -- and, in truth, it would be inimical if he were not obeyed,  since obedience to princes is a general compact of human society  -- how much more, then, ought we unhesitatingly to obey God, the  Governor of all his creatures!  For, just as among the authorities  in human society, the greater authority is obeyed before the  lesser, so also must God be above all.      16.  This applies as well to deeds of violence where there is  a real desire to harm another, either by humiliating treatment or  by injury.  Either of these may be done for reasons of revenge, as  one enemy against another, or in order to obtain some advantage  over another, as in the case of the highwayman and the traveler;  else they may be done in order to avoid some other evil, as in the  case of one who fears another; or through envy as, for example, an  unfortunate man harming a happy one just because he is happy; or  they may be done by a prosperous man against someone whom he fears  will become equal to himself or whose equality he resents.  They  may even be done for the mere pleasure in another man&#x27;s pain, as  the spectators of gladiatorial shows or the people who deride and  mock at others.  These are the major forms of iniquity that spring  out of the lust of the flesh, and of the eye, and of power.[75]   Sometimes there is just one; sometimes two together; sometimes all  of them at once.  Thus we live, offending against the Three and  the Seven, that harp of ten strings, thy Decalogue, O God most  high and most sweet.[76]  But now how can offenses of vileness  harm thee who canst not be defiled; or how can deeds of violence  harm thee who canst not be harmed?  Still thou dost punish these  sins which men commit against themselves because, even when they  sin against thee, they are also committing impiety against their  own souls.  Iniquity gives itself the lie, either by corrupting or  by perverting that nature which thou hast made and ordained.  And  they do this by an immoderate use of lawful things; or by lustful  desire for things forbidden, as &quot;against nature&quot;; or when they are  guilty of sin by raging with heart and voice against thee,  rebelling against thee, &quot;kicking against the pricks&quot;[77]; or when  they cast aside respect for human society and take audacious  delight in conspiracies and feuds according to their private likes  and dislikes.      This is what happens whenever thou art forsaken, O Fountain  of Life, who art the one and true Creator and Ruler of the  universe.  This is what happens when through self-willed pride a  part is loved under the false assumption that it is the whole.   Therefore, we must return to thee in humble piety and let thee  purge us from our evil ways, and be merciful to those who confess  their sins to thee, and hear the groanings of the prisoners and  loosen us from those fetters which we have forged for ourselves.   This thou wilt do, provided we do not raise up against thee the  arrogance of a false freedom -- for thus we lose all through  craving more, by loving our own good more than thee, the common  good of all. CHAPTER IX 17.  But among all these vices and crimes and manifold  iniquities, there are also the sins that are committed by men who  are, on the whole, making progress toward the good.  When these  are judged rightly and after the rule of perfection, the sins are  censored but the men are to be commended because they show the  hope of bearing fruit, like the green shoot of the growing corn.   And there are some deeds that resemble vice and crime and yet are  not sin because they offend neither thee, our Lord God, nor social  custom.  For example, when suitable reserves for hard times are  provided, we cannot judge that this is done merely from a hoarding  impulse.  Or, again, when acts are punished by constituted  authority for the sake of correction, we cannot judge that they  are done merely out of a desire to inflict pain.  Thus, many a  deed which is disapproved in man&#x27;s sight may be approved by thy  testimony.  And many a man who is praised by men is condemned --  as thou art witness -- because frequently the deed itself, the  mind of the doer, and the hidden exigency of the situation all  vary among themselves.  But when, contrary to human expectation,  thou commandest something unusual or unthought of -- indeed,  something thou mayest formerly have forbidden, about which thou  mayest conceal the reason for thy command at that particular time;  and even though it may be contrary to the ordinance of some  society of men[78] -- who doubts but that it should be done  because only that society of men is righteous which obeys thee?   But blessed are they who know what thou dost command.  For all  things done by those who obey thee either exhibit something  necessary at that particular time or they foreshow things to come. CHAPTER X 18.  But I was ignorant of all this, and so I mocked those  holy servants and prophets of thine.  Yet what did I gain by  mocking them save to be mocked in turn by thee?  Insensibly and  little by little, I was led on to such follies as to believe that  a fig tree wept when it was plucked and that the sap of the mother  tree was tears.  Notwithstanding this, if a fig was plucked, by  not his own but another man&#x27;s wickedness, some Manichean saint  might eat it, digest it in his stomach, and breathe it out again  in the form of angels.  Indeed, in his prayers he would assuredly  groan and sigh forth particles of God, although these particles of  the most high and true God would have remained bound in that fig  unless they had been set free by the teeth and belly of some  &quot;elect saint&quot;[79]!  And, wretch that I was, I believed that more  mercy was to be shown to the fruits of the earth than unto men,  for whom these fruits were created.  For, if a hungry man -- who  was not a Manichean -- should beg for any food, the morsel that we  gave to him would seem condemned, as it were, to capital  punishment. CHAPTER XI 19.  And now thou didst &quot;stretch forth thy hand from  above&quot;[80] and didst draw up my soul out of that profound darkness  [of Manicheism] because my mother, thy faithful one, wept to thee  on my behalf more than mothers are accustomed to weep for the  bodily deaths of their children.  For by the light of the faith  and spirit which she received from thee, she saw that I was dead.   And thou didst hear her, O Lord, thou didst hear her and despised  not her tears when, pouring down, they watered the earth under her  eyes in every place where she prayed.  Thou didst truly hear her.      For what other source was there for that dream by which thou  didst console her, so that she permitted me to live with her, to  have my meals in the same house at the table which she had begun  to avoid, even while she hated and detested the blasphemies of my  error?  In her dream she saw herself standing on a sort of wooden  rule, and saw a bright youth approaching her, joyous and smiling  at her, while she was grieving and bowed down with sorrow.  But  when he inquired of her the cause of her sorrow and daily weeping  (not to learn from her, but to teach her, as is customary in  visions), and when she answered that it was my soul&#x27;s doom she was  lamenting, he bade her rest content and told her to look and see  that where she was there I was also.  And when she looked she saw  me standing near her on the same rule.      Whence came this vision unless it was that thy ears were  inclined toward her heart?  O thou Omnipotent Good, thou carest  for every one of us as if thou didst care for him only, and so for  all as if they were but one!       20.  And what was the reason for this also, that, when she  told me of this vision, and I tried to put this construction on  it: &quot;that she should not despair of being someday what I was,&quot; she  replied immediately, without hesitation, &quot;No; for it was not told  me that &#x27;where he is, there you shall be&#x27; but &#x27;where you are,  there he will be&#x27;&quot;?  I confess my remembrance of this to thee, O  Lord, as far as I can recall it -- and I have often mentioned it.   Thy answer, given through my watchful mother, in the fact that she  was not disturbed by the plausibility of my false interpretation  but saw immediately what should have been seen -- and which I  certainly had not seen until she spoke -- this answer moved me  more deeply than the dream itself.  Still, by that dream, the joy  that was to come to that pious woman so long after was predicted  long before, as a consolation for her present anguish.      Nearly nine years passed in which I wallowed in the mud of  that deep pit and in the darkness of falsehood, striving often to  rise, but being all the more heavily dashed down.  But all that  time this chaste, pious, and sober widow -- such as thou dost love  -- was now more buoyed up with hope, though no less zealous in her  weeping and mourning; and she did not cease to bewail my case  before thee, in all the hours of her supplication.  Her prayers  entered thy presence, and yet thou didst allow me still to tumble  and toss around in that darkness. CHAPTER XII 21.  Meanwhile, thou gavest her yet another answer, as I  remember -- for I pass over many things, hastening on to those  things which more strongly impel me to confess to thee -- and many  things I have simply forgotten.  But thou gavest her then another  answer, by a priest of thine, a certain bishop reared in thy  Church and well versed in thy books.  When that woman had begged  him to agree to have some discussion with me, to refute my errors,  to help me to unlearn evil and to learn the good[81] -- for it was  his habit to do this when he found people ready to receive it --  he refused, very prudently, as I afterward realized.  For he  answered that I was still unteachable, being inflated with the  novelty of that heresy, and that I had already perplexed divers  inexperienced persons with vexatious questions, as she herself had  told him.  &quot;But let him alone for a time,&quot; he said, &quot;only pray God  for him.  He will of his own accord, by reading, come to discover  what an error it is and how great its impiety is.&quot; He went on to  tell her at the same time how he himself, as a boy, had been given  over to the Manicheans by his misguided mother and not only had  read but had even copied out almost all their books.  Yet he had  come to see, without external argument or proof from anyone else,  how much that sect was to be shunned -- and had shunned it.  When  he had said this she was not satisfied, but repeated more  earnestly her entreaties, and shed copious tears, still beseeching  him to see and talk with me.  Finally the bishop, a little vexed  at her importunity, exclaimed, &quot;Go your way; as you live, it  cannot be that the son of these tears should perish.&quot; As she often  told me afterward, she accepted this answer as though it were a  voice from heaven. BOOK FOUR This is the story of his years among the Manicheans.  It  includes the account of his teaching at Tagaste, his taking a  mistress, the attractions of astrology, the poignant loss of a  friend which leads to a searching analysis of grief and  transience.  He reports on his first book, De pulchro et apto, and  his introduction to Aristotle&#x27;s  Categories and other books of  philosophy and theology, which he mastered with great ease and  little profit. CHAPTER I 1.  During this period of nine years, from my nineteenth year  to my twenty-eighth, I went astray and led others astray.  I was  deceived and deceived others, in varied lustful projects --  sometimes publicly, by the teaching of what men style &quot;the liberal  arts&quot;; sometimes secretly, under the false guise of religion.  In  the one, I was proud of myself; in the other, superstitious; in  all, vain!  In my public life I was striving after the emptiness  of popular fame, going so far as to seek theatrical applause,  entering poetic contests, striving for the straw garlands and the  vanity of theatricals and intemperate desires.  In my private life  I was seeking to be purged from these corruptions of ours by  carrying food to those who were called &quot;elect&quot; and &quot;holy,&quot; which,  in the laboratory of their stomachs, they should make into angels  and gods for us, and by them we might be set free.  These projects  I followed out and practiced with my friends, who were both  deceived with me and by me.  Let the proud laugh at me, and those  who have not yet been savingly cast down and stricken by thee, O  my God.  Nevertheless, I would confess to thee my shame to thy  glory.  Bear with me, I beseech thee, and give me the grace to  retrace in my present memory the devious ways of my past errors  and thus be able to &quot;offer to thee the sacrifice of  thanksgiving.&quot;[82]  For what am I to myself without thee but a  guide to my own downfall?  Or what am I, even at the best, but one  suckled on thy milk and feeding on thee, O Food that never  perishes?[83]  What indeed is any man, seeing that he is but a  man?  Therefore, let the strong and the mighty laugh at us, but  let us who are &quot;poor and needy&quot;[84] confess to thee. CHAPTER II 2.  During those years I taught the art of rhetoric.   Conquered by the desire for gain, I offered for sale speaking  skills with which to conquer others.  And yet, O Lord, thou  knowest that I really preferred to have honest scholars (or what  were esteemed as such) and, without tricks of speech, I taught  these scholars the tricks of speech -- not to be used against the  life of the innocent, but sometimes to save the life of a guilty  man.  And thou, O God, didst see me from afar, stumbling on that  slippery path and sending out some flashes of fidelity amid much  smoke -- guiding those who loved vanity and sought after  lying,[85] being myself their companion.      In those years I had a mistress, to whom I was not joined in  lawful marriage.  She was a woman I had discovered in my wayward  passion, void as it was of understanding, yet she was the only  one; and I remained faithful to her and with her I discovered, by  my own experience, what a great difference there is between the  restraint of the marriage bond contracted with a view to having  children and the compact of a lustful love, where children are  born against the parents&#x27; will -- although once they are born they  compel our love.      3.  I remember too that, when I decided to compete for a  theatrical prize, some magician -- I do not remember him now --  asked me what I would give him to be certain to win.  But I  detested and abominated such filthy mysteries,[86] and answered  &quot;that, even if the garland was of imperishable gold, I would still  not permit a fly to be killed to win it for me.&quot; For he would have  slain certain living creatures in his sacrifices, and by those  honors would have invited the devils to help me.  This evil thing  I refused, but not out of a pure love of thee, O God of my heart,  for I knew not how to love thee because I knew not how to conceive  of anything beyond corporeal splendors.  And does not a soul,  sighing after such idle fictions, commit fornication against thee,  trust in false things, and &quot;feed on the winds&quot;[87]?  But still I  would not have sacrifices offered to devils on my behalf, though I  was myself still offering them sacrifices of a sort by my own  [Manichean] superstition.  For what else is it &quot;to feed on the  winds&quot; but to feed on the devils, that is, in our wanderings to  become their sport and mockery? CHAPTER III 4.  And yet, without scruple, I consulted those other  impostors, whom they call &quot;astrologers&quot; [mathematicos], because  they used no sacrifices and invoked the aid of no spirit for their  divinations.  Still, true Christian piety must necessarily reject  and condemn their art.      It is good to confess to thee and to say, &quot;Have mercy on me;  heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee&quot;[88] -- not to abuse  thy goodness as a license to sin, but to remember the words of the  Lord, &quot;Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing  befall you.&quot;[89]  All this wholesome advice [the astrologers]  labor to destroy when they say, &quot;The cause of your sin is  inevitably fixed in the heavens,&quot; and, &quot;This is the doing of  Venus, or of Saturn, or of Mars&quot; -- all this in order that a man,  who is only flesh and blood and proud corruption, may regard  himself as blameless, while the Creator and Ordainer of heaven and  the stars must bear the blame of our ills and misfortunes.  But  who is this Creator but thou, our God, the sweetness and  wellspring of righteousness, who renderest to every man according  to his works and despisest not &quot;a broken and a contrite  heart&quot;[90]?      5.  There was at that time a wise man, very skillful and  quite famous in medicine.[91]  He was proconsul then, and with his  own hand he placed on my distempered head the crown I had won in a  rhetorical contest.  He did not do this as a physician, however;  and for this distemper &quot;only thou canst heal who resisteth the  proud and giveth grace to the humble.&quot;[92]  But didst thou fail me  in that old man, or forbear from healing my soul?  Actually when I  became better acquainted with him, I used to listen, rapt and  eager, to his words; for, though he spoke in simple language, his  conversation was replete with vivacity, life, and earnestness.  He  recognized from my own talk that I was given to books of the  horoscope-casters, but he, in a kind and fatherly way, advised me  to throw them away and not to spend idly on these vanities care  and labor that might otherwise go into useful things.  He said  that he himself in his earlier years had studied the astrologers&#x27;  art with a view to gaining his living by it as a profession.   Since he had already understood Hippocrates, he was fully  qualified to understand this too.  Yet, he had given it up and  followed medicine for the simple reason that he had discovered  astrology to be utterly false and, as a man of honest character,  he was unwilling to gain his living by beguiling people.  &quot;But  you,&quot; he said, &quot;have the profession of rhetoric to support  yourself by, so that you are following this delusion in free will  and not necessity.  All the more, therefore, you ought to believe  me, since I worked at it to learn the art perfectly because I  wished to gain my living by it.&quot; When I asked him to account for  the fact that many true things are foretold by astrology, he  answered me, reasonably enough, that the force of chance, diffused  through the whole order of nature, brought these things about.   For when a man, by accident, opens the leaves of some poet (who  sang and intended something far different) a verse oftentimes  turns out to be wondrously apposite to the reader&#x27;s present  business.  &quot;It is not to be wondered at,&quot; he continued, &quot;if out of  the human mind, by some higher instinct which does not know what  goes on within itself, an answer should be arrived at, by chance  and not art, which would fit both the business and the action of  the inquirer.&quot;      6.  And thus truly, either by him or through him, thou wast  looking after me.  And thou didst fix all this in my memory so  that afterward I might search it out for myself.      But at that time, neither the proconsul nor my most dear  Nebridius -- a splendid youth and most circumspect, who scoffed at  the whole business of divination -- could persuade me to give it  up, for the authority of the astrological authors influenced me  more than they did.  And, thus far, I had come upon no certain  proof -- such as I sought -- by which it could be shown without  doubt that what had been truly foretold by those consulted came  from accident or chance, and not from the art of the stargazers. CHAPTER IV 7.  In those years, when I first began to teach rhetoric in  my native town, I had gained a very dear friend, about my own age,  who was associated with me in the same studies.  Like myself, he  was just rising up into the flower of youth.  He had grown up with  me from childhood and we had been both school fellows and  playmates.  But he was not then my friend, nor indeed ever became  my friend, in the true sense of the term; for there is no true  friendship save between those thou dost bind together and who  cleave to thee by that love which is &quot;shed abroad in our hearts  through the Holy Spirit who is given to us.&quot;[93]  Still, it was a  sweet friendship, being ripened by the zeal of common studies.   Moreover, I had turned him away from the true faith -- which he  had not soundly and thoroughly mastered as a youth -- and turned  him toward those superstitious and harmful fables which my mother  mourned in me.  With me this man went wandering off in error and  my soul could not exist without him.  But behold thou wast close  behind thy fugitives -- at once a God of vengeance and a Fountain  of mercies, who dost turn us to thyself by ways that make us  marvel.  Thus, thou didst take that man out of this life when he  had scarcely completed one whole year of friendship with me,  sweeter to me than all the sweetness of my life thus far.8.  Who can show forth all thy praise[94] for that which he  has experienced in himself alone?  What was it that thou didst do  at that time, O my God; how unsearchable are the depths of thy  judgments!  For when, sore sick of a fever, he long lay  unconscious in a death sweat and everyone despaired of his  recovery, he was baptized without his knowledge.  And I myself  cared little, at the time, presuming that his soul would retain  what it had taken from me rather than what was done to his  unconscious body.  It turned out, however, far differently, for he  was revived and restored.  Immediately, as soon as I could talk to  him -- and I did this as soon as he was able, for I never left him  and we hung on each other overmuch -- I tried to jest with him,  supposing that he also would jest in return about that baptism  which he had received when his mind and senses were inactive, but  which he had since learned that he had received.  But he recoiled  from me, as if I were his enemy, and, with a remarkable and  unexpected freedom, he admonished me that, if I desired to  continue as his friend, I must cease to say such things.   Confounded and confused, I concealed my feelings till he should  get well and his health recover enough to allow me to deal with  him as I wished.  But he was snatched away from my madness, that  with thee he might be preserved for my consolation.  A few days  after, during my absence, the fever returned and he died.      9.  My heart was utterly darkened by this sorrow and  everywhere I looked I saw death.  My native place was a torture  room to me and my father&#x27;s house a strange unhappiness.  And all  the things I had done with him -- now that he was gone -- became a  frightful torment.  My eyes sought him everywhere, but they did  not see him; and I hated all places because he was not in them,  because they could not say to me, &quot;Look, he is coming,&quot; as they  did when he was alive and absent.  I became a hard riddle to  myself, and I asked my soul why she was so downcast and why this  disquieted me so sorely.[95]  But she did not know how to answer  me.  And if I said, &quot;Hope thou in God,&quot;[96] she very properly  disobeyed me, because that dearest friend she had lost was as an  actual man, both truer and better than the imagined deity she was  ordered to put her hope in.  Nothing but tears were sweet to me  and they took my friend&#x27;s place in my heart&#x27;s desire. CHAPTER V 10.  But now, O Lord, these things are past and time has  healed my wound.  Let me learn from thee, who art Truth, and put  the ear of my heart to thy mouth, that thou mayest tell me why  weeping should be so sweet to the unhappy.  Hast thou -- though  omnipresent -- dismissed our miseries from thy concern?  Thou  abidest in thyself while we are disquieted with trial after trial.   Yet unless we wept in thy ears, there would be no hope for us  remaining.  How does it happen that such sweet fruit is plucked  from the bitterness of life, from groans, tears, sighs, and  lamentations?  Is it the hope that thou wilt hear us that sweetens  it?  This is true in the case of prayer, for in a prayer there is  a desire to approach thee.  But is it also the case in grief for a  lost love, and in the kind of sorrow that had then overwhelmed me?   For I had neither a hope of his coming back to life, nor in all my  tears did I seek this.  I simply grieved and wept, for I was  miserable and had lost my joy.  Or is weeping a bitter thing that  gives us pleasure because of our aversion to the things we once  enjoyed and this only as long as we loathe them? CHAPTER VI 11.  But why do I speak of these things?  Now is not the time  to ask such questions, but rather to confess to thee.  I was  wretched; and every soul is wretched that is fettered in the  friendship of mortal things -- it is torn to pieces when it loses  them, and then realizes the misery which it had even before it  lost them.  Thus it was at that time with me.  I wept most  bitterly, and found a rest in bitterness.  I was wretched, and yet  that wretched life I still held dearer than my friend.  For though  I would willingly have changed it, I was still more unwilling to  lose it than to have lost him.  Indeed, I doubt whether I was  willing to lose it, even for him -- as they tell (unless it be  fiction) of the friendship of Orestes and Pylades[97]; they would  have gladly died for one another, or both together, because not to  love together was worse than death to them.  But a strange kind of  feeling had come over me, quite different from this, for now it  was wearisome to live and a fearful thing to die.  I suppose that  the more I loved him the more I hated and feared, as the most  cruel enemy, that death which had robbed me of him.  I even  imagined that it would suddenly annihilate all men, since it had  had such a power over him.  This is the way I remember it was with  me.      Look into my heart, O God!  Behold and look deep within me,  for I remember it well, O my Hope who cleansest me from the  uncleanness of such affections, directing my eyes toward thee and  plucking my feet out of the snare.  And I marveled that other  mortals went on living since he whom I had loved as if he would  never die was now dead.  And I marveled all the more that I, who  had been a second self to him, could go on living when he was  dead.  Someone spoke rightly of his friend as being &quot;his soul&#x27;s  other half&quot;[98] -- for I felt that my soul and his soul were but  one soul in two bodies.  Consequently, my life was now a horror to  me because I did not want to live as a half self.  But it may have  been that I was afraid to die, lest he should then die wholly whom  I had so greatly loved. CHAPTER VII 12.  O madness that knows not how to love men as they should  be loved!  O foolish man that I was then, enduring with so much  rebellion the lot of every man!  Thus I fretted, sighed, wept,  tormented myself, and took neither rest nor counsel, for I was  dragging around my torn and bloody soul.  It was impatient of my  dragging it around, and yet I could not find a place to lay it  down.  Not in pleasant groves, nor in sport or song, nor in  fragrant bowers, nor in magnificent banquetings, nor in the  pleasures of the bed or the couch; not even in books or poetry did  it find rest.  All things looked gloomy, even the very light  itself.  Whatsoever was not what he was, was now repulsive and  hateful, except my groans and tears, for in those alone I found a  little rest.  But when my soul left off weeping, a heavy burden of  misery weighed me down.  It should have been raised up to thee, O  Lord, for thee to lighten and to lift.  This I knew, but I was  neither willing nor able to do; especially since, in my thoughts  of thee, thou wast not thyself but only an empty fantasm.  Thus my  error was my god.  If I tried to cast off my burden on this  fantasm, that it might find rest there, it sank through the vacuum  and came rushing down again upon me.  Thus I remained to myself an  unhappy lodging where I could neither stay nor leave.  For where  could my heart fly from my heart?  Where could I fly from my own  self?  Where would I not follow myself?  And yet I did flee from  my native place so that my eyes would look for him less in a place  where they were not accustomed to see him.  Thus I left the town  of Tagaste and returned to Carthage. CHAPTER VIII 13.  Time never lapses, nor does it glide at leisure through  our sense perceptions.  It does strange things in the mind.  Lo,  time came and went from day to day, and by coming and going it  brought to my mind other ideas and remembrances, and little by  little they patched me up again with earlier kinds of pleasure and  my sorrow yielded a bit to them.  But yet there followed after  this sorrow, not other sorrows just like it, but the causes of  other sorrows.  For why had that first sorrow so easily penetrated  to the quick except that I had poured out my soul onto the dust,  by loving a man as if he would never die who nevertheless had to  die?  What revived and refreshed me, more than anything else, was  the consolation of other friends, with whom I went on loving the  things I loved instead of thee.  This was a monstrous fable and a  tedious lie which was corrupting my soul with its &quot;itching  ears&quot;[99] by its adulterous rubbing.  And that fable would not die  to me as often as one of my friends died.  And there were other  things in our companionship that took strong hold of my mind: to  discourse and jest with him; to indulge in courteous exchanges; to  read pleasant books together; to trifle together; to be earnest  together; to differ at times without ill-humor, as a man might do  with himself, and even through these infrequent dissensions to  find zest in our more frequent agreements; sometimes teaching,  sometimes being taught; longing for someone absent with impatience  and welcoming the homecomer with joy.  These and similar tokens of  friendship, which spring spontaneously from the hearts of those  who love and are loved in return -- in countenance, tongue, eyes,  and a thousand ingratiating gestures -- were all so much fuel to  melt our souls together, and out of the many made us one. CHAPTER IX 14.  This is what we love in our friends, and we love it so  much that a man&#x27;s conscience accuses itself if he does not love  one who loves him, or respond in love to love, seeking nothing  from the other but the evidences of his love.  This is the source  of our moaning when one dies -- the gloom of sorrow, the steeping  of the heart in tears, all sweetness turned to bitterness -- and  the feeling of death in the living, because of the loss of the  life of the dying.      Blessed is he who loves thee, and who loves his friend in  thee, and his enemy also, for thy sake; for he alone loses none  dear to him, if all are dear in Him who cannot be lost.  And who  is this but our God: the God that created heaven and earth, and  filled them because he created them by filling them up?  None  loses thee but he who leaves thee; and he who leaves thee, where  does he go, or where can he flee but from thee well-pleased to  thee offended?  For where does he not find thy law fulfilled in  his own punishment?  &quot;Thy law is the truth&quot;[100] and thou art  Truth. CHAPTER X 15.  &quot;Turn us again, O Lord God of Hosts, cause thy face to  shine; and we shall be saved.&quot;[101]  For wherever the soul of man  turns itself, unless toward thee, it is enmeshed in sorrows, even  though it is surrounded by beautiful things outside thee and  outside itself.  For lovely things would simply not be unless they  were from thee.  They come to be and they pass away, and by coming  they begin to be, and they grow toward perfection.  Then, when  perfect, they begin to wax old and perish, and, if all do not wax  old, still all perish.  Therefore, when they rise and grow toward  being, the more rapidly they grow to maturity, so also the more  rapidly they hasten back toward nonbeing.  This is the way of  things.  This is the lot thou hast given them, because they are  part of things which do not all exist at the same time, but by  passing away and succeeding each other they all make up the  universe, of which they are all parts.  For example, our speech is  accomplished by sounds which signify meanings, but a meaning is  not complete unless one word passes away, when it has sounded its  part, so that the next may follow after it.  Let my soul praise  thee, in all these things, O God, the Creator of all; but let not  my soul be stuck to these things by the glue of love, through the  senses of the body.  For they go where they were meant to go, that  they may exist no longer.  And they rend the soul with pestilent  desires because she longs to be and yet loves to rest secure in  the created things she loves.  But in these things there is no  resting place to be found.  They do not abide.  They flee away;  and who is he who can follow them with his physical senses?  Or  who can grasp them, even when they are present?  For our physical  sense is slow because it is a physical sense and bears its own  limitations in itself.  The physical sense is quite sufficient for  what it was made to do; but it is not sufficient to stay things  from running their courses from the beginning appointed to the end  appointed.  For in thy word, by which they were created, they hear  their appointed bound: &quot;From there -- to here!&quot; CHAPTER XI 16.  Be not foolish, O my soul, and do not let the tumult of  your vanity deafen the ear of your heart.  Be attentive.  The Word  itself calls you to return, and with him is a place of unperturbed  rest, where love is not forsaken unless it first forsakes.   Behold, these things pass away that others may come to be in their  place.  Thus even this lowest level of unity[102] may be made  complete in all its parts.  &quot;But do I ever pass away?&quot;  asks the  Word of God.  Fix your habitation in him.  O my soul, commit  whatsoever you have to him.  For at long last you are now becoming  tired of deceit.  Commit to truth whatever you have received from  the truth, and you will lose nothing.  What is decayed will  flourish again; your diseases will be healed; your perishable  parts shall be reshaped and renovated, and made whole again in  you.  And these perishable things will not carry you with them  down to where they go when they perish, but shall stand and abide,  and you with them, before God, who abides and continues forever.      17.  Why then, my perverse soul, do you go on following your  flesh?  Instead, let it be converted so as to follow you.   Whatever you feel through it is but partial.  You do not know the  whole, of which sensations are but parts; and yet the parts  delight you.  But if my physical senses had been able to  comprehend the whole -- and had not as a part of their punishment  received only a portion of the whole as their own province -- you  would then desire that whatever exists in the present time should  also pass away so that the whole might please you more.  For what  we speak, you also hear through physical sensation, and yet you  would not wish that the syllables should remain.  Instead, you  wish them to fly past so that others may follow them, and the  whole be heard.  Thus it is always that when any single thing is  composed of many parts which do not coexist simultaneously, the  whole gives more delight than the parts could ever do perceived  separately.  But far better than all this is He who made it all.   He is our God and he does not pass away, for there is nothing to  take his place. CHAPTER XII 18.  If physical objects please you, praise God for them, but  turn back your love to their Creator, lest, in those things which  please you, you displease him.  If souls please you, let them be  loved in God; for in themselves they are mutable, but in him  firmly established -- without him they would simply cease to  exist.  In him, then, let them be loved; and bring along to him  with yourself as many souls as you can, and say to them: &quot;Let us  love him, for he himself created all these, and he is not far away  from them.  For he did not create them, and then go away.  They  are of him and in him.  Behold, there he is, wherever truth is  known.  He is within the inmost heart, yet the heart has wandered  away from him.  Return to your heart, O you transgressors, and  hold fast to him who made you.  Stand with him and you shall stand  fast.  Rest in him and you shall be at rest.  Where do you go  along these rugged paths?  Where are you going?  The good that you  love is from him, and insofar as it is also for him, it is both  good and pleasant.  But it will rightly be turned to bitterness if  whatever comes from him is not rightly loved and if he is deserted  for the love of the creature.  Why then will you wander farther  and farther in these difficult and toilsome ways?  There is no  rest where you seek it.  Seek what you seek; but remember that it  is not where you seek it.  You seek for a blessed life in the land  of death.  It is not there.  For how can there be a blessed life  where life itself is not?&quot;      19.  But our very Life came down to earth and bore our death,  and slew it with the very abundance of his own life.  And,  thundering, he called us to return to him into that secret place  from which he came forth to us -- coming first into the virginal  womb, where the human creature, our mortal flesh, was joined to  him that it might not be forever mortal -- and came &quot;as a  bridegroom coming out his chamber, rejoicing as a strong man to  run a race.&quot;[103]  For he did not delay, but ran through the  world, crying out by words, deeds, death, life, descent, ascension  -- crying aloud to us to return to him.  And he departed from our  sight that we might return to our hearts and find him there.  For  he left us, and behold, he is here.  He could not be with us long,  yet he did not leave us.  He went back to the place that he had  never left, for &quot;the world was made by him.&quot;[104]  In this world  he was, and into this world he came, to save sinners.  To him my  soul confesses, and he heals it, because it had sinned against  him.  O sons of men, how long will you be so slow of heart?  Even  now after Life itself has come down to you, will you not ascend  and live?  But where will you climb if you are already on a  pinnacle and have set your mouth against the heavens?  First come  down that you may climb up, climb up to God.  For you have fallen  by trying to climb against him.  Tell this to the souls you love  that they may weep in the valley of tears, and so bring them along  with you to God, because it is by his spirit that you speak thus  to them, if, as you speak, you burn with the fire of love. CHAPTER XIII 20.  These things I did not understand at that time, and I  loved those inferior beauties, and I was sinking down to the very  depths.  And I said to my friends: &quot;Do we love anything but the  beautiful?  What then is the beautiful?  And what is beauty?  What  is it that allures and unites us to the things we love; for unless  there were a grace and beauty in them, they could not possibly  attract us to them?&quot;  And I reflected on this and saw that in the  objects themselves there is a kind of beauty which comes from  their forming a whole and another kind of beauty that comes from  mutual fitness -- as the harmony of one part of the body with its  whole, or a shoe with a foot, and so on.  And this idea sprang up  in my mind out of my inmost heart, and I wrote some books -- two  or three, I think -- On the Beautiful and the Fitting.[105]  Thou  knowest them, O Lord; they have escaped my memory.  I no longer  have them; somehow they have been mislaid. CHAPTER XIV 21.  What was it, O Lord my God, that prompted me to dedicate  these books to Hierius, an orator of Rome, a man I did not know by  sight but whom I loved for his reputation of learning, in which he  was famous -- and also for some words of his that I had heard  which had pleased me?  But he pleased me more because he pleased  others, who gave him high praise and expressed amazement that a  Syrian, who had first studied Greek eloquence, should thereafter  become so wonderful a Latin orator and also so well versed in  philosophy.  Thus a man we have never seen is commended and loved.   Does a love like this come into the heart of the hearer from the  mouth of him who sings the other&#x27;s praise?  Not so.  Instead, one  catches the spark of love from one who loves.  This is why we love  one who is praised when the eulogist is believed to give his  praise from an unfeigned heart; that is, when he who loves him  praises him.22.  Thus it was that I loved men on the basis of other men&#x27;s  judgment, and not thine, O my God, in whom no man is deceived.   But why is it that the feeling I had for such men was not like my  feeling toward the renowned charioteer, or the great gladiatorial  hunter, famed far and wide and popular with the mob?  Actually, I  admired the orator in a different and more serious fashion, as I  would myself desire to be admired.  For I did not want them to  praise and love me as actors were praised and loved -- although I  myself praise and love them too.  I would prefer being unknown  than known in that way, or even being hated than loved that way.   How are these various influences and divers sorts of loves  distributed within one soul?  What is it that I am in love with in  another which, if I did not hate, I should neither detest nor  repel from myself, seeing that we are equally men?  For it does  not follow that because the good horse is admired by a man who  would not be that horse -- even if he could -- the same kind of  admiration should be given to an actor, who shares our nature.  Do  I then love that in a man, which I also, a man, would hate to be?   Man is himself a great deep.  Thou dost number his very hairs, O  Lord, and they do not fall to the ground without thee, and yet the  hairs of his head are more readily numbered than are his  affections and the movements of his heart.23.  But that orator whom I admired so much was the kind of  man I wished myself to be.  Thus I erred through a swelling pride  and &quot;was carried about with every wind,&quot;[106] but through it all I  was being piloted by thee, though most secretly.  And how is it  that I know -- whence comes my confident confession to thee --  that I loved him more because of the love of those who praised him  than for the things they praised in him?  Because if he had gone  unpraised, and these same people had criticized him and had spoken  the same things of him in a tone of scorn and disapproval, I  should never have been kindled and provoked to love him.  And yet  his qualities would not have been different, nor would he have  been different himself; only the appraisals of the spectators.   See where the helpless soul lies prostrate that is not yet  sustained by the stability of truth!  Just as the breezes of  speech blow from the breast of the opinionated, so also the soul  is tossed this way and that, driven forward and backward, and the  light is obscured to it and the truth not seen.  And yet, there it  is in front of us.  And to me it was a great matter that both my  literary work and my zest for learning should be known by that  man.  For if he approved them, I would be even more fond of him;  but if he disapproved, this vain heart of mine, devoid of thy  steadfastness, would have been offended.  And so I meditated on  the problem &quot;of the beautiful and the fitting&quot; and dedicated my  essay on it to him.  I regarded it admiringly, though no one else  joined me in doing so. CHAPTER XV 24.  But I had not seen how the main point in these great  issues [concerning the nature of beauty] lay really in thy  craftsmanship, O Omnipotent One, &quot;who alone doest great  wonders.&quot;[107]  And so my mind ranged through the corporeal forms,  and I defined and distinguished as &quot;beautiful&quot; that which is so in  itself and as &quot;fit&quot; that which is beautiful in relation to some  other thing.  This argument I supported by corporeal examples.   And I turned my attention to the nature of the mind, but the false  opinions which I held concerning spiritual things prevented me  from seeing the truth.  Still, the very power of truth forced  itself on my gaze, and I turned my throbbing soul away from  incorporeal substance to qualities of line and color and shape,  and, because I could not perceive these with my mind, I concluded  that I could not perceive my mind.  And since I loved the peace  which is in virtue, and hated the discord which is in vice, I  distinguished between the unity there is in virtue and the discord  there is in vice.  I conceived that unity consisted of the  rational soul and the nature of truth and the highest good.  But I  imagined that in the disunity there was some kind of substance of  irrational life and some kind of entity in the supreme evil.  This  evil I thought was not only a substance but real life as well, and  yet I believed that it did not come from thee, O my God, from whom  are all things.  And the first I called a Monad, as if it were a  soul without sex.  The other I called a Dyad, which showed itself  in anger in deeds of violence, in deeds of passion and lust -- but  I did not know what I was talking about.  For I had not understood  nor had I been taught that evil is not a substance at all and that  our soul is not that supreme and unchangeable good.      25.  For just as in violent acts, if the emotion of the soul  from whence the violent impulse springs is depraved and asserts  itself insolently and mutinously -- and just as in the acts of  passion, if the affection of the soul which gives rise to carnal  desires is unrestrained -- so also, in the same way, errors and  false opinions contaminate life if the rational soul itself is  depraved.  Thus it was then with me, for I was ignorant that my  soul had to be enlightened by another light, if it was to be  partaker of the truth, since it is not itself the essence of  truth.  &quot;For thou wilt light my lamp; the Lord my God will lighten  my darkness&quot;[108]; and &quot;of his fullness have we all  received,&quot;[109] for &quot;that was the true Light that lighteth every  man that cometh into the world&quot;[110]; for &quot;in thee there is no  variableness, neither shadow of turning.&quot;[111]      26.  But I pushed on toward thee, and was pressed back by  thee that I might know the taste of death, for &quot;thou resistest the  proud.&quot;[112]  And what greater pride could there be for me than,  with a marvelous madness, to assert myself to be that nature which  thou art?  I was mutable -- this much was clear enough to me  because my very longing to become wise arose out of a wish to  change from worse to better -- yet I chose rather to think thee  mutable than to think that I was not as thou art.  For this reason  I was thrust back; thou didst resist my fickle pride.  Thus I went  on imagining corporeal forms, and, since I was flesh I accused the  flesh, and, since I was &quot;a wind that passes away,&quot;[113] I did not  return to thee but went wandering and wandering on toward those  things that have no being -- neither in thee nor in me, nor in the  body.  These fancies were not created for me by thy truth but  conceived by my own vain conceit out of sensory notions.  And I  used to ask thy faithful children -- my own fellow citizens, from  whom I stood unconsciously exiled -- I used flippantly and  foolishly to ask them, &quot;Why, then, does the soul, which God  created, err?&quot;  But I would not allow anyone to ask me, &quot;Why,  then, does God err?&quot;  I preferred to contend that thy immutable  substance was involved in error through necessity rather than  admit that my own mutable substance had gone astray of its own  free will and had fallen into error as its punishment.      27.  I was about twenty-six or twenty-seven when I wrote  those books, analyzing and reflecting upon those sensory images  which clamored in the ears of my heart.  I was straining those  ears to hear thy inward melody, O sweet Truth, pondering on &quot;the  beautiful and the fitting&quot; and longing to stay and hear thee, and  to rejoice greatly at &quot;the Bridegroom&#x27;s voice.&quot;[114]  Yet I could  not, for by the clamor of my own errors I was hurried outside  myself, and by the weight of my own pride I was sinking ever  lower.  You did not &quot;make me to hear joy and gladness,&quot; nor did  the bones rejoice which were not yet humbled.[115]       28.  And what did it profit me that, when I was scarcely  twenty years old, a book of Aristotle&#x27;s entitled The Ten  Categories[116] fell into my hands?  On the very title of this I  hung as on something great and divine, since my rhetoric master at  Carthage and others who had reputations for learning were always  referring to it with such swelling pride.  I read it by myself and  understood it.  And what did it mean that when I discussed it with  others they said that even with the assistance of tutors -- who  not only explained it orally, but drew many diagrams in the sand  -- they scarcely understood it and could tell me no more about it  than I had acquired in the reading of it by myself alone?  For the  book appeared to me to speak plainly enough about substances, such  as a man; and of their qualities, such as the shape of a man, his  kind, his stature, how many feet high, and his family  relationship, his status, when born, whether he is sitting or  standing, is shod or armed, or is doing something or having  something done to him -- and all the innumerable things that are  classified under these nine categories (of which I have given some  examples) or under the chief category of substance.      29.  What did all this profit me, since it actually hindered  me when I imagined that whatever existed was comprehended within  those ten categories?  I tried to interpret them, O my God, so  that even thy wonderful and unchangeable unity could be understood  as subjected to thy own magnitude or beauty, as if they existed in  thee as their Subject -- as they do in corporeal bodies -- whereas  thou art thyself thy own magnitude and beauty.  A body is not  great or fair because it is a body, because, even if it were less  great or less beautiful, it would still be a body.  But my  conception of thee was falsity, not truth.  It was a figment of my  own misery, not the stable ground of thy blessedness.  For thou  hadst commanded, and it was carried out in me, that the earth  should bring forth briars and thorns for me, and that with heavy  labor I should gain my bread.[117]       30.  And what did it profit me that I could read and  understand for myself all the books I could get in the so-called  &quot;liberal arts,&quot; when I was actually a worthless slave of wicked  lust?  I took delight in them, not knowing the real source of what  it was in them that was true and certain.  For I had my back  toward the light, and my face toward the things on which the light  falls, so that my face, which looked toward the illuminated  things, was not itself illuminated.  Whatever was written in any  of the fields of rhetoric or logic, geometry, music, or  arithmetic, I could understand without any great difficulty and  without the instruction of another man.  All this thou knowest, O  Lord my God, because both quickness in understanding and acuteness  in insight are thy gifts.  Yet for such gifts I made no thank  offering to thee.  Therefore, my abilities served not my profit  but rather my loss, since I went about trying to bring so large a  part of my substance into my own power.  And I did not store up my  strength for thee, but went away from thee into the far country to  prostitute my gifts in disordered appetite.[118]  And what did  these abilities profit me, if I did not put them to good use?  I  did not realize that those arts were understood with great  difficulty, even by the studious and the intelligent, until I  tried to explain them to others and discovered that even the most  proficient in them followed my explanations all too slowly.      31.  And yet what did this profit me, since I still supposed  that thou, O Lord God, the Truth, wert a bright and vast body and  that I was a particle of that body?  O perversity gone too far!   But so it was with me.  And I do not blush, O my God, to confess  thy mercies to me in thy presence, or to call upon thee -- any  more than I did not blush when I openly avowed my blasphemies  before men, and bayed, houndlike, against thee.  What good was it  for me that my nimble wit could run through those studies and  disentangle all those knotty volumes, without help from a human  teacher, since all the while I was erring so hatefully and with  such sacrilege as far as the right substance of pious faith was  concerned?  And what kind of burden was it for thy little ones to  have a far slower wit, since they did not use it to depart from  thee, and since they remained in the nest of thy Church to become  safely fledged and to nourish the wings of love by the food of a  sound faith.      O Lord our God, under the shadow of thy wings let us hope --  defend us and support us.[119]  Thou wilt bear us up when we are  little and even down to our gray hairs thou wilt carry us.  For  our stability, when it is in thee, is stability indeed; but when  it is in ourselves, then it is all unstable.  Our good lives  forever with thee, and when we turn from thee with aversion, we  fall into our own perversion.  Let us now, O Lord, return that we  be not overturned, because with thee our good lives without  blemish -- for our good is thee thyself.  And we need not fear  that we shall find no place to return to because we fell away from  it.  For, in our absence, our home -- which is thy eternity --  does not fall away. BOOK FIVE A year of decision.  Faustus comes to Carthage and Augustine  is disenchanted in his hope for solid demonstration of the truth  of Manichean doctrine.  He decides to flee from his known troubles  at Carthage to troubles yet unknown at Rome.  His experiences at  Rome prove disappointing and he applies for a teaching post at  Milan.  Here he meets Ambrose, who confronts him as an impressive  witness for Catholic Christianity and opens out the possibilities  of the allegorical interpretation of Scripture.  Augustine decides  to become a Christian catechumen. CHAPTER I 1.  Accept this sacrifice of my confessions from the hand of  my tongue.  Thou didst form it and hast prompted it to praise thy  name.  Heal all my bones and let them say, &quot;O Lord, who is like  unto thee?&quot;[120]  It is not that one who confesses to thee  instructs thee as to what goes on within him.  For the closed  heart does not bar thy sight into it, nor does the hardness of our  heart hold back thy hands, for thou canst soften it at will,  either by mercy or in vengeance, &quot;and there is no one who can hide  himself from thy heat.&quot;[121]  But let my soul praise thee, that it  may love thee, and let it confess thy mercies to thee, that it may  praise thee.  Thy whole creation praises thee without ceasing: the  spirit of man, by his own lips, by his own voice, lifted up to  thee; animals and lifeless matter by the mouths of those who  meditate upon them.  Thus our souls may climb out of their  weariness toward thee and lean on those things which thou hast  created and pass through them to thee, who didst create them in a  marvelous way.  With thee, there is refreshment and true strength. CHAPTER II 2.  Let the restless and the unrighteous depart, and flee  away from thee.  Even so, thou seest them and thy eye pierces  through the shadows in which they run.  For lo, they live in a  world of beauty and yet are themselves most foul.  And how have  they harmed thee?  Or in what way have they discredited thy power,  which is just and perfect in its rule even to the last item in  creation?  Indeed, where would they fly when they fled from thy  presence?  Wouldst thou be unable to find them?  But they fled  that they might not see thee, who sawest them; that they might be  blinded and stumble into thee.  But thou forsakest nothing that  thou hast made.  The unrighteous stumble against thee that they  may be justly plagued, fleeing from thy gentleness and colliding  with thy justice, and falling on their own rough paths.  For in  truth they do not know that thou art everywhere; that no place  contains thee, and that only thou art near even to those who go  farthest from thee.  Let them, therefore, turn back and seek thee,  because even if they have abandoned thee, their Creator, thou hast  not abandoned thy creatures.  Let them turn back and seek thee --  and lo, thou art there in their hearts, there in the hearts of  those who confess to thee.  Let them cast themselves upon thee,  and weep on thy bosom, after all their weary wanderings; and thou  wilt gently wipe away their tears.[122]  And they weep the more  and rejoice in their weeping, since thou, O Lord, art not a man of  flesh and blood.  Thou art the Lord, who canst remake what thou  didst make and canst comfort them.  And where was I when I was  seeking thee?  There thou wast, before me; but I had gone away,  even from myself, and I could not find myself, much less thee. CHAPTER III 3.  Let me now lay bare in the sight of God the twenty-ninth  year of my age.  There had just come to Carthage a certain bishop  of the Manicheans, Faustus by name, a great snare of the devil;  and many were entangled by him through the charm of his eloquence.   Now, even though I found this eloquence admirable, I was beginning  to distinguish the charm of words from the truth of things, which  I was eager to learn.  Nor did I consider the dish as much as I  did the kind of meat that their famous Faustus served up to me in  it.  His fame had run before him, as one very skilled in an  honorable learning and pre-eminently skilled in the liberal arts.      And as I had already read and stored up in memory many of the  injunctions of the philosophers, I began to compare some of their  doctrines with the tedious fables of the Manicheans; and it struck  me that the probability was on the side of the philosophers, whose  power reached far enough to enable them to form a fair judgment of  the world, even though they had not discovered the sovereign Lord  of it all.  For thou art great, O Lord, and thou hast respect unto  the lowly, but the proud thou knowest afar off.[123]  Thou drawest  near to none but the contrite in heart, and canst not be found by  the proud, even if in their inquisitive skill they may number the  stars and the sands, and map out the constellations, and trace the  courses of the planets.      4.  For it is by the mind and the intelligence which thou  gavest them that they investigate these things.  They have  discovered much; and have foretold, many years in advance, the  day, the hour, and the extent of the eclipses of those luminaries,  the sun and the moon.  Their calculations did not fail, and it  came to pass as they predicted.  And they wrote down the rules  they had discovered, so that to this day they may be read and from  them may be calculated in what year and month and day and hour of  the day, and at what quarter of its light, either the moon or the  sun will be eclipsed, and it will come to pass just as predicted.   And men who are ignorant in these matters marvel and are amazed;  and those who understand them exult and are exalted.  Both, by an  impious pride, withdraw from thee and forsake thy light.  They  foretell an eclipse of the sun before it happens, but they do not  see their own eclipse which is even now occurring.  For they do  not ask, as religious men should, what is the source of the  intelligence by which they investigate these matters.  Moreover,  when they discover that thou didst make them, they do not give  themselves up to thee that thou mightest preserve what thou hast  made.  Nor do they offer, as sacrifice to thee, what they have  made of themselves.  For they do not slaughter their own pride --  as they do the sacrificial fowls -- nor their own curiosities by  which, like the fishes of the sea, they wander through the unknown  paths of the deep.  Nor do they curb their own extravagances as  they do those of &quot;the beasts of the field,&quot;[124] so that thou, O  Lord, &quot;a consuming fire,&quot;[125] mayest burn up their mortal cares  and renew them unto immortality.5.  They do not know the way which is thy word, by which thou  didst create all the things that are and also the men who measure  them, and the senses by which they perceive what they measure, and  the intelligence whereby they discern the patterns of measure.   Thus they know not that thy wisdom is not a matter of  measure.[126]  But the Only Begotten hath been &quot;made unto us  wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification&quot;[127] and hath been  numbered among us and paid tribute to Caesar.[128]  And they do  not know this &quot;Way&quot; by which they could descend from themselves to  him in order to ascend through him to him.  They did not know this  &quot;Way,&quot; and so they fancied themselves exalted to the stars and the  shining heavens.  And lo, they fell upon the earth, and &quot;their  foolish heart was darkened.&quot;[129]  They saw many true things about  the creature but they do not seek with true piety for the Truth,  the Architect of Creation, and hence they do not find him.  Or, if  they do find him, and know that he is God, they do not glorify him  as God; neither are they thankful but become vain in their  imagination, and say that they themselves are wise, and attribute  to themselves what is thine.  At the same time, with the most  perverse blindness, they wish to attribute to thee their own  quality -- so that they load their lies on thee who art the Truth,  &quot;changing the glory of the incorruptible God for an image of  corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping  things.&quot;[130]  &quot;They exchanged thy truth for a lie, and worshiped  and served the creature rather than the Creator.&quot;[131]       6.  Yet I remembered many a true saying of the philosophers  about the creation, and I saw the confirmation of their  calculations in the orderly sequence of seasons and in the visible  evidence of the stars.  And I compared this with the doctrines of  Mani, who in his voluminous folly wrote many books on these  subjects.  But I could not discover there any account, of either  the solstices or the equinoxes, or the eclipses of the sun and  moon, or anything of the sort that I had learned in the books of  secular philosophy.  But still I was ordered to believe, even  where the ideas did not correspond with -- even when they  contradicted -- the rational theories established by mathematics  and my own eyes, but were very different. CHAPTER IV 7.  Yet, O Lord God of Truth, is any man pleasing to thee  because he knows these things?  No, for surely that man is unhappy  who knows these things and does not know thee.  And that man is  happy who knows thee, even though he does not know these things.   He who knows both thee and these things is not the more blessed  for his learning, for thou only art his blessing, if knowing thee  as God he glorifies thee and gives thanks and does not become vain  in his thoughts.      For just as that man who knows how to possess a tree, and  give thanks to thee for the use of it -- although he may not know  how many feet high it is or how wide it spreads -- is better than  the man who can measure it and count all its branches, but neither  owns it nor knows or loves its Creator: just so is a faithful man  who possesses the world&#x27;s wealth as though he had nothing, and  possesses all things through his union through thee, whom all  things serve, even though he does not know the circlings of the  Great Bear.  Just so it is foolish to doubt that this faithful man  may truly be better than the one who can measure the heavens and  number the stars and weigh the elements, but who is forgetful of  thee &quot;who hast set in order all things in number, weight, and  measure.&quot;[132] CHAPTER V 8.  And who ordered this Mani to write about these things,  knowledge of which is not necessary to piety?  For thou hast said  to man, &quot;Behold, godliness is wisdom&quot;[133] -- and of this he might  have been ignorant, however perfectly he may have known these  other things.  Yet, since he did not know even these other things,  and most impudently dared to teach them, it is clear that he had  no knowledge of piety.  For, even when we have a knowledge of this  worldly lore, it is folly to make a _profession_ of it, when piety  comes from _confession_ to thee.  From piety, therefore, Mani had  gone astray, and all his show of learning only enabled the truly  learned to perceive, from his ignorance of what they knew, how  little he was to be trusted to make plain these more really  difficult matters.  For he did not aim to be lightly esteemed, but  went around trying to persuade men that the Holy Spirit, the  Comforter and Enricher of thy faithful ones, was personally  resident in him with full authority.  And, therefore, when he was  detected in manifest errors about the sky, the stars, the  movements of the sun and moon, even though these things do not  relate to religious doctrine, the impious presumption of the man  became clearly evident; for he not only taught things about which  he was ignorant but also perverted them, and this with pride so  foolish and mad that he sought to claim that his own utterances  were as if they had been those of a divine person.      9.  When I hear of a Christian brother, ignorant of these  things, or in error concerning them, I can tolerate his uninformed  opinion; and I do not see that any lack of knowledge as to the  form or nature of this material creation can do him much harm, as  long as he does not hold a belief in anything which is unworthy of  thee, O Lord, the Creator of all.  But if he thinks that his  secular knowledge pertains to the essence of the doctrine of  piety, or ventures to assert dogmatic opinions in matters in which  he is ignorant -- there lies the injury.  And yet even a weakness  such as this, in the infancy of our faith, is tolerated by our  Mother Charity until the new man can grow up &quot;unto a perfect man,&quot;  and not be &quot;carried away with every wind of doctrine.&quot;[134]      But Mani had presumed to be at once the teacher, author,  guide, and leader of all whom he could persuade to believe this,  so that all who followed him believed that they were following not  an ordinary man but thy Holy Spirit.  And who would not judge that  such great madness, when it once stood convicted of false  teaching, should then be abhorred and utterly rejected?  But I had  not yet clearly decided whether the alternation of day and night,  and of longer and shorter days and nights, and the eclipses of sun  and moon, and whatever else I read about in other books could be  explained consistently with his theories.  If they could have been  so explained, there would still have remained a doubt in my mind  whether the theories were right or wrong.  Yet I was prepared, on  the strength of his reputed godliness, to rest my faith on his  authority. CHAPTER VI 10.  For almost the whole of the nine years that I listened  with unsettled mind to the Manichean teaching I had been looking  forward with unbounded eagerness to the arrival of this Faustus.   For all the other members of the sect that I happened to meet,  when they were unable to answer the questions I raised, always  referred me to his coming.  They promised that, in discussion with  him, these and even greater difficulties, if I had them, would be  quite easily and amply cleared away.  When at last he did come, I  found him to be a man of pleasant speech, who spoke of the very  same things they themselves did, although more fluently and in a  more agreeable style.  But what profit was there to me in the  elegance of my cupbearer, since he could not offer me the more  precious draught for which I thirsted?  My ears had already had  their fill of such stuff, and now it did not seem any better  because it was better expressed nor more true because it was  dressed up in rhetoric; nor could I think the man&#x27;s soul  necessarily wise because his face was comely and his language  eloquent.  But they who extolled him to me were not competent  judges.  They thought him able and wise because his eloquence  delighted them.  At the same time I realized that there is another  kind of man who is suspicious even of truth itself, if it is  expressed in smooth and flowing language.  But thou, O my God,  hadst already taught me in wonderful and marvelous ways, and  therefore I believed -- because it is true -- that thou didst  teach me and that beside thee there is no other teacher of truth,  wherever truth shines forth.  Already I had learned from thee that  because a thing is eloquently expressed it should not be taken to  be as necessarily true; nor because it is uttered with stammering  lips should it be supposed false.  Nor, again, is it necessarily  true because rudely uttered, nor untrue because the language is  brilliant.  Wisdom and folly both are like meats that are  wholesome and unwholesome, and courtly or simple words are like  town-made or rustic vessels -- both kinds of food may be served in  either kind of dish.      11.  That eagerness, therefore, with which I had so long  awaited this man, was in truth delighted with his action and  feeling in a disputation, and with the fluent and apt words with  which he clothed his ideas.  I was delighted, therefore, and I  joined with others -- and even exceeded them -- in exalting and  praising him.  Yet it was a source of annoyance to me that, in his  lecture room, I was not allowed to introduce and raise any of  those questions that troubled me, in a familiar exchange of  discussion with him.  As soon as I found an opportunity for this,  and gained his ear at a time when it was not inconvenient for him  to enter into a discussion with me and my friends, I laid before  him some of my doubts.  I discovered at once that he knew nothing  of the liberal arts except grammar, and that only in an ordinary  way.  He had, however, read some of Tully&#x27;s orations, a very few  books of Seneca, and some of the poets, and such few books of his  own sect as were written in good Latin.  With this meager learning  and his daily practice in speaking, he had acquired a sort of  eloquence which proved the more delightful and enticing because it  was under the direction of a ready wit and a sort of native grace.   Was this not even as I now recall it, O Lord my God, Judge of my  conscience?  My heart and my memory are laid open before thee, who  wast even then guiding me by the secret impulse of thy providence  and wast setting my shameful errors before my face so that I might  see and hate them. CHAPTER VII 12.  For as soon as it became plain to me that Faustus was  ignorant in those arts in which I had believed him eminent, I  began to despair of his being able to clarify and explain all  these perplexities that troubled me -- though I realized that such  ignorance need not have affected the authenticity of his piety, if  he had not been a Manichean.  For their books are full of long  fables about the sky and the stars, the sun and the moon; and I  had ceased to believe him able to show me in any satisfactory  fashion what I so ardently desired: whether the explanations  contained in the Manichean books were better or at least as good  as the mathematical explanations I had read elsewhere.  But when I  proposed that these subjects should be considered and discussed,  he quite modestly did not dare to undertake the task, for he was  aware that he had no knowledge of these things and was not ashamed  to confess it.  For he was not one of those talkative people --  from whom I had endured so much -- who undertook to teach me what  I wanted to know, and then said nothing.  Faustus had a heart  which, if not right toward thee, was at least not altogether false  toward himself; for he was not ignorant of his own ignorance, and  he did not choose to be entangled in a controversy from which he  could not draw back or retire gracefully.  For this I liked him  all the more.  For the modesty of an ingenious mind is a finer  thing than the acquisition of that knowledge I desired; and this I  found to be his attitude toward all abstruse and difficult  questions.      13.  Thus the zeal with which I had plunged into the  Manichean system was checked, and I despaired even more of their  other teachers, because Faustus who was so famous among them had  turned out so poorly in the various matters that puzzled me.  And  so I began to occupy myself with him in the study of his own  favorite pursuit, that of literature, in which I was already  teaching a class as a professor of rhetoric among the young  Carthaginian students.  With Faustus then I read whatever he  himself wished to read, or what I judged suitable to his bent of  mind.  But all my endeavors to make further progress in Manicheism  came completely to an end through my acquaintance with that man.   I did not wholly separate myself from them, but as one who had not  yet found anything better I decided to content myself, for the  time being, with what I had stumbled upon one way or another,  until by chance something more desirable should present itself.   Thus that Faustus who had entrapped so many to their death --  though neither willing nor witting it -- now began to loosen the  snare in which I had been caught.  For thy hands, O my God, in the  hidden design of thy providence did not desert my soul; and out of  the blood of my mother&#x27;s heart, through the tears that she poured  out by day and by night, there was a sacrifice offered to thee for  me, and by marvelous ways thou didst deal with me.  For it was  thou, O my God, who didst it: for &quot;the steps of a man are ordered  by the Lord, and he shall choose his way.&quot;[135]  How shall we  attain salvation without thy hand remaking what it had already  made? CHAPTER VIII 14.  Thou didst so deal with me, therefore, that I was  persuaded to go to Rome and teach there what I had been teaching  at Carthage.  And how I was persuaded to do this I will not omit  to confess to thee, for in this also the profoundest workings of  thy wisdom and thy constant mercy toward us must be pondered and  acknowledged.  I did not wish to go to Rome because of the richer  fees and the higher dignity which my friends promised me there --  though these considerations did affect my decision.  My principal  and almost sole motive was that I had been informed that the  students there studied more quietly and were better kept under the  control of stern discipline, so that they did not capriciously and  impudently rush into the classroom of a teacher not their own --  indeed, they were not admitted at all without the permission of  the teacher.  At Carthage, on the contrary, there was a shameful  and intemperate license among the students.  They burst in rudely  and, with furious gestures, would disrupt the discipline which the  teacher had established for the good of his pupils.  Many outrages  they perpetrated with astounding effrontery, things that would be  punishable by law if they were not sustained by custom.  Thus  custom makes plain that such behavior is all the more worthless  because it allows men to do what thy eternal law never will allow.   They think that they act thus with impunity, though the very  blindness with which they act is their punishment, and they suffer  far greater harm than they inflict.      The manners that I would not adopt as a student I was  compelled as a teacher to endure in others.  And so I was glad to  go where all who knew the situation assured me that such conduct  was not allowed.  But thou, &quot;O my refuge and my portion in the  land of the living,&quot;[136] didst goad me thus at Carthage so that I  might thereby be pulled away from it and change my worldly  habitation for the preservation of my soul.  At the same time,  thou didst offer me at Rome an enticement, through the agency of  men enchanted with this death-in-life -- by their insane conduct  in the one place and their empty promises in the other.  To  correct my wandering footsteps, thou didst secretly employ their  perversity and my own.  For those who disturbed my tranquillity  were blinded by shameful madness and also those who allured me  elsewhere had nothing better than the earth&#x27;s cunning.  And I who  hated actual misery in the one place sought fictitious happiness  in the other.      15.  Thou knewest the cause of my going from one country to  the other, O God, but thou didst not disclose it either to me or  to my mother, who grieved deeply over my departure and followed me  down to the sea.  She clasped me tight in her embrace, willing  either to keep me back or to go with me, but I deceived her,  pretending that I had a friend whom I could not leave until he had  a favorable wind to set sail.  Thus I lied to my mother -- and  such a mother! -- and escaped.  For this too thou didst mercifully  pardon me -- fool that I was -- and didst preserve me from the  waters of the sea for the water of thy grace; so that, when I was  purified by that, the fountain of my mother&#x27;s eyes, from which she  had daily watered the ground for me as she prayed to thee, should  be dried.  And, since she refused to return without me, I  persuaded her, with some difficulty, to remain that night in a  place quite close to our ship, where there was a shrine in memory  of the blessed Cyprian.  That night I slipped away secretly, and  she remained to pray and weep.  And what was it, O Lord, that she  was asking of thee in such a flood of tears but that thou wouldst  not allow me to sail?  But thou, taking thy own secret counsel and  noting the real point to her desire, didst not grant what she was  then asking in order to grant to her the thing that she had always  been asking.      The wind blew and filled our sails, and the shore dropped out  of sight.  Wild with grief, she was there the next morning and  filled thy ears with complaints and groans which thou didst  disregard, although, at the very same time, thou wast using my  longings as a means and wast hastening me on to the fulfillment of  all longing.  Thus the earthly part of her love to me was justly  purged by the scourge of sorrow.  Still, like all mothers --  though even more than others -- she loved to have me with her, and  did not know what joy thou wast preparing for her through my going  away.  Not knowing this secret end, she wept and mourned and saw  in her agony the inheritance of Eve -- seeking in sorrow what she  had brought forth in sorrow.  And yet, after accusing me of  perfidy and cruelty, she still continued her intercessions for me  to thee.  She returned to her own home, and I went on to Rome. CHAPTER IX 16.  And lo, I was received in Rome by the scourge of bodily  sickness; and I was very near to falling into hell, burdened with  all the many and grievous sins I had committed against thee,  myself, and others -- all over and above that fetter of original  sin whereby we all die in Adam.  For thou hadst forgiven me none  of these things in Christ, neither had he abolished by his cross  the enmity[137] that I had incurred from thee through my sins.   For how could he do so by the crucifixion of a phantom, which was  all I supposed him to be?  The death of my soul was as real then  as the death of his flesh appeared to me unreal.  And the life of  my soul was as false, because it was as unreal as the death of his  flesh was real, though I believed it not.      My fever increased, and I was on the verge of passing away  and perishing; for, if I had passed away then, where should I have  gone but into the fiery torment which my misdeeds deserved,  measured by the truth of thy rule?  My mother knew nothing of  this; yet, far away, she went on praying for me.  And thou,  present everywhere, didst hear her where she was and had pity on  me where I was, so that I regained my bodily health, although I  was still disordered in my sacrilegious heart.  For that peril of  death did not make me wish to be baptized.  I was even better  when, as a lad, I entreated baptism of my mother&#x27;s devotion, as I  have already related and confessed.[138]  But now I had since  increased in dishonor, and I madly scoffed at all the purposes of  thy medicine which would not have allowed me, though a sinner such  as I was, to die a double death.  Had my mother&#x27;s heart been  pierced with this wound, it never could have been cured, for I  cannot adequately tell of the love she had for me, or how she  still travailed for me in the spirit with a far keener anguish  than when she bore me in the flesh.      17.  I cannot conceive, therefore, how she could have been  healed if my death (still in my sins) had pierced her inmost love.   Where, then, would have been all her earnest, frequent, and  ceaseless prayers to thee?  Nowhere but with thee.  But couldst  thou, O most merciful God, despise the &quot;contrite and humble  heart&quot;[139] of that pure and prudent widow, who was so constant in  her alms, so gracious and attentive to thy saints, never missing a  visit to church twice a day, morning and evening -- and this not  for vain gossiping, nor old wives&#x27; fables, but in order that she  might listen to thee in thy sermons, and thou to her in her  prayers?  Couldst thou, by whose gifts she was so inspired,  despise and disregard the tears of such a one without coming to  her aid -- those tears by which she entreated thee, not for gold  or silver, and not for any changing or fleeting good, but for the  salvation of the soul of her son?  By no means, O Lord.  It is  certain that thou wast near and wast hearing and wast carrying out  the plan by which thou hadst predetermined it should be done.  Far  be it from thee that thou shouldst have deluded her in those  visions and the answers she had received from thee -- some of  which I have mentioned, and others not -- which she kept in her  faithful heart, and, forever beseeching, urged them on thee as if  they had thy own signature.  For thou, &quot;because thy mercy endureth  forever,&quot;[140] hast so condescended to those whose debts thou hast  pardoned that thou likewise dost become a debtor by thy promises. CHAPTER X 18.  Thou didst restore me then from that illness, and didst  heal the son of thy handmaid in his body, that he might live for  thee and that thou mightest endow him with a better and more  certain health.  After this, at Rome, I again joined those  deluding and deluded &quot;saints&quot;; and not their &quot;hearers&quot; only, such  as the man was in whose house I had fallen sick, but also with  those whom they called &quot;the elect.&quot; For it still seemed to me  &quot;that it is not we who sin, but some other nature sinned in us.&quot;  And it gratified my pride to be beyond blame, and when _I_ did  anything wrong not to have to confess that _I_ had done wrong --  &quot;that thou mightest heal my soul because it had sinned against  thee&quot;[141] -- and I loved to excuse my soul and to accuse  something else inside me (I knew not what) but which was not I.   But, assuredly, it was I, and it was my impiety that had divided  me against myself.  That sin then was all the more incurable  because I did not deem myself a sinner.  It was an execrable  iniquity, O God Omnipotent, that I would have preferred to have  thee defeated in me, to my destruction, than to be defeated by  thee to my salvation.  Not yet, therefore, hadst thou set a watch  upon my mouth and a door around my lips that my heart might not  incline to evil speech, to make excuse for sin with men that work  iniquity.[142]  And, therefore, I continued still in the company  of their &quot;elect.&quot;      19.  But now, hopeless of gaining any profit from that false  doctrine, I began to hold more loosely and negligently even to  those points which I had decided to rest content with, if I could  find nothing better.  I was now half inclined to believe that  those philosophers whom they call &quot;The Academics&quot;[143] were wiser  than the rest in holding that we ought to doubt everything, and in  maintaining that man does not have the power of comprehending any  certain truth, for, although I had not yet understood their  meaning, I was fully persuaded that they thought just as they are  commonly reputed to do.  And I did not fail openly to dissuade my  host from his confidence which I observed that he had in those  fictions of which the works of Mani are full.  For all this, I was  still on terms of more intimate friendship with these people than  with others who were not of their heresy.  I did not indeed defend  it with my former ardor; but my familiarity with that group -- and  there were many of them concealed in Rome at that time[144] --  made me slower to seek any other way.  This was particularly easy  since I had no hope of finding in thy Church the truth from which  they had turned me aside, O Lord of heaven and earth, Creator of  all things visible and invisible.  And it still seemed to me most  unseemly to believe that thou couldst have the form of human flesh  and be bounded by the bodily shape of our limbs.  And when I  desired to meditate on my God, I did not know what to think of but  a huge extended body -- for what did not have bodily extension did  not seem to me to exist -- and this was the greatest and almost  the sole cause of my unavoidable errors.      20.  And thus I also believed that evil was a similar kind of  substance, and that it had its own hideous and deformed extended  body -- either in a dense form which they called the earth or in a  thin and subtle form as, for example, the substance of the air,  which they imagined as some malignant spirit penetrating that  earth.  And because my piety -- such as it was -- still compelled  me to believe that the good God never created any evil substance,  I formed the idea of two masses, one opposed to the other, both  infinite but with the evil more contracted and the good more  expansive.  And from this diseased beginning, the other sacrileges  followed after.      For when my mind tried to turn back to the Catholic faith, I  was cast down, since the Catholic faith was not what I judged it  to be.  And it seemed to me a greater piety to regard thee, my God  -- to whom I make confession of thy mercies -- as infinite in all  respects save that one: where the extended mass of evil stood  opposed to thee, where I was compelled to confess that thou art  finite -- than if I should think that thou couldst be confined by  the form of a human body on every side.  And it seemed better to  me to believe that no evil had been created by thee -- for in my  ignorance evil appeared not only to be some kind of substance but  a corporeal one at that.  This was because I had, thus far, no  conception of mind, except as a subtle body diffused throughout  local spaces.  This seemed better than to believe that anything  could emanate from thee which had the character that I considered  evil to be in its nature.  And I believed that our Saviour himself  also -- thy Only Begotten -- had been brought forth, as it were,  for our salvation out of the mass of thy bright shining substance.   So that I could believe nothing about him except what I was able  to harmonize with these vain imaginations.  I thought, therefore,  that such a nature could not be born of the Virgin Mary without  being mingled with the flesh, and I could not see how the divine  substance, as I had conceived it, could be mingled thus without  being contaminated.  I was afraid, therefore, to believe that he  had been born in the flesh, lest I should also be compelled to  believe that he had been contaminated by the flesh.  Now will thy  spiritual ones smile blandly and lovingly at me if they read these  confessions.  Yet such was I. CHAPTER XI 21.  Furthermore, the things they censured in thy Scriptures  I thought impossible to be defended.  And yet, occasionally, I  desired to confer on various matters with someone well learned in  those books, to test what he thought of them.  For already the  words of one Elpidius, who spoke and disputed face to face against  these same Manicheans, had begun to impress me, even when I was at  Carthage; because he brought forth things out of the Scriptures  that were not easily withstood, to which their answers appeared to  me feeble.  One of their answers they did not give forth publicly,  but only to us in private -- when they said that the writings of  the New Testament had been tampered with by unknown persons who  desired to ingraft the Jewish law into the Christian faith.  But  they themselves never brought forward any uncorrupted copies.   Still thinking in corporeal categories and very much ensnared and  to some extent stifled, I was borne down by those conceptions of  bodily substance.  I panted under this load for the air of thy  truth, but I was not able to breathe it pure and undefiled. CHAPTER XII 22.  I set about diligently to practice what I came to Rome  to do -- the teaching of rhetoric.  The first task was to bring  together in my home a few people to whom and through whom I had  begun to be known.  And lo, I then began to learn that other  offenses were committed in Rome which I had not had to bear in  Africa.  Just as I had been told, those riotous disruptions by  young blackguards were not practiced here.  Yet, now, my friends  told me, many of the Roman students -- breakers of faith, who, for  the love of money, set a small value on justice -- would conspire  together and suddenly transfer to another teacher, to evade paying  their master&#x27;s fees.  My heart hated such people, though not with  a &quot;perfect hatred&quot;[145]; for doubtless I hated them more because I  was to suffer from them than on account of their own illicit acts.   Still, such people are base indeed; they fornicate against thee,  for they love the transitory mockeries of temporal things and the  filthy gain which begrimes the hand that grabs it; they embrace  the fleeting world and scorn thee, who abidest and invitest us to  return to thee and who pardonest the prostituted human soul when  it does return to thee.  Now I hate such crooked and perverse men,  although I love them if they will be corrected and come to prefer  the learning they obtain to money and, above all, to prefer thee  to such learning, O God, the truth and fullness of our positive  good, and our most pure peace.  But then the wish was stronger in  me for my own sake not to suffer evil from them than was my desire  that they should become good for thy sake. CHAPTER XIII 23.  When, therefore, the officials of Milan sent to Rome, to  the prefect of the city, to ask that he provide them with a  teacher of rhetoric for their city and to send him at the public  expense, I applied for the job through those same persons, drunk  with the Manichean vanities, to be freed from whom I was going  away -- though neither they nor I were aware of it at the time.   They recommended that Symmachus, who was then prefect, after he  had proved me by audition, should appoint me.      And to Milan I came, to Ambrose the bishop, famed through the  whole world as one of the best of men, thy devoted servant.  His  eloquent discourse in those times abundantly provided thy people  with the flour of thy wheat, the gladness of thy oil, and the  sober intoxication of thy wine.[146]  To him I was led by thee  without my knowledge, that by him I might be led to thee in full  knowledge.  That man of God received me as a father would, and  welcomed my coming as a good bishop should.  And I began to love  him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I  had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church -- but as a  friendly man.  And I studiously listened to him -- though not with  the right motive -- as he preached to the people.  I was trying to  discover whether his eloquence came up to his reputation, and  whether it flowed fuller or thinner than others said it did.  And  thus I hung on his words intently, but, as to his subject matter,  I was only a careless and contemptuous listener.  I was delighted  with the charm of his speech, which was more erudite, though less  cheerful and soothing, than Faustus&#x27; style.  As for subject  matter, however, there could be no comparison, for the latter was  wandering around in Manichean deceptions, while the former was  teaching salvation most soundly.  But &quot;salvation is far from the  wicked,&quot;[147] such as I was then when I stood before him.  Yet I  was drawing nearer, gradually and unconsciously. CHAPTER XIV 24.  For, although I took no trouble to learn what he said,  but only to hear how he said it -- for this empty concern remained  foremost with me as long as I despaired of finding a clear path  from man to thee -- yet, along with the eloquence I prized, there  also came into my mind the ideas which I ignored; for I could not  separate them.  And, while I opened my heart to acknowledge how  skillfully he spoke, there also came an awareness of how _truly_  he spoke -- but only gradually.  First of all, his ideas had  already begun to appear to me defensible; and the Catholic faith,  for which I supposed that nothing could be said against the  onslaught of the Manicheans, I now realized could be maintained  without presumption.  This was especially clear after I had heard  one or two parts of the Old Testament explained allegorically --  whereas before this, when I had interpreted them literally, they  had &quot;killed&quot; me spiritually.[148]  However, when many of these  passages in those books were expounded to me thus, I came to blame  my own despair for having believed that no reply could be given to  those who hated and scoffed at the Law and the Prophets.  Yet I  did not see that this was reason enough to follow the Catholic  way, just because it had learned advocates who could answer  objections adequately and without absurdity.  Nor could I see that  what I had held to heretofore should now be condemned, because  both sides were equally defensible.  For that way did not appear  to me yet vanquished; but neither did it seem yet victorious.      25.  But now I earnestly bent my mind to require if there was  possible any way to prove the Manicheans guilty of falsehood.  If  I could have conceived of a spiritual substance, all their  strongholds would have collapsed and been cast out of my mind.   But I could not.  Still, concerning the body of this world, nature  as a whole -- now that I was able to consider and compare such  things more and more -- I now decided that the majority of the  philosophers held the more probable views.  So, in what I thought  was the method of the Academics -- doubting everything and  fluctuating between all the options -- I came to the conclusion  that the Manicheans were to be abandoned.  For I judged, even in  that period of doubt, that I could not remain in a sect to which I  preferred some of the philosophers.  But I refused to commit the  cure of my fainting soul to the philosophers, because they were  without the saving name of Christ.  I resolved, therefore, to  become a catechumen in the Catholic Church -- which my parents had  so much urged upon me -- until something certain shone forth by  which I might guide my course. BOOK SIX Turmoil in the twenties.  Monica follows Augustine to Milan  and finds him a catechumen in the Catholic Church. Both admire  Ambrose but Augustine gets no help from him on his personal  problems.  Ambition spurs and Alypius and Nebridius join him in a  confused quest for the happy life.  Augustine becomes engaged,  dismisses his first mistress, takes another, and continues his  fruitless search for truth. CHAPTER I 1.  O Hope from my youth,[149] where wast thou to me and  where hadst thou gone away?[150]  For hadst thou not created me  and differentiated me from the beasts of the field and the birds  of the air, making me wiser than they?  And yet I was wandering  about in a dark and slippery way, seeking thee outside myself and  thus not finding the God of my heart.  I had gone down into the  depths of the sea and had lost faith, and had despaired of ever  finding the truth.      By this time my mother had come to me, having mustered the  courage of piety, following over sea and land, secure in thee  through all the perils of the journey.  For in the dangers of the  voyage she comforted the sailors -- to whom the inexperienced  voyagers, when alarmed, were accustomed to go for comfort -- and  assured them of a safe arrival because she had been so assured by  thee in a vision.      She found me in deadly peril through my despair of ever  finding the truth.  But when I told her that I was now no longer a  Manichean, though not yet a Catholic Christian, she did not leap  for joy as if this were unexpected; for she had already been  reassured about that part of my misery for which she had mourned  me as one dead, but also as one who would be raised to thee.  She  had carried me out on the bier of her thoughts, that thou mightest  say to the widow&#x27;s son, &quot;Young man, I say unto you, arise!&quot;[151]  and then he would revive and begin to speak, and thou wouldst  deliver him to his mother.  Therefore, her heart was not agitated  with any violent exultation when she heard that so great a part of  what she daily entreated thee to do had actually already been done  -- that, though I had not yet grasped the truth, I was rescued  from falsehood.  Instead, she was fully confident that thou who  hadst promised the whole would give her the rest, and thus most  calmly, and with a fully confident heart, she replied to me that  she believed, in Christ, that before she died she would see me a  faithful Catholic.  And she said no more than this to me.  But to  thee, O Fountain of mercy, she poured out still more frequent  prayers and tears that thou wouldst hasten thy aid and enlighten  my darkness, and she hurried all the more zealously to the church  and hung upon the words of Ambrose, praying for the fountain of  water that springs up into everlasting life.[152]  For she loved  that man as an angel of God, since she knew that it was by him  that I had been brought thus far to that wavering state of  agitation I was now in, through which she was fully persuaded I  should pass from sickness to health, even though it would be after  a still sharper convulsion which physicians call &quot;the crisis.&quot; CHAPTER II 2.  So also my mother brought to certain oratories, erected  in the memory of the saints, offerings of porridge, bread, and  wine -- as had been her custom in Africa -- and she was forbidden  to do so by the doorkeeper [ostiarius].  And as soon as she  learned that it was the bishop who had forbidden it, she  acquiesced so devoutly and obediently that I myself marveled how  readily she could bring herself to turn critic of her own customs,  rather than question his prohibition.  For winebibbing had not  taken possession of her spirit, nor did the love of wine stimulate  her to hate the truth, as it does too many, both male and female,  who turn as sick at a hymn to sobriety as drunkards do at a  draught of water.  When she had brought her basket with the  festive gifts, which she would taste first herself and give the  rest away, she would never allow herself more than one little cup  of wine, diluted according to her own temperate palate, which she  would taste out of courtesy.  And, if there were many oratories of  departed saints that ought to be honored in the same way, she  still carried around with her the same little cup, to be used  everywhere.  This became not only very much watered but also quite  tepid with carrying it about.  She would distribute it by small  sips to those around, for she sought to stimulate their devotion,  not pleasure.      But as soon as she found that this custom was forbidden by  that famous preacher and most pious prelate, even to those who  would use it in moderation, lest thereby it might be an occasion  of gluttony for those who were already drunken (and also because  these funereal memorials were very much like some of the  superstitious practices of the pagans), she most willingly  abstained from it.  And, in place of a basket filled with fruits  of the earth, she had learned to bring to the oratories of the  martyrs a heart full of purer petitions, and to give all that she  could to the poor -- so that the Communion of the Lord&#x27;s body  might be rightly celebrated in those places where, after the  example of his Passion, the martyrs had been sacrificed and  crowned.  But yet it seems to me, O Lord my God -- and my heart  thinks of it this way in thy sight -- that my mother would  probably not have given way so easily to the rejection of this  custom if it had been forbidden by another, whom she did not love  as she did Ambrose.  For, out of her concern for my salvation, she  loved him most dearly; and he loved her truly, on account of her  faithful religious life, in which she frequented the church with  good works, &quot;fervent in spirit.&quot;[153]  Thus he would, when he saw  me, often burst forth into praise of her, congratulating me that I  had such a mother -- little knowing what a son she had in me, who  was still a skeptic in all these matters and who could not  conceive that the way of life could be found out. CHAPTER III 3.  Nor had I come yet to groan in my prayers that thou  wouldst help me.  My mind was wholly intent on knowledge and eager  for disputation.  Ambrose himself I esteemed a happy man, as the  world counted happiness, because great personages held him in  honor.  Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden.  But  what hope he cherished, what struggles he had against the  temptations that beset his high station, what solace in adversity,  and what savory joys thy bread possessed for the hidden mouth of  his heart when feeding on it, I could neither       conjecture nor experience.Nor did he know my own frustrations, nor the pit of my  danger.  For I could not request of him what I wanted as I wanted  it, because I was debarred from hearing and speaking to him by  crowds of busy people to whose infirmities he devoted himself.   And when he was not engaged with them -- which was never for long  at a time -- he was either refreshing his body with necessary food  or his mind with reading.Now, as he read, his eyes glanced over the pages and his  heart searched out the sense, but his voice and tongue were  silent.  Often when we came to his room -- for no one was  forbidden to enter, nor was it his custom that the arrival of  visitors should be announced to him -- we would see him thus  reading to himself.  After we had sat for a long time in silence  -- for who would dare interrupt one so intent? -- we would then  depart, realizing that he was unwilling to be distracted in the  little time he could gain for the recruiting of his mind, free  from the clamor of other men&#x27;s business.  Perhaps he was fearful  lest, if the author he was studying should express himself  vaguely, some doubtful and attentive hearer would ask him to  expound it or discuss some of the more abstruse questions, so that  he could not get over as much material as he wished, if his time  was occupied with others.  And even a truer reason for his reading  to himself might have been the care for preserving his voice,  which was very easily weakened.  Whatever his motive was in so  doing, it was doubtless, in such a man, a good one.4.  But actually I could find no opportunity of putting the  questions I desired to that holy oracle of thine in his heart,  unless it was a matter which could be dealt with briefly.   However, those surgings in me required that he should give me his  full leisure so that I might pour them out to him; but I never  found him so.  I heard him, indeed, every Lord&#x27;s Day, &quot;rightly  dividing the word of truth&quot;[154] among the people.  And I became  all the more convinced that all those knots of crafty calumnies  which those deceivers of ours had knit together against the divine  books could be unraveled.I soon understood that the statement that man was made after  the image of Him that created him[155] was not understood by thy  spiritual sons -- whom thou hadst regenerated through the Catholic  Mother[156] through grace -- as if they believed and imagined that  thou wert bounded by a human form, although what was the nature of  a spiritual substance I had not the faintest or vaguest notion.   Still rejoicing, I blushed that for so many years I had bayed, not  against the Catholic faith, but against the fables of fleshly  imagination.  For I had been both impious and rash in this, that I  had condemned by pronouncement what I ought to have learned by  inquiry.  For thou, O Most High, and most near, most secret, yet  most present, who dost not have limbs, some of which are larger  and some smaller, but who art wholly everywhere and nowhere in  space, and art not shaped by some corporeal form: thou didst  create man after thy own image and, see, he dwells in space, both  head and feet. CHAPTER IV 5.  Since I could not then understand how this image of thine  could subsist, I should have knocked on the door and propounded  the doubt as to how it was to be believed, and not have  insultingly opposed it as if it were actually believed.   Therefore, my anxiety as to what I could retain as certain gnawed  all the more sharply into my soul, and I felt quite ashamed  because during the long time I had been deluded and deceived by  the [Manichean] promises of certainties, I had, with childish  petulance, prated of so many uncertainties as if they were  certain.  That they were falsehoods became apparent to me only  afterward.  However, I was certain that they were uncertain and  since I had held them as certainly uncertain I had accused thy  Catholic Church with a blind contentiousness.  I had not yet  discovered that it taught the truth, but I now knew that it did  not teach what I had so vehemently accused it of.  In this  respect, at least, I was confounded and converted; and I rejoiced,  O my God, that the one Church, the body of thy only Son -- in  which the name of Christ had been sealed upon me as an infant --  did not relish these childish trifles and did not maintain in its  sound doctrine any tenet that would involve pressing thee, the  Creator of all, into space, which, however extended and immense,  would still be bounded on all sides -- like the shape of a human  body.      6.  I was also glad that the old Scriptures of the Law and  the Prophets were laid before me to be read, not now with an eye  to what had seemed absurd in them when formerly I censured thy  holy ones for thinking thus, when they actually did not think in  that way.  And I listened with delight to Ambrose, in his sermons  to the people, often recommending this text most diligently as a  rule: &quot;The letter kills, but the spirit gives life,&quot;[157] while at  the same time he drew aside the mystic veil and opened to view the  spiritual meaning of what seemed to teach perverse doctrine if it  were taken according to the letter.  I found nothing in his  teachings that offended me, though I could not yet know for  certain whether what he taught was true.  For all this time I  restrained my heart from assenting to anything, fearing to fall  headlong into error.  Instead, by this hanging in suspense, I was  being strangled.[158]  For my desire was to be as certain of  invisible things as I was that seven and three are ten.  I was not  so deranged as to believe that _this_ could not be comprehended,  but my desire was to have other things as clear as this, whether  they were physical objects, which were not present to my senses,  or spiritual objects, which I did not know how to conceive of  except in physical terms.      If I could have believed, I might have been cured, and, with  the sight of my soul cleared up, it might in some way have been  directed toward thy truth, which always abides and fails in  nothing.  But, just as it happens that a man who has tried a bad  physician fears to trust himself with a good one, so it was with  the health of my soul, which could not be healed except by  believing.  But lest it should believe falsehoods, it refused to  be cured, resisting thy hand, who hast prepared for us the  medicines of faith and applied them to the maladies of the whole  world, and endowed them with such great efficacy. CHAPTER V 7.  Still, from this time forward, I began to prefer the  Catholic doctrine.  I felt that it was with moderation and honesty  that it commanded things to be believed that were not demonstrated  -- whether they could be demonstrated, but not to everyone, or  whether they could not be demonstrated at all.  This was far  better than the method of the Manicheans, in which our credulity  was mocked by an audacious promise of knowledge and then many  fabulous and absurd things were forced upon believers _because_  they were incapable of demonstration.  After that, O Lord, little  by little, with a gentle and most merciful hand, drawing and  calming my heart, thou didst persuade me that, if I took into  account the multitude of things I had never seen, nor been present  when they were enacted -- such as many of the events of secular  history; and the numerous reports of places and cities which I had  not seen; or such as my relations with many friends, or  physicians, or with these men and those -- that unless we should  believe, we should do nothing at all in this life.[159]  Finally,  I was impressed with what an unalterable assurance I believed  which two people were my parents, though this was impossible for  me to know otherwise than by hearsay.  By bringing all this into  my consideration, thou didst persuade me that it was not the ones  who believed thy books -- which with so great authority thou hast  established among nearly all nations -- but those who did not  believe them who were to be blamed.  Moreover, those men were not  to be listened to who would say to me, &quot;How do you know that those  Scriptures were imparted to mankind by the Spirit of the one and  most true God?&quot;  For this was the point that was most of all to be  believed, since no wranglings of blasphemous questions such as I  had read in the books of the self-contradicting philosophers could  once snatch from me the belief that thou dost exist -- although  _what_ thou art I did not know -- and that to thee belongs the  governance of human affairs.      8.  This much I believed, some times more strongly than other  times.  But I always believed both that thou art and that thou  hast a care for us,[160] although I was ignorant both as to what  should be thought about thy substance and as to which way led, or  led back, to thee.  Thus, since we are too weak by unaided reason  to find out truth, and since, because of this, we need the  authority of the Holy Writings, I had now begun to believe that  thou wouldst not, under any circumstances, have given such eminent  authority to those Scriptures throughout all lands if it had not  been that through them thy will may be believed in and that thou  mightest be sought.  For, as to those passages in the Scripture  which had heretofore appeared incongruous and offensive to me, now  that I had heard several of them expounded reasonably, I could see  that they were to be resolved by the mysteries of spiritual  interpretation.  The authority of Scripture seemed to me all the  more revered and worthy of devout belief because, although it was  visible for all to read, it reserved the full majesty of its  secret wisdom within its spiritual profundity.  While it stooped  to all in the great plainness of its language and simplicity of  style, it yet required the closest attention of the most serious- minded -- so that it might receive all into its common bosom, and  direct some few through its narrow passages toward thee, yet many  more than would have been the case had there not been in it such a  lofty authority, which nevertheless allured multitudes to its  bosom by its holy humility.  I continued to reflect upon these  things, and thou wast with me.  I sighed, and thou didst hear me.   I vacillated, and thou guidedst me.  I roamed the broad way of the  world, and thou didst not desert me. CHAPTER VI 9.  I was still eagerly aspiring to honors, money, and  matrimony; and thou didst mock me.  In pursuit of these ambitions  I endured the most bitter hardships, in which thou wast being the  more gracious the less thou wouldst allow anything that was not  thee to grow sweet to me.  Look into my heart, O Lord, whose  prompting it is that I should recall all this, and confess it to  thee.  Now let my soul cleave to thee, now that thou hast freed  her from that fast-sticking glue of death.      How wretched she was!  And thou didst irritate her sore wound  so that she might forsake all else and turn to thee -- who art  above all and without whom all things would be nothing at all --  so that she should be converted and healed.  How wretched I was at  that time, and how thou didst deal with me so as to make me aware  of my wretchedness, I recall from the incident of the day on which  I was preparing to recite a panegyric on the emperor.  In it I was  to deliver many a lie, and the lying was to be applauded by those  who knew I was lying.  My heart was agitated with this sense of  guilt and it seethed with the fever of my uneasiness.  For, while  walking along one of the streets of Milan, I saw a poor beggar --  with what I believe was a full belly -- joking and hilarious.  And  I sighed and spoke to the friends around me of the many sorrows  that flowed from our madness, because in spite of all our  exertions -- such as those I was then laboring in, dragging the  burden of my unhappiness under the spur of ambition, and, by  dragging it, increasing it at the same time -- still and all we  aimed only to attain that very happiness which this beggar had  reached before us; and there was a grim chance that we should  never attain it!  For what he had obtained through a few coins,  got by his begging, I was still scheming for by many a wretched  and tortuous turning -- namely, the joy of a passing felicity.  He  had not, indeed, gained true joy, but, at the same time, with all  my ambitions, I was seeking one still more untrue.  Anyhow, he was  now joyous and I was anxious.  He was free from care, and I was  full of alarms.  Now, if anyone should inquire of me whether I  should prefer to be merry or anxious, I would reply, &quot;Merry.&quot;  Again, if I had been asked whether I should prefer to be as he was  or as I myself then was, I would have chosen to be myself; though  I was beset with cares and alarms.  But would not this have been a  false choice?  Was the contrast valid?  Actually, I ought not to  prefer myself to him because I happened to be more learned than he  was; for I got no great pleasure from my learning, but sought,  rather, to please men by its exhibition -- and this not to  instruct, but only to please.  Thus thou didst break my bones with  the rod of thy correction.      10.  Let my soul take its leave of those who say: &quot;It makes a  difference as to the object from which a man derives his joy.  The  beggar rejoiced in drunkenness; you longed to rejoice in glory.&quot;  What glory, O Lord?  The kind that is not in thee, for, just as  his was no true joy, so was mine no true glory; but it turned my  head all the more.  He would get over his drunkenness that same  night, but I had slept with mine many a night and risen again with  it, and was to sleep again and rise again with it, I know not how  many times.  It does indeed make a difference as to the object  from which a man&#x27;s joy is gained.  I know this is so, and I know  that the joy of a faithful hope is incomparably beyond such  vanity.  Yet, at the same time, this beggar was beyond me, for he  truly was the happier man -- not only because he was thoroughly  steeped in his mirth while I was torn to pieces with my cares, but  because he had gotten his wine by giving good wishes to the  passers-by while I was following after the ambition of my pride by  lying.  Much to this effect I said to my good companions, and I  saw how readily they reacted pretty much as I did.  Thus I found  that it went ill with me; and I fretted, and doubled that very  ill.  And if any prosperity smiled upon me, I loathed to seize it,  for almost before I could grasp it, it would fly away. CHAPTER VII 11.  Those of us who were living like friends together used  to bemoan our lot in our common talk; but I discussed it with  Alypius and Nebridius more especially and in very familiar terms.   Alypius had been born in the same town as I; his parents were of  the highest rank there, but he was a bit younger than I.  He had  studied under me when I first taught in our town, and then  afterward at Carthage.  He esteemed me highly because I appeared  to him good and learned, and I esteemed him for his inborn love of  virtue, which was uncommonly marked in a man so young.  But in the  whirlpool of Carthaginian fashion -- where frivolous spectacles  are hotly followed -- he had been inveigled into the madness of  the gladiatorial games.  While he was miserably tossed about in  this fad, I was teaching rhetoric there in a public school.  At  that time he was not attending my classes because of some ill  feeling that had arisen between me and his father.  I then came to  discover how fatally he doted upon the circus, and I was deeply  grieved, for he seemed likely to cast away his very great promise  -- if, indeed, he had not already done so.  Yet I had no means of  advising him, or any way of reclaiming him through restraint,  either by the kindness of a friend or by the authority of a  teacher.  For I imagined that his feelings toward me were the same  as his father&#x27;s.  But this turned out not to be the case.  Indeed,  disregarding his father&#x27;s will in the matter, he began to be  friendly and to visit my lecture room, to listen for a while and  then depart.      12.  But it slipped my memory to try to deal with his  problem, to prevent him from ruining his excellent mind in his  blind and headstrong passion for frivolous sport.  But thou, O  Lord, who holdest the helm of all that thou hast created,[161]  thou hadst not forgotten him who was one day to be numbered among  thy sons, a chief minister of thy sacrament.[162]  And in order  that his amendment might plainly be attributed to thee, thou  broughtest it about through me while I knew nothing of it.      One day, when I was sitting in my accustomed place with my  scholars before me, he came in, greeted me, sat himself down, and  fixed his attention on the subject I was then discussing.  It so  happened that I had a passage in hand and, while I was  interpreting it, a simile occurred to me, taken from the  gladiatorial games.  It struck me as relevant to make more  pleasant and plain the point I wanted to convey by adding a biting  gibe at those whom that madness had enthralled.  Thou knowest, O  our God, that I had no thought at that time of curing Alypius of  that plague.  But he took it to himself and thought that I would  not have said it but for his sake.  And what any other man would  have taken as an occasion of offense against me, this worthy young  man took as a reason for being offended at himself, and for loving  me the more fervently.  Thou hast said it long ago and written in  thy Book, &quot;Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.&quot;[163]  Now I  had not rebuked him; but thou who canst make use of everything,  both witting and unwitting, and in the order which thou thyself  knowest to be best -- and that order is right -- thou madest my  heart and tongue into burning coals with which thou mightest  cauterize and cure the hopeful mind thus languishing.  Let him be  silent in thy praise who does not meditate on thy mercy, which  rises up in my inmost parts to confess to thee.  For after that  speech Alypius rushed up out of that deep pit into which he had  willfully plunged and in which he had been blinded by its  miserable pleasures.  And he roused his mind with a resolve to  moderation.  When he had done this, all the filth of the  gladiatorial pleasures dropped away from him, and he went to them  no more.  Then he also prevailed upon his reluctant father to let  him be my pupil.  And, at the son&#x27;s urging, the father at last  consented.  Thus Alypius began again to hear my lectures and  became involved with me in the same superstition, loving in the  Manicheans that outward display of ascetic discipline which he  believed was true and unfeigned.  It was, however, a senseless and  seducing continence, which ensnared precious souls who were not  able as yet to reach the height of true virtue, and who were  easily beguiled with the veneer of what was only a shadowy and  feigned virtue. CHAPTER VIII 13.  He had gone on to Rome before me to study law -- which  was the worldly way which his parents were forever urging him to  pursue -- and there he was carried away again with an incredible  passion for the gladiatorial shows.  For, although he had been  utterly opposed to such spectacles and detested them, one day he  met by chance a company of his acquaintances and fellow students  returning from dinner; and, with a friendly violence, they drew  him, resisting and objecting vehemently, into the amphitheater, on  a day of those cruel and murderous shows.  He protested to them:  &quot;Though you drag my body to that place and set me down there, you  cannot force me to give my mind or lend my eyes to these shows.   Thus I will be absent while present, and so overcome both you and  them.&quot; When they heard this, they dragged him on in, probably  interested to see whether he could do as he said.  When they got  to the arena, and had taken what seats they could get, the whole  place became a tumult of inhuman frenzy.  But Alypius kept his  eyes closed and forbade his mind to roam abroad after such  wickedness.  Would that he had shut his ears also!  For when one  of the combatants fell in the fight, a mighty cry from the whole  audience stirred him so strongly that, overcome by curiosity and  still prepared (as he thought) to despise and rise superior to it  no matter what it was, he opened his eyes and was struck with a  deeper wound in his soul than the victim whom he desired to see  had been in his body.  Thus he fell more miserably than the one  whose fall had raised that mighty clamor which had entered through  his ears and unlocked his eyes to make way for the wounding and  beating down of his soul, which was more audacious than truly  valiant -- also it was weaker because it presumed on its own  strength when it ought to have depended on Thee.  For, as soon as  he saw the blood, he drank in with it a savage temper, and he did  not turn away, but fixed his eyes on the bloody pastime,  unwittingly drinking in the madness -- delighted with the wicked  contest and drunk with blood lust.  He was now no longer the same  man who came in, but was one of the mob he came into, a true  companion of those who had brought him thither.  Why need I say  more?  He looked, he shouted, he was excited, and he took away  with him the madness that would stimulate him to come again: not  only with those who first enticed him, but even without them;  indeed, dragging in others besides.  And yet from all this, with a  most powerful and most merciful hand, thou didst pluck him and  taught him not to rest his confidence in himself but in thee --  but not till long after. CHAPTER IX 14.  But this was all being stored up in his memory as  medicine for the future.  So also was that other incident when he  was still studying under me at Carthage and was meditating at  noonday in the market place on what he had to recite -- as  scholars usually have to do for practice -- and thou didst allow  him to be arrested by the police officers in the market place as a  thief.  I believe, O my God, that thou didst allow this for no  other reason than that this man who was in the future to prove so  great should now begin to learn that, in making just decisions, a  man should not readily be condemned by other men with reckless  credulity.      For as he was walking up and down alone before the judgment  seat with his tablets and pen, lo, a young man -- another one of  the scholars, who was the real thief -- secretly brought a hatchet  and, without Alypius seeing him, got in as far as the leaden bars  which protected the silversmith shop and began to hack away at the  lead gratings.  But when the noise of the hatchet was heard the  silversmiths below began to call to each other in whispers and  sent men to arrest whomsoever they should find.  The thief heard  their voices and ran away, leaving his hatchet because he was  afraid to be caught with it.  Now Alypius, who had not seen him  come in, got a glimpse of him as he went out and noticed that he  went off in great haste.  Being curious to know the reasons, he  went up to the place, where he found the hatchet, and stood  wondering and pondering when, behold, those that were sent caught  him alone, holding the hatchet which had made the noise which had  startled them and brought them there.  They seized him and dragged  him away, gathering the tenants of the market place about them and  boasting that they had caught a notorious thief.  Thereupon he was  led away to appear before the judge.      15.  But this is as far as his lesson was to go.  For  immediately, O Lord, thou didst come to the rescue of his  innocence, of which thou wast the sole witness.  As he was being  led off to prison or punishment, they were met by the master  builder who had charge of the public buildings.  The captors were  especially glad to meet him because he had more than once  suspected them of stealing the goods that had been lost out of the  market place.  Now, at last, they thought they could convince him  who it was that had committed the thefts.  But the custodian had  often met Alypius at the house of a certain senator, whose  receptions he used to attend.  He recognized him at once and,  taking his hand, led him apart from the throng, inquired the cause  of all the trouble, and learned what had occurred.  He then  commanded all the rabble still around -- and very uproarious and  full of threatenings they were -- to come along with him, and they  came to the house of the young man who had committed the deed.   There, before the door, was a slave boy so young that he was not  restrained from telling the whole story by fear of harming his  master.  And he had followed his master to the market place.   Alypius recognized him, and whispered to the architect, who showed  the boy the hatchet and asked whose it was.  &quot;Ours,&quot; he answered  directly.  And, being further questioned, he disclosed the whole  affair.  Thus the guilt was shifted to that household and the  rabble, who had begun to triumph over Alypius, were shamed.  And  so he went away home, this man who was to be the future steward of  thy Word and judge of so many causes in thy Church -- a wiser and  more experienced man. CHAPTER X 16.  I found him at Rome, and he was bound to me with the  strongest possible ties, and he went with me to Milan, in order  that he might not be separated from me, and also that he might  obtain some law practice, for which he had qualified with a view  to pleasing his parents more than himself.  He had already sat  three times as assessor, showing an integrity that seemed strange  to many others, though he thought them strange who could prefer  gold to integrity.  His character had also been tested, not only  by the bait of covetousness, but by the spur of fear.  At Rome he  was assessor to the secretary of the Italian Treasury.  There was  at that time a very powerful senator to whose favors many were  indebted, and of whom many stood in fear.  In his usual highhanded  way he demanded to have a favor granted him that was forbidden by  the laws.  This Alypius resisted.  A bribe was promised, but he  scorned it with all his heart.  Threats were employed, but he  trampled them underfoot -- so that all men marveled at so rare a  spirit, which neither coveted the friendship nor feared the enmity  of a man at once so powerful and so widely known for his great  resources of helping his friends and doing harm to his enemies.   Even the official whose counselor Alypius was -- although he was  unwilling that the favor should be granted -- would not openly  refuse the request, but passed the responsibility on to Alypius,  alleging that he would not permit him to give his assent.  And the  truth was that even if the judge had agreed, Alypius would have  simply left the court.      There was one matter, however, which appealed to his love of  learning, in which he was very nearly led astray.  He found out  that he might have books copied for himself at praetorian rates  [i.e., at public expense].  But his sense of justice prevailed,  and he changed his mind for the better, thinking that the rule  that forbade him was still more profitable than the privilege that  his office would have allowed him.  These are little things, but  &quot;he that is faithful in a little matter is faithful also in a  great one.&quot;[164]  Nor can that possibly be void which was uttered  by the mouth of Thy truth: &quot;If, therefore, you have not been  faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust  the true riches?  And if you have not been faithful in that which  is another man&#x27;s, who shall give you that which is your own?&quot;[165]  Such a man was Alypius, who clung to me at that time and who  wavered in his purpose, just as I did, as to what course of life  to follow.      17.  Nebridius also had come to Milan for no other reason  than that he might live with me in a most ardent search after  truth and wisdom.  He had left his native place near Carthage --  and Carthage itself, where he usually lived -- leaving behind his  fine family estate, his house, and his mother, who would not  follow him.  Like me, he sighed; like me, he wavered; an ardent  seeker after the true life and a most acute analyst of the most  abstruse questions.  So there were three begging mouths, sighing  out their wants one to the other, and waiting upon thee, that thou  mightest give them their meat in due season.[166]  And in all the  vexations with which thy mercy followed our worldly pursuits, we  sought for the reason why we suffered so -- and all was darkness!   We turned away groaning and exclaiming, &quot;How long shall these  things be?&quot;  And this we often asked, yet for all our asking we  did not relinquish them; for as yet we had not discovered anything  certain which, when we gave those others up, we might grasp in  their stead. CHAPTER XI 18.  And I especially puzzled and wondered when I remembered  how long a time had passed since my nineteenth year, in which I  had first fallen in love with wisdom and had determined as soon as  I could find her to abandon the empty hopes and mad delusions of  vain desires.  Behold, I was now getting close to thirty, still  stuck fast in the same mire, still greedy of enjoying present  goods which fly away and distract me; and I was still saying,  &quot;Tomorrow I shall discover it; behold, it will become plain, and I  shall see it; behold, Faustus will come and explain everything.&quot;  Or I would say[167]:&quot;O you mighty Academics, is there no certainty  that man can grasp for the guidance of his life?  No, let us  search the more diligently, and let us not despair.  See, the  things in the Church&#x27;s books that appeared so absurd to us before  do not appear so now, and may be otherwise and honestly  interpreted.  I will set my feet upon that step where, as a child,  my parents placed me, until the clear truth is discovered.  But  where and when shall it be sought?  Ambrose has no leisure -- we  have no leisure to read.  Where are we to find the books?  How or  where could I get hold of them?  From whom could I borrow them?   Let me set a schedule for my days and set apart certain hours for  the health of the soul.  A great hope has risen up in us, because  the Catholic faith does not teach what we thought it did, and  vainly accused it of.  Its teachers hold it as an abomination to  believe that God is limited by the form of a human body.  And do I  doubt that I should &#x27;knock&#x27; in order for the rest also to be  &#x27;opened&#x27; unto me?  My pupils take up the morning hours; what am I  doing with the rest of the day?  Why not do this?  But, then, when  am I to visit my influential friends, whose favors I need?  When  am I to prepare the orations that I sell to the class?  When would  I get some recreation and relax my mind from the strain of work?      19.  &quot;Perish everything and let us dismiss these idle  triflings.  Let me devote myself solely to the search for truth.   This life is unhappy, death uncertain.  If it comes upon me  suddenly, in what state shall I go hence and where shall I learn  what here I have neglected?  Should I not indeed suffer the  punishment of my negligence here?  But suppose death cuts off and  finishes all care and feeling.  This too is a question that calls  for inquiry.  God forbid that it should be so.  It is not without  reason, it is not in vain, that the stately authority of the  Christian faith has spread over the entire world, and God would  never have done such great things for us if the life of the soul  perished with the death of the body.  Why, therefore, do I delay  in abandoning my hopes of this world and giving myself wholly to  seek after God and the blessed life?      &quot;But wait a moment.  This life also is pleasant, and it has a  sweetness of its own, not at all negligible.  We must not abandon  it lightly, for it would be shameful to lapse back into it again.   See now, it is important to gain some post of honor.  And what  more should I desire?  I have crowds of influential friends, if  nothing else; and, if I push my claims, a governorship may be  offered me, and a wife with some money, so that she would not be  an added expense.  This would be the height of my desire.  Many  men, who are great and worthy of imitation, have combined the  pursuit of wisdom with a marriage life.&quot;      20.  While I talked about these things, and the winds of  opinions veered about and tossed my heart hither and thither, time  was slipping away.  I delayed my conversion to the Lord; I  postponed from day to day the life in thee, but I could not  postpone the daily death in myself.  I was enamored of a happy  life, but I still feared to seek it in its own abode, and so I  fled from it while I sought it.  I thought I should be miserable  if I were deprived of the embraces of a woman, and I never gave a  thought to the medicine that thy mercy has provided for the  healing of that infirmity, for I had never tried it.  As for  continence, I imagined that it depended on one&#x27;s own strength,  though I found no such strength in myself, for in my folly I knew  not what is written, &quot;None can be continent unless thou dost grant  it.&quot;[168]  Certainly thou wouldst have given it, if I had  beseeched thy ears with heartfelt groaning, and if I had cast my  care upon thee with firm faith. CHAPTER XII 21.  Actually, it was Alypius who prevented me from marrying,  urging that if I did so it would not be possible for us to live  together and to have as much undistracted leisure in the love of  wisdom as we had long desired.  For he himself was so chaste that  it was wonderful, all the more because in his early youth he had  entered upon the path of promiscuity, but had not continued in it.   Instead, feeling sorrow and disgust at it, he had lived from that  time down to the present most continently.  I quoted against him  the examples of men who had been married and still lovers of  wisdom, who had pleased God and had been loyal and affectionate to  their friends.  I fell far short of them in greatness of soul,  and, enthralled with the disease of my carnality and its deadly  sweetness, I dragged my chain along, fearing to be loosed of it.   Thus I rejected the words of him who counseled me wisely, as if  the hand that would have loosed the chain only hurt my wound.   Moreover, the serpent spoke to Alypius himself by me, weaving and  lying in his path, by my tongue to catch him with pleasant snares  in which his honorable and free feet might be entangled.      22.  For he wondered that I, for whom he had such a great  esteem, should be stuck so fast in the gluepot of pleasure as to  maintain, whenever we discussed the subject, that I could not  possibly live a celibate life.  And when I urged in my defense  against his accusing questions that the hasty and stolen delight,  which he had tasted and now hardly remembered, and therefore too  easily disparaged, was not to be compared with a settled  acquaintance with it; and that, if to this stable acquaintance  were added the honorable name of marriage, he would not then be  astonished at my inability to give it up -- when I spoke thus,  then he also began to wish to be married, not because he was  overcome by the lust for such pleasures, but out of curiosity.   For, he said, he longed to know what that could be without which  my life, which he thought was so happy, seemed to me to be no life  at all, but a punishment.  For he who wore no chain was amazed at  my slavery, and his amazement awoke the desire for experience, and  from that he would have gone on to the experiment itself, and then  perhaps he would have fallen into the very slavery that amazed him  in me, since he was ready to enter into &quot;a covenant with  death,&quot;[169] for &quot;he that loves danger shall fall into it.&quot;[170]      Now, the question of conjugal honor in the ordering of a good  married life and the bringing up of children interested us but  slightly.  What afflicted me most and what had made me already a  slave to it was the habit of satisfying an insatiable lust; but  Alypius was about to be enslaved by a merely curious wonder.  This  is the state we were in until thou, O Most High, who never  forsakest our lowliness, didst take pity on our misery and didst  come to our rescue in wonderful and secret ways. CHAPTER XIII 23.  Active efforts were made to get me a wife.  I wooed; I  was engaged; and my mother took the greatest pains in the matter.   For her hope was that, when I was once married, I might be washed  clean in health-giving baptism for which I was being daily  prepared, as she joyfully saw, taking note that her desires and  promises were being fulfilled in my faith.  Yet, when, at my  request and her own impulse, she called upon thee daily with  strong, heartfelt cries, that thou wouldst, by a vision, disclose  unto her a leading about my future marriage, thou wouldst not.   She did, indeed, see certain vain and fantastic things, such as  are conjured up by the strong preoccupation of the human spirit,  and these she supposed had some reference to me.  And she told me  about them, but not with the confidence she usually had when thou  hadst shown her anything.  For she always said that she could  distinguish, by a certain feeling impossible to describe, between  thy revelations and the dreams of her own soul.  Yet the matter  was pressed forward, and proposals were made for a girl who was as  yet some two years too young to marry.[171]  And because she  pleased me, I agreed to wait for her. CHAPTER XIV 24.  Many in my band of friends, consulting about and  abhorring the turbulent vexations of human life, had often  considered and were now almost determined to undertake a peaceful  life, away from the turmoil of men.  This we thought could be  obtained by bringing together what we severally owned and thus  making of it a common household, so that in the sincerity of our  friendship nothing should belong more to one than to the other;  but all were to have one purse and the whole was to belong to each  and to all.  We thought that this group might consist of ten  persons, some of whom were very rich -- especially Romanianus, my  fellow townsman, an intimate friend from childhood days.  He had  been brought up to the court on grave business matters and he was  the most earnest of us all about the project and his voice was of  great weight in commending it because his estate was far more  ample than that of the others.  We had resolved, also, that each  year two of us should be managers and provide all that was  needful, while the rest were left undisturbed.  But when we began  to reflect whether this would be permitted by our wives, which  some of us had already and others hoped to have, the whole plan,  so excellently framed, collapsed in our hands and was utterly  wrecked and cast aside.  From this we fell again into sighs and  groans, and our steps followed the broad and beaten ways of the  world; for many thoughts were in our hearts, but &quot;Thy counsel  standeth fast forever.&quot;[172]  In thy counsel thou didst mock ours,  and didst prepare thy own plan, for it was thy purpose &quot;to give us  meat in due season, to open thy hand, and to fill our souls with  blessing.&quot;[173] CHAPTER XV 25.  Meanwhile my sins were being multiplied.  My mistress  was torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, and my  heart which clung to her was torn and wounded till it bled.  And  she went back to Africa, vowing to thee never to know any other  man and leaving with me my natural son by her.  But I, unhappy as  I was, and weaker than a woman, could not bear the delay of the  two years that should elapse before I could obtain the bride I  sought.  And so, since I was not a lover of wedlock so much as a  slave of lust, I procured another mistress -- not a wife, of  course.  Thus in bondage to a lasting habit, the disease of my  soul might be nursed up and kept in its vigor or even increased  until it reached the realm of matrimony.  Nor indeed was the wound  healed that had been caused by cutting away my former mistress;  only it ceased to burn and throb, and began to fester, and was  more dangerous because it was less painful. CHAPTER XVI 26.  Thine be the praise; unto thee be the glory, O Fountain  of mercies.  I became more wretched and thou didst come nearer.   Thy right hand was ever ready to pluck me out of the mire and to  cleanse me, but I did not know it.  Nor did anything call me back  from a still deeper plunge into carnal pleasure except the fear of  death and of thy future judgment, which, amid all the waverings of  my opinions, never faded from my breast.  And I discussed with my  friends, Alypius and Nebridius, the nature of good and evil,  maintaining that, in my judgment, Epicurus would have carried off  the palm if I had not believed what Epicurus would not believe:  that after death there remains a life for the soul, and places of  recompense.  And I demanded of them: &quot;Suppose we are immortal and  live in the enjoyment of perpetual bodily pleasure, and that  without any fear of losing it -- why, then, should we not be  happy, or why should we search for anything else?&quot;  I did not know  that this was in fact the root of my misery: that I was so fallen  and blinded that I could not discern the light of virtue and of  beauty which must be embraced for its own sake, which the eye of  flesh cannot see, and only the inner vision can see.  Nor did I,  alas, consider the reason why I found delight in discussing these  very perplexities, shameful as they were, with my friends.  For I  could not be happy without friends, even according to the notions  of happiness I had then, and no matter how rich the store of my  carnal pleasures might be.  Yet of a truth I loved my friends for  their own sakes, and felt that they in turn loved me for my own  sake.      O crooked ways!  Woe to the audacious soul which hoped that  by forsaking thee it would find some better thing!  It tossed and  turned, upon back and side and belly -- but the bed is hard, and  thou alone givest it rest.[174]  And lo, thou art near, and thou  deliverest us from our wretched wanderings and establishest us in  thy way, and thou comfortest us and sayest, &quot;Run, I will carry  you; yea, I will lead you home and then I will set you free.&quot;[175] BOOK SEVEN The conversion to Neoplatonism.  Augustine traces his growing  disenchantment with the Manichean conceptions of God and evil and  the dawning understanding of God&#x27;s incorruptibility.  But his  thought is still bound by his materialistic notions of reality.   He rejects astrology and turns to the stud of Neoplatonism.  There  follows an analysis of the differences between Platonism and  Christianity and a remarkable account of his appropriation of  Plotinian wisdom and his experience of a Plotinian ecstasy.  From  this, he comes finally to the diligent study of the Bible,  especially the writings of the apostle Paul.  His pilgrimage is  drawing toward its goal, as he begins to know Jesus Christ and to  be drawn to him in hesitant faith. CHAPTER I 1.  Dead now was that evil and shameful youth of mine, and I  was passing into full manhood.[176]  As I increased in years, the  worse was my vanity.  For I could not conceive of any substance  but the sort I could see with my own eyes.  I no longer thought of  thee, O God, by the analogy of a human body.  Ever since I  inclined my ear to philosophy I had avoided this error -- and the  truth on this point I rejoiced to find in the faith of our  spiritual mother, thy Catholic Church. Yet I could not see how  else to conceive thee.  And I, a man -- and such a man! -- sought  to conceive thee, the sovereign and only true God.  In my inmost  heart, I believed that thou art incorruptible and inviolable and  unchangeable, because -- though I knew not how or why -- I could  still see plainly and without doubt that the corruptible is  inferior to the incorruptible, the inviolable obviously superior  to its opposite, and the unchangeable better than the changeable.      My heart cried out violently against all fantasms,[177] and  with this one clear certainty I endeavored to brush away the swarm  of unclean flies that swarmed around the eyes of my mind.  But  behold they were scarcely scattered before they gathered again,  buzzed against my face, and beclouded my vision.  I no longer  thought of God in the analogy of a human body, yet I was  constrained to conceive thee to be some kind of body in space,  either infused into the world, or infinitely diffused beyond the  world -- and this was the incorruptible, inviolable, unchangeable  substance, which I thought was better than the corruptible, the  violable, and the changeable.[178]  For whatever I conceived to be  deprived of the dimensions of space appeared to me to be nothing,  absolutely nothing; not even a void, for if a body is taken out of  space, or if space is emptied of all its contents (of earth,  water, air, or heaven), yet it remains an empty space -- a  spacious nothing, as it were.      2.  Being thus gross-hearted and not clear even to myself, I  then held that whatever had neither length nor breadth nor density  nor solidity, and did not or could not receive such dimensions,  was absolutely nothing.  For at that time my mind dwelt only with  ideas, which resembled the forms with which my eyes are still  familiar, nor could I see that the act of thought, by which I  formed those ideas, was itself immaterial, and yet it could not  have formed them if it were not itself a measurable entity.      So also I thought about thee, O Life of my life, as stretched  out through infinite space, interpenetrating the whole mass of the  world, reaching out beyond in all directions, to immensity without  end; so that the earth should have thee, the heaven have thee, all  things have thee, and all of them be limited in thee, while thou  art placed nowhere at all.  As the body of the air above the earth  does not bar the passage of the light of the sun, so that the  light penetrates it, not by bursting nor dividing, but filling it  entirely, so I imagined that the body of heaven and air and sea,  and even of the earth, was all open to thee and, in all its  greatest parts as well as the smallest, was ready to receive thy  presence by a secret inspiration which, from within or without  all, orders all things thou hast created.  This was my conjecture,  because I was unable to think of anything else; yet it was untrue.   For in this way a greater part of the earth would contain a  greater part of thee; a smaller part, a smaller fraction of thee.   All things would be full of thee in such a sense that there would  be more of thee in an elephant than in a sparrow, because one is  larger than the other and fills a larger space.  And this would  make the portions of thyself present in the several portions of  the world in fragments, great to the great, small to the small.   But thou art not such a one.  But as yet thou hadst not  enlightened my darkness. CHAPTER II 3.  But it was not sufficient for me, O Lord, to be able to  oppose those deceived deceivers and those dumb orators -- dumb  because thy Word did not sound forth from them -- to oppose them  with the answer which, in the old Carthaginian days, Nebridius  used to propound, shaking all of us who heard it: &quot;What could this  imaginary people of darkness, which the Manicheans usually set up  as an army opposed to thee, have done to thee if thou hadst  declined the combat?&quot;  If they replied that it could have hurt  thee, they would then have made thee violable and corruptible.   If, on the other hand, the dark could have done thee no harm, then  there was no cause for any battle at all; there was less cause for  a battle in which a part of thee, one of thy members, a child of  thy own substance, should be mixed up with opposing powers, not of  thy creation; and should be corrupted and deteriorated and changed  by them from happiness into misery, so that it could not be  delivered and cleansed without thy help.  This offspring of thy  substance was supposed to be the human soul to which thy Word --  free, pure, and entire -- could bring help when it was being  enslaved, contaminated, and corrupted.  But on their hypothesis  that Word was itself corruptible because it is one and the same  substance as the soul.      And therefore if they admitted that thy nature -- whatsoever  thou art -- is incorruptible, then all these assertions of theirs  are false and should be rejected with horror.  But if thy  substance is corruptible, then this is self-evidently false and  should be abhorred at first utterance.  This line of argument,  then, was enough against those deceivers who ought to be cast  forth from a surfeited stomach -- for out of this dilemma they  could find no way of escape without dreadful sacrilege of mind and  tongue, when they think and speak such things about thee. CHAPTER III 4.  But as yet, although I said and was firmly persuaded that  thou our Lord, the true God, who madest not only our souls but our  bodies as well -- and not only our souls and bodies but all  creatures and all things -- wast free from stain and alteration  and in no way mutable, yet I could not readily and clearly  understand what was the cause of evil.  Whatever it was, I  realized that the question must be so analyzed as not to constrain  me by any answer to believe that the immutable God was mutable,  lest I should myself become the thing that I was seeking out.  And  so I pursued the search with a quiet mind, now in a confident  feeling that what had been said by the Manicheans -- and I shrank  from them with my whole heart -- could not be true.  I now  realized that when they asked what was the origin of evil their  answer was dictated by a wicked pride, which would rather affirm  that thy nature is capable of suffering evil than that their own  nature is capable of doing it.5.  And I directed my attention to understand what I now was  told, that free will is the cause of our doing evil and that thy  just judgment is the cause of our having to suffer from its  consequences.  But I could not see this clearly.  So then, trying  to draw the eye of my mind up out of that pit, I was plunged back  into it again, and trying often was just as often plunged back  down.  But one thing lifted me up toward thy light: it was that I  had come to know that I had a will as certainly as I knew that I  had life.  When, therefore, I willed or was unwilling to do  something, I was utterly certain that it was none but myself who  willed or was unwilling -- and immediately I realized that there  was the cause of my sin.  I could see that what I did against my  will I suffered rather than did; and I did not regard such actions  as faults, but rather as punishments in which I might quickly  confess that I was not unjustly punished, since I believed thee to  be most just.  Who was it that put this in me, and implanted in me  the root of bitterness, in spite of the fact that I was altogether  the handiwork of my most sweet God?  If the devil is to blame, who  made the devil himself?  And if he was a good angel who by his own  wicked will became the devil, how did there happen to be in him  that wicked will by which he became a devil, since a good Creator  made him wholly a good angel?  By these reflections was I again  cast down and stultified.  Yet I was not plunged into that hell of  error -- where no man confesses to thee -- where I thought that  thou didst suffer evil, rather than that men do it. CHAPTER IV 6.  For in my struggle to solve the rest of my difficulties,  I now assumed henceforth as settled truth that the incorruptible  must be superior to the corruptible, and I did acknowledge that  thou, whatever thou art, art incorruptible.  For there never yet  was, nor will be, a soul able to conceive of anything better than  thee, who art the highest and best good.[179]  And since most  truly and certainly the incorruptible is to be placed above the  corruptible -- as I now admit it -- it followed that I could rise  in my thoughts to something better than my God, if thou wert not  incorruptible.  When, therefore, I saw that the incorruptible was  to be preferred to the corruptible, I saw then where I ought to  seek thee, and where I should look for the source of evil: that  is, the corruption by which thy substance can in no way be  profaned.  For it is obvious that corruption in no way injures our  God, by no inclination, by no necessity, by no unforeseen chance  -- because he is our God, and what he wills is good, and he  himself is that good.  But to be corrupted is not good.  Nor art  thou compelled to do anything against thy will, since thy will is  not greater than thy power.  But it would have to be greater if  thou thyself wert greater than thyself -- for the will and power  of God are God himself.  And what can take thee by surprise, since  thou knowest all, and there is no sort of nature but thou knowest  it?  And what more should we say about why that substance which  God is cannot be corrupted; because if this were so it could not  be God? CHAPTER V 7.  And I kept seeking for an answer to the question, Whence  is evil?  And I sought it in an evil way, and I did not see the  evil in my very search. I marshaled before the sight of my spirit  all creation: all that we see of earth and sea and air and stars  and trees and animals; and all that we do not see, the firmament  of the sky above and all the angels and all spiritual things, for  my imagination arranged these also, as if they were bodies, in  this place or that.  And I pictured to myself thy creation as one  vast mass, composed of various kinds of bodies -- some of which  were actually bodies, some of those which I imagined spirits were  like.  I pictured this mass as vast -- of course not in its full  dimensions, for these I could not know -- but as large as I could  possibly think, still only finite on every side.  But thou, O  Lord, I imagined as environing the mass on every side and  penetrating it, still infinite in every direction -- as if there  were a sea everywhere, and everywhere through measureless space  nothing but an infinite sea; and it contained within itself some  sort of sponge, huge but still finite, so that the sponge would in  all its parts be filled from the immeasurable sea.[180]      Thus I conceived thy creation itself to be finite, and filled  by thee, the infinite.  And I said, &quot;Behold God, and behold what  God hath created!&quot;  God is good, yea, most mightily and  incomparably better than all his works.  But yet he who is good  has created them good; behold how he encircles and fills them.   Where, then, is evil, and whence does it come and how has it crept  in?  What is its root and what its seed?  Has it no being at all?   Why, then, do we fear and shun what has no being?  Or if we fear  it needlessly, then surely that fear is evil by which the heart is  unnecessarily stabbed and tortured -- and indeed a greater evil  since we have nothing real to fear, and yet do fear.  Therefore,  either that is evil which we fear, or the act of fearing is in  itself evil.  But, then, whence does it come, since God who is  good has made all these things good?  Indeed, he is the greatest  and chiefest Good, and hath created these lesser goods; but both  Creator and created are all good.  Whence, then, is evil?  Or,  again, was there some evil matter out of which he made and formed  and ordered it, but left something in his creation that he did not  convert into good?  But why should this be?  Was he powerless to  change the whole lump so that no evil would remain in it, if he is  the Omnipotent?  Finally, why would he make anything at all out of  such stuff?  Why did he not, rather, annihilate it by his same  almighty power?  Could evil exist contrary to his will?  And if it  were from eternity, why did he permit it to be nonexistent for  unmeasured intervals of time in the past, and why, then, was he  pleased to make something out of it after so long a time?  Or, if  he wished now all of a sudden to create something, would not an  almighty being have chosen to annihilate this evil matter and live  by himself -- the perfect, true, sovereign, and infinite Good?   Or, if it were not good that he who was good should not also be  the framer and creator of what was good, then why was that evil  matter not removed and brought to nothing, so that he might form  good matter, out of which he might then create all things?  For he  would not be omnipotent if he were not able to create something  good without being assisted by that matter which had not been  created by himself.      Such perplexities I revolved in my wretched breast,  overwhelmed with gnawing cares lest I die before I discovered the  truth.  And still the faith of thy Christ, our Lord and Saviour,  as it was taught me by the Catholic Church, stuck fast in my  heart.  As yet it was unformed on many points and diverged from  the rule of right doctrine, but my mind did not utterly lose it,  and every day drank in more and more of it. CHAPTER VI 8.  By now I had also repudiated the lying divinations and  impious absurdities of the astrologers.  Let thy mercies, out of  the depth of my soul, confess this to thee also, O my God.  For  thou, thou only (for who else is it who calls us back from the  death of all errors except the Life which does not know how to die  and the Wisdom which gives light to minds that need it, although  it itself has no need of light -- by which the whole universe is  governed, even to the fluttering leaves of the trees?) -- thou  alone providedst also for my obstinacy with which I struggled  against Vindicianus, a sagacious old man, and Nebridius, that  remarkably talented young man.  The former declared vehemently and  the latter frequently -- though with some reservation -- that no  art existed by which we foresee future things.  But men&#x27;s surmises  have oftentimes the help of chance, and out of many things which  they foretold some came to pass unawares to the predictors, who  lighted on the truth by making so many guesses.      And thou also providedst a friend for me, who was not a  negligent consulter of the astrologers even though he was not  thoroughly skilled in the art either -- as I said, one who  consulted them out of curiosity.  He knew a good, deal about it,  which, he said, he had heard from his father, and he never  realized how far his ideas would help to overthrow my estimation  of that art.  His name was Firminus and he had received a liberal  education and was a cultivated rhetorician.  It so happened that  he consulted me, as one very dear to him, as to what I thought  about some affairs of his in which his worldly hopes had risen,  viewed in the light of his so-called horoscope.  Although I had  now begun to learn in this matter toward Nebridius&#x27; opinion, I did  not quite decline to speculate about the matter or to tell him  what thoughts still came into my irresolute mind, although I did  add that I was almost persuaded now that these were but empty and  ridiculous follies.  He then told me that his father had been very  much interested in such books, and that he had a friend who was as  much interested in them as he was himself.  They, in combined  study and consultation, fanned the flame of their affection for  this folly, going so far as to observe the moment when the dumb  animals which belonged to their household gave birth to young, and  then observed the position of the heavens with regard to them, so  as to gather fresh evidence for this so-called art.  Moreover, he  reported that his father had told him that, at the same time his  mother was about to give birth to him [Firminus], a female slave  of a friend of his father&#x27;s was also pregnant.  This could not be  hidden from her master, who kept records with the most diligent  exactness of the birth dates even of his dogs.  And so it happened  to pass that -- under the most careful observations, one for his  wife and the other for his servant, with exact calculations of the  days, hours, and minutes -- both women were delivered at the same  moment, so that both were compelled to cast the selfsame  horoscope, down to the minute: the one for his son, the other for  his young slave.  For as soon as the women began to be in labor,  they each sent word to the other as to what was happening in their  respective houses and had messengers ready to dispatch to one  another as soon as they had information of the actual birth -- and  each, of course, knew instantly the exact time.  It turned out,  Firminus said, that the messengers from the respective houses met  one another at a point equidistant from either house, so that  neither of them could discern any difference either in the  position of the stars or any other of the most minute points.  And  yet Firminus, born in a high estate in his parents&#x27; house, ran his  course through the prosperous paths of this world, was increased  in wealth, and elevated to honors.  At the same time, the slave,  the yoke of his condition being still unrelaxed, continued to  serve his masters as Firminus, who knew him, was able to report.      9.  Upon hearing and believing these things related by so  reliable a person all my resistance melted away.  First, I  endeavored to reclaim Firminus himself from his superstition by  telling him that after inspecting his horoscope, I ought, if I  could foretell truly, to have seen in it parents eminent among  their neighbors, a noble family in its own city, a good birth, a  proper education, and liberal learning.  But if that servant had  consulted me with the same horoscope, since he had the same one, I  ought again to tell him likewise truly that I saw in it the  lowliness of his origin, the abjectness of his condition, and  everything else different and contrary to the former prediction.   If, then, by casting up the same horoscopes I should, in order to  speak the truth, make contrary analyses, or else speak falsely if  I made identical readings, then surely it followed that whatever  was truly foretold by the analysis of the horoscopes was not by  art, but by chance.  And whatever was said falsely was not from  incompetence in the art, but from the error of chance.      10.  An opening being thus made in my darkness, I began to  consider other implications involved here.  Suppose that one of  the fools -- who followed such an occupation and whom I longed to  assail, and to reduce to confusion -- should urge against me that  Firminus had given me false information, or that his father had  informed him falsely.  I then turned my thoughts to those that are  born twins, who generally come out of the womb so near the one to  the other that the short interval between them -- whatever  importance they may ascribe to it in the nature of things --  cannot be noted by human observation or expressed in those tables  which the astrologer uses to examine when he undertakes to  pronounce the truth.  But such pronouncements cannot be true.  For  looking into the same horoscopes, he must have foretold the same  future for Esau and Jacob,[181] whereas the same future did not  turn out for them.  He must therefore speak falsely.  If he is to  speak truly, then he must read contrary predictions into the same  horoscopes.  But this would mean that it was not by art, but by  chance, that he would speak truly.      For thou, O Lord, most righteous ruler of the universe, dost  work by a secret impulse -- whether those who inquire or those  inquired of know it or not -- so that the inquirer may hear what,  according to the secret merit of his soul, he ought to hear from  the deeps of thy righteous judgment.  Therefore let no man say to  thee, &quot;What is this?&quot; or, &quot;Why is that?&quot; Let him not speak thus,  for he is only a man. CHAPTER VII 11.  By now, O my Helper, thou hadst freed me from those  fetters.  But still I inquired, &quot;Whence is evil?&quot; -- and found no  answer.  But thou didst not allow me to be carried away from the  faith by these fluctuations of thought.  I still believed both  that thou dost exist and that thy substance is immutable, and that  thou dost care for and wilt judge all men, and that in Christ, thy  Son our Lord, and the Holy Scriptures, which the authority of thy  Catholic Church pressed on me, thou hast planned the way of man&#x27;s  salvation to that life which is to come after this death.      With these convictions safe and immovably settled in my mind,  I eagerly inquired, &quot;Whence is evil?&quot;  What torments did my  travailing heart then endure!  What sighs, O my God!  Yet even  then thy ears were open and I knew it not, and when in stillness I  sought earnestly, those silent contritions of my soul were loud  cries to thy mercy.  No man knew, but thou knewest what I endured.   How little of it could I express in words to the ears of my  dearest friends!  How could the whole tumult of my soul, for which  neither time nor speech was sufficient, come to them?  Yet the  whole of it went into thy ears, all of which I bellowed out in the  anguish of my heart.  My desire was before thee, and the light of  my eyes was not with me; for it was within and I was without.  Nor  was that light in any place; but I still kept thinking only of  things that are contained in a place, and could find among them no  place to rest in.  They did not receive me in such a way that I  could say, &quot;It is sufficient; it is well.&quot; Nor did they allow me  to turn back to where it might be well enough with me.  For I was  higher than they, though lower than thou.  Thou art my true joy if  I depend upon thee, and thou hadst subjected to me what thou didst  create lower than I.  And this was the true mean and middle way of  salvation for me, to continue in thy image and by serving thee  have dominion over the body.  But when I lifted myself proudly  against thee, and &quot;ran against the Lord, even against his neck,  with the thick bosses of my buckler,&quot;[182] even the lower things  were placed above me and pressed down on me, so that there was no  respite or breathing space.  They thrust on my sight on every  side, in crowds and masses, and when I tried to think, the images  of bodies obtruded themselves into my way back to thee, as if they  would say to me, &quot;Where are you going, unworthy and unclean one?&quot;  And all these had sprung out of my wound, for thou hadst humbled  the haughty as one that is wounded.  By my swelling pride I was  separated from thee, and my bloated cheeks blinded my eyes. CHAPTER VIII 12.  But thou, O Lord, art forever the same, yet thou art not  forever angry with us, for thou hast compassion on our dust and  ashes.[183]  It was pleasing in thy sight to reform my deformity,  and by inward stings thou didst disturb me so that I was impatient  until thou wert made clear to my inward sight.  By the secret hand  of thy healing my swelling was lessened, the disordered and  darkened eyesight of my mind was from day to day made whole by the  stinging salve of wholesome grief.</div></div></div><div class="loadMoreContainer_AJDI"><button class="loadMoreButton_i_aG">See more</button></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container
