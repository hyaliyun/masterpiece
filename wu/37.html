DESCENT. According to the supporters of the Fitzgerald-Irish origin of the clan, Otho had a son Fitz-Otho, who is on record as his father&#x27;s successor  as Castellan of Windsor in 1078.  Fitz-Otho is said to have had three sons. Gerald, the eldest, under the name of Fitz-Walter, is said to have married,  in 1112, Nesta, daughter of a Prince of South Wales, by whom he also had  three sons.  Fitz-Walter&#x27;s eldest son, Maurice, succeeded his father, and accompanied Richard Strongbow to Ireland in 1170. He was afterwards  created Baron of Wicklow and Naas Offelim of the territory of the  Macleans for distinguished services rendered in the subjugation of that  country, by Henry II., who on his return to England in 1172 left Maurice in  the joint Government. Maurice married Alicia, daughter of Arnulph de Montgomery,  brother of Robert Earl of Shrewsbury, and by that lady had four sons.  The eldest was known as Gerald Fitz-Maurice, who in due course succeeded his father, and was created Lord Offaly.  Having married Catherine, daughter of Hamo de Valois, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, he had a son,  named Maurice after his grandfather.  This Maurice died in 1257, leaving  two sons, Thomas and Gerald.  Thomas, generally called &quot;Tomas Mor,&quot; or  Great Thomas, on account of his great valour and signal services in the  battlefield, succeeded his father as Lord Offaly.  He married the only  daughter of Thomas Carron.  This lady brought him the Seigniory of  Desmond as a dowry.  By her Thomas Lord Offaly had an only son, John,  who, according to Colin Fitzgerald&#x27;s supporters, was first Earl of Kildare  and married first, Marjory, daughter of Sir Thomas Fitz-Antony, by whom  he had issue--Maurice, progenitor of the Dukes of Leinster.  John married, secondly, Honora, daughter of Hugh O&#x27;Connor, by whom he had six sons,  the eldest of whom, according to the Irish-origin theory, was Colin Fitz-Gerald--but who, if the Fitzgerald theory had not been a pure invention, really ought to have been called Colin Fitz-John, or son of John--the  reputed ancestor of the Mackenzies. This, briefly stated, is the genealogy of the Fitzgeralds as given by  the supporters of the Irish origin of the Mackenzies, and it may be right or  wrong for all we need care in discussing the origin of the Mackenzies.  Its  accuracy will, however, be proved impossible. According to the true genealogy, Thomas, who was the third son of Maurice, married Rohesia, heiress of Woodstock, near Athy, and daughter  of Richard de St. Michael, Lord of Rheban. By this lady he had an only  son, John, who succeeded as 6th Baron Offaly, and was in 1316 created  1st Earl of Kildare.  John married Blanche, daughter of John Roche, Baron of Fermoy; not the two ladies given him in the Fitzgerald-Mackenzie  genealogy. The real authentic genealogy of the Fitzgeralds, from whom the Dukes of Leinster and other Fitzgerald families are descended, is as  follows:--The first, I.  OTHO, known as &quot;Dominus Otho,&quot; belonged undoubtedly to  the Gherardini family of Florence.  He passed into Normandy, and in 1057  crossed into England, became a favourite with Edward the Confessor, and  obtained extensive estates from that monarch. He had a son II.  WALTER  FITZ  OTHO, or son of Otho.  He is mentioned in  Domesday Book in 1078 as being then in possession of his father&#x27;s  estates.  He was Castellan of Windsor and Warden of the Forests in  Berkshire.  He married Gladys, daughter of Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn, Prince  of North Wales, and had three sons, the eldest being III.  GERALD  FITZ  WALTER, or son of Walter, who was  appointed by Henry I. to the Constableship of Pembroke Castle and other  important offices.  He married Nesta, daughter of Rhys ap Gruffyd, ap  Tudor Mawr, Prince of South Wales, and had issue by her, three sons, the  eldest of whom was IV.  MAURICE  FITZ GERALD, or son of Gerald. This, it will be  noticed, was the first Fitzgerald of which we have any record, and he was the progenitor of the Irish Fitzgeralds.  He accompanied Richard de Clare,  Earl of Pembroke, popularly known as &quot;Strongbow,&quot; to Ireland, and there highly distinguished himself, having, among other acts of renown, captured the city of Dublin.  He died at Wexford in 1177.  He married Alice or Alicia, daughter of Arnulph de Montgomery, fourth son of Roger  de Montgomery, who led the centre of the Norman army at the battle of  Hastings, and by her had issue--five sons, the eldest of whom was  William, Baron of Naas, not Gerald as claimed by the supporters of the  Colin Fitzgerald theory. Thus far the two genealogies may be said to agree, except in a few of the marriages. V.  GERALD  FITZ  MAURICE, the second son, in 1205 became  first Baron Offaly.  The third son, Thomas, was progenitor of the original Earls of Desmond, who have long been extinct in the male line, the present Earldom, which is the Irish title of the Earl of Denbigh, having  been created in 1622.  Gerald Fitz Maurice married Katherine, daughter of Hamo de Valois, who was Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1197, and by  her had a son, VI.  MAURICE  FITZ  GERALD, second Baron Offaly, one of the  Lord Justices of Ireland. Maurice died in 1257, having married Juliana,  daughter of John de Cogan, who was Lord Justice of Ireland in 1247, and  by her had three sons, Maurice, Gerald, and Thomas.  Maurice Fitzgerald  has no wife given him in the Colin Fitzgerald genealogy.  Thomas, the  youngest son, had a son John, who ultimately, on the death of Maurice,  fifth Baron Offaly, without issue, succeeded as sixth Baron, and was, on the 14th May, 1316, created the first Earl of Kildare.  Maurice Fitz Gerald  was succeeded by his eldest son, VII.  MAURICE  FITZ MAURICE, as third Baron Offaly.  He  married Emelina, daughter of Sir Stephen de Longespee, a rich heiress,  and by her had a son and two daughters. He was succeeded by his only  son, VIII.  GERALD  FITZ MAURICE, 4th Baron Offaly, who died  without issue in 1287, when he was succeeded by his cousin Maurice, only  son of Gerald, second son of Maurice Fitzgerald, second Baron Offaly, as IX.  MAURICE FITZGERALD, 5th Baron Offaly, who married  Agnes de Valance, daughter of William Earl of Pembroke, without issue,  when he was succeeded by his cousin John, son of Thomas, third son of  Maurice Fitzgerald, second Baron Offaly, as X.  JOHN  FITZ  THOMAS  FITZ GERALD, sixth Baron Offaly,  and first Earl of Kildare.  From him, by his wife Blanche, daughter of John  Roche, Baron of Fermoy, are descended the present Duke of Leinster and  other Irish Fitzgeralds. He died on the 10th November, 1316.  Several important particulars bearing on the points in dispute are  noticeable in this genuine Fitzgerald genealogy, a few of which may be  remarked upon.  (1) There is no trace of a Colin Fitzgerald, or of any other  Colin, in the real family genealogy from beginning to end, down to the present day.  (2) Gerald, the 4th Baron Offaly, died in 1287.  He was  succeeded by his cousin Maurice, as 5th Baron, who in turn war  succeeded by his cousin John Fitz Thomas Fitz Gerald, who died comparatively young in 1316.  According to the Colin Fitzgerald theory,  this John, first Earl of Kildare, was twice married, and by his second wife  had six sons, of whom Colin Fitzgerald, who really ought to have been  described as Colin Fitz John--for it will be observed that the Chiefs in the  real genealogy are invariably described as Fitz or son of their fathers--was  the eldest.  This was impossible.  How could John Fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, who died at a comparatively early age in 1316, have had a son by his  second marriage, who must have arrived at a mature age before he &quot;was driven&quot; from Ireland to Scotland in 1261, and be able to fight, as alleged  by his supporters, with great distinction, as a warrior who had already an  established reputation, at the battle of Largs, in 1263? Let us suppose that  Colin&#x27;s reputed father was 70 years old when he died.  He (the father)  must thus have been born as early as 1246.  Let us take it that his eldest  son, the reputed Colin, by his second wife, was born when his father was  only 24 years of age--say in 1270--and the result of the Fitzgerald origin theory would be that Colin must have fought at the battle of Largs 7 years  before, according to the laws of nature, he could have been born.  In other  words, he was not born, if born at all, for seven years after the battle of  Largs, four years after the reputed charter of 1266, and 40 years  subsequent to 1230, the last year in which either of the witnesses whose  names are upon the alleged charter itself was in life.  (3) But take the  genealogy as given by the upholders of the Colin Fitzgerald origin  themselves Maurice, who died in 1257, had, according to it, two sons--Thomas and Gerald. This Thomas, they say, succeeded his father as third  Lord Offaly, and had a son, John, who, by his second wife, had Colin Fitzgerald. That is, Maurice, who died in 1257, had a great grandson Colin, who, as a warrior of mature years and experience, fought at the battle of Largs only six years after his great-grandfathers death. But there was in  fact no Earl of Kildare at this early date.  That title was, as already stated,  not created until 1316, twenty-eight years after his son Colin Fitzgerald was, according to the testimony of his supporters, buried in Icolmkill. It is  surely unnecessary to add that such a consummation is absolutely  impossible; and these facts alone, though no other shred of evidence was  forthcoming, would dispose of the Colin Fitzgerald origin of the  Mackenzies for ever. Colin&#x27;s five brothers are given by the upholders of the Fitzgerald origin as Galen, said to have been the same as Gilleon or Gillean, the ancestor of the Macleans; Gilbert, ancestor of the White Knights; John,  ancestor of the Knights of Glynn; Maurice, ancestor of the Knights of  Kerry; and Thomas, progenitor of the Fitzgeralds of Limerick.  But it is  quite unnecessary to deal with Colin&#x27;s brothers and their descendants here. It will be sufficient if we dispose of Colin himself, who, according to the  genealogy given to him by those who claim him as their progenitor, was  really not Colin Fitz-Gerald but Colin Fitz-John. He must, however, be  dealt with a little more at length; for, whoever he may have been, and  however mythical his personal history, his name will always command a  certain amount of interest for members of the Clan Mackenzie, and those  who have become allied with them by marriage or association.  Most of us are acquainted with the turbulent state of the West  Highlands and Islands in the reign of Alexander II., when the Highland  Chiefs became so powerful, and were so remote from the centre of  Government, that they could not be brought under the King&#x27;s authority.   His Majesty determined to make a serious effort to reduce these men to  obedience, and for this purpose he proceeded, at the head of a large force,  but died on his way in 1249, on the Island of Kerrera, leaving his son, Alexander III., then only nine years of age, with the full weight and  responsibility of government on his shoulders.  Shortly after the King attained his majority, Colin Fitzgerald,  correctly speaking Fitz John is said to have been driven out of Ireland and  to have sought refuge at the Scottish Court, where he was heartily  welcomed by the King, by whom his rank and prowess well known to him  by repute, were duly recognised and acknowledged. At this time Alexander was preparing to meet Haco, King of  Norway, who, on the 2nd of October, 1262, landed with a large force on  the coast of Ayrshire, where he was met by a gallant force of fifteen hundred knights splendidly mounted on magnificent chargers--many of  them of pure Spanish breed--wearing breastplates, while their riders, clad  in complete armour, with a numerous army of foot armed with spears,  bows and arrows, and other weapons of war, according to the usage in  their respective provinces, the whole of this valiant force led by the King  in person.  These splendid, well-accoutred armies met at Largs two or  three days after, and then commenced that sanguinary and memorable  engagement which was the first decisive check to the arrogance of the  Norsemen who had so long held sway in the West Highlands and Isles,  and the first opening up of the channel which led to the subsequent  arrangements between Alexander III. of Scotland and Magnus IV. of  Norway in consequence of which an entirely new organisation was  introduced into the Hebrides, then inhabited by a mixed race composed of  the natives and largely of the descendants of successive immigrant  colonists of Norwegians and Danes who had settled in the country.  In this memorable engagement, we are told, the Scots commenced  the attack.  The right wing, composed of the men of Argyle, of Lennox, of Athole, and Galloway, was commanded by Alexander, Lord High  Steward, while Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, commanded the left wing,  composed of the men of the Lothians, Berwick, Stirling, and Fife.  The  King placed himself in the centre, at the head of the choice men of Ross, Perth, Angus, Mearns, Mar, Moray, Inverness, and Caithness, where he  was confronted by Haco in person, who, for the purpose of meeting the  Scottish King, took post in the Norwegian centre. The High Steward, by a dexterous movement, made the enemy&#x27;s left give way, and instantly, by  another adroit manoeuvre, he wheeled back on the rear of Haco&#x27;s centre,  where he found the two warrior Kings desperately engaged.  This induced  Haco, after exhibiting all the prowess of a brave King and an able  commander, to retreat from the field, followed by his left wing, leaving, as  has been variously stated, sixteen to twenty-four thousand of his followers on the field, while the loss on the Scottish side is estimated at about five  thousand.  The men of Caithness and Sutherland were led by the Flemish  Freskin, those of Moray by one of their great chiefs, and there is every  reason to believe that the men of Ross rallied round one of their native  chiefs.  Among the most distinguished warriors who took part in this great  and decisive victory for the Scots, under the immediate eye of their brave King, was, it is said, Colin Fitzgerald, who is referred to in a fragment of  the Record of Icolmkill as &quot;Callenus peregrinus Hibernus nobilis ex  familia Geraldinorum qui proximo anno ab Hibernia pulsus opud regni  benigne acceptus hinc usque in curta permansit et in praefacto proelio  strenue pugnavit.&quot;  That is, &quot;Colin, an Irish stranger and nobleman, of the  family of the Geraldines who, in the previous year, had been driven from  Ireland, and had been well received by the King, remained up to this time at Court, and fought bravely in the aforesaid battle.&quot;  This extract has  often been quoted to prove that Colin Fitzgerald was the progenitor of the Mackenzies; but it will be noticed that it contains no reference whatever to the point.  It merely says that Colin, an Irishman, was present at Largs. After the defeat of Haco the King sent detachments to secure the West Highlands and Isles, and to check the local chiefs.  Among the leaders sent in charge of the Western garrisons was, according to the  supporters of the Irish-origin theory, Colin Fitzgerald, who, under the  patronage of Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith, was settled in the  Government of the Castle of Ellandonnan, the well-known stronghold of  the Mackenzies, in Kintail, situated on a small rocky island at the junction  of Lochalsh, Loch Duich and Loch Long. Colin&#x27;s jurisdiction, it is said, extended over a wide district, and he is referred to in the fragment of the  Record of Icolmkill, already quoted, as he &quot;of whom we have spoken at  the battle of Largs, and who afterwards conducted himself with firmness  against the Islanders, and was left a governor among them.&quot;  Sir George Mackenzie, first Earl of Cromartie, who will be proved later on to have  been the inventor of the Fitzgerald theory, says in a MS. history of the  clan, that Colin &quot;being left in Kintail, tradition records that he married the  daughter of Mac Mhathoin, heritor of the half of Kintail.  This Mhathoin,&quot;  he continues, &quot;is frequently identified with Coinneach Gruamach Mac  Mhathoin, Cailean&#x27;s predecessor as Governor of Ellandonnan Castle.  The  other half of Kintail belonged to O&#x27;Beolan, one of whose chiefs, Ferchair,  was created Earl of Ross, and his lands were given to Cailean Fitzgerald.&quot; It will be proved by incontestible public documents still in existence, that  these identical lands were, except that they once for a time exchanged  them with a relative for lands in Buchan, uninterruptedly possessed by the  Earls of Ross, the descendants of this Ferchair, or Farquhar, for two  centuries after the battle of Largs.  While the Earl of Cromartie and other clan historians accept the  Fitzgerald origin by marriage with a daughter of Kenneth Matheson of  Lochalsh, the Mathesons maintain that the first Mackenzie, or Mac  Choinnich--the actual progenitor of the clan--was a son of their chief, Coinneach Gruamach, and that the Mackenzies are thus only a sept, or  minor branch of the Mathesons. It must in fairness be admitted that the  latter contention is quite as near the truth as the Fitzgerald theory and it  must have already occurred to the reader, how, if the Fitzgerald origin of the Mackenzies had been true, has it come about that the original patronymic of Fitzgerald has given way to that of Mackenzie?  It is not  pretended that it was ever heard of after Colin himself. This difficulty occurred even to the Earl of Cromartie, and this is  how he attempts to dispose of it.  Cailean, he says, had a son by the  daughter of Kenneth Mac Mhathoin, or Matheson, whom he named Coinneach, or Kenneth, after his father-in-law Kenneth Matheson; Cailean  himself was killed in Glaic Chailein by Mac Mhathoin, who envied him,  and was sore displeased at Colin&#x27;s succession to Matheson&#x27;s ancient  heritage; Colin was succeeded by his son Kenneth, and all his descendants were by the Highlanders called &quot;Mac Choinnich,&quot; or Kenneth&#x27;s son,  taking the patronymic from Mac Mhathoin rather than from Cailean,  whom they esteemed a stranger. Of the two theories the Matheson one is  by far the more probable; but they are both without any real foundation.  The Fitzgerald theory has, however, until recently, been accepted  by all the leading Mackenzie families and by the clan generally.  It has  been adopted in all the Peerages and Baronetages, and by almost every writer on the history and genealogy of the Cabar feidh race.  The main if not the only authority of any consequence in favour of this Irish origin is the charter alleged to have been granted by Alexander  III. to Colin in 1266, of which the reputed original runs as follows:-- `Alexander, Dei Gracia, Rex Scottorum omnibus probis hominibus tocius terre sue clericis it laicis, salutem sciant presentes et futuri me pro  fiddi seruicio michi navato per Colinum Hybernum tam in bello quam in  pace ideo dedisse, et hac Presenti carta mea concessisse dicto Colino, et ejus successoribus to/as terras de Kintail Tenendas de nabis et  successoribus nostris in liberam baronium cum g ua rdia Reddendo  servicium fo rinsecum et fidelitatem Testibus Andrea episcopo,  Moraviensi. Wa ltero Stewart. Hen rico de Balioth Camerario. Ama/do de  Campania. Thoma Hostiario, vice-comite de Innerness. Apud Kincardine,  IX die Jan.. Anno Regni Domini, Regis XVI.&quot; This is a literal translation of the document.--&quot;Alexander, by the Grace of God, King of Scots, to all honest men  of his whole dominions, cleric and laic, greeting: Be it known to the  present and future that I, for the faithful service rendered to me by Colin of Ireland, in war as well as peace, therefore I have given, and by this my  present charter I concede to the said Colin and his successors, the lands of  Kintail to be held of us in free barony with ward to render foreign service  and fidelity. Witnesses (as above.) At Kincardine, 9th day of January, in the year of the reign of the Lord the King. the 16th.&quot; The Kincardine at which this charter is alleged to have been signed is supposed to be the place of that name situated on the River Dee; for  about this time an incident is reported to have occurred in the Forest of Mar in connection with which it is traditionally stated that the Mackenzies  adopted the stag&#x27;s head as their coat armour.  The legend is as follows: Alexander was on a hunting expedition in the forest, near Kincardine, when an infuriated stag, closely pursued by the hounds, made straight in  the direction of the King, and Cailean Fitzgerald, who accompanied the  Royal party, gallantly interposed his own person between the exasperated  animal and his Majesty, and shot it with an arrow in the forehead.  The  King in acknowledgment of the Royal gratitude at once issued a diploma  in favour of Colin granting him armorial bearings which were to be, a  stags head puissant, bleeding at the forehead where the arrow pierced it, to  be borne on a field azure, supported by two greyhounds.  The crest to be a dexter arm bearing a naked sword, surrounded by the motto &quot;Fide Parta,  Fide Acta,&quot; which continued to be the distinctive bearings of the  Mackenzies of Seaforth until it was considered expedient, as  corroborating their claims on the extensive possessions of the Macleods of  Lewis, to substitute for the original the crest of that warlike clan, namely,  a mountain in flames, surcharged with the words, &quot;Luceo non uro,&quot; the  ancient shield, supported by two savages, naked, and wreathed about the  head with laurel, armed with clubs issuing fire, which are the bearings  now used by the representatives of the High Chiefs of Kintail.  The incident of the hunting match and Colin Fitzgerald&#x27;s gallant  rescue of Alexander III. was painted by West for &quot;The last of the  Seaforths&quot; in one of those large pictures with which the old Academician  employed and gratified his latter years.  The artist received ?oo for the noble painting, which is still preserved in Brahan Castle, and in his old age he expressed his willingness to give the same sum for it in order to  have it exhibited in his own collection. The first notice of the reputed charter to Colin Fitzgerald is in the  manuscript history of the Mackenzies, by George, first Earl of Cromartie, already quoted, written about the middle of the seventeenth century.  All the later genealogists appear to have taken its authenticity for granted, and  quoted it accordingly.  Dr Skene, the most learned and accurate of all our  Highland historians, expresses his decided opinion that the charter is  forged and absolutely worthless as evidence in favour of the Fitzgerald  origin of the clan.  At pages 223-25 of his Highlanders of Scotland, he  says -- &quot;The Mackenzies have long boasted of their descent from the great Norman family of Fitzgerald in Ireland, and in support of this origin they  produce a fragment of the Records of Icolmkill, and a charter by  Alexander III. to Colin Fitzgerald, the supposed progenitor of the family,  of the lands of Kintail. At first sight these documents might appear  conclusive, but, independently of the somewhat suspicious circumstance  that while these pages have been most freely and generally quoted, no one has ever seen the originals, and the fragment of the Icolmkill Record  merely says that among the actors in the battle of Largs, fought in 1263, was `Peregrinus et Hibernus nobilis ex familia Geraldinorum qui proximo anno Hibernia pulsus apud regni benigne acceptus hinc usque in curta  permansit et in praefacto proelio strenue pugnavit,&#x27; giving not a hint of his  having settled in the Highlands, or of his having become the progenitor of  any Scottish family whatever while as to the supposed charter of  Alexander III., it is equally inconclusive, as it merely grants the lands of  Kintail to Colin Hiberno, the word `Hiberno&#x27; having at the time come into general use as denoting the Highlanders, in the same manner as the word  `Erse&#x27; is now frequently used to express their language; but inconclusive as it is, this charter,&quot; he continues, &quot;cannot be admitted at all, as it bears  the most palpable marks of having been a forgery of a later time, and one by no means happy in its execution.  How such a tradition of the origin of  the Mackenzies ever could have arisen, it is difficult to say but the fact of  their native origin and Gaelic descent is completely set at rest by the  Manuscript of 1450, which has already so often been the means of  detecting the falsehood of the foreign origins of other clans.&quot; Cosmo Innes, another high authority, editor of the Orgines Parachiales Scotia, the most valuable work ever published dealing with  the early history of Scotland, and especially of the Highlands, came to a similar conclusion, and expresses it even more strongly than Dr Skene. At  pages 392-3, Vol. II., he says &quot;The lands of Kintail are said to have been  granted by Alexander III. to Colin, an Irishman of the family of Fitzgerald,  for services done at the battle of Largs. The charter is not extant, and its  genuineness has been doubted.&quot; In a footnote, this learned antiquarian  gives the text of the document, in the same terms as those in which they  have been already quoted from another source, and which, he says, is  &quot;from a copy of the 17th century.&quot;  &quot;If the charter be genuine,&quot; he adds, &quot;it is not of Alexander III., or connected with the battle of Largs (1263). Two of the witnesses, Andrew, Bishop of Moray, and Henry de Baliol, Chamberlain, would correspond with the 16th year of Alexander II.&quot; He  further says that &quot;the writers of the history of the Mackenzies assert also  charters of David II. (1360) and of Robert II. (1380) to `Murdo filius  Kennethi de Kintail,&#x27; but without furnishing any description or means of  testing their authenticity.  No such charters are recorded.&quot; This is emphatic enough and to every unprejudiced mind  absolutely conclusive.  The sixteenth year of the reign of Alexander II.  was 1230; for he ascended the throne in 1214.  It necessarily follows that the charter, if signed at all, must have been signed thirty-three years before  the battle of Largs, and thirty-six years earlier than the actual date written  on the document itself.  If it had any existence before it appeared in the  Earl of Cromartie&#x27;s manuscript of the seventeenth century, it must have  been written during the lives of the witnesses whose names attest it. That  is, according to those who maintain that Colin Fitzgerald was the  progenitor of the Mackenzies, thirty-one years before that adventurer ever  crossed the Irish Channel, and probably several years before he was born, if he ever existed elsewhere than in the Earl of Cromartie&#x27;s fertile  imagination. But this is not all.  It has long been established beyond any possible doubt that the Earls of Ross were the superiors of the lands of  Kintail during the identical period in which the same lands are said to  have been held by Colin Fitzgerald and his descendants as direct vassals of  the Crown. Ferchard Mac an t-Sagairt, Earl of Ross, received a grant of  the lands of Kintail from Alexander II. for services rendered to that  monarch in 1222, and he is again on record as their possessor in 1234,  four years after the latest date on which the reputed charter to Colin  Fitzgerald, keeping in view the witnesses whose names appear on the face  of it, could possibly have been a genuine document.  Even the most  prominent of the clan historians who have so stoutly maintained the  Fitzgerald theory felt bound to admit that, &quot;it cannot be disputed that the Earl of Ross was the Lord paramount under Alexander II., by whom Farquhard Mac an t-Sagairt was recognised in the hereditary dignity of his  predecessors, and who, by another tradition,&quot; Dr George Mackenzie says,  &quot;was a real progenitor of the noble family of Kintail.&quot;  That the Earls of  Ross continued lords paramount long after the death of Colin Fitzgerald,  which event is said to have taken place in 1278, will be incontestibly  proved. But meantime let us return to the Origines Parochiales Scotiae. There we have it stated on authority which no one whose opinion is worth  anything will for a moment call in question. The editor of that remarkable  work says: -- &quot;In 1292 the Sheriffdom of Skye erected by King John Baliol, included the lands of the Earl of Ross in North Argyle, a district which  comprehended Kintail and several other large parishes in Ross (Acts of  Parliament of Scotland, Vol. 1. p. 917).  Between 1306 and 1329 King  Robert Bruce confirmed to the Earl of Ross all his lands including North  Argyle (Robertson&#x27;s Index, p. 16, No. 7; Register of Moray, p. 342). in  1342, William, Earl of Ross, the son and heir of the deceased Hugh, Earl  of Ross, granted to Reginald, the son of Roderick (Ranald Rorissoune or  MacRuaraidh) of the Isles, the ten davochs (or pennylands) of Kintail in  North Argyle (Robertson&#x27;s Index, p. 48, No. 1; p. 99; p. 100, No. 1). The  grant was afterwards confirmed by King David II. (Robertson&#x27;s Index).   About the year 1346 Ranald was succeeded by his sister Amie, the wife of  John of Isla (Gregory p. 27).  Between the years 1362 and 1372, William,  Earl of Ross, exchanged with his brother Hugh of Ross, Lord of Phylorth,  and his heirs, his lands of all Argyle, with the Castle of Ellandonnan, for  Hugh&#x27;s lands in Buchan (Balnagown Charters).  In 1463 the lands of  Kintail were held by Alexander Mackenzie (Gregory, p, 83),&quot; when the  Mackenzies obtained the first authentic charter on record as direct vassals  from the Crown. During the whole of this period--for two hundred years--there is no trace of Colin Fitzgerald or any of his descendants as superiors of the  lands of Kintail in terms of Alexander III.&#x27;s reputed charter of 1266, the  Mackenzies holding all that time from and as direct vassals of their  relatives, the Earls of Ross, who really held the position of Crown vassals  which, according to the upholders of the Fitzgerald theory, had that theory  been true, would have been held by Colin and his posterity.  But neither he  nor any of his reputed descendants appear once on record in that capacity during the whole of these two centuries.  On the contrary, it has now been  proved from unquestionable authentic sources that Kintail was in  possession of the Earls of Ross in, and for at least two generations before,  1296; that King Robert the Bruce confirmed him in these lands in 1306,  and again in 1329; that in 1342 Earl William granted the ten davochs or  pennylands of Kintail--which is its whole extent--to Reginald of the Isles;  that this grant was afterwards confirmed by David II.; and that between  the years 1362 and 1372 the Earl of Ross exchanged the lands of Kintail, including the Castle of Ellandonnan, with his brother Hugh for lands in  Buchan. These historical events could never have occurred had the  Mackenzies occupied the position as immediate vassals of the Crown  contended for by the supporters of the Fitzgerald theory of the origin of the clan. It is admitted by those who uphold the claims of Colin Fitzgerald  that the half of Kintail belonged to Farquhar O&#x27;Beolan, Earl of Ross, after  what they describe as the other half had been granted by the King to Colin  Fitzgerald.  But as it is conclusively established that the ten pennylands,  being the whole extent of Kintail were all the time, before and after, in possession of the Earls of Ross, this historical myth must follow the rest. Even the Laird of Applecross, in his MS. history of the clan, written in  1669, although he adopts the Fitzgerald  theory from his friend and  contemporary the Earl of Cromartie, has his doubts. After quoting the  statement, that &quot;the other half of Kintail at this time belonged to  O&#x27;Beolan, whose chief, called Farquhar, was created  Earl of Ross, and  that his lands in Kintail were given by the King to Colin Fitzgerald,&quot; he says, &quot;this tradition carries enough of probability to found historical credit,  but I find no charter of these lands purporting any such grounds for that the first charter of Kintail is given by this King Alexander to this Colin,  anno 1266.&quot;  That is, Alexander III.  But enough has been said on this part of the subject.  Let us,  however, briefly quote two well-known modern writers.  The late Robert  Carruthers, LL.D., Inverness, had occasion several years ago to examine  the Seaforth family papers for the purpose of reviewing them in the North British Quarterly Review.  He did not publish all that he had written on the subject, and he was good enough to present the writer, when preparing the first edition of this work, with some valuable MS. notes on the clan  which had not before appeared in print.  In one of these notes Dr  Carruthers says -- &quot;The chivalrous and romantic origin of the Clan Mackenzie,  though vouched for by certain charters and local histories, is now believed to be fabulous. It seems to have been first advanced in the 17th century, when there was an absurd desire and ambition in Scotland to fabricate or  magnify all ancient and lordly pedigrees.  Sir George Mackenzie of  Tarbat, the Lord Advocate, and Sir George Mackenzie, the first Earl of  Cromartie, were ready to swear to the descent of the Scots nation from  Gathelus, son of Cecrops, King of Athens, and Scota his wife, daughter of Pharaoh, King of Egypt; and, of course, they were no less eager to claim a  lofty and illustrious lineage for their own clan.  But authentic history is  silent as to the two wandering Irish Knights, and the reputed charter (the  elder one being palpably erroneous) cannot now be found.  For two  centuries after the reigns of the Alexanders, the district of Kintail formed  pin of the lordship of the Isles, and was held by the Earls of Ross.  The Mackenzies, however, can he easily traced to their wild mountainous and  picturesque country--Ceann-da-Shail--the Head of the two Seas.&quot; This is from an independent, impartial writer who had  no interest whatever in supporting either the one theory or the other.  Sir William  Fraser, the well-known  author of so many valuable  private family histories, incidentally refers to the forged charter in his  Earls of Cromartie, written specially for the late Duke of Sutherland.  He  was naturally unwilling to offend the susceptibilities of the Mackenzie  chiefs, all of whom had hitherto claimed Colin Fitzgerald as their  progenitor, but he was forced to admit the inconclusive character of the  disputed charter, and that no such charter was granted to Colin Fitzgerald  by Alexander III.  Sir William says:--&quot;In the middle of the seventeenth  century, when Lord Cromartie wrote his history, the means of  ascertaining, by the names of witnesses and other ways, the true granter of  a charter and the date were not so accessible as at present.  The mistake of  attributing the Kintail charter to King Alexander the Third, instead of  King Alexander the Second, cannot be regarded as a very serious error in  the circumstances.&quot;  Sir William, it will be observed, gives up the charter  from Alexander III.  The mere admission that it is not of Alexander III.  is  conclusive against its ever having been granted to Colin Fitzgerald at all,  for, as already pointed out, that adventurer, if he ever existed, did not, even according to his stoutest supporters, cross the Irish Channel, nor was  he ever heard of on this side of it, for more than thirty years after the date  written on the face of the document itself could possibly have been  genuine, the witnesses whose names appear as attesting it having been in  there graves for more than a generation before the battle of Largs was  fought. When the ablest upholders of the Colin Fitzgerald theory are  obliged to make  such admissions and explanations as these, they explain away their whole case and they must be held to have practically given it  up for once admit, as Sir William Fraser does, that the charter is of the reign of Alexander II. (1230), it cannot possibly have any reference to  Colin  Fitzgerald, who, according to those who support the Irish origin of  the clan, only arrived in Scotland from Ireland in 1262 and it is equally absurd and impossible to maintain that a charter granted in 1230 could  have been a reward for services rendered or valour displayed at the battle  of Largs, which was fought in 1263, to say nothing of the now admittedly impossible date and signatures written on the face of the document itself;  and Sir William Fraser having, by the logic of facts, been forced to give up  that crucial point, should in consistency have at the same time given up  Colin Fitzgerald.  And in reality he practically did so, for having stated  that the later reputed charters of 1360 and 1380 are not now known to  exist, he adds, &quot;But the terms of them as quoted in the early histories of  the family are consistent with either theory of the origin of the  Mackenzies, whether descended from Colin Fitzgerald or Colin of the  Aird.&quot; In this he is quite correct; but it is impossible to say the same thing  of the earlier charter, which all the authorities worth listening to now  admit to be a palpable forgery of the seventeenth century; and Sir William  virtually admits as much. There is one other fact which alone would be almost conclusive against the Fitzgerald theory.  Not a single man of the name Colin is  found, either among the chiefs or members of the clan from their first  appearance in history until we come to Colin cam Mackenzie XI. of  Kintail, who succeeded in June, 1568--a period of three hundred years  after the alleged date of the reputed charter to Colin Fitzgerald.  Colin Cam was a second son, his eldest brother, Murdoch, having died during  his father&#x27;s life and before he attained majority, when Colin became heir to the estates.  It was then, as now, a common custom to name the second  son after some prominent member of his mother&#x27;s family, and this was, no  doubt, what was done in the case of Colin Cam, the first Colin who  appears--as late as the middle of the sixteenth century--in the genealogy of the Mackenzies.  His mother was Lady Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of John, Earl of Atholl, by Lady Mary Campbell, daughter of Archibald, second, and sister of Colin, third Earl of Argyll.  Colin Cam Mackenzie  XI. of Kintail, and the first of the name in the family genealogy, was thus  called Colin by his mother, Lady Elizabeth Stewart, after her uncle Colin,  third Earl of Argyll.  It scarcely needs to be pointed out how very improbable it is that,  had Colin Fitzgerald been really the progenitor of the Mackenzies, his  name would have been so completely ignored as a family name for more than  three  hundred years in face of the invariable custom among all other  notable Highland houses of honouring their direct ancestors by continuing their names as the leading names in the family genealogy. It is believed that no one who brings an  independent,  unprejudiced. mind to bear upon the question discussed in the preceding  pages can help coming to the conclusion that the Colin Fitzgerald theory is completely disposed of.  It is indeed extremely doubtful whether such a  person ever existed, but in any case it has been conclusively proved by the  evidence of those who claim him as their ancestor that he never could  have been what they allege--the progenitor of the Mackenzies, whom all  the best authorities now maintain to be of purely native Celtic origin.  And  if this be so, is it not unpatriotic in the highest degree for the heads of our  principal Mackenzie families to persist in supplying Burke, Foster, and  other authors of Peerages, Baronet ages, and County Families, with the details of an alien Irish origin like the impossible Fitzgerald myth upon which they have, in entire error, been feeding their vanity since its  invention by the first Earl of Cromartie little more than two hundred years  ago.   For be it remembered that all these Norman and Florentine  pedigrees and  descents are supplied to the compilers of such genealogical  works as those by members of the respective families themselves, and that the editors are not personally responsible for nor do they in any way  guarantee their accuracy.   It is really difficult to understand the feeling  that has so long prompted most of our leading Highlanders to show such an unnatural and unpatriotic preference for alien progenitors--claiming the Norman enemies and conquerers of their country, or mythical Irish adventurers, as ancestors to be proud of.  Writing of the clans who claim this alien origin the late Dr W. F. Skene, Historiographer Royal for  Scotland, says-- &quot;As the identity of the false aspect which the true tradition, assumes in all these cases implies that the case was the same all, we may assume that wherever these two circumstances are to he found combined,  of a clan claiming a foreign origin and asserting a marriage with the  heiress of a Highland family whose estates they possessed and whose  followers they led, they must invariably have been the oldest cadet of that  family, who, by usurpation or otherwise, had become de facto chief of the clan, and who covered their defect by right of blood by denying their  descent from the clan, and asserting that the founder had married the  heiress of its chief.&quot; [Highlands and Highlanders.] In his later and more important work the same learned historian discusses this question at great length.  He analyses all the doubtful  pedigrees and origins claimed by the leading clans. Regarding the  Fitzgerald theory he says, &quot;But the most remarkable of these spurious  origins is that claimed by the Mackenzies.  It appears to have been first put forward by Sir George Mackenzie, first Earl of Cromarty,&quot; who, in his first manuscript, made Colin a son of the Earl of Kildare, but in a later edition, written in 1669, &quot;finding that there was no Earl of Kildare until  1290, he corrects it by making him son of John Fitz-Thomas, chief of the Geraldines in Ireland, and father of John, first Earl of Kildare, who was slain in 1261.&quot;  Dr Skene then summarises the story already known at   length to the reader, quotes the Record of Icolmkill and the forged charter,  and concludes -- &quot;The same mistake is here committed as is usual in manufacturing these pedigree charters, by making it a crown charter erecting the lands  into a barony.  Kintail could not have been a barony at that time, and the  Earl of Ross and not the king was superior, for in 1342 the Earl of Ross  grants the ten davochs of the lands of Kintail to Reginald, son of Roderick  of the Isles, and we find that the Mackenzies held their lands of the Earls  of Ross and afterwards of the Duke of Ross till 1508, when they were all erected into a barony by King James the Fourth, who gave them a crown  charter.  An examination of the witnesses usually detects these spurious  charters, and in this case it is conclusive against the charter.  Andrew was  bishop of Moray from 1223 to 1242 and there was no bishop of that name  in the reign of Alexander the Third.  Henry de Baliol was chamberlain in  the reign of Alexander the Second, and not of Alexander the Third.   Thomas Hostarius belongs to the same reign, and has been succeeded by  his son Alan long before the date of this charter.&quot; Dr Skene adds that if the Earl of Cromartie was not himself the actual inventor of the whole story, it must have taken its rise not very long  before his day, for, he says, &quot;no trace of it is to be found in the Irish MSS.,  the history of the Geraldine family knows nothing of it, and MacVureach,  who must have been acquainted with the popular history of the western  clans, was equally unacquainted with it.&quot; [Celtic Scotland, Vol. III., pp.  351-354.] This fully corroborates all that was said in the preceding  pages regarding the Fitzgerald-Irish origin of the Mackenzies and which every  intelligent clansman, however biassed, must now admit in his inner  consciousness to be fully and finally disposed of.  Having, however, quoted Skene&#x27;s earlier views on the general  claim by the Highland chiefs for alien progenitors it may be well to give here his more mature conclusions from his later and greater work, especially as some people, who have not taken the trouble to read what he writes, have  been  saying that the great Celtic historian had seen cause to  change his views on these important points in Highland genealogy since  he wrote his Highlands and Highlanders in 1839.  After examining them  all very closely and exhaustively in a long and learned chapter of some  forty pages, he says -- &quot;The conclusion, then, to which this analysis of the clan pedigrees which have been popularly accepted at different times has brought us, is  that, so far as they profess to show the origin of the different clans, they  are entirely artificial and untrustworthy, but that the older genealogies may be accepted as showing--the descent of the clan from its eponymus  or founder, and within reasonable limits for some generations beyond him, while the later spurious pedigrees must be rejected altogether.  It may  seem surprising that such spurious and fabulous origins should be so  readily credited by the clan families as genuine traditions, and receive  such prompt acceptance as the true fount from which they sprung;  but we  must recollect that the fabulous history of Hector Boece was as rapidly and universally adopted as the genuine annals of the national history, and  became rooted in those parts of the country to which its fictitious events  related as local traditions.&quot; [Celtic Scotland, Vol. III., p. 364.] The final decision to which Dr Skene comes in his great work is that the clans, properly so called, were of native origin, and that the  surnames adopted by them were partly of native and partly of foreign  descent.  Among these native Highland clans he unhesitatingly classes the Mackenzies, the clan Gillie-Andres or Rosses, and  the Mathesons, all of  whom belong, he says, to the tribe of Ross.  In his first work on the  Highlands and Highland Clans he draws the general deduction, based on  all our existing MS. genealogies, that the clans were divided into several  great tribes, descended from a common ancestor, but he at the same time  makes a marked distinction between the different tribes which, by indica-tions traceable in each, can be identified with the earldoms or  maormorships into which the North of Scotland was originally divided.   By the aid of the old genealogies he divides the clans into five different tribes in the following order:--(1) The descendants of Conn of the Hundred Battles; (2) of Ferchar Fata Mac Feradaig; (3) of Cormaig Mac  Obertaig; (4) of Fergus Leith Dearg; and (5) of Krycul.  In the third of  these divisions he includes the old Earls of Ross, the Mackenzies, the  Mathesons, and several other clans, and to this classification he adheres,  after the  most mature consideration, in his later and greater work, the  History of Celtic Scotland. THE  REAL  CELTIC  ORIGIN. It is now most interesting to know who the ancient Earls of Ross, from whom the Mackenzies are really descended, were.  The first of these  earls of whom we have any record is Malcolm Mac Heth to whom Malcolm IV. gave Ross in 1157, with the title of Earl of Ross, but the  inhabitants rose against him and drove him out of the district. Wyntoun  mentions an Earl &quot;Gillandrys,&quot; a name which we believe is derived from  the common ancestor of the Mackenzies and Rosses, &quot;Gilleoin-Ard-Rois,&quot;  as one of the six Celtic earls who besieged King Malcolm at Perth in  1160.  Skene is also of opinion that this Gillandres represented the old  Celtic earls of Ross, as the clan bearing the name of Ross are called in  Gaelic Clann Ghilleanrias, or descendants of Gillandres, and may, he  thinks, have led the revolt which drove Malcolm Mac Heth out of the  earldom. The same King, two years after the incident at Perth, gave the  earldom of Ross to Florence, Count of Holland, on that nobleman&#x27;s  marriage with His Majesty&#x27;s sister Ada, in 1162, but the new earl never  secured practical possession [Celtic Scotland, Vol. III., pp. 66-67.]  He is,  however, found claiming it as late as 1179, in the reign of William the  Lion. The district of Ross is often mentioned in the Norse Sagas along with the other parts of the country then governed by Maormors or Jarls,  and Skene in his earlier work says that it was only on the downfall of  those of Moray that the chiefs of Ross appear prominent in historical  records, the Maormors of Moray being in such close proximity to them  and so great in power and influence that the less powerful Maormor of  Ross held only a comparatively subordinate position, and his name was in  consequence seldom or never associated with any of the great events of  that early period in Highland history.  It was only after the disappearance  of those district potentates  that  the chiefs appear under  the appellation  of Comites or Earls. That most, if not all, of these earls were the descendants of the ancient maormors there can be little doubt, and the  natural presumption in this instance is strengthened by the fact that all the  old authorities concur in asserting that the Gaelic name of the original  Earls of Ross was O&#x27;Beolan--a corruption of Gilleoin, or Gillean, na h`Airde--or the descendants of Beolan.  &quot;And we  actually find,&quot; says the same authority, &quot;from the oldest Norse Saga connected with Scotland that  a powerful chief in the North of Scotland named O&#x27;Beolan, married the  daughter of Ganga Rolfe, or Rollo, the celebrated pirate who became  afterwards the celebrated Earl of Normandy.&quot;  If this view is well-founded the ancestor of the Earls of Ross was chief in Kintail as early as the  beginning of the tenth century.  We have seen that the first Earl of Ross recorded in history was  Malcolm Mac Heth, to whom a precept is found, directed by Malcolm IV.,  requesting him to protect the monks of Dunfermline and defend them in  their lawful privileges and possessions.  The document is not dated, but  judging from the names of the witnesses attesting it, the precept must have been issued before 1162.  It will be remembered that Mac Heth was one of  the six Celtic earls who besieged the King at Perth two years before, in  1160.  William the Lion, who seems to have kept the earldom in his own  hands for several years, in 1179 marched into the district at the head of his  earls and barons, accompanied by a large army, and subdued an  insurrection fomented by the local chiefs against his authority.  On this occasion he built two castles within its bounds, one called Dunscath on  the northern Sutor at the entrance to the Cromarty Firth, and Redcastle in  the Black Isle.  In the same year we find Florence, Count of Holland, complaining that he had been deprived of its nominal ownership by King  William.  There is no trace of any other earl in actual possession until we  come to Ferquard or &quot;Ferchair Mac an t&#x27; Sagairt,&quot; Farquhar the son of the Priest, who rose rapidly to power on the ruins of the once powerful Mac  Heth earls of Moray, of which line Kenneth Mac Heth, who, with Donald  Ban, led a force into Moray against Alexander  II., son  of William  the  Lion,  in 1215, was the last.  Of this raid the following account is given in  Celtic Scotland, Vol. I. p. 483:-- &quot;The young king had barely reigned a year when be had to  encounter the old enemies of the Crown, the families of Mac William and Mac Eth, who now combined their forces under Donald Ban, the son of  that Mac William who bad been slain at Mamgarvie in 1187, and Kenneth  Mac Eth, a son or grandson of Malcolm Mac Eth, with the son of one of  the Irish provincial kings, and burst into the Province of Moray at the bead  of  a large band of malcontents.  A very important auxiliary, however, now  joined the party of the king. This was Ferquhard or Fearchar Macintagart,  the son of the `Sagart&#x27; or priest who was the lay possessor of the extensive  possessions of the old monastery founded by the Irish Saint Maelrubba at Applecross in the seventh century.  Its possessions lay between the district  of Ross and the Western Sea and extended from Lochcarron to Loch Ewe  and Loch Maree, and Ferquhard was thus in reality a powerful Highland  chief commanding the population of an extensive western region.  The  insurgents were assailed by him with great vigour, entirely crushed, and  their leaders taken, who be at once beheaded and presented their heads to the new king as a welcome gift on the 15th of June, when he was knighted  by the king as a reward for his prompt assistance.&quot; The district then known as North Argyle consisted chiefly of the possessions of this ancient monastery of Appercrossan or Applecross. Its inhabitants had hitherto--along with those of South Argyle, which  extended from Lochcarron to the Firth of Clyde--maintained a kind of  semi-independence, but in 1222 they were, by their lay possessor, Ferchair  Mac an t&#x27;Sagairt, who was apparently the grandson or great-grandson of  Gillandres, one of the six earls who besieged Malcolm IV. at Perth in  1160, brought into closer connection with the crown.  The lay Abbots of  which Ferquhard was the head were the hereditary possessors of all the  extensive territories which had for centuries been ruled and owned by this old and powerful Celtic monastery.  As a reward for his services against  the men of Moray in 1215 and for the great services which, in 1222, he  again rendered to the King in the subjugation of the whole district then  known as Argyle, extending from the Clyde to Lochbroom, he received  additional honours.  In that campaign known as &quot;the Conquest of Argyle,&quot;  Ferquhard led most of the western tribes, and for his prowess, the Celtic earldom, which was then finally annexed to the Crown and made a feudal  appanage, was conferred on him with the title of Earl of Ross, and he is so  designated in a charter dated 1234.  He is again on record, under the same  title, in 1235 and 1236.  Regarding an engagement which took place be-tween Alexander II. and the Gallowegians, in 1235, the Chronicle of Melrose says, that &quot;at the beginning of the battle the Earl of Ross, called  Macintagart, came up and attacked the enemies (of the King) in the rear,  and as soon as they perceived this they took to flight and retreated into the  woods and mountains, but they were followed up by the Earl and several  others, who put many of them to the sword, and harassed them as long as  daylight lasted.&quot; In Celtic Scotland, Vol. II, p.412, it is stated that the  hereditary lay priests of which he was the chief &quot;according to tradition, bore the name of O&#x27;Beollan&quot;; and MacVuirich, in the Black Book of Clanranald, says that from Ferquhard was descended Gillapatrick the Red,  son of Roderick, and known traditionally as the Red Priest, whose  daughter, at a later date, married and carried the monastery lands of  Lochalsh and Lochcarron to the Macdonalds of the Isles. In one of the Norse Sagas the progenitor of Ferquhard is  designated &quot; King,&quot; just the same as the great Somerled and some of his descendants had been called at a later date.  Referring to Helgi, son of  Ottar, the Landnamabok Saga records that &quot;he made war upon Scotland  and carried off prisoner Nidbjorga, the daughter of King Bjolan, and of  Kadliner, daughter or Ganga Rolf,&quot; or Rollo, who, as already stated, afterwards became the celebrated Earl of Normandy.  Writing of Alexander, third Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles,  Hugh Macdonald, the Sleat historian, says that -- &quot;He was a man born to much trouble all his life time. First he took  to him the concubine daughter of Patrick Obeolan, surnamed the Red,  who was a very beautiful woman.  This surname Obeolan was the surname  of the Earls of Ross, till Farquhar, born in Ross, was created earl by King  Alexander, and so carried the name of Ross since, as best answering the  English tongue.  This Obeolan had its descent of the ancient tribe of  Manapii; of this tribe is also St. Rice or Ruffus. Patrick was an Abbot and  had Carlebay in the Lewis, and the Church lands in that country, with 18  mark lands in Lochbroom. He bad two sons and a daughter.  The sons were called Normand and Austin More, so called from his excessive strength and corpulency.  This Normand had daughters that were great  beauties, one of whom was married to Mackay of Strathnavern one to  Dugall MacRanald, Laird of Mudort; one to MacLeod of Assint; one to  MacDuffie; and another, the first, to Maclean of Bororay. Patrick&#x27;s  daughter bore a son to Alexander, Lord of the Isles and Earl of Ross, who was called Austin (Uisdean or Hugh) or as others say, Augustine.  She was twice before the King, as Macdonald could not be induced to part with  her, on occasion of her great beauty. The King said, that it was no wonder  that such a fair damsel had enticed Macdonald.&quot; [Collectanea de Rebus  Albanicis, pp. 304-305.] It is not intended here to discuss whether Hugh of Sleat and his elder brother Celestine of Lochalsh were illegitimate or not. They were so  called by their father, Earl Alexander, and by their brother, Earl John.  The  first describes Celestine as &quot;filius naturalis&quot; in a charter preserved in the   Mackintosh charter chest, dated 1447, and Earl John calls his brother  Austin or Hugh &quot;frater carnalis&quot; in two charters, dated respectively 1463 and 1470.  This goes far to corroborate the Sleat historian, who was not the least likely to introduce illegitimacy into his own favourite family  unless the charge was really true.  It is instructive to find that Celestine  succeeded to all the lands of the monastery of Applecross in Lochalsh,  Lochcarron, and Lochbroom. These lay abbots are also said to have held,  under the old Earls of Ross, the Sleat district of the Isle of Skye, which  Hugh, first of that family, is alleged to have inherited  through his mother,  daughter of the Red Priest and a descendant of Farquhar Mac an t&#x27;Sagairt, Earl of Ross.  It will be observed also that Austin, Uisdean, or Hugh, a  common name among the Applecross and old Earl of Ross dynasty, comes  into the Macdonald family for the first time at this period, after Earl  Alexander of the Macdonald line had formed a union with the daughter of  the last lay Abbot of Applecross.  Skene distinctly affirms that Hugh  Macdonald of Sleat was the son of Earl Alexander by a daughter of this  Gille-Padruig (Celtic Scotland, Vol. III. p. 298) while Gregory suggests  that the words naturalis and carnalis used by Hugh&#x27;s father and brother in  the charters already quoted &quot;were used to designate the issue of those  handfast or left-handed marriages which appear to have been so common  in the Highlands and Isles.&quot; [Western Highlands and Isles, p.41]  Whether the Sleat district of Skye was or was not carried for the first time to the Macdonald Earls of Ross and Lords of the Isles by this union with a  member of the family of the original O&#x27;Beolan Earls, it is perfectly clear  that the latter had an intimate connection with the Sleat district at a much  earlier period. Saint Maelrubba, who is first heard of in Britain in 671, two years later, in 673, founded the original Church of Applecross &quot;from which as a centre he evangelised the whole of the western districts lying between  Loch Carron and Loch Broom, as well as the south and west parts of the  Island of Skye, and planted churches in Easter Ross and elsewhere.&quot;  [Celtic Scotland, Vol. II. p. 166.]  It is at least interesting to find these  lands going to and afterwards remaining in possession of the two sons of  Earl Alexander who are said to have  been  illegitimate, when all their  other enormous possessions were in 1493 finally forfeited to the Crown.   Hugh, who possessed Sleat during the life of his father and brother, receives a Crown charter of these lands under the Great Seal two years  after, in 1495, although his brother John, fourth and last Lord of the Isles,  was still alive, his death not having occurred until 1498, three years later.  Sir Robert Gordon (Earldom  of Scotland, p. 36) shows that the  Rosses were originally designated O&#x27;Beolan and Gillanders  indiscriminately, according to the writer&#x27;s or speaker&#x27;s fancy.  He says  that-- &quot;From the second son of the Earl of Ross the lairds of Balnagowan are descended, and had by inheritance the lands of Rariechies and Coulleigh, where you may observe that the laird of Balnagowan&#x27;s surname  should not be Ross, seeing that there was never any Earl of Ross of that  surname; but the Earls of Ross were first of the surname of Beolan, then  they were Leslies, and last of all that earldom fell by inheritance to the  Lords of the Isles, who resigned the same unto king James the Third&#x27;s  bands, in the year of God 1477.  So I do think that the lairds of  Balnagowan, perceiving the Earls of Ross decayed, and that earldom,  fallen into the Lords of the Isles&#x27; hands, they called themselves Ross  thereby to testify their descent from the Earls of Ross. Besides, all the Rosses in that province are Unto this day called in the Irish (Gaelic)  language Clan Leandries, which race by their own tradition is sprung from another stock.&quot; In the same work, p. 46, we find that the Earls of Ross were called O&#x27;Beolans as late as 1333, for Sir Robert informs us, writing of the battle  of Halidon Hill, that &quot;in this field was Hugh Beolan, Earl of Ross, slain.&quot; It is established to the satisfaction of all reasonable men that the  Applecross and O&#x27;Beolan Earls  of Ross were one and the same, and that  they were descended from Gilleoin na h&#x27; Airde, corrupted in the Norse  Sagas into &quot;Beolan,&quot; the general designation by which they were known,  until Earl William, the last of his line, died without surviving male issue  on the 9th of February, 1372,  when  the  title  devolved  upon  his   daughter, Euphemia, Countess of Ross in her own right, whose daughter,   Mary, or  Margaret, by Sir Walter  Leslie, carried the earldom to Donald of Harlaw, second Lord of the Isles.  That the O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross, of whom Ferquhard Mac an t&#x27;Sagairt was the first, descended from the same  ancestor, Gilleoin na h&#x27; Airde, as the older &quot;Gillandres&quot; earl of 1160, is  equally certain.  Earl Gillandres was probably forfeited for the part he  took against Malcolm IV. on that occasion, and Ferquhard having  rendered such important services to Alexander II. was restored probably  quite as much in virtue of his ancient rights as the grandson of Ferquhard  as on account of his valiant conduct in support of the crown in Moray, in Argyle, and in Galloway, in  1215, 1222, and 1235. The surname Ross has in early times been invariably rendered in Gaelic as Gilleanrias, or Gillanders, and the Rosses appear under this  appellation in all the early Acts of Parliament.  There is also an unvarying  tradition that on the death of the last Earl of the O&#x27;Beolan line a certain  Paul Mac Tire was for some years head of the Rosses, and this tradition is  corroborated by the fact that there is a charter on record by Earl William  of the lands of Gairloch in 1366 in favour of Paul Mac Tire and his heirs by Mary Graham, in which the Earl styles Mac Tire his cousin.  This grant was confirmed by King Robert II. in 1372.  In  the manuscript of 1467 the genealogy of Clann Gille-Anrias, or the descendants of Gillean-Ard-Rois,  begins with a Paul Mac Tire.  The clan whose genealogy is there given is  undoubtedly that of the Rosses, and in the manuscript they are traced  upwards from Paul MacTire in a direct line to Gilleon na h&#x27;Airde, the  &quot;Beolan&quot; of the Norse Sagas, who lived in the tenth century, and who will be shown to be also the remote progenitor of the Mackenzies.  The Aird  referred to is said to be the Aird of Ross. In the manuscript of  1467 the name Gille-Anrias appears in the  genealogies of both the Mackenzies and the Rosses exactly contemporaneous with the generation which preceded the original grant to  &quot;Ferchair Mac an t&#x27;Sagairt&quot; of the Earldom of Ross.  The name Gille--Anrias has been rendered as the Gaelic equivalent for Servant of Andrew,  or St. Andrew, and that, according to Skene, would seem to indicate that  the first of that name, if not a priest himself, must have belonged to the  priestly house of Appercrossan or Applecross, of which Earl Farquhar  ultimately became the head. The dates exactly correspond; and when, in  addition to this, it is remembered that of the earls who besieged Malcolm IV. at Perth in 1160 one was named &quot;Gillandres&quot; it seems fully  established that Ferchard Mac an t&#x27;Sagairt was descended from the  original  earls and that he was entitled to the earldom by ancient right on  the failure or forfeiture of the direct representative of the old line, as well  as by a new creation.  Although there may have been one or two usurpers--a common event in those turbulent times--Ferquhard was undoubtedly a  near relative and the legitimate successor of the Celtic &quot;Gillandres&quot; earl of  1160.  He is described in the Chronicle of Melrose as &quot;Comes Rossensis  Machentagard,&quot; and in Dalrymple&#x27;s Annals of Scotland as &quot;Mc Kentagar,&quot;  a designation which the author describes in a footnote as &quot;an   unintelligible word,&quot; though its meaning is perfectly plain to every Gaelic-speaking Celt. Ferquhard founded the Abbey of Fearn, in Easter Ross, about  1230, and died there in 1251.  Referring to his position during the first half of the thirteenth  century even the Earl of Cromartie is forced to admit in his MS., a copy of  which we possess, that &quot;it cannot be disputed that the Earl of Ross was the  Lord paramount under Alexander II., by whom Farquhard Mac an  t&#x27;Sagairt was recognised in the hereditary dignity of his predecessors, and  who, by another tradition, was a real progenitor of the noble family of  Kintail.&quot; And this was said and written by an author, who, in another part of the same manuscript, stoutly maintains that the king granted these  identical lands to Colin Fitzgerald by a charter which, if it was ever signed  at all, must have been signed a full generation before the date which the forged document bears--thirty years after the witnesses whose names  attest it had gone to their last home. THE  O&#x27;BEOLAN  EARLS  OF  ROSS. It must now be most interesting to every member of the Clan  Mackenzie to know who these O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross were and all that  can be ascertained regarding themselves and their family alliances. Leaving out Earl Gillanders, of whom so little is known, let us begin with I.  FERQUHARD,  OR  FARQUHAR  O&#x27;BEOLAN, &quot;Mac an  t&#x27;Sagairt,&quot; who, as already stated, founded the Abbey of Fearn, and died  there in 1251.  By his wife, whose name has not come down to us, he had issue, at least, 1.  William, his heir and successor. 2.  Malcolm, of whose life nothing is known. 3.  Euphemia, who married Walter de Moravia, Lord of Duffus  from 1224 to 1262. 4.  Christina, who married Olave the Red, King of Man, with issue. Farquhar was succeeded by his eldest son, II. WILLIAM  O&#x27;BEOLAN,  EARL  OF  ROSS.  He obtained Skye  and Lewis from Alexander III. and died at Earles Allane in 1274.  He married Joan daughter of the first Red Comyn, who died in 1273, and  sister of John, the Black Comyn, Lord of Badenoch and Earl of Buchan,  who married Marjory, sister of King John  Baliol, with issue--the  Red   Comyn, who was killed by Robert the Bruce in the Church of Dumfries in  1306.  Another sister of the Countess of Ross was married to John  Macdougall, Lord of Lorn, on record 1251, usually styled &quot; King Eoin or  Ewin.&quot;  By his wife Earl William had issue-- 1.  William, his heir and successor. 2.  Dorothea, who married her cousin, Torquil Macleod II. of  Lewis, with issue. He was succeeded by his only son, III.  WILLIAM  O&#x27;BEOLAN,  EARL OF  ROSS,  who fought  alternately with Edward I. and Robert the Bruce, and was imprisoned in  London 1296-97.  In 1306 he delivered up to the English King, Robert  Bruce&#x27;s Queen, Isabella, his daughter Marjory, his sister Mary, the brave Countess of Buchan, and other ladies of distinction, who bad for a time  found shelter and protection in the Sanctuary of St. Duthus, at Tain, from  the English oppressors of their country.  In 1309 he obtained a new grant of his lands.  By his wife, one of the Grahams of Montrose, he had issue-- 1.  Hugh, his heir and successor. 2.  Sir John, who married his second cousin, Margaret, daughter of Alexander, Earl of Buchan. 3.  Isabella,  who  married  Edward  Bruce, Earl of Carrick, brother of King Robert the Bruce. 4.  A daughter who, as her second husband, married Malise, Earl  of Stratherne, with issue--four daughters, the eldest of whom married William St. Clair, Baron of Roslin, whose son Henry afterwards succeeded in right of his mother to the earldom of Stratherne. He died at Delny, in Easter Ross, in 1323, and was succeeded by his eldest son, IV.  HUGH  O&#x27;BEOLAN,  EARL  OF  ROSS.  He received charters, of Strathglass and of the Isle of Skye.  He married first, in 1308,  Maud or Matilda, sister of King Robert the Bruce, with issue-- 1.  William, his heir and successor. 2.  Hugh Ross of Rarichies, from whom the Old Rosses of  Balnagown, of whom the last representative in the male line was the late George Ross of Pitcalnie.  This Hugh obtained the lands of Philorth in  Aberdeen-shire, and between 1362 and 1372 he exchanged them with his  brother, Earl Hugh, for the lands of North Argyle, including the Castle of  Ellandonnan.  The territories exchanged included Strathglass, Kintail.  and  other lands in Wester Ross. 3.  Janet, who married, first, Monimusk of Monimusk and,  secondly, Sir Alexander Murray of Abercairny. 4.  Euphemia or Eupham, who married, first, Randolph, Earl of  Moray, who was killed at the battle of Durham, and secondly, her cousin, King Robert II., grandson of Robert the Bruce and first of the Stuart  dynasty.  This marriage being within the prohibited degrees of  consanguinity a special dispensation was obtained from Pope Innocent VI.  for its celebration in 1355.  She died in 1372. Earl Hugh married, secondly, also by dispensation from the Pope, in 1329, Margaret, daughter of Sir David de Graham.  The Earl was killed at the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, when he  was succeeded by his eldest son, V.  WILLIAM  O&#x27;BEOLAN,  EARL  OF  ROSS  AND LORD  OF   SKYE, banished to Norway for some serious offence, but in 1336 he is  found in actual possession of the earldom.  He was afterwards Justiciar of  Scotland, and in a charter of 1374 he is designated &quot;frater Regis,&quot; or the  King&#x27;s brother, no doubt from the fact that his sister Euphemla was the  wife of Robert II.  He rebuilt the Abbey of Fearn, and married his cousin Isobel, daughter of Malise, Earl of Stratherne, Orkney, and Caithness, with  issue-- 1.  William, who died before his father 2.  Euphemia, who became Countess of Ross in her own right on  the death of her father. 3.  Johanna, who, in  1375, married Sir Alexander Fraser, Lord of Cowie and Durris,  ancestor of the Frasers of Philorth and Pitsligo, now  represented by Lord Saltoun.  Johanna first carried the lands of Philorth to  that family.  She has a charter in 1370. William died on the 9th of February, 1372, without surviving male issue, when he was succeeded by his eldest daughter, VI.  EUPHEMIA O&#x27;BEOLAN,  COUNTESS  OF  ROSS in her  own right.  She married first, by dispensation, dated 1367, Sir Walter  Leslie, son of Sir Andrew Leslie, who in right of his wife became Earl of Ross.  They have a charter of the earldom of Ross and of the lands of Skye  dated 1370, two years before Earl William&#x27;s death, in their own favour and that of their heirs male and female in reversion.  Her first husband  predeceased her in 1382, whereupon she married, secondly, Alexander,  Earl of Buchan, better known in history as &quot;The Wolf of Badenoch.&quot;  He  died, without issue, in 1394.  She died Abbess of Elcho in 1398, and was  buried in Fortrose Cathredral.  By Sir Walter Leslie she had issue-- 1.  Sir Alexander Leslie, who became Earl of Ross in right of his mother. 2.  Margaret Leslie, who married Donald, second Lord of the Isles, who in her right, after fighting the battle of Harlaw, succeeded to the  earldom of Ross, and carried it to a new family, the Macdonald Lords of  the isles. When the Countess Euphemia died, in 1398, she was succeeded by her only son, VII.  SIR  ALEXANDER  LESLIE,  EARL  OF  ROSS, who married Isabella, daughter of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, Governor  of Scotland, and by her had issue an only daughter, Lady Euphemia, or  Mary, who became a nun, and resigned the earldom in favour of her  maternal uncle, John, Earl of Buchan.  Donald, Lord of the Isles, who   married  her  father&#x27;s  sister,  Margaret, disputed Euphemia&#x27;s right to put  the earldom past her aunt, and the battle of Harlaw was fought in 1411 to decide the issue, which, as already stated, turned, so far as the possession  of the great earldom was concerned, in favour of the Lord of the Isles,  since known as Donald of Harlaw.  From this point the history of the earldom falls properly to be dealt with and is given at length in The  History of the Macdonalds and Lords of the Isles. But thus far it cannot  fail to be extremely interesting to all the members of the clan Mackenzie,  whether they believe in the Gillanders and O&#x27;Beolans or in the Fitzgeralds  as the progenitors of the race; for in any case the clan was in its earlier  annals closely allied with the O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross by descent and  marriage. It has been established that Gillanders and O&#x27;Beolan were the  names of the ancient and original Earls of Ross, and they continued to be represented in the male line by the Old Rosses of Balnagowan down to the  end of the eighteenth century, when the last heir male of that family,  finding that the entail ended with himself, sold the estates to General  Ross, brother of Lord Ross of Hawkhead, who, although possessing the  same name, was of a different family and origin.  It will, it is believed, be  now admitted with equal certainty that the Rosses and the  Mackenzies are descended from the same progenitor, Beolan or Gilleoin na h&#x27;Airde, the  undoubted common ancestor of the old Earls of Ross, the Gillanders, and  the Rosses.  The various steps in the earliest portion of the genealogy connecting the Mackenzies with the common ancestor will be given with  the same detail as that of the Rosses, and it will be stated with sufficient  accuracy to justify  the  conclusions at which, in common with  Dr Skene  and all the best authorities on the subject, we have arrived.  The genealogy  of the Clan Andres or Rosses in the manuscript of 1467, is as follows:-- &quot;Pol ic Tire, ic Eogan, ic Muiredaigh, ic Poil, ic Gilleanrias, ic  Martain, ic Poil, ic Cainig, ic Cranin, ic Eogan, ic Cainic, ic Cranin, McGilleoin na h&#x27;Airde, ic Eirc, ic Loirn, ic Fearchar, Mc Cormac, ic  Abertaig, ic Feradaig.&quot; Dr Skene&#x27;s translation-- &quot;Paul son of Tire, son of Ewen, son of Murdoch, son of Paul, son of Gillanrias, son of Martin, son of Paul, son of Kenneth, son of Crinan, son of Ewen, son of Kenneth, son of Crinan, son of Gilleoin of the Aird,  son of Erc, son of Lorn, son of Ferchar, son of Cormac, son of  Oirbeirtaigh, son of Feradach.&quot; The Mackenzie genealogy in the same MS. is-- &quot;Muiread  ic Cainig, Mc Eoin, ic Cainig, ic Aengusa, ic Cristin, ic  Agam, Mc Gilleoin Qig, ic Gilleon na h&#x27;Aird.&quot; Skene&#x27;s translation follows-- &quot;Murdoch son of Kenneth, son of John, son of Kenneth, son of  Angus, son of Cristin, son of Adam, son of Gilleoin Og, son of Gilleoin of  the Aird.&quot; Skene makes an important correction on this genealogy in his later  work, Celtic Scot/and, Vol. III., p. 485, by substituting Cainig--Kenneth,  for Agam--Adam, in his original reading.  In this form the genealogy of  1467 corresponds exactly, so far as it goes, with that given by MacVuirich  in the Black Book of Clanranald. In 1222 &quot;Gilchrist filius Kinedi,&quot;  Gillecriosd son of Kenneth, is on record as a follower of MacWilliam.   Cristean is the ordinary Gaelic form of Christopher, otherwise Gilchrist, or  Gillecriosd. There is thus no doubt that the &quot;Cristin&quot; of the Gaelic  genealogy is the same name as Gillecriosd, Gilchrist, and Christopher. In  the MacVuirich manuscript, however, several names are given between  Gilleoin Og and Gilleoin na h&#x27;Airde which are absent from the manuscript  of 1467; for while we have thirteen generations in the Clan Anrias or Ross  genealogy in the latter between Paul Mac Tire and Gilleoin of the Aird,  we have only eight in the Mackenzie genealogy between Murdoch of the  Cave, who was contemporary with Mac Tire, and their common ancestor  Gilleoin of the Aird, or Beolan.  In the MacVuirich manuscript there are  fifteen generations, translated thus-- &quot;Murdoch son of Kenneth, son of John, son of Kenneth, son of  Angus &#x27;crom,&#x27; or the hump-backed, son of Kenneth, son of Gilleoin Og, son of Gilleoin Mor, or the Great, son of Murdoch, son of Duncan, son of  Murdoch, son of Duncan, son of Murdoch, son of Kenneth, son of Cristin,  or Christopher, son of Gilleoin of the Aird.&quot; The genealogies of the three families as brought out by these manuscripts, are shown in the following table:-- GILLEOIN OF THE AIRD.                                          |           +------------------------------+------------------+           |CLAN ANRIAS.                  |    MACKENZIES.   |           +------------------------------+------------------+           |  Crinan                      |   Cristin        |           |  Kenneth                     |   Kenneth        |           |  Ewen                        |   Murdoch        |           |  Crinan                      |   Duncan         |           |  Kenneth                     |   Murdoch        |           |  Paul                        |   Duncan         |           |  Martin                      |   Murdoch        |           |  Gillanrias                  |   Gilleoin Mor   |           +---------|--------------------|   Gilleoin Og    |                     |                    |   Kenneth        | +-------------------+------------------+ |   Angus Crom     | | EARLS OF ROSS     |     ROSSES    | |   Kenneth        | +-------------------+------------------+ |   John           | | The Priest-&quot;An    |  Paul            | |   Kenneth        | | Sagart&quot;           |  Murdoch         | |   Murdoch of the | | I.

It will be observed that Colin does  not appear once in these early genealogies, and it has been already pointed  out that no trace of it is found anywhere as a family name until the middle  of the sixteenth century, when it was introduced by the marriage of one of  the Mackenzie chiefs to a daughter of the Earl of Atholl, whose mother  was Lady Mary Campbell, and who, calling her second son  after her own  uncle Colin, third Earl of Argyll, for the first time brought that name into  the family genealogy of Kintail. It will also be seen as we proceed, although the Earls of Ross were superiors of the lands of Kintail as part of the earldom, and that it was therefore impossible that Colin Fitzgerald or any other person than those earls could have had a gift of it from the Crown, that the Mackenzies  occupied the lands and the castle, not as immediate vassals; of the King, but of their own near relatives, the O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross and their  successors, for at least two hundred years before the Mackenzies received a grant of it for themselves direct from the Crown.  This is proved beyond  dispute by genuine historical documents.  Until within a few years of the final forfeiture of the Lords of the Isles in 1476, the Mackenzies  undoubtedly held their lands, first from the O&#x27;Beolan Earls and  subsequently from the Island Lords as Earls of Ross; for the first direct Crown charter to any chief of Kintail of which we have authentic record, is one dated the 7th of January, 1463, in favour of Alexander &quot;Ionraic,&quot;  the sixth Baron. To show the intimate relations which existed between the original Earls of Ross and the ancestor of the Mackenzies, a quotation may be  given from a manuscript history of the clan written by Dr George  Mackenzie, nephew of Kenneth Mor, third Earl of Seaforth, in the  seventeenth century.  Although be is a supporter of the Fitzgerald origin,  he is forced to say that, &quot;at the same time (1267) William, Earl of Ross, laying a claim of superiority over the Western Isles, thought this a fit  opportunity to seize the Castle of Ellandonnan.  He sent a messenger to his  Kintail men to send their young chieftain to him as being his nearest  kinsman by marriage with his aunt.&quot;  He then goes on to say, that  Kenneth, not Colin, was joined by the MacIvers, Macaulays, MacBeolans,  and Clan Tarlichs, &quot;the ancient inhabitants of Kintail,&quot; and refused to surrender, when &quot;the Earl of Ross attacked them and was beaten.&quot; Had  there been  no previous kinship between the two families--and no one will  now attempt with any show of reason to maintain that there was not--this marriage of William, the second Earl, to Kenneth&#x27;s aunt would have made  the youthful Kenneth, ancestor of the Mackenzies, first cousin, on the  maternal side, to William O&#x27;Beolan, the third Earl of that line, whose wife  and therefore Kintail&#x27;s aunt, was Joan, sister of John, the Black Comyn,  Lord of Badenoch.  It has further been proved to a demonstration, and it is  now admitted by all the best authorities, that the O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross were descended from Gilleoin na h `Airde; and so are the Mackenzies,  who from the first formed an integral and most important part of the  ancient powerful native Gaelic tribes of which the Earls of Ross were the chiefs. It has been shown that Kenneth, from whom the Mackenzies  take their name, was  closely  allied  by marriage with William, second Earl of  Ross, the latter having married Kenneth&#x27;s maternal aunt. This fact by  itself would be sufficient to establish the high position, which even at that  early period, was occupied by Kenneth, who was already very closely  connected with the O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross by blood and marriage. Kenneth himself married Morna or Morba, daughter of Alexander Macdougall, styled, &quot;De Ergedia,&quot; Lord of Lorn by a daughter of John, the first Red Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, who died in 1273. Kenneth&#x27;s wife  was thus a sister of John, the Black Comyn, who died about 1299, having  married Marjory, daughter of John Baliol, by whom he had John, the  second Red Comyn, one of the competitors for the Scottish Crown, killed  by Robert the Bruce in the Church of Dumfries in 1306. Kenneth&#x27;s issue  by Morna or Morba of Lorn was John Mackenzie, II. of Kintail, who was  thus, through his mother, third In descent from John, the first Red Comyn,  who died in 1273, and sixth from the great Somerled of the Isles, Thane of  Argyle, progenitor of the Macdougalls of Lorn and of all the Macdonalds, who died in 1164. John made even a more illustrious alliance than his father, by which at that early date he introduced the Royal blood of Scotland and  England into the family of Kintail.  He married his relative, Margaret,  sister of David, twelfth Earl of Atholl, slain in 1335, and daughter of  David, the eleventh Earl, who died in 1327 (whose estates were forfeited  by Edward I.), by Joan Comyn (died  1323), daughter of the Red Comyn  killed by Robert the Bruce, and great granddaughter of John Baliol. Margaret&#x27;s father, David, eleventh Earl of Atholl who died in  1327, was  the oldest son of John de Strathbogie, tenth Earl, hanged by Edward I.   Earl John&#x27;s mother was the Countess Isabel de Dover, who died at a very  old age in 1292, daughter of Richard Fitzroy de Chillam (died 1216), a  natural son of King John of England. Kenneth Mackenzie, III of Kintail, the issue of this marriage, was sixth in descent from John Baliol of the Royal line of Scotland and sixth from King John of England. The Norwegian blood of the Kings of Man was brought into the  family by the marriage of this Kenneth to Finguala, daughter of Torquil Macleod, I. of Lewis, who was the grandson of Olave the Black, Norwegian King of Man, who died about 1237, by his wife Christina, daughter of Ferquhard &quot;Mac an t&#x27;Sagairt,&quot; first O&#x27;Beolan Earl of Ross. The Royal blood of the Bruce was introduced by the marriage of Murdoch Mackenzie, V. of Kintail, to Finguala, daughter of Malcolm Macleod, III. of Harris  (who has a charter in  1343), by Martha, daughter  of David, twelfth Earl of Mar, son of Gratney, eleventh Earl (whose sister  Isabel married Robert the Bruce) by his wife Christina, daughter of Robert  Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and sister of King Robert the Bruce. The Plantaganet blood-royal of England was introduced later by  the marriage of Kenneth Mackenzie, X. of Kintail, to Lady Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of John, second Earl of Atholl, fourth in descent from  John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, son of Edward III., and father of Henry IV. of England, and this strain was strengthened and continued by the  marriage of Kenneth&#x27;s son, Colin Cam Mackenzie, XI. of Kintail, to his  cousin Barbara, daughter of John Grant of Grant by Lady Marjory Stewart,  daughter of John, third Earl of Atholl. It scarcely needs to be pointed out  that, through these inter-marriages, the Mackenzies are also descended  from the ancient Celtic MacAlpine line of Scottish Kings, from the  original Anglo-Saxon Kings of England, and from the oldest  Scandinavian, Charlemagne, and Capetian lines, as far back as the  beginning of the ninth century. The origin of the O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross and the Mackenzies from the same source is strikingly illustrated by their inter-marriages into the  same families and with each other&#x27;s kindred.  Both the O&#x27;Beolans and the  Mackenzies made alliances with the Comyns of Badenoch, with the  MacDougalls of Lorn, and subsequently with the Macleods of Lewis and  Harris, thus forming a network of cousinship which ultimately included all  the leading families in the Highlands, every one of which, through these  alliances, have the Royal blood of all the English, Scottish, and  Scandinavian Kings, and many of the earlier foreign monarchs, coursing  in their veins. Surely this is a sufficiently ancient and illustrious origin and much  more satisfactory to every patriotic clansman than an Irish adventurer like  the reputed Colin Fitzgerald, who, if he ever existed, had not and never  could have had any connection with the real origin of the Mackenzies,  which was as purely native of the Highlands as it was possible for any  Scoto-Celtic family in those days to be.  The various genealogical steps  and marriage alliances already referred to will be confirmed in each  individual case as we proceed with the succession and history of the  respective chiefs of the family, beginning with the first of the line, I.  KENNETH,  OR  COINNEACH, Who gave his name to the clan.  His is the fourth ascending name in the  manuscript genealogy of 1467, which begins with  Murdoch of the Cave. Murdoch died in 1375, and was thus almost contemporaneous with the author of the Gaelic genealogy, which, translated, proceeds up to this  Kenneth as follows:--Murdoch, son of Kenneth, son of John, son of  Kenneth, and so on, as already given at page 39 to Gilleoin of the Aird. At this interesting stage it may be well to explain how the name Mackenzie came to be pronounced and written as it now is.  John, the son  of this Kenneth, would be called in the original native Gaelic, &quot;Ian Mac  Choinnich,&quot; John, son of Kenneth.  In that form it was unpronounceable to those unacquainted with the native tongue. The nearest approach the  foreigner could get to its correct enunciation would be Mac Coinni or Mac Kenny, which ultimately came to be spelt Mac Kenzie, Z in those days  having exactly the same value and sound as the letter V; and the name,  although spelt with a Z instead of a Y would be pronounced Mac Kenny,  as indeed we pronounce in our own day, in Scotland, such names as  Menzies, Macfadzean, and several others, as if they were still written with the letter Y.  The two letters being thus of the same value, after a time came to be used indiscriminately in  the word Kenny or Kenzie, and the  letter z having subsequently acquired a different value and sound of its  own, more allied to the letter S than to the original Y, the name is  pronounced as if it were written Mackensie. Kenneth was the son and heir of Angus, the direct representative of  a long line of ancestors up to Gilleoin na li&#x27;Airde, the common progenitor  of the O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross, the Clann Ghille-Andrais, who about the  end of the fourteenth century called themselves Rosses, and of the  Mackenzies.  The close connection by blood and marriage between the  O&#x27;Beolan Earls of Ross and Kenneth&#x27;s family before and after this period  has been already shown, but the ancient ties of friendship had at this time  become  somewhat strained. Kenneth succeeded to the government of  Ellandonnan Castle, which was garrisoned by his friends and supporters,  the Macraes and the Maclennans, who, even at that early date in large  numbers occupied Kintail.  Kenneth, in fact, was Governor of the Castle,  and was otherwise becoming so powerful that his superior, the Earl, was getting very jealous of him. At this time the first Earl William laid claim to the superiority of  the Western  Isles, which he and his father, Ferchair Mac an t&#x27;Sagairt;  were chiefly instrumental, among the followers of Alexander III., in  wresting from the Norwegians, and he was naturally desirous to have the  government of Ellandonnan Castle in his own hands, or under the charge  of some one less ambitious than Kenneth, and on whom he could implicitly rely.  Kenneth was advancing rapidly both in power and influence  among his more immediate neighbours, who were mainly composed of the  ancient inhabitants of the district, the Mac Beolains, who occupied Glenshiel and the south side of Loch Duich as far as Kylerhea; the Mac  Ivors, who inhabited Glen Lichd, the Cro of Kintail, and the north side of  Loch Duich; while the Mac Tearlichs, now calling themselves Mac  Erlichs or Charlesons, occupied Glenelchaig. These aboriginal natives  naturally supported Kenneth, who was one of themselves, against the  claims of his superior, the Earl, who though a pure Highland Celt was less  known in Kintail than the Governor of the Castle.  This only made the  Earl more determined than ever to obtain possession of the stronghold,  and he peremptorily requested the garrison to surrender it and Kenneth to him at once. The demand was promptly refused; and finding that the  Governor was resolved to hold it at all hazards the Earl sent a strong detachment to take it by storm. Kenneth was readily joined by the surrounding tribes, among  whom were, along with those whose names have been already given, the brave Macaulays of Lochbroom, who were distantly related to him. By  the aid of these reinforcements Kenneth was able to withstand a desperate and gallant onset by the Earl and his followers, who were defeated and  driven back with great slaughter. This exasperated the enemy so much that he soon after returned to the charge with a largely increased force, at the  same time threatening the young governor with the utmost vengeance and  final extirpation unless he immediately capitulated.  But before the Earl was able to carry his threats into execution, be was overtaken by a severe  illness of which he very soon after died, in 1274.  His son, the second Earl   William, did  not persevere in his father&#x27;s policy against Kintail, and it  was not long before his attention was diverted into another channel.  On  the death of Alexander III., in 1286, the affairs of the nation became  confused and distracted.  This was rather an advantage to Kenneth than  otherwise, for, in the general disorder which followed he was able to  strengthen his position among the surrounding tribes.  Through a  combination of native prudence, personal popularity, and a growing power  and influence heightened by the eclat of his having so recently defeated the powerful Earl of Ross, he succeeded in maintaining good order in his  own district, while his increasing influence was felt over most of the  Western Isles. Kenneth married Morna or Morba, daughter of Alexander  Macdougall of Lorn, &quot;de Ergedia,&quot; by a daughter of John the first Red  Comyn, and sister of John the Black Comyn, Earl of Badenoch.  He died in 1304 and was buried in Icolmkill, when he was succeeded by his only  son, II.  JOHN  MAC  KENNETH,  OR  MAC  KENZIE, The  first of the race called Mac Kenny or Mac Kenzie.  Dr George Mackenzie, already quoted, says that &quot;the name Coinneach is common to  the Pictish and Scottish Gael,&quot; and that &quot;Mackenzie, Baron of Kintail,  attached himself to the fortunes of the heroic Robert the Bruce,  notwithstanding MacDougall&#x27;s (his father-in-law) tenacious adherence to  the cause of Baliol, as is believed, in resentment for the murder of his  cousin, the Red Comyn, at Dumfries&quot;; while the Earl of Cromartie says  that he &quot;not only sided with Robert Bruce in his contest with the Cumins  but that he was one of those who sheltered him in his lurking and assisted  him in his restitution; `for in the Isles,&#x27; says Boethius `he had supply from  a friend; and yet Donald of the Isles, who then commanded them, was on  the Cumin&#x27;s side, and raised the Isles to their assistance, and was beat at  Deer by Edward Bruce, anno  1308.&#x27;&quot;  All this is indeed highly probable. After Bruce left the Island of Rachrin he was for a considerable time lost sight of, many believing that he had perished during his wanderings, from the great hardships which he necessarily endured in his  ultimately successful attempts to escape the vigilant efforts and search of  his enemies.   That Bruce found shelter in Ellandonnan Castle and was  there protected for a considerable time by the Baron of Kintail--until he  found opportunity again to take the field against his enemies--has ever  since been the unbroken tradition in the Highlands, and it has always been  handed down from one generation to another as a proud incident in the  history of the clan.  The Laird of Applecross, who wrote his manuscript history of the Mackenzies in 1669, follows the earlier family historians.     He says that this Baron of Kintail &quot;did own the other party, and was one of  those who sheltered the Bruce, and assisted in his recovery.  I shall not say  he was the only one, but this stands for that assertion that all who were considerable in the Hills and Isles were enemies to the Bruce, and so  cannot be presumed to be his friends.  The Earl of Ross did most  unhandsomely and unhumanly apprehend his lady at Tain and delivered  her to the English, anno 1305.  Donald of the Isles, or Rotholl, or rather Ronald, with all the Hebrides, armed against the Bruce and were beat by  Edward  Bruce in Buchan, anno 1308.  Alexander of Argyll partied (sided  with) the Baliol; his country, therefore, was wasted by Bruce, anno 1304, and himself taken by him, 1309.  Macdougall of Lorn fought against the  Bruce, and took him prisoner, from whom he notably escaped, so that  there is none in the district left so considerable as this chief (Mackenzie)  who had an immediate dependence on the Royal family and had this  strong fort, which was never commanded by the Bruce&#x27;s enemies, either  English or Scots; and that his shelter and assistance was from a remote  place and friend is evident from all our stories.  But all their neighbours being stated on a different side from the Mackenzies engendered a feud  betwixt him and them, especially with the Earl of Ross and Donald of the  Isles, which never ended  but with the end of the Earl of Ross and  lowering of the Lord of the Isles.&quot;  That this is true will be placed beyond  question as we proceed. It may, indeed, be assumed from subsequent events in the history of these powerful families and the united testimony of all the genealogists  of the Mackenzies, that the chief of Kintail did befriend Robert the Bruce  against his enemies and protected him in his castle of Ellandonnan, in  spite of the commands of his immediate superior, the Earl of Ross, and the  united power of all the other great families of the Western Isles and  Argyle.  And in his independent stand at this important period in the  history of Scotland will be found the true grounds of the local rancour  which afterwards prevailed between Mackenzie and the Island Lord, and which only terminated in the collapse of the Earls of Ross and the Lords  of the Isles, upon the ruins of which, as a reward for proved loyalty to the  reigning monarch, and as the result of the characteristic prudence of the race of MacKenneth, the House of Kintail gradually rose in power, subsequently absorbed the ancient inheritance of all the original possessors of  the district, and ultimately extended their influence more widely over the  whole provinces of Wester and Central Ross. The genealogists further say that this chief waited on the King during his visit to Inverness in  1312.  [The MS. histories of the Mackenzies give the date of Robert Bruce&#x27;s visit to Inverness as 1307, but  from a copy of the &quot;Annual of Norway,&quot; at the negotiation and  arrangement of which &quot;the eminent Prince, Lord Robert, by the like grace, noble King of Scors (attended) personally on the other part,&quot; it will be seen that the date of the visit was 1312.--See Invernessiana, by Charles Fraser-Mackintosh, F,S.A. Scot., pp. 36-40.]  This may now be accepted as correct, as also that  he fought at the head of his followers at the battle of  Inverury, where Bruce defeated Mowbray and the Comyn in  1303.  After  this important engagement, according to Fenton, &quot;all the nobles, barons, towns, cities. garrisons, and castles north of the Grampians submitted to Robert the Bruce,&quot; when, with good reason, the second chief of Clan  Kenneth was further confirmed in the favour of his sovereign, and in the  government of Ellandonnan. The Lord of the Isles had in the meantime, after his capture in Argyle, died while confined in  Dundonald Castle, when  his brother and  successor, Angus Og, declared for Bruce.  Argyll and Lorn left, or were  driven out of the country, and took up their residence in England.  With  Angus Og of the Isles now on the side of Bruce, and the territories of  Argyll and Lorn at his mercy in the absence of their respective chiefs, it  was an easy matter for the King, during the varied fortunes of his heroic struggle, defending Scotland from the English, to draw largely upon the  resources of the West Highlands and Isles, flow unmolested, particularly  after the surprise at Perth in the winter of 1312, and the reduction of all  the strongholds in Scotland--except Stirling, Berwick, and Dunbar--during the ensuing summer.  The decisive blow, however, yet to be struck  by which the independence and liberties of Scotland were to be for ever  established and confirmed, and the time was drawing nigh when every  nerve would have to be strained for a final effort to clear it, once for all, of  the bated followers of the tyrant Edwards, roll them back before an  impetuous wave of Scottish valour, and for ever put an end to England&#x27;s  claim to tyrannise over a free-born people whom it was found impossible  to crush or cow.  Nor, in the words of the Bennetsfield manuscript, &quot;will we affect a morbid indifference to the fact that on the 24th of June, 1314,  Bruce&#x27;s heroic band of thirty thousand warriors on the glorious field of  Bannockburn contained above ten thousand Western Highlanders and men  of the Isles,&quot; under Angus Og of the Isles, Mackenzie of Kintail (who led five hundred of his vassals), and other chiefs of the mainland, of whom  Major specially says, that &quot;they made an incredible slaughter of their  enemies, slaying heaps of them around wherever they went, and running  upon them with their broadswords and daggers like wild bears without any  regard to their own lives.&quot;  Alluding to the same event, Barbour says-- Angus of the Is&#x27;es and Bute alsae, And of the plain lands he had mae Of armed men a noble route, His battle stalwart was and stout. General Stewart of Garth, in a footnote, Sketches of the  Highlanders, says that the eighteen Highland chiefs who fought at  Bannockburn were--Mackay, Mackintosh, Macpherson, Cameron,  Sinclair, Campbell, Menzies, Maclean, Sutherland, Robertson, Grant,  Fraser, Macfarlane, Ross, Macgregor, Munro, Mackenzie, and Macquarrie  and that &quot;Cumming, Macdougall of Lorn, Macnab, and a few others were  unfortunately in opposition to Bruce, and suffered accordingly.&quot;  In due  time the Western chiefs returned home, where on their arrival, many of them found local feuds still smouldering--encouraged by the absence of  the natural protectors of the people--amidst the surrounding blaze.  John lived peaceably at home during the remainder of his days.  He  married Margaret, daughter of David de Strathbogie, XIth Earl of Atholl,  by Joan, daughter of John, the Red Comyn, last Earl of Badenoch, killed  by Robert the Bruce in 1306.  He died in 1328, and was succeeded by his  only son, III.  KENNETH  MACKENZIE, Commonly called Coinneach na Sroine, or Kenneth of the Nose, from the  size of that organ.  Very little is known of this chief.  But he does not appear to have been long in possession when he found himself serious  trouble and unable to cope successfully with the Earl of Ross, who made  determined efforts to re-establish the original position of his house over  the Barons of Kintail.  Wyntoun says that in 1331, Randolph, Earl of  Moray, nephew of Robert the Bruce, and at that time Warden of  Scotland,  sent his Crowner to Ellandonnan, with orders to prepare the castle for his  reception and to arrest all &quot;misdoaris&quot; in the district, fifty of whom the Crowner beheaded, and, according to the barbarous practice of even much  later times, exposed their heads for the edification of the surrounding  lieges high upon the castle walls.  Randolph himself soon after arrived  and, says the same chronicler, was &quot;right blithe&quot; to see the goodly show of  heads &quot;that flowered so weel that wall&quot;--a ghastly warning to all  treacherous or plundering &quot;misdoaris.&quot;  From what occurred on this  occasion it is obvious that Kenneth either did not attempt or was not able  to govern his people with a firm hand and to keep the district free from plunderers and lawlessness. It is undoubted that at this time the Earl of Ross succeeded in gaining a considerable hold in the district over which he had all along  claimed superiority; for in 1342 William, the fifth and last O&#x27;Beolan Earl,  is on record as granting a charter of the whole ten davochs of Kintail to Reginald, son of Roderick of the Isles. The charter was granted and dated  at the Castle of Urquhart, witnessed by the bishops of Ross and Moray,  and confirmed by David II. in 1344. [Invernessiana, p.56.]  From all this it  may fairly be assumed that the line of Mac Kenneth was not far from the breaking point during the reign of Kenneth of the Nose. Some followers of the Earl of Ross about this time made a raid to  the district of Kenlochewe and carried away a great herschip. Mackenzie  pursued them, recovered a considerable portion of the spoil. and killed  many of the raiders.  The Earl of Ross was greatly incensed at Kenneth&#x27;s  conduct in this affair, and he determined to have him apprehended and  suitably punished for the murders and other excesses committed by him. In this he ultimately succeeded.  Mackenzie was captured, chiefly through the instrumentality of Leod Mac Gilleandrais--a desperate character, and a  vassal and relative of the Earl--and executed at Inverness in 1346, when the lands of Kenlochewe, previously possessed by Kintail, were given to  Mac Gilleandrais as a reward for Mackenzie&#x27;s capture. On this point the author of the Ardintoul manuscript says, that the  lands of Kenlochewe were held by Kenneth Mackenzie &quot;and his predecessors by tack, but not as heritage, for they had no real or heritable  right of them until Alexander of Kintail got heritable possession of them from John, Earl of Ross,&quot; at a much later date. Ellandonnan Castle,  however, held out during the whole of this disturbed and distracted period,  and until Kenneth&#x27;s heir, who at his father&#x27;s death was a mere boy, came  of age, when he fully avenged the death of his father, and succeeded to the  inheritance of his ancestors.  The garrison meanwhile maintained  themselves on the spoil of the enemy.  The brave defenders of the castle  were able to hold their own throughout and afterwards to hand over the stronghold to their chief when he arrived at a proper age and returned  home. The Earl of Cromarty, who gives a very similar account of this period, concludes his notice of Kenneth in these terms--&quot; Murdered thus, his estate was possessed by the oppressor&#x27;s followers; but Island Donain  keeped still out, maintaining themselves on the spoyle of the enemie.  All  being trod under by insolince and oppression, right had no place.  This  was during David Bruce&#x27;s imprisonment in England,&quot; when chaos and  disorder ruled supreme, at least in the Highlands. Kenneth married Finguala, or Florence, daughter of Torquil  Macleod, II. of Lewis. by his wife Dorothea, daughter of William, second O&#x27;Beolan Earl of Ross by his wife, Joan, daughter of John the  first Red  Comyn, and sister of John the Black Comyn, Lord of Badenoch and Earl  of Buchan, with issue, an only son, IV.  MURDOCH  MACKENZIE, Usually called &quot;Murchadh Dubh na h&#x27; Uagh,&quot; or Black Murdoch of the Cave, from his habits of life, which shall be described presently. Murdoch  was very young when his father was executed at Inverness. During  Kenneth&#x27;s absence on that occasion, and for some time afterwards,  Duncan Macaulay, a great friend, who then owned the district of  Lochbroom, had charge of Ellandonnan Castle.  The Earl of Ross was  determined to secure possession of Murdoch, as he previously did of his  father, and Macaulay becoming apprehensive as to his safety sent him,  then quite young, accompanied by his own son, for protection to  Mackenzie&#x27;s relative, Macdougall of Lorn.  While here the Earl of Ross  succeeded in capturing young Macaulay, and in revenge for his father&#x27;s  gallant defence at Ellandonnan during Kenneth&#x27;s absence, and more  recently against his own futile attempts to take that stronghold, he put  Macaulay to death, whereupon Murdoch, who barely escaped with his life, left Lorn and sought the protection of his uncle, Macleod of Lewis. The actual murderer of Macaulay was the same desperate  character, Leod Macgilleandrais, a vassal of the Earl of Ross, who had in 1346 been mainly instrumental in the capture and consequent death of  Mackenzie&#x27;s father at Inverness.  The Earl of Cromarty describes the  assassin as &quot;a depender of the Earl of Ross, and possessed of several lands  in Strathcarron (of Easter Ross) and some in Strathoykell.&quot;  When he  killed Macaulay, Leod possessed himself of his lands of Lochbroom and  Coigach &quot;whereby that family ended.&quot; Macaulay&#x27;s estates should have  gone to Mackenzie in right of his wife, Macaulay&#x27;s daughter, but &quot;holding of the Earl of Ross, the earl disponed the samen in lyfrent by tack to Leod,  albeit Murdo Mackenzie acclaimed it in right of his wyfe.&quot; Leod kept possession of Kenlochewe, which, lying as it did,  exactly between Kintail and Lochbroom, he found most convenient as a  centre of operations against both, and he repeatedly took advantage of it, though invariably without success so far at least as his main object was  concerned--to get possession of the stronghold of Ellandonnan. On the  other hand, the brave garrison of the castle made several desperate  reprisals under their heroic commander, Macaulay, and held out in spite of  all the attempts made to subdue them, until the restoration of David II., by  which time Murdoch Mackenzie had grown up a brave and intrepid youth,  approaching majority. The author of the Ardintoul MS. informs us that he was called  Murdo of the Cave; being perhaps not well tutored, he preferred sporting and hunting in the hills and forests to going to the Ward School, where the  ward children, or the heirs of those who held their lands and wards from  the King, were wont or bound to go, and he resorted to the dens and caves about Torridon and  Kenlochewe, hoping to get a hit at Leod Mac-gilleandrais, who was instrumental, under the Earl of Ross, to apprehend  and cut off his father.  In the meantime Leod hearing of Murdo&#x27;s resorting  to these bounds, that he was kindly entertained by some of the inhabitants,  and fearing that he  would  withdraw the services and affections of the  people from himself, and connive some mischief against him for his ill-usage of his father, he left no means untried to apprehend him, so that Mackenzie was obliged to start privately to Lochbroom, from whence, with only one companion, he went to his uncle, Macleod of Lewis, by  whom, after he had revealed himself to him alone, he was well received,  and both of them resolved to conceal his name until a fit opportunity  offered to make known his identity.  He, however, met with a certain man  named Gille Riabhach who came to Stornoway with twelve men, about  the same time as himself, and he, in the strictest confidence, told Gille Riabhach that he was Mackenzie of Kintail, which secret the latter kept  strictly inviolate.  Macleod entertained his nephew, keeping it an absolute  secret from others who he was, that his enemies might think that he was  dead, and so feel the greater security till such time as they would deem it wise that he should act for himself and make an attempt to rescue his  possessions from Macgilleandrais, who now felt quite secure, thinking  that Mackenzie had perished, having for so long heard nothing concerning  him.  When a suitable time arrived his uncle gave Murdo two of his great  galleys, with as many men (six score) as he desired, to accompany him,  his cousin german Macleod, the Gille Riabhach and his twelve followers,  all of whom determined to seek their fortunes with young Kintail.  They  embarked at Stornoway, and securing a favourable wind they soon arrived  at Sanachan, in Kishorn (some say at Poolewe), where they landed, marched straight towards Kenlochewe, and arrived at a thick wood near  the place where Macgilleandrais had his residence.  Mackenzie commanded his followers to lie down and watch, while he and his companion, Gille Riabhach, went  about in search of intelligence. He  soon found a woman cutting rushes, at the same time lamenting his own  supposed death and Leod Macgillearidrais&#x27; succession to the lands of  Kenlochewe in consequence.  He at once recognised her as the woman&#x27;s  sister who nursed or fostered him, drew near, spoke to her, sounded her,  and discovering her unmistakeable affection for him he felt that he could with perfect safety make himself known to her.  She was overjoyed to find that it was really he, whose absence and  loss she had so intensely and so  long lamented.  He then requested her to go and procure him information of Leod&#x27;s situation and occupation that night.  This she did with great  propriety and discretion.  Having satisfied herself, she returned at the  appointed time and assured him that Macgilleandrais felt perfectly secure,  quite unprepared for an attack, and bad just appointed to meet the adjacent  people next morning at a place called Ath-nan-Ceann (the Ford of the  Heads), preparatory to a hunting match, having instructed those who might arrive before him to wait his arrival.  Mackenzie considered this an  excellent opportunity for punishing Leod.  He in good time went to the ford accompanied by his followers.  Those invited by Leod soon after  arrived, and, seeing Mackenzie before them, thought he was Macgilleandrais with some of his men, but soon discovered their mistake. Mackenzie killed all those whom he did not recognise as soon as they appeared.  The natives of the place, who were personally known to him,  he pardoned and dismissed.  Leod soon turned up, and seeing such a  gathering awaiting  him, naturally thought that they were his own friends,  and hastened towards them, but on approaching nearer he found himself  &quot;in the fool&#x27;s hose.&quot;  Mackenzie and his band fell upon them with their  swords, and after a slight resistance Macgilleandrais and his party fled, but  they were soon overtaken at a place called to this day Featha Leoid or  Leod&#x27;s Bog, where they were all slain, except Leod&#x27;s son Paul, who was  taken prisoner and kept in captivity for some time, but was afterwards  released upon plighting his faith that he would never again trouble  Mackenzie or resent against him his father&#x27;s death.  Murdoch Mackenzie  being thus  re-possessed of Kenlochewe, &quot;gave Leod Macgilleandrais&#x27;  widow to Gillereach to wife for his good services and fidelity, whose posterity live at Kenlochewe and thereabout, and to this day some of them live there.&quot;  According to the Cromarty MS., Mackenzie possessed  himself of Lochbroom in right of his wife and disposed of Coigach to his  cousin Macleod, &quot;for his notable assistance in his distress; which lands  they both retained but could obtain no charters from the Earls of Ross, of  whom they held, the Earls of Ross pretending that they fell to themselves in default of male heirs, the other retaining possession in right of his wife  as heir of line.&quot; Paul Macgilleandrais some years after this repaired to the confines of Sutherland and Caithness, prevailed upon Murdo Riabhach, Kintail&#x27;s illegitimate son, to join him, and, according to one authority, became &quot;a common depredator,&quot; while according to another, he became what was  perhaps not inconsistent in those days with the character of a desperado --a  person of considerable state and property. They often &quot;spoiled&quot;  Caithness.  The Earl of Cromarty, referring to this raid,  says that Paul &quot;desired to make a spoil on some neighbouring country, a barbarous  custom but most ordinary in those days, as thinking thereby to acquire the  repute of valour and to become formidable as the greatest security amidst their unhappy feuds.  This, their prentice try or first exhibition, was called in Irish (Gaelic) `Creach mhacain&#x27; the young man&#x27;s herschip.&quot; Ultimately Murdo Riabhach and Paul&#x27;s only son were killed by Budge of Toftingall.   Paul was so mortified at the death of his young depredator son that he  gave up building the fortress of Duncreich, which he was at the time  erecting to strengthen still more his position in the county.  He gave his  lands of Strathoykel, Strathcarron, and Westray, with his daughter and  heiress in marriage, to Walter Ross, III. of Balnagown, on which condition  he obtained pardon from the Earl of Ross, the chief and superior of both. Mackenzie, after disposing of Macgilleandrais, returned to his own  country; where he was received with open arms by the whole population  of the district.  He then married the only daughter of his gallant friend and  defender, Duncan Macaulay--whose only son, Murdoch, had been killed   by Macgilleandrais--and through her his son ultimately succeeded to the  lands of Lochbroom and  Coigeach granted to Macaulay&#x27;s predecessor by  Alexander II.  Mackenzie was now engaged principally in preserving and  improving his possessions, until the return of David II. from England,  1357-8, when Murdoch laid before the King a complaint against the Earl  of Ross for the murder of his father, and claimed redress but the only  satisfaction he ever obtained was a confirmation of his rights previously granted by the King to &quot;Murdo filius Kennethi de Kintaill, etc.,&quot; dated &quot;Edinburg 1362, et Regni Domini Regis VI., Testibus Waltero Senescollo et allis.&quot; [MS. History of the Mackenzies.] Of Murdoch Dubh&#x27;s reign, the Laird of Applecross says:--&quot;During this turbulent age, securities and writs, as well as laws, were little  regarded; each man&#x27;s protection lay in his own strength.&quot; Kintail  regularly attended the first Parliament of Robert II., until it was decreed by  that King and his Privy Council that the services of the &quot;lesser barons&quot;  should not be required in future Parliaments or General Councils.  He then  returned home, and spent most of his time in hunting and wild sports, of  which he was devotedly fond, living peaceably and undisturbed during the remainder of his days.  This Baron of Kintail took no share in the recent rebellion under  the Lord of the Isles, who, backed by most of the other West Highland  chiefs, attempted to throw off his independence and have himself  proclaimed King of the Isles.  The feeble and effeminate Government of  David II., and the evil results consequent thereon throughout the country,  encouraged the island lord in this desperate enterprise, but, as Tytler says,  the King on this occasion, with an unwonted energy of character,  commanded the attendance of the Steward, with the prelates and barons  of the realm, and surrounded by this formidable body of vassals and retainers, proceeded against the rebels in person.&quot;  The expedition proved  completely successful, and John of the Isles, with a numerous train of  chieftains who joined him in the rebellion, met the King at Inverness, and  submitted to his authority.  He there engaged in the most solemn manner,  for himself and for his vassals, that they should yield themselves faithful  and obedient subjects to David their liege lord, and not only give due and  prompt obedience to the ministers of the  King in suit and service, as well  as in the payment of taxes and public burdens, but that they would coerce and put down all others, and compel all who dared to rise against the  King&#x27;s authority to make due submission, or pursue them from their  respective territories.&quot;  For the fulfilment of these obligations, the Lord of  the Isles not only gave his most solemn oath before the King and his  nobles, on condition of forfeiting his whole possessions in case of failure,  but offered his father-in-law, the High Steward, in security and delivered  his son Donald, his grandson Angus, and his natural son, also named  Donald, as hostages for the strict performance of the articles of the treaty,  which was duly signed, attested and dated, the 15th November, 1369. [For a full copy of this instrument, see  Invernessiana, pp. 69-70.] Fordun says that in order to crush the Highlanders, and the more easily, as the King thought, to secure obedience to the laws, he used  artifice by dividing the chiefs and promising high rewards to those who  would capture or kill their brother lords; and, that writer continues &quot;this  diabolical plan, by implanting the seeds of disunion amongst the chiefs,  succeeded, and  they gradually destroyed one another.&quot; Before his marriage Murdoch had three illegitimate sons.  One of them was called Hector or Eachainn Biorach.  He acquired the lands of  Drumnamarg by marrying Helen, daughter of Loban or Logan of Drum-namarg, who, according to the Earl of Cromarty, &quot;was one of the Earl of  Ross&#x27;s feuars.  This superior having an innate enmity with Kenneth&#x27;s race,  was the cause that this Hector had no peaceable possession of  Drumnamarg, but turning outlaw, retired to Eddirachillis, where he left a son called Henry, of whom are descended a race yet possessing there,  called Sliochd Ionraic, or Henry&#x27;s race.&quot;  The second bastard was named  Dugald Deargshuileach, &quot;from his red eyes.&quot;  From him descended John  Mackenzie, Commissary-Depute of Ross, afterwards in Cromarty, Rev.  Roderick Mackenzie, minister of Croy, John Mackenzie, a writer in   Edinburgh, and  several others of the name.  The third bastard  was named Alexander, and from him descended Clann Mhurchaidh Mhoir in  Ledgowan, and many of the common people who resided in the Braes of  Ross. Murdoch had another son Murdoch Riach, after his wife&#x27;s death, by a daughter of the Laird of Assynt, also illegitimate, although the Laird  of Applecross says that he was &quot;by another wife.&quot;  This Murdoch retired  to Edderachillis and married a Sutherland woman there, &quot;where, setting  up an independent establishment, he became formidable in checking the  Earl of Ross in his excursions against his clan, till he was killed by a  Caithness man named Budge of Toftingall.  His descendants are still  styled Clann Mhuirich, and among them we trace Daniel Mackenzie, who  arrived at the rank  of Colonel in the service of the Statholder, who had a  son Barnard, who was Major in Seaforth&#x27;s regiment, and killed at the  battle of Auldearn.  He too left a son, Barnard, who taught Greek and  Latin for four years at Fortrose, was next ordained by the Bishop of Ross and presented to the Episcopal Church of Cromarty, where, after a variety of fortunes, he died, and was buried in the Cathedral Church of Fortrose.    Alexander, eldest son of this last (Barnard), studied medicine under  Boerhave, and retired to practice at Fortrose. He married Ann, daughter of  Alexander Mackenzie of Belmaduthy, purchased the lands of Kinnock,  and left a son, Barnard, and two daughters, Catherine and Ann.&quot;  [Bennetsfield MS. of the Mackenzies.] This was the turbulent and insecure state of affairs throughout the Kingdom when the chief of Mackenzie was  peaceably  and  quietly enjoying  himself in  his Highland home.  He died in 1375.  [Murdo became a great favourite latterly with all those with whom he came in  contact.  &quot;He fell in company with the Earl of Sutherland, who became his very good friend afterwards, as that he still resorted his court. In end  (being comely of person and one active young man) the Earl&#x27;s lady (who  was King Robert the Bruce&#x27;s young daughter) fell in conceit of him, and  both forgetting the Earl&#x27;s kindness, by her persuasion, he got her with  child, who she caused name Dougall,&quot; and the earl suspecting nothing  amiss &quot;caused bred him at schools with the rest of his children but  Dougall being as ill-given as gotten, he still injured the rest, and when the  earl would challenge or offer to beat him, the Ladie still said, `Dear heart,  let him alone, it is hard to tell Dougall&#x27;s father,&#x27; which the good earle always took in good part.  In end, he comeing to years of discretion, she to&#x27;d her husband that Mackenzie was his father, and shortly thereafter, by  way of merriment, to&#x27;d the King how his lady cheated him. The King,  finding him to be his own cousine and of parts of learning, with all to  pleasure the earle and his lady, he made Dougall prior of Beauly.&quot;--Ancient MS.] By his wife Isabel, only child of Macaulay of Loch. broom,  Murdoch Dubh had a son and successor, V.  MURDOCH  MACKENZIE, Known as &quot;Murchadh na Drochaid,&quot; or Murdoch of the Bridge.  The author of the Ardintoul MS. say&#x27;s that &quot;he was called Murdo na Droit by  reason of some bad treatment his lady met with at the Bridge of Scatwell, which happened on this occasion.  He having lived for many years with  his lady and getting no&#x27; children, and so fearing that the direct line of his  family might fail in his person, was a little concerned and troubled thereat,  which being understood by some sycophants and flatterers that were about  him and would fain curry his favour, they thought that they could not  ingratiate themselves more on him than putting his lady out of the way, whereby he might marry another, and they waited an opportunity to put  their design in execution (some say not without his connivance), and so on  a certain evening or late at night as she was going to Achilty, where her laird lived, these wicked flatterers did presumptuously and barbarously  cast her over the Bridge of Scatwell, and then their conscience accusing  them for that horrid act they made off with themselves.  But the wonderful  providence of God carried the innocent lady (who was then with child)  nowithstanding the impetuousness of the river, safe to the shore, and  enabled her in the night-time to travel the length of Achilty, where her husband did impatiently wait her coming, that being the night she promised to be home, and entertained her very kindly, being greatly offended at the maltreatment she met with.  The child she had then in the womb was afterwards called Alexander, and some  say agnamed Inrick   because by a miracle or Providence he escaped that danger and afterwards  became heir to his father and inherited his estate.&quot; The author of the  Applecross MS. says that this Baron was called &quot;Murchadh no Droit&quot;  from &quot;the circumstances that his mother being with child of him, had been saved after a fearful fall from the Bridge of Scattal into the Water of  Conon.&quot;  The writer of the &quot;Ancient&quot; MS. history of the Mackenzies, the  oldest in existence, suggests that Mackenzie himself may have instigated  the ruffians to do away with his wife.  &quot;They lived,&quot; he says, &quot;a  considerable time together childless, but men in those days (of whom he  reason) preferred succession and manhood to wedlock.  He caused to  throw her under silence of night over the Bridge of Scatwell, but by Providence and by the course of the river she was cast ashore and escaped,  went back immediately to his house, then at Achilty, and went to his  bedside in a fond condition.  But commiserating her case and repenting  over the deed he gave her a hearty reception, learned from her that she  expected soon to become a mother, and &quot;so afterwards they lived together  contentedly all their days.&quot; During his earlier years Murdoch appears to have lived a peaceful life, following the example of loyalty to the Crown set him by his father,  keeping the laws himself, and compelling those over whom his  jurisdiction extended to do the same.  Nor, if we believe the MS.  historians of the family, was this dutiful and loyal conduct allowed to go  unrewarded.  All the successors of the Earl of Cromarty follow his  lordship in saying that a charter was given by King Robert to Murdo,  &quot;filius Murdochi de Kintail,&quot; of Kintail and Laggan Achadrom, dated at  Edinburgh, anno 1380, attested by &quot;Willielmus de Douglas, et Archibaldo  de Galloway, et Joanne, Cancellario Scotiae.&quot;  As already stated, however,  no such charter as this, or the one previously mentioned on the same  authority as having been granted to Murdoch IV. of Kintail, in 1362, is on record. Murdoch was one of the sixteen Highland chiefs who accompanied  the Scots under James, second  Earl of Douglas, in his famous march to England and defeated Sir Henry Percy, the renowned Hotspur, at the memorable battle of Otterburn, or Chevy Chase, in 1388. The period immediately following this historical raid across the Border was more than usually turbulent even for those days in the Scottish  Highlands, but Mackenzie managed to escape involving himself seriously  with either party to the many quarrels which culminated in the final  struggle for the earldom of Ross between the Duke of Albany and Donald,  Lord of the Isles, in 1411, at the battle of Harlaw. As soon as the news of the disaster to the Earl of Mar, who  commanded at Harlaw, reached the ears of the Duke of Albany, at the  time Regent for Scotland, he set about collecting an army with which, in the following autumn, he marched in person to the north determined to bring the Lord of the Isles to obedience. Having taken possession of the  Castle of Dingwall, he appointed a governor to it, and from thence  proceeded to recover the whole of Ross.  Donald retreated before him,  taking up  his winter quarters in the Western Islands. Hostilities were  renewed next summer, but the contest was not long or doubtful,  notwithstanding some little advantages obtained by the Lord of the Isles.    He was compelled for a time to give up his claim to the earldom of Ross,  to become a vassal of the Scottish Crown, arid to deliver hostages for his  good behaviour in the future. Murdoch must have felt secure in his stronghold of Ellandonnan, and been a man of great prudence, sagacity, and force of character, when, in spite of the commands of his nominal superior--the  Lord of the Isles--to support him in these unlawful and rebellious proceedings against the  King and threats of punishment in case of refusal, he resolutely declined to join him in his desperate and treasonable adventures.  He went the  length of saying that even if his lordship&#x27;s claims were just in themselves,  they would not justify a rebellion against the existing Government; and he  further informed him that, altogether independently of that  important consideration, he felt no great incentive to aid in the cause of the  representative of his grandfather&#x27;s murderer. Mackenzie was in fact one of  those prudent and loyal chiefs who kept at home in the Highlands, looking after his own affairs, the comfort of his followers, and laying a solid  foundation for the future prosperity of his house, &quot;which was so  characteristic of them that they always esteemed the authority of the  magistrate as an inviolable obligation.&quot; Donald of the Isles never forgave Mackenzie for thus refusing to assist him in obtaining the Earldom of Ross, and he determined to ruin  him if he could.  On this subject the Earl of Cromartie says that at the  battle of Harlaw Donald was assisted by almost &quot;all the northern people,  Mackenzie excepted, who because of the many injuries received by his  predecessors from the Earls of Ross, and chiefly by the instigation and  concurrence of Donald&#x27;s predecessors, he withdrew and  refused concurrence.  Donald resolved to ruin him, but deferred it till his return,  which falling out more unfortunately than he expected, did not allow him  power nor opportunity to use the vengeance he intended, for on his return to Ross he sent Mackenzie a friend with fair speeches desiring his  friendship, thinking no enemy despicable as he then stood.&quot;  Murdoch, at  Donald&#x27;s request, proceeded to Dingwall, where the Island Lord urged  him to join and promise him to support his interest.  This Mackenzie firmly refused, &quot;partly out of hatred to his family for old feuds, partly dissuaded by Donald&#x27;s declining fortunes&quot; at that particular period ;  whereupon the Lord of the Isles made Murdoch prisoner in an  underground chamber in the Castle of Dingwall.   He was not long here,  however, when he found an opportunity of making his plight known to  some of his friends, and he was soon after released in exchange for some  of Donald&#x27;s immediate relatives who had been purposely captured by  Mackenzie&#x27;s devoted vassals. Here it may be appropriate to give the traditionary account of the origin of the Macraes and how they first found their way to Kintail and  other places in the West; for their relationship with the Mackenzies has  from the earliest times been of the closest and most loyal character.   Indeed, from the aid they invariably afforded them they have been aptly  described as &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s shirt of mail.&quot;  According to the Rev. John  Macrae, minister of Dingwall, who died in 1704, and wrote the only  existing trustworthy history and genealogy of his own clan, the Macraes  came originally from Clunes, in the Aird of Lovat, recently acquired from patriotic family reasons by Horatio Macrae, W.S., Edinburgh, the  representative in this country of the Macraes of Inverinate, who were  admittedly the chiefs of that brave and warlike race.  The Rev. John  Macrae, who was himself a member of the Inverinate family, says that the Macraes left the Aird under the following circumstances:--A dispute had  arisen in the hunting field between Macrae of Clunes and a bastard son of Lovat, when a son of Macrae intervened to protect his father, and killed  Fraser&#x27;s son in the scuffle.  The victor &quot;immediately ran oft; and calling  himself John Carrach, that he might be less known, settled on the West  Coast, and of him are descended the branch of the Macraes called Clann  Ian Charraich. It was some time after this that his brethren and other  relatives began seriously to consider that Lovat&#x27;s own kindred and friends became too numerous, and that the country could not accommodate them  all, which was a motive for their removing to other places according as  they had encouragement.  One of the brothers went to Brae Ross and lived  at Brahan, where there is a piece of land called Knock Vic Ra, and the  spring well which affords water to the Castle is called Tober Vic Ra. His  succession spread westward to Strathgarve, Strathbraan, and Strathconan,  where several of them live at this time.  John Macrae, who was a merchant in Inverness, and some of his brethren, were of them, and some others in  Ardmeanach.  Other two of MacRa&#x27;s sons, elder than the above, went off  from Clunes several  ways; one  is said  to have gone to Argyleshire and  another to Kintail.  In the meantime their father remained at Clunes all his  days, and bad four Lords Fraser of Lovat fostered in his house.  He that  went to Argyle, according to our tradition, married the heiress of Craignish, and on that account took the surname of Campbell.  The other  brother who went to Kintail, earnestly invited and encouraged by  Mackenzie, who then had no kindred of his own blood, the first six  Barons, or Lords of Kintail, having but one lawful son to succeed the  father, hoping that the MacRas, by reason of their relation, as being  originally descended from the same race of people in Ireland would prove  more faithful than others, wherein he was not disappointed, for the  MacRas of Kintail served him and his successors very faithfully in every  quarrel they had with neighbouring clans, and by their industry, blood, and  courage, have been instrumental in raising that family.&quot;  The writer adds that he does not know Macrae&#x27;s christian name, but that he married &quot;a  daughter or grand-daughter of MacBeolan, who possessed a large part of  Kintail before Mackenzie&#x27;s predecessors got a right of it from Alexander  III.&quot;  This  marriage, and their common ancestry from a native Celtic  source, and not from &quot;the same race of people in Ireland&quot; seems a much  more probable explanation of the early and continued friendship which  existed between the two families than that suggested by the rev. author of  &quot;The Genealogy of the Macraes,&quot; above quoted. But the curious circumstance to which he directs attention  regarding the first five Mackenzie chiefs is quite true.  It is borne out by every genealogy of the House of Kintail which we have ever seen. There  is not a trace of any legitimate male descendant from the first of the name  down to Alexander, the sixth baron, except the immediately succeeding  chief, so that their vassals and followers in the field and elsewhere must,  for nearly two hundred years, have been men of different septs and tribes and names, except the progeny of their own illegitimate sons, such as  &quot;Sliochd Mhurcbaidh Riabhaich&quot; and others of similar base origin.  Murdoch married Finguala or Florence, daughter of Malcolm  Macleod, III. of Harris and Dunvegan, by his wife, Martha, daughter of  Donald Stewart, Earl of Mar, nephew of King Robert the Bruce.  By this  marriage the Royal blood of the Bruce was introduced for the first time  into the family of Kintail, as also that of the ancient Kings of Man. Tormod Macleod, II. of Harris, who was grandson of Olave the Black, last  Norwegian King of Man, and who, as we have seen, had married Christina, daughter of Ferquhard O&#x27;Beolan, Earl of Ross, married Finguala Mac Crotan, the daughter of an ancient and powerful Irish chief.   By this  lady Malcolm Macleod, III. of Harris and Dunvegan, had issue, among  others, Finguala, who now became the wife of Murdoch Mackenzie and  mother of Alexander Ionraic, who carried on the succession of the ancient line of Kintail. Murdoch died in 1416 when he was succeeded by his only son, VI.  ALEXANDER  MACKENZIE, Alastair Ionraic, or Alexander the Upright, so called &quot;for his righteousness.&quot;  He was among the Western barons summoned in 1427, to  meet King James I. at Inverness, who, on his return from a long captivity in England, in 1424, determined to put down the rebellion and oppression  which was then and for some time previously so rampant in the Highlands. To judge by the poceedings of a Parliament held at Perth on the 30th  September 1426, James exhibited a foresight and appreciation of the  conduct of the lairds in those days, and passed laws which might with  good effect, and with equal propriety, be applied to the state of affairs in  our own time.  In that Parliament an Act was passed which, among other  things, ordained that, north of the Grampians, the fruit of those lands  should be expended in the country where those lands lie.  The Act is as  follows:--&quot;It is ordanit be the King ande the Parliament that everilk lorde  hafande landis bezonde the mownthe (the Grampians) in the quhilk landis  in auld  tymes there  was  castellis,  fortalyces  and  manerplaicis, big,  reparell and reforme their castellis and maneris, and duell in thame, be  thameself, or be ane of thare frendis for the gracious gournall of thar  landis, be gude polising and to expende ye fruyt of thar landis in the  countree where thar landis lyis.&quot; [Invernessiana, p.102.] James was determined to bring the Highlanders to submission, and Fordun relates a characteristic anecdote in which the King pointedly declared his resolution. When the excesses in the Highlands were first  reported to him by one of his nobles, on entering Scotland, he thus  expressed himself :--&quot; Let God but grant me life, and there shall not be a  spot in my dominions where the key shall riot keep the castle, and the  furze bush the cow, though I myself should lead the life of a dog to  accomplish it&quot;; and it was in this frame of mind that he visited Inverness  in 1427, determined to establish good government and order in the North,  then in such a state of insubordination that neither life nor  property was  secure.  The principal chiefs, on his order or invitation met him, from  what motives it is impossible to determine--whether hoping for a reconciliation by prompt compliance with the Royal will, or from a dread, in case of refusal, to suffer the fate of the Southern barons who had  already fallen victims to his severity.  The order was in any case obeyed,  and all the leading chiefs repaired to meet him at the Castle of Inverness. As they entered the ball, however, where the Parliament was at the time  sitting, they were, one by one, by order of the King, arrested, ironed, and  imprisoned in different apartments, and debarred from having any  communications with each other, or with their followers. Fordun says that James displayed marks of great joy as these turbulent and haughty spirits, caught in the toils which he had prepared for  them, came voluntarily within reach of his regal power, and that be  &quot;caused to be arrested Alexander of the Isles, and his mother, Countess of  Ross, daughter and heiress of Sir Walter Lesley, as well as the more  notable men of the north, each of whom he wisely invited singly to the  Castle, and caused to be put in strict confinement apart.  There he also  arrested Angus Duff (Angus Dubh Mackay) with his four sons, the leader  of 4000 men from Strathnarven (Strathnaver.)  Kenneth More, with his  son-in-law, leader of two thousand men; [All writers on the Clan  Mackenzie have hitherto claimed this Kenneth More as their Chief, and  argued from the above that Mackenzie had a following of two thousand fighting men in 1427.  It will be seen that Alexander was Chief at this  time, but Kenneth More may have been intended for MacKenneth More,  or the Great Mackenzie.  He certainly could have had no such following of his own name.] John Ross, William Lesley, Angus de Moravia, and  Macmaken, leaders of two thousand men; and also other lawless caterans  and great captains in proportion, to the number of about fifty Alexander  Makgorrie (MacGodfrey) of Garmoran, and John Macarthur (of the family  of Campbell), a great chief among his own clan, and the leader of a  thousand and more, were convicted, and being adjudged to death were  beheaded.  Then James Cambel was hanged, being accused and convicted  of the slaughter of John of the Isles (John Mor, first of the Macdonalds of  Isla.) The rest were sent here and there to the different castles of the noblemen throughout the kingdom, and were afterwards condemned to different kinds of death, and some were set at liberty.&quot;  Among the latter  was Alexander of Kintail.  The King sent him, then a mere youth, to the  High School at Perth, at that time the principal literary seminary in the kingdom, while the city itself was frequently the seat of the Court. During Kintail&#x27;s absence it appears that his three bastard uncles ravaged the district of Kinlochewe, for we find them insulting and troubling &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s tenants in  Kenlochewe and Kintail   Macaulay, who was still Constable in Ellandonnan, not thinking it proper to leave his  post, proposed Finlay Dubh Mac Gillechriost as the fittest person to be  sent to St. Johnston, now Perth, and by general consent he accordingly  went to inform his young master, who was then there with the rest of the  King&#x27;s ward children at school, of his lordship&#x27;s tenants being imposed on  as above, which, with Finlay&#x27;s remonstrance on the subject, prevailed on  Alexander, his young master, to come home, and being backed with all the assistance Finlay could command, soon brought his three bastard uncles to condign punishment.&quot; [Genealogical Account of the Macraes.] The writer of the Ardintoul MS. says that Finlay &quot;prevailed on him to go home without letting the master of the school know of it. Trysting with him at a certaiu place and set hour they set off, and, lest any should  surprise them, they declined the common road and went to Macdougall of  Lorn, he being acquainted with him at St. Johnston.  Macdougall  entertained him kindly, and kept him with him for several days.  He at that  time made his acquaintance with Macdougall&#x27;s daughter, whom  afterwards he married, and from thence came to his own Kintail, and  having his authority and right backed with the power of the people, he  calls his bastard uncles before him, and removes their quarters from  Kenlochewe, and gave them possessions in Glenelchaig in Kintail  prescribing measures and rule for them how to behave, assuring them,  though he pardoned them at that time, they should forfeit favours and be  severely punished if they transgressed for the future; but after this, going  to the county of Ross to their old dwelling at Kenlochewe, they turned to practice their old tricks and broke loose, so that he was forced to correct  their insolency and make them shorter by the heads, and thus the people  were quit of their trouble.&quot; The young Lord of the Isles was at the same time that Mackenzie  went to Perth sent to Edinburgh, from which he soon afterwards escaped to the North, at the instigation of his mother, the Countess, raised his  vassals, and, joined by all the outlaws and vagabonds in the country,   numbering a formidable body of about ten thousand, he laid waste the  country, plundered and devastated the crown lands, against which his  vengeance was specially directed, razed the Royal burgh of Inverness to  the ground, pillaged and burned the houses, and perpetrated every  description of cruelty. He then besieged the Castle, but without success, after which he retired precipitately towards Lochaber, where he was met  by the Royal forces, commanded by the King in person.  The Lord of the  Isles prepared for battle, but he had the mortification to notice the desertion of Clan Chattan and Clan Cameron, who had previously joined  him, and of seeing them going over in a body to the Royal standard.  The  King immediately attacked the island chief and completely routed his  forces, while their leader sought safety in flight.  He was vigorously  pursued, and finding escape or concealment equally impossible, and being  reduced to the utmost distress, hunted from place to place by his vigilant  pursuers, the haughty chief resolved to throw himself entirely on the  mercy of His Majesty, and finding his way to Edinburgh in the most secret manner, and on the occasion of a solemn festival on Easter Sunday, in  1429, at Holyrood, he suddenly appeared in his shirt and drawers before  the King and Queen, surrounded by all the nobles of the Court, while they were engaged in their devotions before the High Altar, and implored, on  his knees, with a naked sword held by the point in his hand, the  forgiveness of his sovereign.  With bonnet in hand, his legs and arms quite  bare, his body covered only with a plaid, and in token of absolute  submission, he offered his sword to the King.  His appearance,  strengthened by the solicitations of the affected Queen and all the nobles,   made such an impression on His Majesty that he submitted to the  promptings of his heart against the wiser and more prudent dictates of his  judgment.  He accepted  the sword offered him, and spared the life of his captive, but immediately committed him to Tantallon Castle, under the  charge of William Douglas, Earl of Angus.  The spirit of Alexander&#x27;s followers, however, could not brook this mortal offence, and the whole  strength of the clan was promptly mustered under his cousin Donald  Balloch, who led them to Lochaber, where they met the King&#x27;s forces  under the Earls of Mar and Caithness, killed the latter, gained a complete  victory over the Royal army, and returned to the Isles in triumph, with an  immense quantity of spoil. James soon after proceeded north in person as far as Dunstaffnage; Donald Balloch fled to Ireland; and, after several encounters with the  rebels, the King obtained the submission of the  majority of the  chiefs  who were engaged in the rebellion, while others were promptly  apprehended and executed to the number of about three hundred.  The  King thereupon released the Lord of the Isles from Tantallon Castle, and  granted him a free pardon for all his rebellious acts, confirmed him in all  his titles and possessions, and further conferred upon him, in addition, the  Lordship of Lochaber, which had previously, on its forfeiture, been  granted to the Earl of Mar.  After his first escape from Edinburgh, the Lord of the Isles again in  1429 raised the standard of revolt.  He for the second time burnt the town  of Inverness, while Mackenzie was &quot;attending to his duties at Court.&quot; Kintail was recalled by his followers, who armed for the King, and led by their young chief on his return home, they materially aided in the  overthrow of Alexander of the Isles at the same time securing peace and  good government in their own district, and among most of the surrounding  tribes.  Alexander is also found actively supporting the King, and with the  Royal army, during the turbulent rule of John, successor to Alexander,  Lord of the Isles, who afterwards, in 1447, died at peace with his  sovereign. James I. died in 1460, and was succeeded by James II. When, in 1462, the Earl of Douglas, the Lord of the Isles, and Donald Balloch of  Isla entered into a treaty with the King of England for the subjugation of  Scotland, on condition, in the event of success, that the whole of Scotland,  north of the Firth of Forth, should be divided between them, Alexander  Mackenzie stood firm in the interest of the ruling monarch, and with such success that nothing came of this extraordinary compact.  We soon after  find him rewarded by a charter in  his favour, dated 7th January 1463,  confirming him in his lands of Kintail, with a further grant of the &quot;5 merk lands of Killin, the lands of Garve, and the 2 merk lands of Coryvulzie,  with the three merk lands of Kinlochluichart, and 2 merk lands of Ach-na-Clerich, the 2 merk lands of Garbat, the merk lands of Delintan, and the 4  merk lands of Tarvie, all lying within the shire and Earldom of Ross, to be  holden of the said John and his successors, Earls of Ross.&quot;  This is the first  Crown charter in favour of the Mackenzie chief of which any authentic  record exists. Alexander continued to use  his great influence at Court, as well as  with John Lord of the Isles, for the purpose of bringing about a  reconciliation between his Majesty and his powerful subject during the  unnatural rebellion of Angus Og against his father. The King, however,  proved inexorable, and refused to treat with the Earl on any condition  other than the absolute and unconditional surrender of the earldom of  Ross to the Crown, of which, however, he would be allowed to hold all his other possessions in future. These conditions the island chief haughtily refused, again flew to arms, and in 1476 invaded Moray, but finding that  he could offer no effectual resistance to the powerful forces sent against  him by the King, he, by the seasonable grants of the lands of Knapdale and  Kintyre, secured the influence of Colin, first Earl of Argyll, in his favour,  and with the additional assistance of Kintail, procured remission of his  past offences on the conditions previously offered to him and resigning for  ever, in 1476, the Earldom of Ross to the King, he &quot;was infeft of new&quot; in the Lordship of the Isles and the other possessions which he had not been called upon to renounce.  The Earldom was in the same year, in the 9th  Parliament of James III., irrevocably annexed to the Crown, where the title and the honours still remain, held by the Prince of Wales. The great services rendered by the Baron of Kintail to the reigning family, especially during these negotiations, and generally throughout his  long rule at Ellandonnan, were recognised by a charter from the Crown,  dated Edinburgh, November 1476, of some of the lands renounced by the  Earl of Ross, viz., Strathconan, Strathbraan, and Strathgarve; and after this  the Barons of Kintail held all their lands quite independently of any  superior but the Crown.  During the long continued disputes between the Earl of Ross and  Kintail no one was more zealous in the cause of the island chief than  Allan Macdonald of Moydart, who, during Mackenzie&#x27;s absence, made  several raids into Kintail, ravaged the country, and carried away large numbers of cattle.  After the forfeiture of the Earldom of Ross, Allan&#x27;s  youngest brother, supported by a faction of the tenantry, rebelled against  his elder brother, and possessed himself for a time of the Moydart estates. The Lord of the Isles was unwilling to appear so soon in these broils; or perhaps he favoured the pretentions of the younger brother, and refused to  give any assistance to Allan, who, however, hit upon a device as bold as it  ultimately proved successful.   He started for Kinellan, &quot;being ane ile in  ane loch,&quot; where Mackenzie at the time resided, and presented himself  personally before his old enemy, who was naturally surprised beyond  measure to receive such a visit from one to whom he had never been  reconciled.  Allan, however, related how he had been oppressed by his  brother and his nearest friends and how he had been refused aid from  those to whom he had a natural right to look for it.  In these desperate circumstances he resolved to apply to his greatest enemy, who, he argued,  might for any assistance he could give gain in return as faithful a friend as  he bad previously been his &quot;diligent adversary.&quot; Alexander, on hearing  the story, was moved to pity by the manner in which Allan had been  oppressed by his own relatives, promised him the required support,  proceeded in person with a sufficient force to repossess him, and finally accomplished his purpose.  The other Macdonalds, who had  been   dispossessed  thereupon  represented to the King that Alexander  Mackenzie had invaded their territory as a &quot;disturber of the peace, and ane  oppressor,&quot; the result being that he was cited before His Majesty at  Edinburgh, &quot;but here was occasion given to Allan to requite Alexander&#x27;s  generosity,  for Alexander  having raised armies to assist him, without  commission, he found in it a transgression of the law, though just upon the matter; so to prevent Alexander&#x27;s prejudice, he presently went to Holyrood  house, where the King was, and being of a bold temper, did  truly relate how his and Alexander&#x27;s affairs stood, showing withal that he,  as being the occasion of it, was ready to suffer what law would exact  rather than to expose so generous a friend to any hazard.  King James was so taken with their reciprocal heroisms, that he not only forgave, but  allowed Alexander, and of new confirmed Allan in the lands of Moydart.&quot;  [Cromartie MS. of the Mackenzies.]  The two were then allowed to return  home unmolested. Some time before this a desperate skirmish took place at a place called Bealach nam Brog, &quot;betwixt the heights of Fearann Donuil and  Lochbraon&quot; (Dundonald and Lochbroom), which was brought about by  some of Kintail&#x27;s vassals, instigated by Donald Garbh M&#x27;Iver, who  attempted to seize the Earl of Ross.  The plot was, however, discovered,  and M&#x27;Iver was seized by the Lord of the Isles&#x27; followers, and imprisoned in the Castle of Dingwall.  He was soon released, however, by  his  undaunted countrymen from Kenlochewe, consisting of Macivers,  Maclennans, Macaulays, and Macleays, who, by way of reprisal, pursued  and seized the Earl&#x27;s relative, Alexander Ross of Balnagown, and carried  him along with them. The Earl at once apprised Lord Lovat, who was  then His Majesty&#x27;s Lieutenant in the North, of the illegal seizure of  Balnagown, and his lordship promptly dispatched northward two hundred  men, who, joined by Ross&#x27;s vassals, the Munroes of Fowlis, and the  Dingwalls of Kildun, pursued and overtook the western tribes at Bealach  nam Brog, where they were resting themselves.  A sanguinary conflict ensued, aggravated and more than usually exasperated by a keen and bitter recollection of ancient feuds and animosities.  The Kenlochewe men seem  to have been almost extirpated.  The race of Dingwall were actually  extinguished, one hundred and forty of their men having been slain, while the family of Fowlis lost eleven members of their house alone, with many  of the leading men of their clan. [&quot;Among the rest ther wer slain eleven  Monroes or the House or Foulls, that wer to succeed one after another; so that the succession of Foulls fell into a chyld then lying in his cradle.&quot;--Sir  Robert Gordon&#x27;s History 0f the Earldom of Sutherland, p. 36.] An interesting account of this skirmish and the cause which led to it is given in one of the family manuscripts.  It says Euphemia Leslie,  Countess Dowager of Ross, lived at Dingwall.  She would gladly have  married Alexander of Kintail, he being a proper handsome young man,  and she signified no less to himself.  He refused the offer, perhaps,  because  he plighted  his faith to Macdougall&#x27;s daughter, but though he  had not had done so, he had all the reason imaginable to  reject the  Countess&#x27;s offer, for besides that she was not able to add to his estate, being but a life-rentrix, she was a turbulent woman, and therefore, in the  year 1426, the King committed her to prison in St. Colin&#x27;s Isle (Dingwall),  because she had instigated her son, Alexander Earl of Ross, to rebellion. She invited Kintail to her Court in Dingwall to make a last effort, but  finding him obstinate she converted her love to hatred and revenge, and  made him prisoner, and either by torturing or bribing his page, he  procured the golden ring which was the token between Mackenzie and  Macaulay, the governor of Ellandonnan, who had strict orders not to quit  the castle or suffer any one to enter it until he sent him that token. The  Countess sent a gentleman to Ellandonnan with the ring, who, by her  instructions, informed Macaulay that his master was, or shortly would be, married to the Countess of Ross, desiring the Governor to repair to his  master and to leave. the stronghold with him.  Macaulay seeing and  receiving the ring believed the story, and gave up the castle, but in a few  days he discovered his mistake and found that his chief was a prisoner  instead of being a bridegroom.  He went straight to Dingwall, and finding an opportunity to communicate with Mackenzie, the latter made  allegorical remarks by which Macaulay understood that nothing would  secure his release but the apprehension of Ross of Balnagown, who was  grand uncle, or grand uncle&#x27;s son to the Countess.  Macaulay returned to  Kintail, made up a company of the &quot;prettiest fellows&quot; he could find of Mackenzie&#x27;s family, and went back with them to Easter Ross, and in the  morning apprehended Balnagown in a little arbour near the house, in a  little wood to which he usually resorted for an airing, and, mounting him on horseback, carried him westward among the hills. Balnagown&#x27;s friends  were soon in pursuit, but fearing capture, Macaulay sent Balnagown away  under guard, resolving to fight and detain the pursuers at Bealach nam  Brog, as already described, until Balnagown was safely out of their reach. After his success here Macaulay went to Kintail, and at Glenluing, five  miles from Ellandonnan, he overtook thirty men, sent by the Countess,  with meal and other provisions for the garrison, and the spot, where they seized them is to this day called Innis nam Balg.  Macaulay secured them, and placed his men in their upper garments and plaids, who took the sacks of meal on their backs, and went straight with them to the garrison, whose  impoverished condition induced  the Governor to admit them without any  enquiry, not doubting but they were his own friends.  Once inside they  threw down their burdens, drew their weapons from under their plaids, seized the new Governor and all his men and kept them in captivity until  Mackenzie was afterwards exchanged for the Governor and Balnagown.  [Ardintoul MS.] There has been considerable difference of opinion as to the date of  this encounter, but it is finally set at rest by the discovery of a positive  date in the Fowlis papers, where it is said that &quot;George, the fourth Laird,  and his son, begotton on Balnagown&#x27;s daughter, were killed at the conflict  of Beallach na Brog, in the year 1452, and Dingwall of Kildun, with  several of their friends and followers, in taking back the Earl of Ross&#x27;s second son from Clan Iver, Clan Tarlich or Maclennans, and Clan Leod.&quot;  [The Earl of Cromarty gives a different version, and says that the battle or  skirmish took place in the year immediately after the Battle of Harlaw. In  this he is manifestly in error.  The Highlanders, to defend themselves from  the arrows of their enemies, with their belts tied their shoes on their  breasts, hence the name &quot;Bealach nam Brog,&quot; or the Pass of the Shoes.]   The Balnagown of that date was not the Earl of Ross&#x27;s son, but a near  relative. Angus Og, after many sanguinary conflicts with his father, finally overthrew him at the battle of the Bloody Bay, between Tobermory and Ardnamurchan, obtained possession of all the extensive territories of his clan, and was recognised as its legitimate head.  He then determined to  punish Mackenzie for having taken his father&#x27;s part at Court, and  otherwise, during the rebellion, and swore that he would recover from him the great possessions which originally belonged to his predecessors, the  Lords of the Isles, but now secured by Royal Charter to the Baron of  Kintail.  With this object he decided to attack him, and marched to  Inverness, where he expected to meet the now aged Mackenzie returning  from attendance at Court.  Angus, however, missed his object, and instead of killing Mackenzie, he was himself assassinated by his harper, an  Irishman. This tragic, but well-merited, close to such a violent and  turbulent career, is recorded in the Red Book of Clan Ranald in the  following terms:--&quot;Donald, the son of Angus that was killed at Inverness by his own harper, son of John of the Isles, son of Alexander, son of Donald, son of John, son of Angus Og;&quot; an event which must have occurred about 1485. Alexander was the first of the family who lived on the island In Loch Kinellan, while at the same time he had Brahan as a &quot;maines,&quot; or  farm, both of which his successor for a time held from the King at a yearly  rent, until Kenneth feued Brahan, and Colin, his son, feued Kinellan. The  Earl of Sutherland had been on friendly terms with Mackenzie, and  appointed him as his deputy in the management of the Earldom of Ross,  which devolved on him after the forfeiture.  On one occasion, the Earl of Sutherland being in the south at Court, the Strathnaver men and the men  of the Braes of Caithness took advantage of his absence and invaded  Sutherland.  An account of their conduct soon spread abroad, and reached  the ears of the Chief of Kintail, who at once with a party of six hundred men, passed into Sutherland, where, the Earl&#x27;s followers having joined  him, he defeated the invaders, killed a large number of them, forced the  remainder to sue for peace, and compelled them to give substantial  security for their peaceful behaviour in future. Kintail was now a very old man.  His prudence and sagacity well repaid the judicious patronage of the first King James, confirmed and  extended by his successors on the throne, and, as has been well said by his  biographer, secured for him &quot;the love and respect of three Princes in  whose reign be flourished, and as his prudent management in the Earldom  of Ross showed him to be a man of good natural parts, so it very much  contributed to the advancement of the interest of his family by the  acquisition of the lands he thereby made; nor was he less commendable  for the quiet and peace he kept among his Highlanders, putting the laws  punctually in execution against all delinquents.&quot;  Such a character as this,  justly called Alastair Ionraic, or the just, was certainly well fitted to govern, and deserved to flourish in the age in which he lived.  Various important events occurred during the latter part of his life, but as Kenneth,  his brave son and successor, was the actual leader of the clan for many  years before his father&#x27;s death, and especially at the celebrated battle of  Park, the leading battles and feuds in which the clan was engaged during  this period will be dealt with in the account of that Baron.  There has been much difference of opinion among the genealogists  and  family historians regarding Alexander&#x27;s two wives.  Both Edmonston  in his Baronagium Genealogicum, and  Douglas  in  his  Peerage say  that Alexander&#x27;s first wife was Agnes, sixth daughter of Colin, first Earl of  Argyll.  This we shall prove to be absolutely impossible within the  ordinary course of the laws of nature.  Colin, first Earl of Argyll,  succeeded as a minor in  1453, his uncle, Sir Colin Campbell of  Glenurchy, having been appointed his tutor.  Colin of Argyll was created  Earl in 1457, probably on his coming of age.  He married Isabel Stewart of  Lorn, had two sons, and, according to Crawford, five daughters. If he had  a daughter Agnes she must have been his sixth daughter and eighth child,  Assuming that Argyll married when he became of age, about 1457, Agnes,  as his eighth surviving child, could not have been born before 1470.  Her reputed husband, Alexander of Kintail, was then close upon 70 years of  age, having died in 1488, bordering upon 90, when his alleged wife would  barely have reached a marriageable age, and when her reputed son,  Kenneth a Bhlair, pretty well advanced in years, had already fought the famous battle of Park.  John of Killin, her alleged grandson, was born  about 1480, when at most the lady said to have been his grandmother  could only have been 10 to 15 years of age, and, in 1513, at the age of 33,  he distinguished himself at the battle of  Flodden, where Archibald  second Earl of Argyll, the lady&#x27;s brother, at least ten years older than  Agnes, was slain.  All this is of course impossible. A similar difficulty has arisen, from what appears to be a very simple cause, about  Alexander&#x27;s second marriage.  The authors of all the family MS. histories are unanimous in stating that his first wife was Anna,  daughter of John Macdougall of Lorn, or Dunollich, known as John Mac  Alan Mac Cowle, fourth in descent from Alexander de Ergedia and Lord  of Lorn (1284), and eighth from Somerled, Thane of Argyle, who died in  1164.  Though the direct line of the house of Lorn ended in two heiresses who, in 1388, carried away the property to their husbands, the  Macdougalls of Dunollich became the male representatives of the ancient  and illustrious house of Lorn ; and this fully accounts for the difference  and confusion which has been introduced about the families of Lorn and   Dunollich in some of the Mackenzie family manuscripts. The same authorities who affirm that Agnes of Argyll was  Alexander&#x27;s first wife assert that Anna Macdougall, was his second.   There is ample testimony to show that the latter was his first, although some confusion has again arisen in this case from a similarity of names  and patronymics.   Some of the family MSS. say that Alexander&#x27;s second  wife was Margaret, daughter of &quot;M&#x27;Couil,&quot; &quot;M&#x27;Chouile,&quot; or  &quot;Macdougall&quot; of Morir, or Morar, while others, among them the Allangrange Ancient  MS. have it that she was &quot;MacRanald&#x27;s daughter.&quot; The Ardintoul MS. describes her as &quot;Muidort&#x27;s daughter.&quot;  One of the  Gairloch MSS. says that she was &quot;Margarite, the daughter of Macdonald  of Morar, of the Clan Ranald Race, from the stock of Donald, Lord of the  Aebudae Islands,&quot; while in another MS. in Sir Kenneth  Mackenzie&#x27;s  possession  she  is designated &quot;Margaret Macdonald, daughter of  Macdonald of Morar.&quot;  There is thus an apparent contradiction, but it can be conclusively shown that the lady so variously described was one and  the same person.  Gregory in his Highlands and Islands of Scotland, p.  158, states that &quot;Macdougall&quot; was the patronymic of one of the families of  Clan Ranald of Moydart and Morar.  Speaking of Dugald MacRanald, son and successor to Ranald Ban Ranaldson of Moydart, he says, &quot;Allan the  eldest son of Dougal, and the undoubted male heir of Clan Ranald,  acquired the estate of Morar, which he transmitted to his descendants. He  and his successors were always styled, in Gaelic, MacDhughail Mhorair,  ie., MacDougal of Morar, from their ancestor, Dougald MacRanald.&quot;  At  p. 65 he says that &quot;the Clan Ranald of Garmoran comprehended the  families of Moydart, Morar, Knoydart, and Glengarry.&quot;  This family was  descended from Ranald, younger son of John of the Isles, by his marriage  with the heiress of the MacRorys or MacRuaries of Garmoran whose  ancestry, from Somerled of the Isles, is as illustrious as that of any family  in the kingdom.  A district north of Arisaig is still known among  the Western Islanders as &quot;Mor-thir Mhic Dhughail&quot; or the mainland possession of the son of Dougall.  The MS. histories of the Mackenzies having been all written after the patronymic of &quot;MacDhughail&quot; was acquired by the Macdonalds of Moydart and Morar, they naturally enough  described Alexander of Kintail&#x27;s second wife as a daughter of Macdougall  of Morar, of Muidort, and of Clan Ranald, indiscriminately.  But in point of fact all these designations describe one and the same person. Alexander  married  first, Anna, daughter of John Macdougall of Dunolly, with issue-- 1.  Kenneth, his heir and successor. 2.  Duncan, progenitor of the Mackenzies of Hilton, and their branches, and of whom in their order as the senior cadet family of the  clan. He married secondly Margaret, daughter of Macdonald of Morar, a cadet of Clanranald, with issue-- 3.  Hector Roy or &quot;Eachainn Ruadh,&quot; from whom are descended  the Mackenzies of Gairloch and their various offshoots, of whom in their  proper place. 4. A daughter, who married Allan Macleod, Hector Roy&#x27;s  predecessor in Gairloch. He is also said to have had a natural son, Dugal, who became a priest and was Superior of the Priory of Beauly, which he repaired about  1478, and in which he is buried.  This ecclesiastic is said by others to have  been Alexander&#x27;s brother. (Anderson&#x27;s History of the Frasers, p. 66; and  MS. History of the Mackenzies.) Alexander died in 1488 at Kinellan, having attained the extreme old age of 90 years, was buried in the Priory of Beauly, and was succeeded  by his eldest son by the first marriage, VII.  KENNETH  MACKENZIE, Better known as &quot;Coinneach a&#x27; Bhlair,&quot; or Kenneth of the Battle, from his prowess and success against the Macdonalds at the Battle of Park during  his father&#x27;s life-time.  He was served heir to his predecessor and seized in  the lands of Kintail at Dingwall on the 2nd of September, 1488.  He  secured the cognomen &quot;Of the Battle&quot; from the distinguished part he took  in &quot;Blar-na-Pairc&quot; fought at a well-known spot still pointed out near  Kinellan, above Strathpeffer. His father was advanced in life before  Kenneth married, and as soon as the latter arrived at twenty years of age Alexander thought it prudent, with the view of establishing peace between the two families, to match Kenneth, his heir and successor, with Margaret, daughter of John Lord of the Isles and fourth  Earl  of Ross, and for  ever   extinguish  their ancient feuds in that alliance.  The Island chief willingly  consented and the marriage was in due course solemnised. About a year  after, the Earl&#x27;s nephew and apparent heir, Alexander Macdonald of  Lochalsh, came to Ross, and, feeling more secure in consequence of this  matrimonial alliance between the family of Mackenzie and his own, took  possession of Balcony House and the adjoining lands, where, at the  following Christmas, he provided a great feast for his old dependants,  inviting to it also most of the more powerful chiefs and barons north of the Spey, and among others, Kenneth Mackenzie, his cousin&#x27;s husband. The  house of Balcony being at the time very much out of repair, he could not  conveniently lodge all his distinguished guests within it, and had  accordingly to arrange for some of them in the outhouses as best he could. Kenneth did not arrive until Christmas Eve, accompanied by a train of  forty able bodied men, according to the custom of the times, but without  his lady, which deeply offended Macdonald.  Maclean of Duart had chief  charge of the arrangements in the house and the disposal of the guests.   Some days previously he had a disagreement with Kenneth at some  games, and, on his arrival, Maclean told the heir of Kintail that, taking advantage of his connection with the family, they had taken the liberty of  providing him with lodgings in the kiln.  Kenneth considered this an  insult, and, divining that it proceeded from Maclean&#x27;s illwill to him, he instantly struck him a blow on  the ear, which threw him to the ground.   The servants in the house viewed this as a direct insult to their chief, Macdonald, and at once took to arms.  Kenneth, though sufficiently bold,  soon perceived that he had no chance to light successfully or to beat a  retreat, and, noticing several boats lying on the shore, which had been  provided for the transport of the guests, he took as many of them as he  required, sank the rest, and passed with his followers to the opposite  shore, where he remained over night in the house of a tenant, who, like a good many more in those days, had no surname, but was simply known by  a patronymic. Kenneth, boiling with passion, was sorely affronted at the insult which he had received, and at being from his own house at Christmas, staying with a stranger, and off his own property.  In these  circumstances, he requested his host to adopt the name of Mackenzie,  promising him protection in future, so that be might thus be able to say  that he slept under the roof of one of his own name.  The man at once  consented, and his posterity were ever after known as Mackenzies. Next morning (Christmas Day) Kenneth went to the hill above Chanonry, and sent word to the Bishop, who was at the time enjoying his  Christmas with some of his clergy, that he desired to speak to him.  The  Bishop knowing his man&#x27;s temper and the turbulent state of the times  thought it prudent to comply with this request, though be considered it  very strange to receive such a message on such a day, and wondered much  what his visitors object could be. He soon found that Kenneth simply  wanted a feu of the small piece of land on which was situated the house in  which he had lodged the previous night, stating, as his reason, &quot;lest  Macdonald should brag that he had forced him on Christmas Day to lodge  at another man&#x27;s discretion, and not on own heritage.&quot;  The Bishop,  willing to oblige him probably afraid to do otherwise, and perceiving him in such a rage, at once sent for his clerk and there and then granted him a  charter of the township of Cullicudden, whereupon Kenneth returned to  the place and remained in it all day, lording over it as his own property. The place was kept by him and his successors until Colin &quot;Cam&quot; acquired  more of the Bishop&#x27;s lands in the neighbourhood, and afterwards  exchanged the whole with the Sheriff of Cromarty for lands in  Strathpeffer. Next day Kenneth started for Kinellan, where his father, the old chief Alexander, resided, and related to him what had taken place. His  father was much grieved, for he well knew that the smallest difference  between the families would revive their old grievances, and, although  there was less danger since Macdonald&#x27;s interest in Ross was smaller than in the past, yet he knew the clan to be a powerful one still, more so than  his own, in their number of able-bodied warriors; but these considerations,  strongly impressed upon the son by the experienced and aged father, only  added fuel to the fire in Kenneth&#x27;s bosom, which was already fiercely  burning to avenge the insult offered him by Macdonald&#x27;s servants.  His natural impetuosity could ill brook any such insult and he considered himself wronged so much that he felt it his duty personally to retaliate and  avenge it.  While this was  the  state  of his  mind matters  were suddenly  brought to a crisis by the arrival on the fourth day of a messenger from  Macdonald with a summons requesting Alexander and his son Kenneth to  remove from Kinellan, with all their families, within twenty-four hours,  allowing only that the young Lady Margaret, Macdonald&#x27;s own cousin,  might remain until she had more leisure to remove, and threatening war to the knife in case of noncompliance. Kenneth&#x27;s rage now became ungovernable, and, without consulting  his father or waiting his counsel, he bade the messenger tell Macdonald that his father would remain where he was in spite of him and all his  power. As for himself, he accepted no rules as to his staying or going, but  Macdonald would be sure enough to hear of him wherever he was.  As for  Macdonald&#x27;s cousin, Lady Margaret, since he had no desire to keep  further peace with his family he would no longer keep his relative. Such was the defiant message sent to young Macdonald, and  immediately after its despatch, Kenneth sent away Lady Margaret, in the  most ignominious manner, to Balcony House.  The lady was blind of an eye, and, to insult her cousin to the utmost, he sent her back to him  mounted on a one-eyed horse, accompanied by a one-eyed servant, followed by a one-eyed dog.  She was in a delicate state of health, and this  inhumanity grieved her so much that she never after wholly recovered.  Her son, recently born, the only issue of the marriage, was named  Kenneth, and to distinguish him from his father was called &quot;Coinneach   Og&quot; or Kenneth the younger. It appears that Kenneth had no great affection for Lady Margaret, for a few days after he sent her away he went to Lord Lovat accompanie by two hundred of his followers and besieged his house.  Lovat was naturally surprised at his conduct and demanded an explanation, when he  was informed by Kenneth that he came to demand his daughter Agnes in  marriage now that he had no wife, having, as he told him, disposed of  Lady Margaret in the manner already described. He insisted upon an  immediate and favourable reply to his suit on which condition he  promised to be on strict terms of friendship with the family; but, if his demand was refused he would swear mortal enmity against Lovat and his  house; and, as evidence of his intention in this respect, he pointed out to  his lordship that he already bad a party of his vassals outside gathering together the men, women, and goods that were nearest in the vicinity, all of whom, be declared, should &quot;be made one fyne to evidence his  resolution.&quot; Lovat, who had no particularly friendly feelings towards  Macdonald of the Isles, was not at all indisposed to procure Mackenzie&#x27;s friendship on the terms proposed, and considering the exigencies and  danger of his retainers, and knowing full well the bold and determined  character of the man he had to deal with, he consented to the proposed  alliance, provided the voting lady herself was favourable.  She fortunately  proved submissive.  Lord Lovat delivered her up to her suitor, who  immediately returned borne with her, and ever after they lived together as  husband and wife. Macdonald was naturally very much exasperated by Kenneth&#x27;s  defiant answer to himself and the repeated insults heaped upon his  relative, and through her upon her family.  He therefore dispatched his great steward, Maclean, to collect his followers in the Isles, as also to advise and request the aid of his nearest relations on the mainland-the  Macdonalds of Moidart and Clan Jan of Ardnamurchan. In a short time  they mustered a force between them of about fifteen hundred men--some  say three thousand--and arranged with Macdonald to meet him at Contin.   They assumed that Alexander Mackenzie, now so old, would not have  gone to Kintail, but would stay in Ross, judging that the Macdonalds, so  recently come under obligations to the King to keep the peace would not  venture to collect their forces and invade the low country.  But Kenneth, foreseeing the danger from the rebellious temper of Macdonald, went to  Kintail at the commencement of his enemy&#x27;s preparations, and placed a  strong garrison, with sufficient provisions, in Ellandonnan Castle; and the  cattle and other goods in the district he ordered to be driven and sent to  the most remote hills and secret places.  He took all the remaining able-bodied men along with him, and on his way back to Kinellan he was  joined by his dependants in Strathconan, Strathgarve, and other glens in  the Braes of Ross, all fully determined to defend Kenneth and his aged  father at the expense, if need be, of their lives, small as their united forces  were in comparison with that against which they knew they would soon  have to contend. Macdonald had meanwhile collected his friends, and, at the head of a large body of Western Highlanders, advanced through Lochaber into  Badenoch, where he was joined by the Clan Chattan; marched to  Inverness, where they were met by the young laird of Kilravock and some  of Lovat&#x27;s people;  reduced the Castle (then a royal fortress), placed a  garrison in it, and proceeded to the north-east, plundering the lands of Sir  Alexander Urquhart, Sheriff of Cromarty. They next marched westward  to the district of Strathconan, ravaged the lands of the Mackenzies as they  went, and put the inhabitants and more immediate retainers of the family  to the sword, resolutely determined to punish Mackenzie for his ill-treatment of Lady Margaret and recover possession of that part of the  Earldom of Ross forfeited by the earls of that name, and now the property of Mackenzie by Royal charter.  Having wasted Strathconan, Macdonald arrived on Sunday morning at Contin, where he found the people in great  terror and confusion; and the able-bodied men having already joined  Mackenzie, the aged, the women, and the children took refuge in the  church, thinking themselves secure within its precincts from any enemy  professing Christianity.  They soon, to their horror, found out their  mistake.  Macdonald, having little or no scruples on the score of religion,  ordered the doors to be closed and guarded, and then set fire to the  building.  The priest, together with the hapless crowd of helpless and aged  men, women and children, were all burnt to ashes. Some of those who were fortunate enough not to have been in  Contin church immediately started for Kinellan, and informed Mackenzie of the hideous massacre.  Alexander, though deeply grieved at the cruel  destruction of his people, expressed his gratitude that the enemy, whom he  had hitherto considered too numerous to contend with successfully, had  now engaged God against them by their impious conduct.  Contin was not  far from Kinellan, and Macdonald, thinking that Mackenzie would not  remain at the latter place with such a comparatively small force, ordered Gillespic to draw up his followers on the large moor, now known as &quot;Blar-na-Pairc,&quot; that he might review them, and send out a detachment to pursue the enemy. Kenneth Mackenzie, who had received the command of the  clan from the old chief, had meantime posted his men in a strong position --on ground where he considered he could defend himself against a superior force, and conveniently situated to attack the enemy if a  favourable opportunity occurred.  His followers only amounted to six  hundred, while his opponent had at least three times that number, but he  had the advantage in another respect inasmuch as he had sufficient  provisions for a much longer period than Macdonald could possibly  procure for his larger force, the country people having driven their cattle  and all the provender that might be of service to the enemy out of his  reach.  About mid-day the Islesmen were drawn up on the moor, about a  quarter of a mile distant from the position occupied by the Mackenzies,  the opposing forces being only separated from each other by a peat moss,  full of deep pits and deceitful bogs.  Kenneth, fearing a siege, had shortly  before this prevailed upon his aged father to retire to the Raven&#x27;s Rock, above Strathpeffer, to which place, strong and easily defended, he resolved to follow him in case he were compelled to retreat before the  numerically superior force of his enemy.  This the venerable Alexander  did, recommending his son to the assistance and protection of a Higher  Power, at the same time assuring him of success, notwithstanding the far  more numerous numbers of his adversary. By the nature of the ground, Kenneth perceived that Macdonald  could not bring all his forces to the attack at once, and he accordingly resolved to maintain his ground and try the effects of a stratagem which he  correctly  calculated  would  mislead  his opponent and place him at a  serious disadvantage.  He acquainted his younger brother, Duncan, with  his resolution and plans, and sent him off, before the struggle commenced,  with a body of archers to be placed in ambush, while he determined to  cross the peat-bog himself and attack Macdonald in front with the main  body, intending to retreat as soon as his adversary returned the attack, and  thus entice the Islesmen to pursue him.  He informed Duncan of his own  intention to retreat and commanded him to be in readiness with his archers to charge the enemy whenever they got fairly into the moss and entangled  among the pits and bogs. Having made these preliminary arrangements, he boldly advanced  to meet the foe, leading his resolute band in the direction of the intervening moss.  Macdonald, seeing him, cried in derision to Gillespic to  see &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s impudent madness, daring thus to face him at such  disadvantage.&quot; Gillespic, being a more experienced leader than the  youthful and impetuous Alexander, said that &quot;such extraordinary boldness  should be met by more extraordinary wariness in us, lest we fall into  unexpected inconvenience.&quot;  Macdonald, in a towering passion, replied to  this wise counsel--&quot;Go you also and join with them, and it will not need our care nor move the least fear in my followers; both of you will not be a  breakfast to me and  mine.&quot;  Meanwhile Mackenzie advanced a little  beyond the moss, avoiding, from his intimate knowledge of it, all the dangerous pits and bogs, when Maclean of Lochbuy, who led the van of  the enemy&#x27;s army, advanced and charged him with great fury. Mackenzie,  according to his pre-arranged plan, at once retreated, but in so masterly a  manner that, in doing so, he inflicted as much damage on the enemy as he  received.  The Islesmen speedily got entangled in the moss, and Duncan  Mackenzie observing this, rushed forth from his ambush and furiously  attacked them in flank and rear, killing most of those who had entered the  bog.  He then turned his attention to the main body of the Islesmen, who  were quite unprepared  for so sudden  an  onslaught. Kenneth, setting this,  charged with his main body, who were all well instructed in their leader&#x27;s  design, and, before the enemy were able to form in order of battle, he fell  on their right flank with such impetuosity and did such execution among  them that they were compelled to fall back in confusion before the  splendid onset of the small force which they had so recently sneered at  and despised.  Gillespic, stung by Alexander Macdonald&#x27;s taunt before the engagement began, to prove to him that &quot;though he was wary in council  he was not fearful in action,&quot; sought out Kenneth Mackenzie, that he  might engage him in single combat, and followed by some of his bravest followers he, with signal valour, did great execution among the Mackenzies in course of his approach to Kenneth, who was in the hottest  of the fight, and who, seeing Gillespic coming in his direction, advanced to meet him, killing, wounding, or scattering any of the Macdonalds that  came in his way.  He made a signal to Gillespic to advance and meet him  hand-to-hand, but, finding him hesitating, Kenneth, who far exceeded him  in strength while he equalled him in courage, would brook no tedious  debate but pressed on with fearful eagerness, at one blow cut off  Gillespic&#x27;s arm arid passed very far into his body so that he fell down dead  on the spot. At this moment Kenneth noticed his standard-bearer close by,  without his colours, and fighting desperately to his own hand.  He turned round to him, and angrily asked what had become of his colours, when he  was coolly answered--&quot; I left Macdonald&#x27;s standard-bearer, quite  unashamed of himself, and without the slightest concern for those of his  own chief, carefully guarding mine.&quot; Kenneth naturally demanded an  explanation of such an extraordinary state of matters, when the man  informed him that he had met Macdonald&#x27;s standard-bearer in the conflict, and had been fortunate enough to slay him; that he had thrust the staff of  his own standard through his opponent&#x27;s body  and as there appeared to be some good work to do among the enemy, he had left some of his  companions to guard the standard, and devoted himself to do what little he  could to aid his master, and protect him from his adversaries.  Maclean of  Lochbuy (Lachlainn MacThearlaich) was killed  by &quot;Duncan mor na  Tuaighe,&quot; Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;great scallag,&quot; of whom we have the following  curious account:-- Shortly before the battle, a raw, ungainly, but powerful looking youth from Kintail was seen staring about, as the Mackenzies were starting to meet the enemy, in an apparently idiotic manner, as if looking  for something.  He ultimately came across an old rusty battle-axe, of great  size, and, setting off after the others, he arrived at the scene of strife just  as the combatants were closing with each other.  Duncan Macrae (for such  was his name), from his stupid and ungainly appearance, was taken little  notice of, and was wandering about in an aimless, vacant, half-idiotic  manner. Hector  Roy, Alexander&#x27;s third son, and progenitor of the  Gairloch Mackenzies, observing him, asked why he was not taking part in  the fight, and supporting his chief and clan.  Duncan replied--&quot;Mar a faigh  mi miabh duine, cha dean mi gniomh duine.&quot;  (Unless I get a man&#x27;s  esteem, I shall not perform a man&#x27;s work.)  This was in reference to his  not having been provided with a proper weapon. Hector answered him--&quot;Deansa gniomh duine `s gheibh thu miabh duine.&quot;  (Perform a man&#x27;s  work and you will get a man&#x27;s esteem.) Duncan at once rushed into the  strife, exclaiming--&quot;Buille mhor bho chul mo laimhe,  `s ceum leatha, am fear nach teich rombam, teicheam roimhe.&quot;  (A heavy stroke from the  back of my hand [arm] and a step to [enforce] it  He who does not get out of my way, let me get out of his.)  Duncan soon killed a man, and, drawing the body aside, he coolly sat upon it.  Hector Roy, noticing this peculiar  proceeding as be was passing by in the heat of the contest, accosted  Duncan, and asked him why he was not still engaged with his comrades.   Duncan answered--&quot;Mar a faigh mi ach miabh aon duine cha dean mi ach  gniomh aon duine.&quot;  (If I only get one man&#x27;s due I shall only do one man&#x27;s  work).  Hector told him to perform two men&#x27;s work, and be would get two  men&#x27;s  reward.  Duncan returned again to the field of carnage, killed  another, pulled his body away, placed it on the top of the first, and sat upon the two.  The same question was again asked, and the answer given:  --&quot;I have killed two men, and earned two men&#x27;s wages.&quot;  Hector answered --&quot;Do your best, and we shall not be reckoning with you.&quot;  Duncan instantly  replied--&quot;Am  fear nach  biodh  ag cunntadh rium cha bhithinn ag cunntadh ris&quot;--(He that would not reckon with me, I would not reckon  with him)--and rushed into the thickest of the battle, where he mowed  down the enemy with his rusty battle-axe like grass; so much so that  Lachlan Maclean of Lochbuy (Lachlainn MacThearlaich), a most  redoubtable warrior, placed himself in Duncan&#x27;s way to check him in his  murderous career.  The two met in mortal strife, but, Maclean being a very  powerful man, clad in mail, and well versed in arms, Duncan could make  no impression upon him  but, being lighter and more active than his  heavily mailed opponent, he managed to defend himself, watching his  opportunity, and retreating backwards until he arrived at a ditch, where his  opponent, thinking he had him fixed, made a desperate stroke at him,  which Duncan parried, at the same time jumping backwards across the  ditch.  Maclean, to catch his enemy, made a furious lunge with his  weapon, but, instead of entering Duncan&#x27;s body, it got fixed in the  opposite bank of the ditch.  In withdrawing it, he bent his head forward, when the helmet, rising, exposed the back of his neck, upon which  Duncan&#x27;s  battle-axe descended with the velocity of lightning, and with  such terrific force as to sever Maclean&#x27;s head from his body. This, it is said, was the turning-point of the struggle, for the Macdonalds, seeing the  brave leader of their van falling, at once retreated, and gave up all for lost. The hero was ever afterwards known as &quot;Donnchadh Mor na Tuaighe,&quot; or  Big Duncan of the Axe, arid many a story is told in Kintail and Gairloch  of the many other prodigies of valour which he performed in the after  contests of the Mackenzies and  the  Macraes against their common  enemies.  &quot;Such of Macdonald&#x27;s men as escaped the battle fled together,  and as they were going homeward  began to spulzie Strathconan, which   Mackenzie hearing, followed them with a party, overtakes them at  Invercorran, kills shoals of them and the rest fled divers ways.&quot; That night, as Mackenzie sat at supper, he missed Duncan Mor,  and said to the company--&quot;I am more vexed for the want of my scallag mar (big servant) this night than any satisfaction I had of this day.&quot;  One  of those present said, &quot;I thought, (as the people fled) I perceived him  following four or five men that ran up the burn.&quot; He had not well spoken the word when Duncan Mor came in with four heads &quot;bound on a woody&quot;  and threw them before his master, saying--&quot;Tell me now if I have not  deserved my supper,&quot; to which, it is said of him, he fell with great gusto. This reminds me, continues the chronicler, &quot;of a cheat he once played on an Irishman, being a traveller, withal a strong, lusty fellow,  well-proportioned, but of an extraordinary stomach.  He resorted into  gentlemen&#x27;s houses, and (was) very oft in Mackenzie&#x27;s. Having come on  a time to the same Mackenzie&#x27;s house in Islandonain two or three years  after this battle (of Park), he was cared for as usual, and when the laird  went to dinner, he was set aside, at a side-table to himself, and a double  proportion allowed him, which this Duncan Mor envying, went on a day  and sat side for side with him, drew his skyn or short dagger and eats with  him.  `How now,&#x27; says the Irishman, `how comes it that you fall in eating in any manner of way.&#x27;  ` I cannot tell,&#x27; says Duncan, `but I do think I have  as good will to eat as you can have.&#x27;  `Well,&#x27; says the other, `we shall try  that when we have done.&#x27;  So when the laird had done of his dinner, the   Irishman  went where he was and said, `Noble sir, I have travelled now  almost among all the clans in Scotland, and was resorting their houses, as  I have been several times here, where I cannot say but I was sufficiently cared for, but I never met with such an affront as I have this day.&#x27;  The laird asked what he meant.  So he tells him what injury Duncan had done  him in eating a share of his proportion.  `Well,&#x27; says the laird, `I hope M&#x27;ille Chruimb,&#x27; for so the Irishman was called, `you will take no notice of him that did that; for he is but a fool that plays the fool now and then.&#x27; `I cannot tell,&#x27; says he, `but he is no idiot at eating, nor will I let my  affront pass so; for I must have a turn or two of wrestling with him for it in  your presence.&#x27;  Whereupon a stander-by asks Duncan if he would wrestle  with him.  `I will,&#x27; says he, `for I think I was fit sides with him in eating  and might be so with this.&#x27;  They yocks, and Duncan threw him thrice on  his back.  The Irishman was so angry he wist not what to  say.  He invites  him to put the stone, and at the second cast he worried him four feet, but  could never reach him.  Then he was like to burst himself. Finding this, he invites him to lop so that he outlopped him as far a length.  The  Irishman then said, `I have travelled as far as any of my equals, both in Scotland, England, and Ireland, and tried many hands, but I never met  with my equal till this day, but comrade,&#x27; say&#x27;s he `let us now go and  swim a little in the laird&#x27;s presence.&#x27;  `With all my heart,&#x27; say&#x27;s Duncan,  `for I never sought better&#x27; (with this Duncan could swim not at all), but down to the shore they go to the next rock, and being full sea, was at least  three fathoms deep, but before the Irishman had off half of his clothes  Duncan was stark naked, lops over the rocks and ducks to the bottom and  up again.  Looking about him he calls to a boy that stood by, and said,  `Lad, go where the Lady is, and bid her send me a butter and four cheese.&#x27; The  Irishman, hearing  this,  asks `what purpose.&#x27;  `To what purpose,&#x27;  says he, `yons the least we will need this night and to-morrow wherever  we be,&#x27; `Do you intend a journey,&#x27; say&#x27;s the Irishman.  `Aye, that I do,&#x27; answered the other, `and am in hopes to cross the Kyle ere night.&#x27;  Now,  this Kyle was 20 leagues off with a very ill stream, as the Irishman very well knew, so that he said, with a very great oath, lie would not go with him that length, but if he liked to sport the laird with several sorts of swimming, he would give a trial.  `Sport here, sport there, wherever I go you must go.&#x27;  With this the cheese and butter come, and Duncan desires  the Irishman to make ready, but all his persuasions (not against his will)  would not prevail with Mac a Chruimb, whereupon all the company gave  over with laughter, knowing the other could swim none at all, but the  fellow thought they jeered  him.  The laird made Duncan forbear him; but  Duncan swore a great oath he would make him swim or he left the town,  otherwise he would want of his will.  So it came to pass for the Irishman got away that same night, was seen on the morrow in Lochalsh, but none  (was) found that ferried him over.  But never after resorted Mackenzie&#x27;s house.&quot; [Ancient MS. of the Mackenzies.] What remained of the Macdonalds after the battle of Park were completely routed and put to flight, but most of them were killed, &quot;quarter  being no ordinar complement in thos dayes.&quot; The night before the battle young Brodie of Brodie, accompanied  by his accustomed retinue, was on a visit at Kinellan, and as be was preparing to leave the next morning be noticed Mackenzie&#x27;s men in arms,  whereupon he asked if the enemy were known to be so near that for a  certainty they would fight before night.  Being informed that they were  close at hand, he determined to wait and take part in the battle, replying to  Kenneth&#x27;s persuasions to the contrary, &quot;that be was an ill fellow and  worse neighbour that would leave his friend at such a time,&quot;  He took a  distinguished part in the fight and behaved &quot;to the advantage of his friend  and notable loss of his enemy,&quot; and the Earl of Cromarty informs us that  immediately after the battle be went on his journey.  But his conduct  produced a friendship between the Mackenzies and the family of Brodie,  which continued among their posterity, &quot;and even yet remains betwixt them, being more sacredly observed than the ties of affinity and consanguinity amongst most others,&quot; and a bond of manrent was entered  into between the families.  Some authorities assert that young Brodie was slain, but of this no early writer makes any mention and neither in Sir  Robert Gordon&#x27;s Earldom of Sutherland, in the Earl of Cromartie or other  MS. Histories of the Mackenzies, nor in Brown&#x27;s History of the Highland  Clans, is there any mention made of his having been killed, though they  all refer to the distinguished part be took in the battle.  He was, however,  seriously wounded. The morning after the battle Kenneth, fearing that the few of the Macdonalds who escaped might rally among the hills and commit cruelties and robberies on those of his people whom they might come across, marched to Strathconan, where he found, as he had expected, that  about three hundred of the enemy had rallied, and were destroying  everything they had passed over in their eastward march before the battle. As soon, however, as they noticed him in pursuit they took to their heels,  but they were overtaken and all killed or made prisoners. Kenneth then  returned to Kinellan, carrying with him Alexander Macdonald of Lochalsh, whom he had taken prisoner, in triumph.  His aged father, Alastair Ionraic, had now returned from the Raven&#x27;s Rock,  and warmly congratulated his valiant son upon his splendid victory;  adding, however, with significant emphasis, that he feared they made two  days work of one,&quot; since, by sparing Macdonald, who was also a prisoner,  and his apparent heir, they preserved the lives of those who might yet give  them trouble.  But Kenneth, though a lion in the field, could not, from any  such prudential consideration, be induced to commit such a cowardly and  inhuman act as was here inferred.  He, however, had no great faith in the forbearance of his followers if an opportunity occurred to them, and he  accordingly sent Macdonald, under a strong guard, to Lord Lovat, to be  kept by him in safety until he should advise him how to dispose of him. He kept Alexander of Lochalsh with himself, but, contrary to the expectations of their friends, he, on the intercession of old Macdonald,  released them both within six months, having first bound them by oath  and honour never to molest him or his, and never again to claim any right to the Earldom of Ross, which the Lord of the Isles had in 1475 forfeited to the Crown. Many of the Macdonalds and their followers who escaped from the field of battle perished in the River Conon.  Flying from the close pursuit  of the victorious Mackenzies, they took the river, which in some parts was  very deep, wherever they came up to it, and were drowned.  Rushing to  cross at Moy, they met an old woman--still smarting under the insults and  spoliations inflicted on her and her neighbours by the Macdonalds on their  way north--and asked her where was the best ford on the river.  &quot;O!  ghaolaich,&quot; she answered, &quot;is aon ath an abhuinn; ged tha i dubh, cha `n  eil i domhain,&quot; (Oh! dear, the river is all one ford together; though it looks  black, it is not deep).  In their pitiful plight, and on the strength of this  misleading information, they rushed into the water in hundreds, and were  immediately carried away by the stream, many of them clutching at the  shrubs and bushes which overhung the banks of the river, and crying  loudly for assistance.  This amazon and a number of her sex who were  near at hand had meanwhile  procured their sickles, and now exerted  themselves in cutting away the bushes to which the wretched Macdonalds  clung with a death grasp, the old woman exclaiming in each case, as she  applied her sickle, &quot;As you have taken so much  already which did not  belong to you, my friend, you can take that into the  bargain.  The   instrument of the old woman&#x27;s revenge has been for many generations,  and still is by very old people in the district, called &quot;Cailleach na Maigb,&quot;  or the Old Wife of Moy. The Mackenzies then proceeded to ravage the lands of  Ardmeanach and those belonging to William Munro of Fowlis--the  former because the young laird of Kilravock, whose father was governor  of that district, had assisted the Macdonalds; the latter probably because Munro, who joined neither party, was suspected secretly of favouring Lochalsh.  So many excesses were committed at this time by the Mackenzies that the Earl of Huntly, Lieutenant of the North, was compelled, notwithstanding their services in repelling the invasion of the  Macdonalds, to proceed against them as oppressors of the lieges.  [Gregory, p. 57.  Kilravock Writs, p.170, and Acts of Council.] A blacksmith, known as Glaishean Gow or &quot;Gobha,&quot; one of  Lovat&#x27;s people, in whose father&#x27;s house Agnes Fraser, Mackenzie&#x27;s wife,  was fostered, hearing of the advance of the Macdonalds to the Mackenzie territory, started with a few followers in the direction of Conan, but  arrived too late to take part in the fight.  They were, however, in time to  meet those few who managed to ford or swim the river, and killed every  one of them so that they found an opportunity &quot;to do more service than if they had been at the battle.&quot; This insurrection cost the Macdonalds the Lordship of the Isles, as  others had previously cost them the Earldom of Ross.  In a Parliament  held in Edinburgh in 1493, the possessions of the Lord of the Isles were  declared forfeited to the Crown.  In the following January the aged Earl  appeared before King James IV., and made a voluntary surrender of  everything, after which he remained for several years in the King&#x27;s  household as a Court pensioner. By Act of the Lords of Council in 1492  Alexander Urquhart, Sheriff of Cromarty, had obtained restitution for  himself and his tenants for the depredations committed by Macdonald and  his followers. According to the Kilravock Papers, p. 162, the spoil  amounted to 600 cows and oxen, each worth 13s 4d, 80 horses, each worth  26s 8d; 1000 sheep, each worth 2s; 200 swine, each worth 3s; with plenishing to the value of ?00 and also 500 bolls of victual and ?00 of the mails of the Sheriff&#x27;s lands. The  Earl of Cromarty says of Kenneth, &quot;that he raised great fears  in his neighbours by his temper and power, by which he had overturned so  great ane interest as that of Macdonald, yet it appearit that he did not  proceid to such attemptts but on just resentments and rationall grounds,  for dureing his lyfe he not only protected the country by his power, but he  caryed so that non was esteemed a better neighbour to his friends nor a  juster maister to his dependers.  In that one thing of his caryadge to his first wife he is justly reprowable; in all things else he merits justly to be  numbered amongst the best of our Scots patriots.&quot; The same writer  continues-- &quot;The fight at Blairnapark put Mackenzie in great respect  through all the North.  The Earl of Huntly, George, who was the second  Earle, did contract a friendship with him, and when he was imployed by  King James 3d to assist him against the conspirators in the South, Kenneth  came with 500 men to him in summer 1488; but erre they came the  lengthe of Perth, Mackenzie had nottice of his father Alexander&#x27;s death,  whereupon Huntly caused him retire to ordor his affaires, least his old enemies might tack advantage of such a change, and Huntly judgeing that  they were rather too numberous than weak for the conspirators, by which  occasion he (Kenneth) was absent from that vnfortunat battle wher King  James 3d wes kild, yet evir after this, Earl George, and his son Alexander,  the 3d Earl of Huntly, keipt a great kyndness to Kenneth and his  successors.  From the yeir 1489 the kingdom vnder King James 4d wes at  great peace, and thereby Mackenzie toock opportunity to setle his privat  affaires, which for many yeirs  befor, yea severall ages, had bein almost still disturbed by the Earls of Ross and Lords of the Illes, and so he lived  in peace and good correspondences with his neighbours till the yeir 1491, for in the moneth of February that yeir he died and wes buried at Bewlie. All his predecessors wer buried at Icolmkill (except his father), as wer  most of the considerable chieffs in the Highlands.  But this Kenneth, after  his marriage, keipt frequent devotiones with the Convent of Bewlie, and at  his owin desyre wes buried ther, in the ille on the north syd of the alter,  which wes built by himselfe in his lyftyme or he died; after that he done pennance for his irregular marieing or Lovit&#x27;s daughter.  He procured recommendationes from Thomas Hay (his lady&#x27;s uncle), Bishop of Ross, to Pope Alexander the 6, from whom he procured a legittmatione of all the cheildrein of the mariadge, daited apud St Petri, papatus nostri primo,  anno Cristiano 1491.&quot; Bishop Hay strongly impressed upon Mackenzie the propriety of  getting his marriage with Agnes of Lovat legitimized, and to send for a commission to the Pope for that purpose.  Donald Dubh MacChreggir, priest of Kirkhill, was despatched to Rome with that object, and, according to several of the family manuscripts, procured the legitimation of the marriage.  &quot;This priest was a native of Kintail, descended from a  clan there called Clan Chreggir, who, being a hopefull boy in his younger days, was educat in Mackenzie&#x27;s house, and afterwards at Beullie be the  forementioned Dugall Mackenzie, pryor yrof.  In end he was made priest  of Kirkhill.  His successors to this day are called Frasers.  Of this priest is  descended Mr William Fraser and Mr Donald Fraser.&quot; [Ancient MS.] Another writer describes the messengers sent to Rome as Mr Andrew Fraser, priest of Kintail, a learned and eloquent man, who took in his  company Dugal Mackenzie, natural son to Alexander Inrig, who was a  scholar.  The Pope entertained them kindly and very readily granted them  what they desired and were both made knights to the boot of Pope  Clement the VIII., but when my knights came home, they neglected the  decree of Pope Innocent III. against the marriage and consentrinate of all  the clergy or otherwise they got a dispensation from the then Pope  Clement VIII., for both of them married--Sir Dugall was made priest of  Kintail and married nien (daughter) Dunchy Chaim in Glenmorriston.  Sir  Andrew likewise married, whose son was called  Donald Du Mac  Intagard, and was priest of Kirkhill and Chaunter of Ross.  His tack of the  vicarage of Kilmorack to John Chisholm of Comar stands to this day.  The present Mr William Fraser, minister of Kilmorack, is the fifth minister in  lineal and uninterrupted succession.&quot; [Ardintoul MS.] Anderson, in his Account of the Family of Fraser, also says that &quot;application was made to the Pope to sanction the second marriage, which  he did, anno 1491.&quot;  Sir James D. Mackenzie of Findon (note, p. 19)  however says that he made a close search in the Vatican and the Roman  libraries but was unable to find trace of any document of legitmation.  Of Roderick, Sir Kenneth&#x27;s fourth son, who was an exceedingly  powerful man, the following interesting story is told--He was a man of  great strength and stature, and in a quarrell which took place between him  and Dingwall of Kildun, he killed the latter, and &quot;that night abode with his  wife&quot;  Complaint was made to King James the Fifth, who commanded the  Baron of Kintail to give Rory up to justice.  His brother, knowing he could  not do so openly and by force without trouble and considerable danger,  went to Kintail professedly to settle his affairs there, and when he was about returning home he requested Rory to meet him at Glassletter, that he  might privately consult and discourse with him as to his present state.   Rory duly met him on the appointed day with fifty men of his &quot;coalds,&quot;  the Macleays, besides ordinary servants and some Kintail men.  While the  two brothers went to discourse, they passed between the Kintail men and  the Macleays, who sat at a good distance from one another.  When  Mackenzie came near the Kintail men, he clapped Rory on the shoulder,  which was the sign between them, and Rory was immediately seized.  Gillecriost MacFhionnla instantly ran to the Macleays, who had taken to  their arms to relieve their Coald Rory Mor, and desired them in a friendly  manner to compose themselves, and not be rash, since Rory was seized  not by his enemies, but was in the hands of his own brother, and of those who had as great a kindness for him, and interest in him as they had  themselves; and further he desired them to consider what would be the  consequences, for if the least drop of blood was shed, Rory would be  immediately put to death, and so all their pains would be lost.  He thus  prevailed upon them to keep quiet. In the meantime Rory struggled with  the Kintail men, and would not be taken or go along with them, until John Mor, afterwards agnamed Ian Mor nan Cas, brother to Gillecriost  MacFhionnla, took Rory by the feet and cast him down.  They then bound  him and carried him on their shoulders, until he consented to go along  with them willingly, and without further objection.  They took him to Ellandonnan, whence shortly after he was sent south to the King, where he had to take his trial.  He, however, denied the whole affair, and in the  absence of positive proof, the judges declined to convict him; but the  King, quite persuaded of his guilt, ordered him to be sent a prisoner to the  Bass Rock, with strict injunctions to have him kept in chains.  This order  was obeyed, and Rory&#x27;s hands and legs were much pained and cut with the  irons.  The governor had unpleasant feuds with one of his neighbours,  which occasioned several encounters and skirmishes between their  servants, who came in repeatedly with wounds and bruises.  Rory,  noticing this to occur frequently, said to one of them, &quot;Would to God that  the laird would take me with him, and I should then be worth my meat to him and serve for better use than I do with these chains.&quot;  This was  communicated to the governor, who sent for Rory and asked him if he  would fight well for him.  &quot;If I do not that,&quot; said he, &quot;let me hang in these  chains.&quot;  He then took his solemn oath that he would not run away, and  the governor ordered the servants to set about curing Rory&#x27;s wounds with  ointments.  He soon found himself in good condition to fight, and an  opportunity was not long delayed. The governor met his adversary  accompanied by his prisoner, who fought to admiration, exhibiting great  courage and enormous strength.  He soon routed the enemy, and the  governor became so enamoured of him that he was never after out of his  company whenever he could secretly have him unknown to the Court. About this time an  Italian came to Edinburgh, who challenged  the whole nation  to a wrestling match for a large sum of money.  One or two  grappled with him, but he disposed of them so easily that no one else  could be found to engage him.  The King was much annoyed at this, and  expressed himself strongly in favour of any one who would defeat the  Italian, promising to give him a suitable reward.  The governor of the  Rock having heard of this, thought it an excellent opportunity for his  prisoner to secure his freedom, and at the same time redeem the credit of the nation, and he informed the King that a prisoner committed to the Bass  by his Majesty if released of his irons would, in his opinion, match the  Italian. The King immediately answered, &quot;His liberty, with reward, shall he have if he do so.&quot;  The governor, so as not to expose his own intimate relations with and treatment of the prisoner, warily asked that time should  be allowed to cure him of his wounds, lest his own crime and Rory&#x27;s  previous liberty should become known.  When sufficient time had elapsed  for this purpose a day was appointed, and the governor brought Rory to  Holyrood House to meet the King, who enquired if he &quot;would undertake  to cast the Italian for his liberty?&quot;  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered Rory &quot;it will be a  hard task that I will not undertake for that; but, sir, it may be, it will not be so easy to perform as to undertake, yet I shall give him a fair trial.&quot;   &quot;Well&quot; said the King, &quot;how many days will you have to fit yourself?&quot;   &quot;Not an hour&quot; replied Rory.  His Majesty was so pleased with his  resolution that he immediately sent to the Italian to ask if he would accept  the challenge at once.  He who had won so many victories so easily  already did not hesitate to grapple with Rory, having no fear as to the  result.  Five lists were prepared.  The Italian was first on the ground, and  seeing Rory approaching him, dressed in his rude habit, without any of the usual dress and accoutrements, laughed loudly.  But no sooner was he in  the Highlander&#x27;s grasp than the Italian was on his knee. The King cried  with joy; the Italian alleged foul play, and made other and frivolous  excuses, but His Majesty was so glad of the apparent advantage in his  favour that he was unwilling to expose Rory to a second hazard.  This did not suit the Highlander at all, and he called out, &quot;No, no, sir; let me try  him again, for now I think I know his strength.&quot;  His Majesty hearing this,  consented, and in the second encounter Rory laid firm hold of the  foreigner, pulled him towards him with all his might, breaking his back,  and disjointing the back-bone.  The poor fellow fell to the ground groaning with pain, and died two day&#x27;s after.  The King, delighted with  Rory&#x27;s prowess, requested him to remain at Court, but this he refused,  excusing himself on the ground that his long imprisonment quite unfitted  him for Court life, but if it pleased his Majesty he would send him his son,  who was better fitted to serve him.  He was provided with money and  suitable clothing by Royal command.  The King requested him to hasten  his son to Court, which he accordingly did.  This son was named  Murdoch, and His Majesty became so fond of him that he always retained  him about his person, and granted him, as an earnest of greater things to follow, the lands of Fairburn, Moy, and others adjoining, also the Ferry of  Scuideal; but Murdoch being unfortunately absent from the Court when  the King died, he missed much more which his Majesty had designed for him. [Ardintoul and Cromartie MS. Histories of the Mackenzies.] The following, told of Roderick and Kenneth, the fifth son, is also worth a place--Kenneth was Chaunter of Ross, and perpetual Curate of  Coinbents, which vicarage he afterwards resigned into the hands of Pope  Paulus in favour of the Priory of Beauly.  Though a priest and in holy  orders he would not abstain from marriage, for which cause the Bishop  decided to have him deposed.  On the appointed day for his trial he had  his brother Rory at Chanonry,, when the trial was to take place, with a  number of his followers.  Kenneth presented himself before the Bishop in  his long gown, but under it he had a two-edged sword, and drawing near   his  Lordship, who sat in  his presiding  chair, whispered in his ear, &quot;It is best that you should let me alone, for my brother Rory is in the churchyard  with many ill men, and if you take off my orders he will take off your  head, and I myself will not be your best friend.&quot; He then coolly exposed  his penknife, as he called his great sword, &quot;which sight, with Rory&#x27;s  proximity, and being a person whose character was well enough known by  his Lordship, he was so terrified that he incontinently absolved and  vindicated the good Chaunter,&quot; who ever after enjoyed his office (and his wife) unchallenged. Sir Kenneth of Kintail, who was knighted by James IV. &quot;for being highly instrumental in reducing his fierce countrymen to the blessings of a  civilized life,&quot; was twice married; first, to Lady Margaret, daughter of  John, Lord of the Isles and Earl of Ross, with issue-- I.  Kenneth Og, his heir and successor. He married secondly, Agnes or Anne Fraser, daughter of Hugh,  third Lord Lovat, with issue-- II.  John, who succeeded his brother Kenneth Og. III.  Alexander, first of the family of Davochmaluag. IV.  Roderick, progenitor of the families of Achilty, Fairburn, Ardross, etc. V.  Kenneth, better know as &quot;the Priest of Avoch,&quot; from whom the families of Suddie, Ord, Corryvulzie, Highfield, Inverlaul, Little Findon,  and others of lesser note. VI.  Agnes, who married Roderick Macleod, VII. of Lewis, with issue. VII.  Catherine, who married Hector Munro of Fowlis, with issue. There has been a considerable difference of opinion among the family genealogists as to the date of Sir Kenneth&#x27;s death, but it is now  placed beyond doubt that he died in 1491, having only ruled as actual  chief of the clan for the short space of three years. This is clearly proved  from  his tomb in the Priory of Beauly, where there is a full length  recumbent effigy of him, in full armour, with arms folded across his chest  as if in prayer, and on the arch over it is the following inscription &quot;Hic  Jacet, Kanyans, m. kynch d&#x27;us de Kyntayl, q. oblit vii. die Februarii, a.  di. m.cccc.lxxxxi.&quot;  Sir William Fraser, in his history of the Earls of Cromartie, gives, in his genealogy of the Mackenzies of Kintail, the date of his death as &quot;circa 1506,&quot; and ignores his successor Kenneth Og  altogether.  This is incomprehensible to readers of the work; for in the  book itself, in various places, it is indubitably established that Sir  William&#x27;s genealogy is incorrect in this, as in other important particulars.&quot;  [Sir William Fraser appears to have adopted Douglas in his genealogies,  who, as already shown, in many instances, cannot be depended upon.] The following, from the published &quot;Acts of the Lords of Council,&quot; p. 327, under date 17th  June, 1494, places the question absolutely beyond  dispute.  &quot;The King&#x27;s Highness and Lords of Council decree and deliver  that David Ross of Balnagown shall restore and deliver again to Annas  Fresale, the spouse of THE  LATE Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail, seven  score of cows, price of the piece (each), 20s; 30 horses, price of the piece,  2 merks; 200 sheep and goats, price of the piece, 25; and 14 cows, price of  the piece, 20s; spuilzied and taken by the said David and his complices  from the said Annas out of the lands of Kynlyn (? Killin or Kinellan), as was sufficiently proved before the Lords; and ordain that letters be written  to distrain the said David, his lands and goods therefor, and he was present  at his action by this procurators.&quot;  It is needless to point out that the man  who, by this undoubted authority, was THE LATE Kenneth Mackenzie of  Kintail, in 1494 could not have died about or &quot;circa 1506,&quot; as Sir William  Fraser asserts in his Earls of Cromartie.  Kenneth died in 1491, and was  succeeded by his only son by his first wife, Margaret of Isla, VIII.  KENNETH  OG  MACKENZIE, Or KENNETH  THE  YOUNGER, who was also known as Sir Kenneth.   He was fostered in Taagan, Kenlochewe. [Ancient MS.]  When, in 1488, King James the IV. succeeded to the throne, he determined to attach to his  interest the principal chiefs in the Highlands.  &quot;To overawe and subdue the  petty princes who affected independence, to carry into their territories, hitherto too exclusively governed by their own capricious or tyrannical  institutions, the same system of a severe but regular and rapid  administration of civil and criminal justice which had been established in  his Lowland dominions was the laudable object of the King; and for this  purpose he succeeded, with that energy and activity which remarkably  distinguished him, in opening up an intercourse with many of the leading  men in the northern counties. With the Captain of the Clan Chattan,  Duncan Mackintosh with Ewen, the son of Alan, Captain of the Clan  Cameron with Campbell of Glenurghay; the Macgilleouns of Duart and  Lochbuy; Mackane of Ardnamurchan the Lairds of Mackenzie and Grant;  and the Earl of Huntly, a baron of the most extensive power in these  northern districts, he appears to have been in habits of constant and  regular communication -rewarding them by presents, in the shape either of money or of grants or land, and securing their services in reducing to obedience such of their fellow chieftains as proved contumacious, or  actually rose in rebellion.&quot; [Tytler, vol. iv., pp. 367-368.] To carry out this plan he determined to take pledges for their good  behaviour from some of the most powerful clans, and, at the same time,  educate the younger lairds into a more civilized manner of governing their  people.  Amongst others he took a special interest in Kenneth Og, and  Farquhar Mackintosh, the young lairds of Mackenzie and Mackintosh,  who were cousins, their mothers being sisters, daughters of John, last Lord  of the Isles.  They were both powerful, the leaders of great clans, and  young men of great spirit and reckless habits.  They were accordingly  apprehended in 1495 [&quot;The King having made a progress to the North,  was advised to secure these two gentlemen as hostages for securing the  peace of the Highlands, and accordingly they were apprehended at  Inverness and sent prisoners to Edinburgh in the year 1495, where they remained two years.&quot;--Dr George Mackenzie&#x27;s MS. History,] and sent to  Edinburgh, where they were kept in custody in the Castle, until a  favourable opportunity occurring in 1497, they escaped over the ramparts  by the aid of ropes secretly conveyed to them by some of their friends. This was the more easily managed, as they had liberty granted them to  roam over the whole bounds of the Castle within the outer walls; and the  young chieftains, getting tired of restraint, and ashamed to be idle while  they considered themselves fit actors for the stage of their Highland  domains, resolved to attempt an escape by dropping over the walls, when  Kenneth injured his leg, so as to incapacitate him from rapid progress; but  Mackintosh manfully resolved to risk capture himself rather than leave his fellow-fugitive behind him in such circumstances.  The result of this  accident, however, was that after three days journey they were only able to  reach the Torwood, where, suspecting no danger, they put up for the night in a private house. The Laird of Buchanan, who was at the time an outlaw for a  murder he had committed, happened to be in the neighbourhood, and  meeting the Highlanders, entertained them with a show of kindness; by which means he induced them to divulge their names and quality.  A proclamation had recently been issued promising remission to any outlaw  who would bring in another similarly circumstanced, and Buchanan  resolved to procure his own freedom at the expenseof his fellow-fugitives;  for he knew well that such they were, previously knowing of them as his  Majesty&#x27;s pledges from their respective clans.  In the most deceitful  manner, he watched until they had retired to rest, when he surrounded the house with a band of his followers, and charged them to surrender.  This  they declined; and Mackenzie, being of a violent temper and possessed of  more courage than prudence, rushed out with a drawn sword &quot;refusing delivery and endeavouring to escape,&quot; whereupon he was shot with an  arrow by one of Buchanan&#x27;s men.  His head was severed from his body,  and forwarded to the King in Edinburgh; while young Mackintosh, who  made no further resistance, was secured and sent a prisoner to the King. Buchanan&#x27;s outlawry was remitted, and Mackintosh was confined in Dunbar, where he remained until after the death of James the Fourth at the  battle of  Flodden  Field. [Gregory, p.93; and MS. History by the Earl of Cromartie.]  Buchanan&#x27;s base conduct was universally execrated, while  the fate of young Mackenzie was lamented throughout the whole  Highlands, having been accused of no other crime than the natural  forwardness of youth, and having escaped from his confinement in  Edinburgh Castle. It is admitted on all hands that Kenneth Og was killed, as above, in 1497, and he must, therefore--his father having died in 1491--have ruled  as one of the Barons of Kintail, though there is no record of his having  been formally served heir.  He was not married, but left two bastard sons--one, known as Rory Beag, by the daughter of the Baron of Moniack; and  the other by the daughter of a gentleman in Cromar, of whom are  descended the Sliochd Thomais in Cromar and Glenshiel, Braemar, the  principal families of which were those of Dalmore and Renoway. [&quot;In his  going to Inverness, as I have said, to meet the King, he was the night  before his coming there in the Baron of Muniag&#x27;s house, whose daughter  he got with child, who was called Rory Begg.  Of this Rory descended the  parson of Slate; and on the same journey going along with the King to  Edinburgh he got a son with a gentleman&#x27;s daughter, and called him  Thomas Mackenzy, of whom descended the Mackenzies--in Braemar  called Slyghk Homash Vic Choinnich.  That is to say Thomas  Mackenzie&#x27;s Succession.  If he had lived he would be heir to Mackenzie  and Macdonald (Earl of Ross).&quot;--Ancient MS.]  He was succeeded by his eldest brother by his father&#x27;s second marriage with Agnes or Anne, daughter of Hugh, third Lord Lovat, IX.  JOHN  MACKENZIE  OF  KILLIN, Known by that designation from his having generally resided at that place. He was, as we have seen, the first son of Kenneth, seventh Baron of  Kintail, by his second wife Agnes, or Anne of Lovat, and his father being never regularly married, the great body of the clan did not consider John his legitimate heir.  Hector Roy Mackenzie, his uncle, progenitor of the  House of Gairloch, a man of great prudence and courage, was by Kenneth  a Bhlair appointed tutor to his eldest son Kenneth Og, then under age,  though Duncan, an elder brother by Alexander&#x27;s first wife, had, according to custom, a prior claim to that honourable and important trust.  Duncan  is, however, described as one who was &quot;of better hands than head&quot;- more  brave than  prudent.  Hector took charge, and on the death of Kenneth Og  found himself in possession of valuable and extensive estates.  He had  already secured great popularity among the clan, which in the past he had often led to victory against the common enemy.  He objected to John&#x27;s  succession on the ground that he was the illegitimate son of Lovat&#x27;s  daughter, with whom his father, Kenneth, at first did &quot;so irregularly and unlawfully cohabit,&quot; and John&#x27;s youth encouraging him, it is said, [MS.  History by the Earl of Cromartie.]  Hector proposed an arrangement to  Duncan, whom he considered the only legitimate obstacle to his own  succession, by which he would transfer his rights as elder brother in  Hector&#x27;s favour, in return for which he should receive a considerable  portion of the estates for himself and his successors.  Duncan declined to  enter into the proposed agreement, principally on the ground that the  Pope, in 1491, the year in which John&#x27;s father died, had legitimised  Kenneth a Bhlair&#x27;s marriage with Agnes of Lovat, and thereby restored the children of that union to the rights of succession.  Finding Duncan  unfavourable to his project, Hector declared John illegitimate, and held  possession of the estates for himself; and the whole clan, with whom he  was a great favourite, submitted to his rule. [Though we have given this  account on the authority of the MS. histories of the family, it is now  generally believed that Duncan was dead at this period, and that his son  Allan, who would have succeeded, failing John of Killin&#x27;s legitimacy, was a minor when his father died.] It can hardly be supposed that Lord Lovat would be a disinterested spectator of these proceedings, and in the interest of his sister&#x27;s children  he procured a precept of clare constat from James Stewart, Duke of Ross,  [After the forfeiture of the ancient Earls of Ross, the district furnished  new titles under the old names, to members of the Royal family.  James  Stewart, second son of King James the Third, was created in 1487 Duke of  Ross, Marquis of Ormond, Earl of Ardmanach, and Lord of Brechin and  Navar.  The Duke did not long hold the territorial Dukedom of Ross.  On  the 13th of May 1503, having obtained the rich Abbey of Dunfermline, he  resigned the Dukedom of Ross into the hands of the King.  The Duke  reserved for his life the hill of Dingwall beside that town for the style of Duke, the hill of Ormond (above Avoch) for the style of Marquis, the  Redcastle of Ardmanach for the style of Earl, and the Castle of Brechin,  with the gardens, &amp;c., for the name of Brechin and Navar.  The Duke of  Ross died in 1504.  It was said of him by Ariosto, as translated by Hoole--    /*&quot;The title of the Duke of Ross he bears, No chief like him in dauntless mind compares.&quot;*/ The next creation of the title of the Duke of Ross was in favour of  Alexander Stewart, the posthumous son of King James the Fourth. The  Duke was born on the 30th April 1514, and died on the 18th December  1515.  In the reign of Mary Queen of Scots, John, Earl of Sutherland,  acquired from Mary, the Queen Dowager, a certain right in the Earldom of  Ross, which might ultimately have joined in one family both Sutherland  and Ross.  Lord Darnley, on the prospect of his marriage with Queen  Mary, was created Earl of Ross, a title by which he is little known, as it  was only given to him a short time before he obtained the higher titles of  Duke of Albany and King of Scotland.--Fraser&#x27;s Earls of Cromartie.] and Archbishop of St Andrews, in favour of his grandson, John, as heir to the estates.  The document is &quot;daited the last of Apryle 1500 and seasin  thereon 16 Mey 1500 be Sir John Barchaw and William Monro of Foulls,  as Baillie to the Duk.&quot; [MS. History by the Earl of Cromartie.]  This  precept included the Barony of Kintail, as well as the lands held by  Mackenzie off the earldom of Ross, for, the charter chest being in the  possession of Hector Roy, Lovat was not aware that Kintail was held  direct from the Crown; but notwithstanding all these precautions and legal  instruments, Hector kept possession and treated the entire estates as his own. Sir William Munro of Fowlis, the Duke&#x27;s Lieutenant for the forfeited earldom of Ross, was dissatisfied with Hector&#x27;s conduct, and  resolved to punish him.  Munro was in the habit of doing things with a  high hand, and on this occasion, during Hector&#x27;s absence from home, he,  accompanied by his Sheriff, Alexander Vass, went to Kinellan, where  Hector usually resided, held a court at the place, and as a mulct or fine took away the couples of one of Hector&#x27;s barns as a token of his power. When Hector discovered what had taken place in his absence, he became  furious, and sent a messenger to Fowlis telling him that if he were a man of courage and a &quot;good  fellow&quot; he would come and take away  the  couples of the other barn when their owner was at home. Munro, greatly offended at this message, determined to accept the bold challenge conveyed in it, and promptly collected his vassals, including the Dingwalls and the MacCullochs, who were then his dependants, to the number of nine hundred, and with this force started for  Kinellan, where he arrived much sooner than Hector, who hurriedly  collected all the men he could in the neighbourhood, anticipated.  Hector had no time to advise his Kintail men nor those at a distance from  Kinellan, and was consequently unable to bring together more than one  hundred and forty men.  With this small force he wisely deemed it  imprudent to venture on a regular battle, but decided upon a stratagem  which if it proved successful, as he anticipated, would give him an  advantage  that  would  more than counterbalance the enemy&#x27;s superiority of numbers.  Having supplied his small but resolute band with provisions  for twenty-four hours, Hector led them secretly, during the night, to the top of Knock-farrel, a place so situated that Munro must needs pass near its north or south side in his march to and from Kinellan.  Early next  morning Fowlis marched past on his way to Kinellan, quite ignorant of  Hector&#x27;s position, and expecting him to have remained at home to  implement the purport of his message.  Sir William was allowed to pass  unmolested, and imagining that Hector had fled, he proceeded to demolish  the barn at Kinellan, ordered its couples to be carried away.  Broke all the  utensils about the place, and drove out all the cattle, as trophies of his  visit.  In the evening he returned, as Hector had conjectured, carrying the  plunder in front of his party, accompanied by a strong guard, while he  placed the rest of his picked men in the rear, fearing that Hector might pursue him, little thinking that he was already between him and his destination.  On his way to Kinellan, Munro bad marched through Strathpeffer  round the north side of Knock-farrel, but for some cause he returned by  the south side where the highway touched the shoulder of the hill on  which Hector&#x27;s men were posted.  He had no fear of attack from that  quarter, and his men feeling themselves quite safe, marched loosely and  out of order.  Hector seeing his opportunity, allowed them to pass until the  rear was within musket shot of him.  He then ordered his men to charge,  which they did with such furious impetuosity, that most of the enemy were cut to pieces before they were properly aware from whence they were  attacked, or could make any effectual attempt to resist the dashing onset of Hector&#x27;s followers.  The groans of the dying in the gloaming, the uncertainty as well as the unexpectedness of the attack, frightened them so  much that they fled in confusion, in spite of every attempt on the part of  Fowlis, who was in front in charge of the spoil and its guard, to stop them. Those from the rear flying in disorder soon confused the men in front, and  the result was a complete rout.  Hector&#x27;s men followed, killing every one they met for it was ordered that no quarter should be given, the number  being so large that they might again turn round, attack and defeat the  victors.  In this retreat almost all the men of the clan Dingwall and  MacCullochs capable of bearing arms were killed, and so many of the  Munroes were slain that for a long time after &quot;there could not be ane  secure friendship made up twixt them and the Mackenzies, till by frequent allyance and mutuall beneffets at last thes animosities are setled and in ordor to a reconciliation, Hector, sone to this William of Foulls, wes maried to John Mackenzie&#x27;s sister Catherine.&quot; At this conflict, besides that it was notable for its neat contrivance, the inequality of the forces engaged, and the number of the slain, there are  two minor incidents worth noting.  One is that the pursuit was so hot that  the Munroes not only fled in a  crowd, but there were so many of them  killed at a place on the edge of the hill where a descent fell from each  shoulder of it to a well; and most of Hector&#x27;s men being armed with  battle-axes and two-edged swords, they had cut off so many heads in that  small space, that, tumbling down the slope to the well, nineteen heads  were counted in it and to this day the well is called &quot;Tobar nan Ceann&quot; or  the Fountain of the Heads.  The other incident is that Suarachan, better  known as &quot;Donnchadh Mor na Tuaighe,&quot; or Big Duncan of the Axe,  previously referred to as one of the heroes of the battle of Park, pursued one of the enemy into the Church of Dingwall, to which he had fled for  shelter.  As he was entering in at the door, Suarachan caught him by the  arm, when the man exclaimed, &quot;My sanctuary saves me!&quot; &quot;Aye,&quot; returned  Suarachan, &quot;but what a man puts in the sanctuary against his will he can  take it out again; and so, pushing him back from the door, he killed him  with one stroke of his broadsword. [MS. History by the Earl or Cromartie.] Sir William Munro returned that night to Fowlis, where happened to be, passing the evening, a harper of the name of MacRa, who, observing Sir William pensive and dispirited, advised him to be more cheerful and  submit patiently to the fortunes of war, since his defeat was not his own fault, nor from want of personal courage and bravery, but arose from the  timorousness of his followers, who were unacquainted with such severe  service.  This led Sir William to take more particular notice of the harper  than he had hitherto done, and he asked him his name.  On hearing it,  Munro replied, &quot;You surely must have been fortunate, as your name  imports, and I am sure that you have been more so than I have been this  day; but it&#x27;s fit to take your advice, MacRath.&quot; This was a play on the minstrel&#x27;s name--MacRath literally meaning &quot;Son of Fortune&quot;--and the  harper being, like most of his kind, smart and sagacious, made the  following impromptu answer-- Eachainn le sheachd fichead fear, Agus thusa le d&#x27;ochd clad, Se Mac Rath a mharbh na daoine Air bathaois Cnoc faireal, Which may be rendered in English as follows:-- Although MacRath doth &quot;fortunate&quot; import, It&#x27;s he deserves that name whose brave effort Eight hundred men did put to flight With his seven score at Knockfarrel. [Ardintoul MS.] In 1499, George, Earl of Huntly, then the King&#x27;s Lieutenant, granted warrant to Duncan  Mackintosh of Mackintosh, John Grant of  Freuchie, and other leaders, with three thousand men, to pass against the Clan Mackenzie, &quot;the  King&#x27;s rebels,&quot; for the slaughter of Harold of  Chisholm, dwelling in Strathglass, &quot;and for divers other heirschips,  slaughters,  spuilzies, committed on the King&#x27;s poor lieges and tenants in  the Lordship of Ardmeanoch,&quot; [Kilravock Papers, p. 170.] but Hector Roy  and his followers gave a good account of them, and soon defeated and  dispersed them.  He seems to have held undisturbed possession until the  year 1507, when John and his brother Roderick were on a visit in the Aird,  at the house of their uncle, Lord  Lovat, when a fire broke out at the castle.  According to the Earl of Cromartie, when the house took fire, no one was found bold enough to approach the burning pile but John, who  rushed boldly through the flames and carried away the Lovat charter chest &quot;a weight even then thought too much  for the strongest man, and that  cheist, yett extant, is a load sufficient for two.  His uncle, bothe obleiged  by the actione, and glad to sie such strength and boldnes in the young man,  desyred (him) to do as much for himself as he haid done for him, and to  discover his (own) charter cheist from his uncle, and that he should have all the concurrance which he (Lovat) could give to that effect.&quot; Anderson&#x27;s History of the Family of Fraser ascribes this bold act to  Roderick, for which he was &quot;considered  amply recompensed by the gift  of a bonnet and a pair of shoes.&quot;  It matters little which is the correct version, but it is not unlikely that Lovat&#x27;s valuable charter chest was saved  by one or other of them, and it is by no means improbable that his  Lordship&#x27;s suggestion  that they should procure their own charter chest  and his offer to aid them in doing so was made and determined to be acted upon on this occasion. John, who had proved himself most prudent, even in his youth, was satisfied that his uncle Hector, a man of undoubted valour and wisdom, in possession of the estates, and highly popular with the clan, could not be expelled without great difficulty and extreme danger to himself.  Any such  attempt would produce feuds and slaughter among his  people, with the  certain result of making himself personally unpopular with the clan, and  his uncle more popular than ever.  He therefore decided upon a more  prudent course resolving to strike only at Hector&#x27;s person, judging that, if  his uncle failed, his claims and the personal respect of his followers would  fall with him.  To carry out his resolution, he contrived a scheme which  proved completely successful.  Having secured an interview with Hector,  who then resided at Wester Fairburn, he pleaded that since he had taken  his estates from him, and left him in such reduced circumstances, it was  not in accordance with his feelings and his ambition for fame to remain  any longer in his native country, where he had neither position nor  opportunities of distinguishing himself.  He therefore begged that his  uncle should give him a galley or birlinn, and as many of the ablest and most determined youths in the country as should voluntarily follow him in his adventures for fame and  fortune in a foreign  land. With these he  should pass to Ireland, then engaged in war, and &quot;there purchase a  glorious death or a more plentiful fortune than he was likely to get at  home.&quot;  The idea pleased Hector exceedingly, and he not only gave him  his own galley, then lying at Torridon, but furnished him with all the  necessary provisions for the voyage, at the same time assuring him that, if  he prosecuted his intentions, he should annually transmit him a sufficient  portion to keep up his position, until his own personal prowess and fortune should  place him above any such necessity whereas, if he otherwise resolved or attempted to molest him in what he called his rights, he would  bring sudden and certain ruin upon himself. Thirty brave and  resolute young men joined the supposed  adventurer, after having informed them that he would have none except  those who would do so of their own free will, from their affection for him,  and determination to support him in any emergency; for he well judged  that only such were suitable companions in the desperate aims which he  had laid out for himself to accomplish.  These he dispatched to the galley  then at Torridon, one of the most secluded glens on the West Coast, and  distant from any populated place; while he himself remained with his  uncle, professedly to arrange the necessary details of his journey, and the  transmission of his portion, but really to notice &quot;his method and manner of converse.&quot;  John soon took farewell of Hector, and departed with every  appearance of simplicity.  His uncle sent a retinue to convoy him with   becoming respect, but principally to assure himself of his departure, and to  guard against surprise or design on John&#x27;s part.  Accompanied by these, he  soon arrived at Torridon, where he found his thirty fellow adventurers and  the galley awaiting him. They at once set sail, and with a fair wind made  for the Isles, in the direction of, and as if intending to make for, Ireland. The retinue sent by Hector Roy returned home, and informed their master  that they saw John and his companions started before a far wind, with  sails set, in the direction of Ireland when Hector exclaimed, referring to  Anne of Lovat, &quot;We may now sleep without fear of Anne&#x27;s children.&quot; John, sailing down Loch Torridon, and judging that Hector&#x27;s men  had returned home, made for a sheltered and isolated creek, landed in a  wood, and dispersed his men with instructions to go by the most private  and unfrequented paths in the direction of Alit Corrienarnich, in the braes  of Torridon, where he would meet them.  This done, they followed  Hector&#x27;s men, being quite close up to them by the time they reached  Fairburn.  John halted at some little distance from Hector&#x27;s house until  about midnight, when, calling his men together, he feelingly addressed  them thus:--&quot;Now, my good friends, I perceive that you are indeed  affectionate to me, and resolute men, who have freely forsaken your  country and relations to share in my not very promising fortune  but my  design in seeking only such as would voluntarily go along with me was  that I might be certain of your affection and resolution, and since you are  they whom I ought only to rely upon in my present circumstances and danger, I shall now tell you that I was never so faint-hearted as to quit my  inheritance without attempting what is possible for any man in my  capacity.  In order to this I feigned this design for Ireland for three  reasons; first, to put my uncle in security, whom I have found ever hitherto  very circumspect and well guarded; next, to find out a select, faithful  number to whom I might trust and thirdly, that in case I fail, and that my  uncle shall prevail over my endeavours, that I might have this boat and  these provisions as a safe retreat, both for myself and you, whom I should  be loath to expose to so great a danger without some probability in the attempt, and some security in the disappointment.  I am resolved this night  to fall on my uncle for he being gone, there is none of his children who  dare hope to repose themselves to his place. The countrymen who now,  for fear, depend on him and disown me, will, no doubt, on the same  motives, promoved with my just title, own me against all other injurious  pretenders.  One thing I must require of you, and it is that albeit those on  whom we are to fall are all related both to you and to me, yet since on  their destruction depends the preservation of our lives, and the restitution of my estate, you must all promise not to give quarter to my uncle or to  any of his company.&quot; To this inhuman resolution they all agreed, disregarding the natural ties of blood and other obligations, and, marching as quietly as possible,  they arrived at Hector&#x27;s house, surrounded it, and set fire to it--guarding it  all round so that not a soul could escape. The house was soon in flames, and the inmates, Hector and his household, were crying out for mercy.   Their pitiful cries made an impression on those outside, for many of them had relatives within, and in spite of their previous resolution to give no quarter, some of them called out to their nearest friends to come out and surrender, on assurance of their lives being spared.  John seeing so many of his followers moved to this merciful conduct, and being unable to resist  them, exclaimed, &quot;My uncle is as near in blood to me as any in the house  are to you, and therefore I will be as kind to him as you are to them.&quot; He  then called upon Hector to surrender and come forth from the burning  pile, assuring him of his life.  This he did; but Donald Dubh  MacGillechriost Mhic Gillereach, a Kenlochewe man, made for the door  with his two-edged sword drawn, whereupon Hector seeing him called out  to John that he would rather be burned where he was than face Donald  Dubh.  John called the latter away, and Hector rushed out into his  nephew&#x27;s arms and  embraced him.  That same night John and Hector,  without &quot;Dysman,&quot; saving God and such commons as were then present,  agreed and condescended that Hector should have the estate till John was  twenty-one years of age, and that John should live on his own purchases  till then,   Hector was to set the whole estate immediately, as tutor to John,  which next day he went about.  &quot;I cannot forget what passed betwixt him  and the foresaid Donald at the set of Kenlochewe, who was one of the first  that sought land from him, which when he sought, Hector says to him:  `I  wonder, Donald, how you can ask land this day, that was so forward  to  kill me the last day.&#x27;  Donald answered that `if he had such a leader this  day as he had that night he should show him no better quarters, for  Kenneth&#x27;s death (meaning Kenneth Aack) struck nearer my heart than any  prejudice you can do me in denying me land this day.&#x27;  Hector said, `Well Donald, I doubt ye not if you had such coildghys (coldhaltas--fosterage) to  me as you had to that man but you would act the like for me.  Therefore you shall have your choice of all the land in the country.&#x27;  Hector having  set the whole estate as tutor, all things seemed fair, only that Allan and his  faction in Kintail, who previously urged John to possess himself of  Ellandonnan Castle, were not satisfied with the arrangement, as John was  still kept out of the stronghold, `which Hector would not grant, not being  condescended on (and as he alleged) lest John should fail on his part  but  the factions--the commons--within that country could not be satisfied  herewith, being, as it was said, moved hereto by an accident that fell out a year or two before.&#x27;&quot; [Ancient MS.]   This &quot;accident&quot; is described further  on, and refers to Hector&#x27;s alleged attempt to get Allan assassinated at  Invershiel. Donald Dubh was Kenneth Og&#x27;s foster-brother, and Imagining that Hector was accessory in an underhand way to Kenneth&#x27;s captivity in Edinburgh Castle, and consequently to his death in the Torwood, he conceived an inveterate hatred for him, and determined to kill him in  revenge the first opportunity that presented itself.  Hector, knowing that  his resolution  proceeded from fidelity and affection to his foster-brother  and master, not only forgave him, but ultimately took an opportunity of  rewarding him  and, as we have seen, afterwards gave him his choice of  all the lands in Kenlochewe. John immediately sent word of what had taken place to his uncle of Lovat, and next day marched for Kintail, where all the people there, as  well as in the other parts of his property, recognised him as their chief. The Castle of Ellandonnan was delivered up to him, with the charter chest and other evidences of his extensive possessions. It has been maintained by the family of Gairloch that there is no truth in the charge against their ancestor, Hector Roy, which we have just  given mainly on the authority of the Earl of Cromartie. The writer of the  Ardintoul MS. of the Mackenzies, [Dr George Mackenzie gives  substantially  the same account,] however corroborates his lordship, and  says that John  was but young when his father died; and Hector, his  younger uncle (Duncan, Hector&#x27;s eldest brother, who should be tutor being dead, and Allan, Duncan&#x27;s son, not being able to oppose or grapple with  Hector), meddled with the estate. It is reported that Hector wished Allan  out of the way, whom he thought only to stand in his way from being laird,  since he was resolved not to own my Lord Lovat&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s children,  being all bastards and gotten in adultery.  The reason why they entertained such thoughts of him was partly this:  Hector going to Ellandonnan (where he placed Malcolm Mac Eancharrich constable) called such of the country  people to him as he judged fit, under pretence of setting and settling the  country, but asked not for, nor yet called his nephew Allan, who lived at Invershiel, within a few miles of Ellandonnan, but went away.  Allan,  suspecting this to have proceeded from unkindness, sends to one of his  familiar friends to know the result of the meeting, or if there was any  spoken concerning him.  The man, perhaps, not being willing to be an ill instrument twixt so near relations, sends Allan the following Irish (Gaelic)  lines:-- Inversheala na struth bras, Tar as, `s fear foul ga d&#x27; fheitheamh, Nineag, ga caol a cas, Tha leannan aice gun thios, A tighinn ga&#x27;m fhaire a shios, Tha i, gun fhios, fo mo chrios Tha `n sar lann ghuilbneach ghlas,-- Bhehion urchair dha le fios. Allan put his own construction on them, and thought a friend  warned him to have a care of himself, there being some designs  on him from a near relation; and so that very night, in the  beginning thereof, he removed himself and family and anything  he valued within the house to an bill above the town, where he  might see and bear anything that might befall the house; and that  same night about cock crow he saw bis house and biggings in  flames, and found them consumed to ashes on the morrow.  The  perpetrators could not be found;  yet it was generally thought to  be Hector his uncle&#x27;s contrivance.&quot; The writer then describes the legitimation of Agnes Fraser&#x27;s children by the Pope, and continues--&quot;Hector, notwithstanding of the  legitimation, refused to quit the possession of the estate,&quot; and he then  gives the same account of John&#x27;s feigned expedition to Ireland, and the  burning of Hector&#x27;s house at Wester Fairburn, substantially as already  given from another source, but adding--&quot;That very night they both entered  upon terms of agreement without acquainting or sending for any, or to  advise a reconciliation betwixt them.  The sum of their agreement was,  that Hector, as a man able to rule and govern, should have (allowing John an aliment) the estate for five or six years, till John should be major, and that thereafter Hector should render it to John as the right and lawful  undoubted heir, and that Hector should ever afterwards acknowledge and  honour him as his chief, and so they parted, all being well pleased.  [John  and Hector did condescend that Hector should have the estate till John  were one and twentie years, and that John should live on his own purchase till then.  Letter from MS.]  But Allan and the most of the Kintail men  were dissatisfied that John did not get Ellandonnan, his principal house, in  his own possession, and so desired John to come to them and possess the  castle by fair or foul means wherein  they promised to assist him.  John  goes to Kintail, desires him to render the place to him, which he refused,  for which cause John ordered bring all his cattle to those he employed to besiege the castle till Malcolm (the governor) would be starved out of it. Yet this did not prevail with the governor, till he got Hector&#x27;s consent, who, being acquainted, came to Lochalsh and met with his nephew, and  after concerting the matter, Hector sends word to Malcolm to render the  place to John.  But Malcolm would not till he would be paid of his goods  that were destroyed.  But Hector sending to him the second time, after  considerable negotiation for several days, telling him he was a fool, that  he might remember how himself was used, and that that might be a means  to take his life also.  Whereupon Malcolm renders the house, but John was so much offended at him that he would not continue him governor, but gave the charge to Gillechriost Mac Fhionnla Mhic Rath, making him  Constable of the Isle.  So after that there was little or no debate twixt John  and Hector during the rest of the six years he was Tutor.&#x27; [Ardintoul and Ancient MSS. of the Mackenzies.] The MS. Histories of the family are borne out by Gregory,  (Highlands and Isles of Scotland, p. 111) who informs us that &quot;Hector Roy Mackenzie, progenitor of the House of Gairloch, had, since the death of  Kenneth Og Mackenzie of Kintail, in 1497, and during the minority of  John, the brother and heir of Kenneth, exercised the command of that  clan, nominally as guardian to the young chief. Under his rule the Clan  Mackenzie became involved in feuds with the Munroes and other clans,  and Hector Roy himself became obnoxious to Government as a disturber  of the public peace.  His intentions towards the young Laird of Kintail  were considered very dubious; and the apprehensions of the latter having  been roused, Hector was compelled by law to yield up the estate and the  command of the tribe to the proper heir.&quot;  Gregory gives the &quot;Acts of the Lords of Council, xxii., fo. 142,&quot; as that upon which, among other autho-rities, he founds.  We give the following extract, except that the spelling is  modernised:-- &quot;7th April  1511.--Anent the summons made at the instance of  John Mackenzie of Kintail against Hector Roy Mackenzie for the  wrongous intromitting, uptaking, and withholding from him of the mails `fermez,&#x27; profits, and duties of all and whole the lands of Kintail, with the  pertinents lying in the Sheriffdom of Inverness, for the space of seven  years together, beginning in the year of God 1501, and also for the space of two years, last bye-past, and for the masterful withholding from the said  John Mackenzie of his house and Castle of Ellandonnan, and to bring with  him his evidence if (he) any has of the constabulary and keeping thereof, and to hear the same decerned of none avail, and diverse other points like as at more length; is contained in the said summons, the said John  Mackenzie being personally present, and the said Hector Roy being  lawfully summoned to this action, oft-times called and not compearing,  the said John&#x27;s rights, etc.  The Lords of Council decree and deliver, that  the said Hector has forfeited the keeping and constabulary of the said  Castle of Ellandonnan, together with the fees granted therefor, and decern  all evidents, if he any has made to him thereupon, of none avail, force, nor  effect, and the said John Mackenzie to have free ingress and entry to the said Castle, because he required the said Hector for deliverance thereof and to thole him to enter thereunto, howbeit the said Hector refused and  would not give him entry to the said Castle, but if his servants would have  delivered their happinnis from them to his men or their entries, like as one  actentit instrument taken thereupon shown and produced before the said  Lords purported and bore, and therefore ordains our sovereign Lords&#x27;  letters (to) be directed to devode and rid the said Castle and to keep the  said John in possession thereof as effeirs and continues to remanent points  contained in the said summons in form, as they are now, unto the 20th day of July next to come, with continuation of days, and ordains that letters be  written in form of commission to the Sheriff of Inverness and his deputies  to summon witnesses and take probations thereupon and to summon the  party to heir them sworn and thereafter send their depositions closed to the  Lords again, the said day, under the said Sheriffs or his Deputy&#x27;s seal, that thereafter justice may be ministered thereuntill.&quot; Whatever truth there may be in the accounts given by the family historians, Hector Roy was undoubtedly at this period possessed of considerable estates of his own; for, we find a &quot;protocol,&quot; by John Vass, &quot;Burges of Dygvayll, and Shireff in this pairt,&quot; by which he makes known  that, by the command of his sovereign lord, letters and process was  directed to him as Sheriff granting him to give Hector Mackenzie heritable  state and possession &quot;of all and syndri the landis off Gerloch with thar  pertinens, after the forme and tenor off our souerane lordis chartyr maide  to the forsaide Hector,&quot; lying between the waters called Inverew and  Torridon. The letter is dated &quot;At Alydyll (?Talladale)  the xth of the  moneth off December the zher off Gode ane thousande four hundreth  nynte an four zheris.&quot; It is clear that Hector did not long continue under a cloud; for in  1508 the King directed a mandate to the Chamberlain of Ross requesting  him to enter Hector Roy Mackenzie in the &quot;males and proffitis of our  landis of Braane and Moy, with ariage,  cariage and vther pertinence  thareof . for his gude and thankfull service done and to be done to us .  and this on na wise ye leif vndone, as ye will incur our indignatioun and displesour.  This our letrez . efter the forme of our said vther letres past  obefor, given vnder our signet at Edinburgh the fift day of Marche and of Regne the twenty yere.--(Signed) James R.&quot;  In 1513 he received a charter under the great seal of the lands of Gairloch formerly granted him, with  Glasletter and Coruguellen, with their pertinents. [The original charter; the  &quot;protocol&quot; from John Vass; the mandate to the Chamberlain of Ross, for  copies of which we are indebted to Sir Kenneth S. Mackenzie, Baronet,  are in the Gaitloch Charter Chest, and the latter two will be found in  extenso in the account of the Gairloch family later on.]  Hector Roy&#x27;s  conduct towards John has been unfavourably criticised, but if it is kept in  mind that no regular marriage ever took place between Kenneth a Bhlair and John&#x27;s mother, Agnes of Lovat that their union was not recognised by  the Church until 1491, if then, the same year in which Kenneth died it can  easily be understood why Hector should conscientiously do what he  probably held to be his duty-oppose John of Killin in the interest of those  whom he considered the legitimate successors of Kenneth a Bhlair and his  unfortunate son, Kenneth Og, to whom only, so far as we can discover,  Hector Roy was appointed Tutor; for when his brother, Kenneth a Bhlair,  died, there was every appearance that Hector&#x27;s ward, Kenneth Og, would  succeed when he came of age.  The succession of John of Killin was at  most only a remote possibility when his father died, and therefore no  Tutor to him would have been appointed. In terms of an Act passed in 1496, anent the education of young gentlemen of note, John, when young, was sent by Hector Roy to Edinburgh to complete his education at Court.  He thus, in early life,  acquired a knowledge of legal principles and practice of great service and  value to him in after life, not only in the management of his own affairs,  but in aiding his friends and countrymen in their peculiar difficulties by  his counsel and guidance, and thus he secured such universal esteem and  confidence as seldom fell to the lot of a Highland chief in that rude and unruly age.  The standard of education necessary at Court in those days  must have been very different from that required in ours, for we find that, with all his opportunities, John of Killin could not write his own name. To a bond in favour of the Earl of Huntly he subscribes, &quot;Jhone M&#x27;Kenzie  of Kyntaill, with my hand on the pen led by Master William Gordone,  Notar.&quot; Referring to the power of the House of Kintail at this period, and  to the rapid advance made by the family under Alexander and his  successors, we quote the following from a modern MS. history of the  family by the late Captain John Matheson of Bennetsfield:--&quot;We must  observe here the rapid advance which the family of Kintail made on every  side.  The turbulent Macdonalds, crushed by the affair of Park, Munro,  sustained by his own clan, and the neighbouring vassals of Ross humbled  at their own door, when a century had not yet passed since the name of  Mackenzie had become familiar to their ears; and it is gratifying to trace  all this to the wise policy of the first James and his successors.  The judicious education of Alastair Ionraic, and consequent cultivation of  those  habits which, by identifying the people with the monarch through  the laws, render a nation securely&#x27; great, is equally discernible in John of  Killin and his posterity.  The successors of the Earls of Ross were  turbulent and tenacious of their rights, but they were irreclaimable. The  youthful Lord of the Isles, at the instigation of his haughty mother,  deserted the Court of James I., while young Kintail remained, sedulously  improving himself at school in Perth, till he was called to display his  gratitude to his Royal master in counteracting the evil arising from the  opposite conduct  of Macdonald.   Thus, by one happy circumstance, the  attention of the King was called to a chieftain who gave such early  promise of steady attachment, and his future favour was secured.  The  family of Kintail was repeatedly recognised in the calendar of the Scottish  Court, while that of the once proud Macdonalds frowned in  disappointment  and barbarous independence amidst their native wilds,  while their territories, extending beyond the bounds of good government  and  protection, presented  gradually  such defenceless gaps as became  inviting and easily penetrable by the intelligence of Mackenzie, and  Alastair Ionraic acquired a great portion of his estates by this legitimate advantage, afterwards secured by the intractable arrogance of Macdonald  of Lochalsh and the valour and military capacity of Coinneach a Bhlair.&quot; In 1513 John of Killin is found among those Highland chiefs  summoned to rendezvous with the Royal army at Barrow Moor  preparatory to the fatal advance of James IV. into England, when the  Mackenzies, forming with  the Macleans, joined that miserably-arranged  and ill-fated expedition which terminated so fatally to Scotland on the  disastrous field of Flodden, where the killed included the King, with the flower of his nobility, gentry, and even clergy.  There was scarcely a  Scottish family of distinction that did not lose at least one, and some of  them lost all the male members who were capable of bearing arms.  The  body of the King was found, much disfigured with wounds, in the thickest  of the slain.  Abercromby, on the authority of Crawford, includes, in a list  of those killed at Flodden, &quot;Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail, ancestor to the  noble family of Seaforth.&quot;  This is an undoubted error for it will be seen  that John, not Kenneth was chief at the time of Flodden.  It was he who  joined the Royal army, accompanied by his brave and gallant uncle,  Hector Roy of Gairloch  and it is established beyond dispute that though  almost all their followers fell, both John and Hector survived and returned  home.  They, however, narrowly escaped the charge of Sir Edward Stanley  in rear of the Highlanders during the disorderly pursuit of Sir Edward Howard, who had given way to the furious and gallant onset of the mountaineers. John was made prisoner, but afterwards escaped in a very  remarkable manner.  When his captors were carrying him and others of his followers to the south, they were overtaken by a violent storm which  obliged them to seek shelter in a retired house occupied by the widow of a  shipmaster.  After taking up their quarters, and, as they thought, providing  for the safe custody of the prisoners, the woman noticed that the captives  were Highlanders; and, in reference to the boisterous weather raging  outside, she, as if unconsciously, exclaimed, &quot;The Lord help those who are  to-night travelling on Leathad Leacachan.&quot;  The prisoners were naturally astonished to hear an allusion, in such a place, to a mountain so familiar to  them in the North Highlands, and they soon obtained an opportunity,  which their hostess appeared most anxious to afford them, of questioning  her regarding her acquaintance with so distant a place; when she told them  that during a sea voyage she took with her husband, she had been taken so ill aboard ship that it was found necessary to send her ashore on the north  west coast of Scotland, where, travelling with only a maid and a single  guide, they were caught in a severe storm, and she was suddenly taken in  labour.  In this distressing and trying position a Highlander passing by  took compassion upon her, and  seeing her case so desperate, with no  resources at hand, he, with remarkable presence of mind, killed one of his  horses, ripped open his stomach, and taking out the bowels, placed  her  and the newly-born infant in their place, as the only effectual shelter from  the storm.  By this means he secured sufficient time to procure female  assistance, and ultimately saved the woman and her child.  But the most remarkable part of the story remains to be told.  The  same person to whom she owed her preservation was at that moment one  of the captives under her roof.   He was one of Kintail&#x27;s followers on the  fatal field of Flodden.  She, informed of his presence and of the plight he  was in, managed to procure a private interview with him, when he amply  proved to her, by more detailed reference to the incidents of their meeting  on Leathad Leacachan, that he was the man--&quot;Uisdean Mor Mac `Ille  Phadruig&quot;--and in gratitude, she, at the serious risk of her own personal  safety, successfully planned the escape of Hugh&#x27;s master and his whole  party.  The story is given on uninterrupted tradition in the country of the  Mackenzies; and a full and independent version in the vernacular of the  hero&#x27;s humane conduct on Leathad Leacachan will be found in the Celtic  Magazine, vol. ii., pp. 468-9, to which the Gaelic reader is referred. Gregory, p. 112, says:--&quot;Tradition has preserved a curious  anecdote connected with the Mackenzies, whose young chief, John of  Kintail, was taken prisoner at Flodden.  It will be recollected that Kenneth Og Mackenzie of Kintail, while on his way to the Highlands, after making  his escape from Edinburgh Castle, was killed in the Torwood by the Laird  of Buchanan.  The foster-brother of Kenneth Og was a man of the district  of Kenlochewe, named Donald Dubh MacGillecrist vic Gillereoch, who  with the rest of the clan was at Flodden with his chief.  In the retreat of the  Scottish army this Donald Dubh heard some one near him exclaiming,  `Alas, Laird! thou hast fallen.&#x27; On enquiry, he was told it was the Laird of  Buchanan, who had sunk from his wounds or exhaustion.  The faithful  Highlander, eager to revenge the death of his chief and foster-brother,  drew his sword, and, saying, `If he has not fallen he shall fall,&#x27; made  straight to Buchanan, whom he killed on the spot.&quot; As to the safe return of John of Kintail and Hector Roy to their Highland home, after this calamitous event, there is now no question whatever; for we find John among others, afterwards appointed, by Act of  Council, a Lieutenant or Guardian of Wester Ross, [Gregory, p. 115. Acts  of Lords of Council, xxvi., fo. 25.] to protect it from Sir Donald Gallda Macdonald of Lochalsh, when he proclaimed himself Lord of the Isles.  In  1515, Mackenzie, without legal warrant, seized the Royal Castle of  Dingwall, but professed his readiness to give it up to any one appointed by  the Regent, John, Duke of Albany. [Acts of Lords of Council, xxvii., fo.  60.]  In 1532 he is included in a commission by James V. for suppressing  a disorderly tribe of Mackintoshes.  He secured  the esteem of this monarch so much that he appointed him a member of his Privy Council. To put the question of John&#x27;s return beyond question, and to show how the family rose rapidly in influence and power during his rule, we  shall quote the Origines Parochiales Scotia, from which it will also be  seen that Kenneth, John&#x27;s heir, received considerable grants for himself  during his father&#x27;s lifetime:--&quot;In 1509 King James IV. granted to John  Makkenzie of Keantalle (the brother of Kenneth Og) the 40 marklands of  Keantalle--namely, the davach of Cumissaig, the davach of Letterfearn,  the davach of Gleanselle, the davach of Glenlik, the davach of Letterchall,  the two davachs of Cro, and three davachs between the water of Keppach  and the water of Lwying, with the castle and fortalice of Eleandonnan, in the earldom of Ross and sheriffdom of Innernis, with other lands in Ross, which John had resigned, and which the King then erected into the barony  of Eleandonnan. [Reg. Mag. Sig., lib. xv., No.89. Gregory, p.83.]   In  1530 King James V. granted to James Grant of Freuchy and Johne  Mckinze of Kintale liberty to go to any part of the realm on their lawful business. [Reg. Sec. Sig., vol. viii., fol. 149.]  In 1532, 1538, and 1540, the  same John  M&#x27;Kenich of Kintaill appears on record. [Reg. Sec. Sig., vol.  ix, fol. 3; vol. xii., fol. 21 ; vol. xiv., fol. 32.]  In 1542, King James V. granted to John Mckenzie of Kintaill the waste lands of Monar, lying  between the water of Gleneak on the north, the top or summit of Landovir  on the south, the torrent of Towmuk and Inchclochill on the east, and the water of Bernis running into the water of Long on the west; and also the  waste lands of lie Ned lying between Loch Boyne on the  north, Loch  Tresk on the south, lie Ballach on the west, and Dawelach on the east, in the earldom of Ross and sheriffdom of Innernes--lands which were never  in the King&#x27;s rental, and never yielded any revenue-for the yearly payment  of ? to the King as Earl of Ross. [Reg. Mag. Sig., lib. xxviii., No.  417.] In 1543 Queen Mary granted to Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail, and Isabel  Stewart, his wife, the lands of Auchnaceyric, Lakachane, Strome-ne-mowklach, Kilkinterne, the two Rateganis, Torlousicht, Auchnashellicht,  Auchnagart, Auchewrane, lic Knokfreith, Aucharskelane, and Malegane,  in the lordship of Kintaill and other lands in Ross, extending in all to 36  marks, which he had  resigned. [Reg. Mag. Sig., lib. xxviii., No. 524.  Reg.  Sec. Sig.,vol. xvii., fol. 56.] In 1551 the same Queen granted to John  M&#x27;Kenze of Kintaill, and Kenzeoch M&#x27;Kenze, his son and apparent heir, a  remission for the violent taking of John Hectour M&#x27;Kenzesone of  Garlouch, Doull Hectoursone, and John Towach Hectoursone, and for  keeping them in prison `vsurpand thairthrou our Souerane Ladyis  autorite.&#x27; [Reg. Sec. Sig., vol. xxiv., fol. 75.]  In 1554 there appear on  record John Mackenzie of Kintaile and his son and heir-apparant, Kenneth Mackenzie of Brahan--apparently the same persons that appear in 1551.  [Reg, Mag. Sig., lib. xxxii., No. 211.] Donald Gorm Mor Macdonald of Sleat laid waste the country of  Macleod of Dunvegan, an ally of Mackenzie, after which he passed over  in 1539 to the mainland and pillaged the lands of Kenlochewe, where he  killed Miles or Maolmuire, son of Finlay Dubh MacGillechriost MacRath,  at the time governor of Ellandonnan Castle.  Finlay was a very &quot;pretty  man,&quot; and the writer of the Genealogy of the Macras informs us that &quot;the  remains of a monument erected for him, in the place where he was killed,  is still (1704) to be seen.&quot;  Kintail was naturally much exasperated at this  unprovoked raid upon his territory, as also for Macdonald&#x27;s attack upon  his friend and ally, Macleod of Dunvegan; and to punish Donald Gorm, he  dispatched his son, Kenneth, with a force to Skye, who made ample  reprisals in Macdonald&#x27;s country, killing many of his followers, and at the same time exhibiting great intrepidity and sagacity.  Donald Gorm almost  immediately afterwards made an incursion into Mackenzie&#x27;s territories of  Kintail, where he killed Sir (Rev.) Dougald Mackenzie, &quot;one of the Pope&#x27;s knights&quot;; whereupon Kenneth, younger of Kintail, paid a second visit to  the Island, wasted the country; and on his return, Macdonald learning that  Ellandonnan was garrisoned by a very weak force, under the new  governor, John Dubh Matheson of Fernaig--who had married Sir Dugald  Mackenzie&#x27;s widow--he made another raid upon it, with fifty birlinns or  large boats full of his followers, with the intention of surprising the small  garrison, and taking the castle by storm.  Its gallant defenders consisted at the time of the governor, his watchman, and Duncan MacGillechriost Mac  Fhionnladh Mhic Rath, a nephew of Maolmuire killed in the last incursion  of the Island chief.  The advance of the boats was, however, noticed in  time by the sentinel or watchman, who at once gave the alarm to the  country people, but they arrived too late to prevent the enemy from  landing.  Duncan MacGillechriost was on the mainland at the time; but  flying back with all speed he arrived at the postern of the stronghold in time to kill several of the Islesmen in the act of landing; and, entering the  castle, he found no one there but the governor and watchman; almost immediately after, Donald Gorm Mor furiously attacked the gate, but  without success, the brave trio having strongly secured it by a second  barrier of iron within a few steps of the outer defences. Unable to procure  access  the Islesmen were driven to the expedient of shooting their arrows  through the embrazures, and in this way they succeeded in killing the  governor. Duncan now found himself sole defender of the castle except the watchman; and worse still his ammunition was reduced to a single barbed  arrow, which he determined to husband until an opportunity occurred by  which he could make good use of it Macdonald at this stage ordered his  boats round to the point of the Airds, and was personally  reconnoitring  with the view of discovering the weakest part of the wall for effecting a breach. Duncan considered this a favourable opportunity, and aiming his  arrow at Donald Gorm, it struck him and penetrated his foot through the  master vein. Macdonald, not having perceived that the arrow was a  barbed one, wrenched it out, and in so doing separated the main artery. Notwithstanding that all available means were used, it was found impossible to stop the bleeding, and his men conveyed him out of the  range of the fort to a spot--a sand bank--on which he died, called to this  day, &quot;Larach Tigh Mhic Dhomhnuill,&quot; or the site of Macdonald&#x27;s house,  where the haughty Lord of Sleat ended his career. [Genealogy of the  Macras and the Ardintoul MS.  &quot;This Donald Gorme was son to Donald  Gruamach, son to Donald Gallach, son to Hugh, natural son to Alexander,  Earl of Ross, for which the elegy made on his death calls him grandchild  and great grandchild to Rhi-Fingal (King Fingal)-- &quot;A Dhonnchaldh Mhic Gillechriost Mhic Fhionnla, `S mor um beud a thuit le d&#x27;aon laimh, Ogha `s iar-ogha Mhic Righ Fhinghaill, `Thuiteam le bramag an aon mhic.&quot; --Letterform MS.]  The Islesmen burnt all they could find ashore in Kintail. &quot;In 1539 Donald Gorm of Sleat and his allies, after laying waste Trouterness in Sky and Kenlochew in Ross, attempted to take the Castle  of Eileandonan, but Donald being killed by an arrow shot from the wall,  the attempt failed.&quot; [Gregory, pp. 145.146.  Border Minstrelsy.  Anderson,  p. 283.  Reg. Sec. Sig., vol. xv., fol. 46.]  In 1541 King James V.  granted a  remission to Donald&#x27;s accomplices--namely, Archibald  Ilis, alias  Archibald the Clerk, Alexander McConnell Gallich, John Dow  Donaldsoun, and twenty-six others whose names are recorded in Origines  Parchiales, p. 394, vol. ii., for their treasonable fire-raising and burning of  the &quot;Castle of Allanedonnand&quot; and of the boats there, for the &quot;Herschip&quot; of Kenlochew and Trouterness, etc. Duncan MacGillechriost now naturally felt that he had some claim to the governorship of the castle, but being considered &quot;a man more bold  and rash than prudent and politick,&quot; Mackenzie decided to pass him over. Duncan then put in a claim for his brother Farquhar, but it was thought  best, to avoid local quarrels and bitterness between the respective  claimants, to supersede them both and appoint another, John  MacMhurchaidh Dhuibh, priest of Kintail, to the Constableship. Duncan  was so much offended at such treatment in return for his valiant services that he left Kintail in disgust, and went to the country of Lord Lovat, who  received him kindly, and gave him the lands of Crochel and others in  Strathglass, where he lived for several years, until Lovat&#x27;s death. Mackenzie, however, often visited him and finally prevailed upon him to  return to Kintail, and Duncan, who always retained a lingering affection  for his native country, ultimately became reconciled to the chief, who  gave him the quarterland of Little Inverinate and Dorisduan, where he  lived  the remainder of his days, and which his descendants continued to  possess for generations after his death. For this service against the Macdonalds, James V. gave Mackenzie Kinchullidrum, Achilty, and Comery in feu, with Meikle Scatwell, under  the Great Seal, in 1528.  The lands of Laggan  Achidrom, being four  merks, the three merks of Killianan, and the four merk lands of Invergarry,  being in the King&#x27;s hands, were disposed by him to John Mackenzie, after  the King&#x27;s minority and revocation, in 1540, with a precept, under the  Great Seal, and sasine thereupon by Sir John Robertson in January 1541. But before this, in 1521, he acquired the lands of Fodderty and mill  thereof from Mr John Cadell, which James V. confirmed to him at  Linlithgow in September, 1522.  In 1541 he feued Brahan from the King  to himself and his heirs male, which failing, to his eldest daughter.  In 1542 he obtained the waste lands and forest of Neid and Monar from  James V. for which sasine is granted in the same year by Sir John  Robertson.  In January 1547 he acquired a wadset of the half of Culteleod (Castle Leod) and Drynie from Denoon of Davidston.  In September of the  same year, old as he was, he went in defence of his Sovereign, young  Mary of Scots, to the Battle of Pinkie, where he was taken prisoner; and  the Laird of Kilravock meeting him advised him that they should own  themselves among the commons, Mackenzie passing off as a bowman. While Kilravock would pass himself off as a miller, which plan succeeded  so well as to secure Kilravock his release; but the Earl of Huntly, who was  also a prisoner, having been conveyed by the Duke of Somerset to view  the prisoners, espying his old friend Mackenzie among the common  prisoners, and ignorant of the plot, called him by his name, desiring that  he might shake hands with him, which civility two English officers  noticed to Mackenzie&#x27;s disadvantage; for thenceforward he was placed  and guarded along with the other prisoners of quality, but afterwards  released for a considerable sum, to which all  his  people contributed  without burdening his own estate with  it, [&quot;He was ransomed by cows  that was raised through all his lands.&quot;--Letterform MS.] so  returning home to set himself to arrange his private affairs, and in the year 1556 he  acquired the heritage of Culteleod and Drynie from Denoon, which was  confirmed to him by Queen Mary under the Great Seal, at Inverness 13th  July the same year.  He had previously, in 1544, acquired the other half of  Culteleod and Drynie from Magnus Mowat, and Patrick Mowat of  Bugholly.  In 1543 John Mackenzie acquired Kildins, part of Lochbroom,  to himself and Elizabeth Grant, his wife, holding blench for a penny, and confirmed in the same year by Queen Mary. [MS. History by the Earl of  Cromartie.] In 1540 Mackenzie with his followers joined King James at Loch  Duich, while on his way with a large fleet to secure the good government of the West Highlands and Isles, upon which occasion many of the suspected and refractory leaders were carried south and placed in  confinement.  His Majesty died soon after, in 1542.  Queen Mary  succeeded, and, being a minor, the country generally, but particularly the  northern parts, was thrown into a state of anarchy and confusion.  In 1544 the Earl of Huntly, holding a commission as Lieutenant of  the North from the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, commanded Kenneth  Mackenzie, younger of Kintail (his father, from his advanced age, being  unable to take the field), to raise his vassals and lead an expedition against  the Clan Ranald of Moidart, who, at that time, held lands from Mackenzie  on the West Coast; but Kenneth, in these circumstances, thought it would  be much against his personal interest to attack Donald Glas of Moidart, and refused to comply with Huntly&#x27;s orders.  To punish him, the Earl  ordered his whole army, consisting of three thousand men, to proceed  against both Moidart and Mackenzie with fire and sword, but he had not  sufficiently calculated on the constitution of his force, which was chiefly  composed of Grants, Rosses, Mackintoshes, and Chisholms; and  Kenneth&#x27;s mother being a daughter of John, then laird of Grant, and three of his daughters having married, respectively, Ross of Balnagown,  Lachlan Mackintosh of Mackintosh, and Alexander Chisholm of Comar,  Huntly found his followers as little disposed to molest Mackenzie as he  had been to attack Donald Glas of Moidart.  In addition to the friendly  feelings of the other chiefs towards young Kintail, fostered by these family alliances, Huntly was not at all popular with his own followers, or with the  Highlanders generally.  He had incurred such odium for having some time  before executed the Laird of Mackintosh, contrary to his solemn pledge,  that it required little excuse on the part of the exasperated kindred tribes to  counteract his plans, and on the slightest pretext to refuse to follow him. He was therefore obliged to retire from the West without effecting any  substantial service; was ultimately disgraced committed to Edinburgh  Castle; compelled to renounce the Earldom of Moray and all his other  possessions in the north; and sentenced to banishment in France for five  years. On the 13th of December 1545, at Dingwall, the Earl of Sutherland entered into a bond of manrent with John Mackenzie of Kintail for mutual  defence against all enemies, reserving only their allegiance to their  youthful Queen, Mary Stuart. [Sir Robert Gordon, p. 112.] Two years  later the Earl of Arran sent the fiery cross over the nation calling upon all  between the ages of sixteen and sixty to meet him at Musselburgh for the  protection of the infant Queen. Mackenzie of Kintail, then between sixty and seventy years of age, when he might fairly consider himself exempt  from further military service, duly appeared with all the followers he  could muster, prudently leaving Kenneth, his only son, at home  and when remonstrated with for taking part in such a perilous journey at his time of  life, especially as he was far past the stipulated age for active service, the  old chief patriotically remarked that one of his age could not possibly die  more decorously than in the defence of his country.  In the same year  (1547) he fought bravely, at the head of his clan, with all the enthusiasm  and gallantry of his younger days, at the battle of Pinkie, where he was  wounded in the head and taken prisoner, but was soon afterwards released, through the influence of the Earl of Huntly, who had meanwhile again got  into favour received a full pardon, and was appointed Chancellor for  Scotland. The Earl of Huntly some time after this paid a visit to Ross, intending, if he were kindly received by the great chiefs, to feu a part of  the earldom of Ross, still in the King&#x27;s hands, and to live in  the district  for some period of the year.  Mackenzie, although friendly disposed  towards the Earl, had no desire to have him residing in his immediate  neighbourhood, and he arranged a plan which had the effect of deciding  Huntly to give up. any idea of remaining or feuing any lands in Ross. The  Earl, having obtained a commission from the Regent to hold courts in the  county, came to the castle of Dingwall, where he invited the principal  chiefs to meet him.  John of Killin, though very advanced in years, was the  first to arrive, and he was very kindly received by Huntly.  Mackenzie in return made a pretence of heartily welcoming and congratulating his  lordship on his coming to Ross, and trusted that he would  be the means of  protecting him and his friends from the violence of his son, Kenneth, who, taking advantage of his frailty and advanced years, was behaving most  unjustly towards him.  John, indeed, expressed the hope that the Earl  would punish Kenneth for his illegal and unnatural rebellion against him, his aged father.  While they were thus speaking, a message came in that a large number of armed men, three or four hundred strong, with banners  flying and pipes playing, were just in sight on the hill above Dingwall. The Earl became alarmed, not knowing whom they might be or what their  object was, whereupon Mackenzie said that it could be no other than  Kenneth and his rebellious followers coming to punish him for paying his  lordship this visit without his consent and he advised the Earl to leave at  once, as he was not strong enough to resist the enemy, and to take him  (the old chief) along with him in order to protect him from his son&#x27;s  violence, which would now, in consequence of this visit he directed  against him more than ever.  The Earl and his retinue at once withdrew to Easter Ross. Kenneth ordered his men to pursue them.  He overtook them  as they were crossing the bridge of Dingwall and killed several of them; but having attained his object of frightening Huntly out of Ross, he ordered his men to desist.  This skirmish is known as the &quot;affair of  Dingwall Bridge.&quot; [Ardintoul MS.] In 1556 Y Mackay of Farr, progenitor of the Lords of Reay,  refused to appear before the Queen Regent at Inverness, to answer charges made against him for depredations committed in Sutherlandshire; and she  issued a commission to John, fifth Earl of Sutherland, to lay Mackay&#x27;s  country waste.  Mackay, satisfied that he could not successfully oppose  the Earl&#x27;s forces in the field, pillaged and plundered another district of  Sutherland.  The Earl conveyed intelligence of how matters stood to John  of Kintail, who, in terms of the bond of manrent entered into between  them in 1545, despatched his son Kenneth with an able body of the clan to arrest Mackay&#x27;s progress, which duty he performed most effectually. Meeting at Brora, a severe contest ensued, which terminated in the defeat of Mackay, with the loss of Angus MacIain Mhoir, one of his chief  commanders, and many of his clan.  Kenneth was thereupon, conjointly  with his father, appointed by the Earl of Sutherland-then the Queen&#x27;s  Lieutenant north of the Spey, and Chamberlain of the Earldom of Ross  [Sir Robert Gordon, p. 134.]--his deputies in the management of this vast  property, at the same time placing them in possession of Ardmeanoch, or  Redcastle, which remained ever since, until within a recent period, in the  possession of the family, becoming the property of Kenneth&#x27;s third son,  Ruairidh Mor, first of the house of Redcastle, and progenitor of the family of Kincraig and other well-known branches. After this, Kintail seems to have lived in peace during the remainder of his long life.  He died at his home at Inverchonan, in 1561, about eighty years of age.  He was buried in the family aisle at Beauly.  That he was a man of proved valour is fully established by the distinguished part he took in the battles of Flodden and Pinkie.  The Earl of  Cromarty informs us that, &quot;in his time he purchased much of the Brae-lands of Ross, and secured both what he acquired and what his  predecessors had, by well ordered and legal security, so that it is doubtful  whether his predecessors&#x27; courage or his prudence contributed most to the rising of the family.&quot; In illustration of the latter quality, we quote the following story:--  John Mackenzie of Kintail &quot;was a very great courtier and counsellor of  Queen Manes.  Much of the lands of Brae Ross were acquired by him,  which minds me how he entertained the Queen&#x27;s Chamberlain who she  sent north to learn the state and condition of the gentry of Ross, minding  to feu her interest of that Earldome. Sir John, hearing of their coming to  his house of Killin, he caused his servants put on a great fyre of ffresh arn   wood newly cutt, which when they came in (sitting on great jests of wood  which he caused sett there a purpose) made such a reek that they were  almost blinded, and were it not the night was so ill they would rather goe  than byde it.  They had not long sitten when his servants came in with a  great bull, which presently they brained on the floor, and or they well  could look about, this fellow with his dirk, and that fellow with his, were  cutting collops of him.  Then conies in another sturdie lusty fellow with a  great calderon in his hand, and ane axe in the other, and with its shaft  stroak each of these that were cutting the collops, and then made Taylzies  of it and put all in the kettle, sett it on the same tire before them all and  helped the tire with more green wood.  When all was ready as he had  ordered, a long, large table was covered and the beef sett on in great  scaills of dishes instead of pleats.  They had scarcely sitten to supper when  they let loose six or sevin great hounds to supp the broth, but before they  made ane end of it, they made such a tulzie as made them all start at the table.  The supper being ended, and longing for their bedds (but much  more for day), there comes in 5 or 6 lustie women with windlings of strae (and white plaids) which they spread on each side of the house, whereon the gentlemen were forced to lye in their cloaths, thinking they had come to purgatory before hand; but they had no sooner seen day light than  without stayeing dinner they made to the gett, down to Ross where they  were most noblie entertained be Ffowlis, Belnagowin, Miltoun, and  severall other gentlemen.  But when they were come south the Queen  asked who were the ablest men they saw there.  They answered all they  did see lived like princes, except Her Majesty&#x27;s great courtier and  counsellor Mackenzie.  So tells her all their usage in his house, and that he  slept with his doggs and sat with his hounds, wherat the Queen leugh  mirrily (whatever her thoughts was of M&#x27;Kenzie) and said `It were a pity  of his poverty, ffor he is the best and honestest among them all.&#x27;  The  Queen thereafter having called all the gentry of Ross to hold their lands of  the Crown in feu, Mackenzie got (by her favour and his pretended poverty) the easiest feu, and for his 1000 merks more than any of the rest  had for three.&quot; [Ancient MS.] John had a natural son named Dugall, who lived in Applecross,  and married a niece of Macleod of Harris, by whom he had a son and one  daughter.  The son, also named Dugall, was a schoolmaster in Chanonry,  and died without issue.  The daughter was married to Duncan Mackenzie,  Reraig, and after his death to Mackintosh of Strone.  Dugall, the elder,  was killed by the Mathesons at Kishorn.  John had also a natural daughter,  Janet, who married first Mackay of Reay, and secondly, Roderick  Macleod, X. of Lewis, with issue--Torquil Cononach; and afterwards &quot;Ian  Mor na Tuaighe,&quot; brother of John MacGillechallum of Raasay, with  whom she eloped. He married Elizabeth, daughter of John, tenth Laird of Grant, and by her had an only son and successor, X.  KENNETH  MACKENZIE, Commonly known as Coinneach na Cuirc, or Kenneth of the Whittle, so  called from his skill in wood carving and general dexterity with the  Highland &quot;sgian dubh.&quot;  He succeeded his father in  1561. In the  following year he was among the chiefs who, at the head of their  followers, met Queen Mary at Inverness, and helped her to obtain  possession of the Castle after Alexander Gordon, the governor, refused her  admission.  In the same year an Act of Privy Council, dated the 21st of  May, bears that he had delivered up Mary Macleod, the heiress of Harris  and Dunvegan, of whom he had previously by accident obtained the  custody, into the hands of Queen Mary, with whom she afterwards  remained for several years as a maid of honour.  The Act is as follows:-- &quot;The same day, in presence of the Queen&#x27;s Majesty and Lords of Secret Council, compeared Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail, who, being commanded by letters and also by writings direct from the Queen&#x27;s Grace,  to exhibit, produce, and present before her Highness Mary Macleod,  daughter and heir of the umquwhile William Macleod of Harris, conform  to the letters and charges direct thereupon:  And declared that James  Macdonald had an action depending the Lords of Session against him for  deliverance of the said Mary to him, and that therefore he could not gudlie  (well) deliver her.  Notwithstanding the which the Queen&#x27;s Majesty  ordained the said Kenneth to deliver the said Mary to her Highness and  granted that he should incur `no scaith thairthrou&#x27; at the hands of the said  James or any others, notwithstanding any title or action they had against him therefor; and the said Kenneth knowing his dutiful obedience to the  Queen&#x27;s Majesty, and that the Queen had ordained him to deliver the said Mary to her Highness in manner foresaid which he in no wise could disobey--and therefore delivered the said Mary to the Queen&#x27;s Majesty  conform to her ordinance foresaid.&quot; [Transactions of the Iona Club, pp.  143-4.] Prior to this Mackenzie refused to give her up to her lawful  guardian, James Macdonald of Dunyveg and the Glens.  In 1563 we find  him on the jury, with James, Earl of Moray, and others, at Inverness, by  whom John Campbell of Cawdor was served heir to the Barony of Strathnairn. [Invernessiana, p.229.]   Kenneth was advanced in years  before he came into possession, and took, as we have seen, an active and  distinguished part in all the affairs of his clan during the life of his long-lived father.  He seems after his return from Inverness, on the occasion of  meeting Queen Mary there, to have retired very much into private life, for,  on Mary&#x27;s escape from Lochleven Castle he sent his son Colin, then quite  a youth attending his studies at Aberdeen, at the head of his vassals, to join the Earl of Huntly, by whom Colin was sent, according to the Laird of  Applecross, &quot;as one whose prudence he confided, to advise the Queen&#x27;s  retreat to Stirling, where she  might stay  in  security till  all  her  friends   were convocate, but by an unhappy council she refused this advice and  fought at Langside, where Colin was present, and when by the Regent&#x27;s  [The Earl of Moray, appointed to the office after Mary&#x27;s defeat.]  insolence, after that victory, all the loyal subjects were forced to take remissions for their duty, as if it were a crime.  Amongst the rest  Mackenzie takes one, the only one that ever any of his family had  and this  is rather a mark of his fidelity than evidence of failure, and an honour, not  a task of his posterity.&quot;  It would have been already seen that another  remission had been received at an earlier date, for the imprisonment and  murder of John Glassich, son and successor to Hector Roy Mackenzie of  Gairloch, in Ellandonnan Castle.  Dr George Mackenzie says that Kenneth  apprehended John Glassich and sent him prisoner to the Castle, where he  was poisoned by the constable&#x27;s lady, [This lady was Nighean Iamhair,  and was spouse to John MacMhurchaidh Dhuibh. the Priest of Kintail,  who was then chosen constable of Ellandonnan for the following reason:--  A great debate arose between the Maclennans and the Macraes about this  important and honourable post, and the laird finding them irreconcilable, lest they should kill one another, and he being a stranger in the country himself, Mackenzie, on the advice of the Lord of Fairburn, erected the  priest constable of the castle. This did not suit the Maclennans, and, as  soon as Mackenzie left the country, they, one Sabbath morning, as the  priest was coming home from church, `sends a man in ambush in his road  who shot him with an arrow in the buttocks, so that he fell.  The ambusher thinking him killed, and perceiving others coming after the priest that  road, made his escape, and he (the priest) was carried to his boat alive.   Of  this priest are all the Murchisons in thise countries descended.&quot;--Ancient  MS.] whereupon &quot;ane certain female, foster-sister of his, composed a  Gaelic rhyme to commemorate him.&quot; The Earl of Cromartie gives as the  reason for this imprisonment and murder that, according to rumour John  Glassich intended to prosecute his father&#x27;s claim to the Kintail estates, and  Kenneth hearing of this sent for him to Brahan, John came suspecting  nothing, accompanied only by his ordinary servants.  Kenneth questioned him regarding the suspicious rumours in circulation, and not being quite  satisfied with the answers, he caused John Glassich to be at once  apprehended.  One of John&#x27;s servants, named John Gearr, seeing his  master thus inveigled, struck at Kenneth of Kintail a fearful blow with a two-handed sword, but fortunately Kenneth, who was standing close to the  table, nimbly moved aside, and the blow missed him, else he would have  been cloven to pieces.  The sword made a deep cut in the table, &quot;so that  you could hide your hand edgeways in it,&quot; and the mark remained in the  table until Colin, first Earl of Seaforth, &quot;caused cut that piece off the table, saying that he loved no such remembrance of the quarrels of his relations.&quot;  Kenneth was a man of good endowments &quot;he carried so prudently that he had the good-liking of his prince and peace from his  neighbours.&quot;  He had a peculiar genius for mechanics, and was seldom  found without his corc--&quot;sgian dubh&quot;--or some other such tool in his  hand, with which he produced excellent specimens of hand-carving on  wood. He married early, during his father&#x27;s lifetime, Lady Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of John, second  Earl of Athol, by his wife, Lady Mary  Campbell, daughter of Archibald, second, and sister of Colin, third Earl of  Argyll, and by her had three sons and several daughters-- I.  Murdoch, who, being fostered in the house of Bayne of Tulloch, was presented by that gentleman on his being sent home, with a goodly  stock of milch cows and the grazing of Strathvaich, but he died before he attained majority. II.  Colin, who succeeded his father. III.  Roderick, who received the lands of Redcastle and became the progenitor of the family of that name. IV.  Janet, who as his third wife married, first, Aeneas Macdonald, VII. of Glengarry, with issue--a daughter Elizabeth, who married John Roy Mackenzie, IV. of Gairloch.  She married secondly, Alexander Chisholm, XIV. of Chisholm, with issue. V.  Catherine, who, as his second wife, married Alexander  Ross, IX.  of Balnagown, with issue--one son Nicholas Alexander, who died on  the 21st of October, 1592. VI.  Agnes, who married Lachlan Mor Mackintosh of Mackintosh,  [The following anecdote is related of this match:--Lachlan Mackintosh, being only an infant when his father, William Mackintosh of that ilk, was murdered in 1550, was carried for safety by some of his humble retainers  to the county of Ross.  This came to the knowledge of Colin, younger of  Kintail, who took possession of the young heir of Mackintosh, and carried him to Ellandonnan Castle.  The old chief retained him, and treated him  with great care until the years of pupilarity had expired, and then married  him to his daughter Agnes, by no means an unsuitable match for either,  apart from the time and manner in which it was consummated.] with  issue. VII.  A daughter who married Walter Urquhart of Cromarty. VIII.  A daughter who married Robert Munro of Fowlis. IX.  A daughter who married Innes of Inverbreackie. By Kenneth&#x27;s marriage to Lady Elizabeth Stewart, the Royal blood of the Plantaganets was introduced into the Family of Kintail, and it was afterwards strengthened and the strain further continued by the marriage  of Kenneth&#x27;s son, Colin Cam, to Barbara Grant of Grant, daughter of Lady  Marjory Stewart, daughter of John, third Earl of Athol. By the inter-marriages of his children Kenneth left his house singularly powerful in family alliances, and as has been already seen he in  1554 derived very substantial benefits from them himself. He died at  Killin on the 6th of June, 1568, and was burried at Beauly.  He was  succeeded by his second and eldest surviving son, XI.  COLIN  CAM  MACKENZIE, Or COLIN  THE  ONE-EYED, who very early became a special favourite at Court, particularly with the King himself; so much, the Earl of  Cromartie says, that &quot;there was none in the North for whom he hade a  greater esteem than for this Colin.  He made him one of his Privie  Councillors, and oft tymes invited him to be nobilitate (ennobled); but  Colin always declined it, aiming rather to have his familie remarkable for  power, as it were, above their qualitie than for titles that equalled their  power.&quot;  We find that &quot;in 1570 King James VI. granted to Coline  Makcainze, the son and apparent heir of the deceased Canzeoch of  Kintaill, permission to be served heir in his minority to all the lands and  rents in the Sheriffdom of Innerness, in which his father died last vest and  seised.  In 1572 the same King confirmed a grant made by Colin  Makcanze of Kintaill to Barbara Graunt, his affianced spouse, in  fulfilment of a contract between him and John Grant of Freuchie, dated  25th April 1571, of his lands of Climbo, Keppach, and Ballichon, Mekle Innerennet, Derisduan Beg, Little Innerennet, Derisduan Moir, Auchadrein, Kirktoun, Ardtulloch, Rovoch, Quhissil, Tullych, Derewall  and Nuik, Inchchro, Morowoch, Glenlik, Innersell and Nuik, Ackazarge,  Kinlochbeancharan, and  Innerchonray, in  the Earldom of Ross, and  Sheriffdom of Inverness.   In 1574 the same Colin was served heir to his  father Kenneth  M&#x27;Keinzie in the davach of Letterfernane, the davach of  Glenshall, and other lands in the barony of Ellendonane of the old extent of five marks.&quot; [Origines Parechiales Scotia, p. 393, vol, ii.] On the 15th of April, 1569, Colin, along with Alexander Ross of  Balnagown, Lachlan  Mackintosh of Mackintosh, Walter Urquhart of  Cromarty, Robert Munro of Fowlis, Hugh Rose of Kilravock, and several  others, signed a bond of allegiance to James VI. and to James Earl of  Murray as Regent.  On the 21st of June, in the same year, before the Lord Regent and the Privy Council, Colin  promised and obliged himself to  cause Torquil Macleod of Lewis to obtain sufficient letters of slams from the master, wife, bairns, and principal kin and friends of the umquhile  John Mac Ian Mhoir, and on the said letters of slams being obtained  Robert Munro of Fowlis promised and obliged himself to deliver to the  said Torquil or Colin the sum of two hundred merks consigned in Robert  Munro&#x27;s hands by certain merchants in Edinburgh for the assithment of slaughters committed at Lochcarron in connection with the fishings in that  Loch.  On the 1st of August, 1569, Colin signs a decree arbitral between  himself and Donald Gormeson Macdonald, sixth of Sleat, the full text of  which will be found at pp. 185-88 of Mackenzie&#x27;s History of the  Macdonalds and Lords of the Isles. In 1570 a quarrel broke out between the Mackenzies and the  Munros. Leslie, the celebrated Bishop of Ross, who had been secretary to Queen Mary, dreading the effect of public feeling against prelacy in  the North, and against himself personally, made over to his cousin Leslie of  Balquhair, his rights and titles to the Chanonry of Ross, together with the  castle lands, in order to divest them of the character of church property,  and so save them to his family but notwithstanding this grant, the Regent Murray gave the custody of the castle to Andrew Munro of Milntown, a  rigid presbyterian, and in high favour with Murray, who promised Leslie  some of the lands of the barony of Fintry in Buchan as an equivalent but  the Regent died before this arrangement was carried out--before Munro obtained titles to the castle and castle lands as he expected.  Yet he  ultimately obtained permission from the Earl of Lennox, during his  regency, and afterwards from the Earl of Mar, his successor in that office,  to get possession of the castle. The Mackenzies were by no means pleased to see the Munros  occupying the stronghold; and, desirous to obtain possession of it  themselves, they purchased Leslie&#x27;s right, by virtue of which they  demanded delivery of the castle.  This was at once refused by the Munros. Kintail raised his vassals, and, joined by a detachment of the Mackintoshes, [In the year 1573, Lachlan More, Laird of Mackintosh, favouring Kintail, his brother-in law, required all the people of Strathnairn  to join him against the Munros.  Colin, Lord of Lorn had at the time the  adminstration of that lordship as the jointure lands of his wife, the  Countesa Dowager of Murray, and he wrote to Hugh Rose of Kilravock:--&quot;My Baillie off Strathnarne, for as much as it is reported to me that  Mackintosh has charged all my tenants west of the water of Naim to pass  forward with him to Ross to enter into this troublous action with  Mackenzie against the Laird of Fowlis, and because I will not that any of mine enter presently this matter whose service appertains to me,  wherefore I will desire you to make my will known to my tenants at  Strathnarne within your Bailliary, that none of them take upon hand to rise  at this present with Mackintosh to pass to Ross, or at any time hereafter without my special command and goodwill obtained under such pains,&quot; etc.  (Dated) Darnoway, 28th of June, 1573.--Kilravock Writs, p.263.]  garrisoned the steeple of the Cathedral Church, and laid siege to Irvine&#x27;s  Tower and the Palace.  The Munros held out for three years, but one day  the garrison becoming short of provisions, they attempted a sortie to the Ness of Fortrose, where there was at the time a salmon stell, the contents  of which they attempted to secure.  They were commanded  by John   Munro, grandson of George, fourth laird of Fowlis, who was killed at the  battle of &quot;Bealach-nam-Brog.&quot;  They, were immediately discovered, and quickly followed by the Mackenzies, under lain Dubh Mac Ruairidh Mhic  Alastair, who fell upon the starving Munros, and, after a desperate  struggle, killed twenty-six of their number, among whom was their  commander, while the victors only sustained a loss of two men killed and  three or four wounded.  The remaining defenders of the castle  immediately capitulated, and it was taken possession of by the  Mackenzies.  Subsequently it was confirmed to the Baron of Kintail by  King James VI. [Sir Robert Gordon, p. 154, and MS. Histories of the  Family.]  Roderick Mor Mackenzie of Redcastle seems to have been the  leading spirit in this affair.  The following document, dated at Holyrood House, the 12th of September 1573, referring to the matter will prove  interesting-- Anent our Sovereign Lord&#x27;s letters raised at the instance of Master  George Munro, making mention:--that whereas he is lawfully provided to  the Chancellory of Ross by his Highness&#x27;s presentation, admission to the  Kirk, and the Lords&#x27; decree thereupon, and has obtained letters in all the  four forms thereupon and therewith has caused charge the tenants and  intromitters with the teind sheaves thereof, to make him and his factors  payment; and in the meantime Rory Mackenzie, brother to Colin  Mackenzie of Kintail, having continual residence in the steeple of the  Chanonry of Ross, which he caused to be built not only to oppress the  country with masterful theft, sorning, and daily oppression, but also for suppressing of the word of God which was always preached in the said  Kirk preceding his entry thereto, which is now become a filthy stye and  den of thieves; has masterfully and violently with a great force of oppression, come to the tenants indebted in payment of the said Mr George&#x27;s benefice aforesaid and has masterfully reft them of all and whole  the fruits thereof; and so he having no other refuge for obtaining of the said benefice, was compelled to denounce the said whole tenants rebels  and put them to the horn, as the said letters and execution thereof more  fully purports; and further is compelled for fear of the said Mr George&#x27;s life to remain from his vocation whereunto God has called him.  And  anent the charge given to the said Rory Mackenzie to desist and cease  from all intromitting, uptaking, molesting or troubling of the said Mr  George&#x27;s tenants of his benefice above-written for any fruits or duties  thereof, otherwise than is ordered by law, or else to have compeared  before my Lord Regent&#x27;s grace and Lords of Secret Council at a certain day bypast, and show a reasonable cause why the same should not be done; under the pain of rebellion and putting him to the horn, with certification to him, and he failing, letters would be directed simpliciter to  put him to the horn, like as is at more length contained in the said letters,  execution and endorsement thereof. Which being called, the said Master  George compeared personally, and the said Rory Mackenzie oftimes  called and not compearing, my Lord Regent&#x27;s grace, with advise of the  Lords of Secret Council, ordained letters to be directed to officers of arms,  Sheriffs in that part, to denounce the said Rory Mackenzie our Sovereign  Lord&#x27;s rebel and put him to the horn and to escheat and bring in all his moveable goods to his Highness&#x27;s use for his contempt. [Records of the  Privy Council.] In December of the same year Colin has to provide cautioners, for things laid to his charge, to the amount of ten thousand pounds, that he  shall remain within four miles of Edinburgh, and eastward as far as the  town of Dunbar, and that he shall appear before the Council on a notice of  forty-eight hours.  On the 6th of February following other cautioners bind  themselves to enter him in Edinburgh on the 20th of May, 1574,  remaining there until relieved, under a penalty of ten thousand pounds.   He is entered to keep ward in Edinburgh on the 1st March, 1575, and is  bound to appear before the Council when required under a similar penalty.    On the 10th of April following he signs a bond that Alexander Ross shall  appear before the Lords when required to do so.  On the 25th of May,  1575, at Chanonry, Robert Munro of Fowlis and Walter Urquhart, Sheriff of Cromarty, bind  themselves their  heirs, and successors, under a penalty  of five thousand pounds, that they shall on a month&#x27;s notice enter and  present Roderick Mor Mackenzie of Redcastle before the King and the  Privy Council and that he shall remain while lawful entry be taken of him,  and that he shall keep good rule in his country in the meantime.  On the  same day Colin, his brother, &quot;of his own free motive will&quot; binds himself  and his heirs to relieve and keep these gentlemen scaithless of the amount  of this obligation.  He is one of several Highland chiefs charged by the  Regent and the Privy Council on the 19th of February; 1577-78, to defend  Donald Mac Angus of Glengarry from an expected invasion of his  territories by sea and land. [Register of the Privy Council.] The disturbed state of the country was such, in 1573, that the Earl  of Sutherland petitioned to be served heir to his estates, at Aberdeen, as he  could not get a jury together to sit at  Inverness, &quot;in consequence of the  barons, such as Colin Mackenzie of Kintail, Hugh Lord Lovat, Lachlan  Mackintosh of Dunachton, and Robert Munro of Fowlis, being at deadly  feud among themselves.&quot; [Antiquarian Notes, p. 79] In 1580 a desperate quarrel broke out between the Mackenzies and Macdonalds of Glengarry.  The Chief of Glengarry inherited part of Lochalsh, Lochcarron, and Lochbroom, from his grandmother, Margaret, one of the sisters and co-heiresses of Sir Donald Macdonald of Lochalsh,  and grand-daughter of Celestine of the Isles. Kenneth, during his father&#x27;s  life, had acquired the other part by purchase from Dingwall of Kildun, son  of the other co-heiress of Sir Donald, on the 24th November, 1554, and  Queen Mary confirmed the grant by Royal charter.  Many causes leading  to disputes and feuds can easily be imagined with such men in close  proximity.  Glengarry and his followers &quot;sorned&quot; on Mackenzie&#x27;s tenants,  not only in the immediate vicinity of his own property of Lochcarron, but also during their raids from Glengarry, on the outskirts of Kintail, and thus  Mackenzie&#x27;s dependants were continually harrassed by Glengarry&#x27;s  cruelty and ill-usage.  His own tenants in Lochalsh and Lochcarron fared  little better, particularly the Mathesons in the former, and the Clann Ian  Uidhir in the latter, who were the original possessors of Glengarry&#x27;s lands  in that district.  These tribes, finding themselves in such abject slavery,  though they regularly paid their rents and other dues, and seeing how  kindly Mackenzie used the neighbouring tenantry, envied their more comfortable state and &quot;abhorred Glengarry&#x27;s rascality, who would lie in  their houses (yea, force their women and daughters) so long as there was  any good to be given, which made them keep better amity and  correspondence with Mackenzie and his tenants than with their own  master and his  followers.  This may partly teach how superiors ought  always to govern and oversee their tenantry and followers, especially in  the Highlands, who were ordinarily made up of several clans, and will not readily underlie such slavery as the Incountry Commons will do.&quot; The  first serious outbreak between the Glengarry Macdonalds and the Mackenzies originated thus:  One Duncan Mac Ian Uidhir Mhic Dhonnachaidh, known as &quot;a very honest gentleman,&quot; who, in his early days, lived under Glengarry, and was a very good deerstalker and an  excellent shot, often resorted to the forest of Glasletter, then the property  of Mackenzie of Gairloch, where he killed many of the deer.  Some time  afterwards, Duncan was, in consequence of certain troubles in his own  country, obliged to leave, and he, with all his family and goods, took up his quarters in Glen Affrick, close to the forest.  Soon after, he went,  accompanied by a friend, to the nearest hill, and began his favourite  pursuit of deerstalking. Mackenzie&#x27;s forester perceiving the stranger, and  knowing him as an old poacher, cautiously walked up, came upon him  unawares, and demanded that he should at once surrender himself and his  arms. Duncan, finding that Gairloch&#x27;s forester was only accompanied by one gillie, &quot;thought it an irrecoverable affront that he and his man should  so yield, and refused to do so on any terms, whereupon the forester being ill-set, and remembering former abuses in their passages,&quot; he and his  companion killed the poachers, and buried them in the hill.  Fionnla Dubh Mac Dhomh&#x27;uill Mhoir and Donald Mac Ian Leith, the latter a native of  Gairloch, were suspected of the crime, but it was never proved against  them, though they were both several times put on their trial by the barons  of Kintail and Gairloch. About two years after the murder was committed, Duncan&#x27;s bones were discovered by one of his friends, who had continued all the time  diligently to search for him.  The Macdonalds always suspected foul play, and this having now been placed beyond question by the discovery of the  bodies of the victims, a party of them started, determined to revenge the death of their clansman; and, arriving at Inchlochell, Glenstrathfarrar, then  the property of Rory Mor Mackenzie of Redcastle, they found Duncan  Mac Ian Mhic Dhomh&#x27;uill Mhoir, a brother of the suspected Finlay Dubh,  without any fear of approaching danger, busily engaged ploughing his  patch of land, and they at once attacked and killed him.  The renowned  Rory Mor, hearing of the murder of his tenant, at once despatched a  messenger to Glengarry demanding redress and the punishment of the  assassins, but Glengarry refused.  Rory was, however, determined to have satisfaction, and he resolved, against the counsel of his friends, to have  retribution for this and previous injuries at once and as best he could. Having thus decided, he at once sent for his friend, Dugall Mackenzie of  Applecross, to consult him as to the best mode of procedure to ensure  success. Glengarry lived at the time in the Castle of Strone, Lochcarron, and, after consultation, the two Mackenzies resolved to use every means  in their power to capture him, or some of his nearest relatives.  For this  purpose Dugall suggested a plan by which he thought he would induce the  unsuspecting Glengarry to meet him on a certain day at Kishorn.  Rory  Mor, to avoid any suspicion, was to start at once for Lochbroom, under  cloak of attending to his interests there; and if Macdonald agreed to meet  Dugall at Kishorn, he would immediately send notice of the day to Rory.   No sooner had Dugall arrived at home than, to carry out this plan, he  dispatched a messenger to Glengarry informing him that he had matters of  great importance to communicate to him, and that he wished, for that purpose, to meet him on any day which he might deem suitable. Day and place were soon appointed, and Dugall at once sent a  messenger, as arranged, with full particulars of the proposed meeting to  Rory Mor, who instantly gathered his friends, the Clann Allan, and  marched them to Lochcarron.  On his arrival, he had a meeting with  Donald Mac Ian Mhic Ian Uidhir, and Angus Mac Eachainn, both of the  Clann Ian Uidhir, and closely allied to Glengarry by blood and marriage,  and living on his lands.  &quot;Yet notwithstanding this alliance, they, fearing  his, and his rascality&#x27;s further oppression, were content to join Rory in the  plot.&quot;  The appointed day having arrived, Glengarry and his lady (a  daughter of the Captain of Clan Ranald, he having. previously sent away  his lawfull wife, a daughter of the laird of Grant) came by sea to Kishorn. He and Dugall Mackenzie having conferred together for some time discussing matters of importance to each as neighbours, Glengarry took  his leave, but while being convoyed to his boat, Dugall suggested the  impropriety of his going home by sea in such a clumsy boat, when he had  only a distance of two miles to walk, and if he did not suspect his own  inability to make the lady comfortable for the night, he would be glad to provide for her and see her home safely next morning.  Macdonald  declined the proffered hospitality to his lady.  He sent her home by the  boat, accompanied by four of his followers, and told Dugall that he would not endanger the boat by overloading, but that he and the remainder of his  gentlemen and followers would go home on foot. Rory Mor had meanwhile placed his men in ambush in a place still called Glaic nan Gillean.  Glengarry and his train, on their way to Strone  Castle, came upon them without the slightest suspicion, when they were  suddenly surrounded by Rory&#x27;s followers, and called upon to surrender.   Seeing this, one of the Macdonalds shot an arrow at Redcastle, which  fixed in the fringe of his plaid, when his followers, thinking their leader  had been mortally wounded furiously attacked the Macdonalds; but Rory  commanded his friends, under pain of death, to save the life of Glengarry,  who, seeing he had no chance of escape, and hearing Redcastle&#x27;s orders to his men, threw away his sword, and ran into Rory Mor&#x27;s arms, begging that his life might be spared.  This was at once granted to him, but not a  single one of his men escaped from Redcastle&#x27;s infuriated followers, who  started the same night, taking Glengarry along with him, for Lochbroom. Even this did not satisfy the cruel disposition of Donald Mac Ian Mhic Ian Uidhir and Angus Mac Eachainn, who had an old grudge against their chief, Glengarry, his father having some time previously evicted their  father from Attadale, Lochcarron, to which they claimed a right.  They,  under silence of night, gathered all the Clann Ian Uidhir, and proceeded to  Arinaskaig and Dalmartin, where lived at the time three uncles of  Glengarry--Gorrie, Rorie, and Ronald--whom they, with all their  retainers, killed on the spot. &quot;This murder was undoubtedly unknown to  Rory or any of the Mackenzies, though alleged otherwise; for as soon as  his nephew, Colin of Kintail, and his friends heard of this accident, they  were much concerned, and would have him (Rory) set Glengarry at liberty but all their persuasions would not do tell he was secured of him by writ and oath, that he and his would never pursue this accident either legally or  unlegally, and which, as was said, he never intended  to do, till seventeen  years thereafter, when, in 1597, the children of these three uncles of  Glengarry arrived at manhood,&quot; determined, as will be seen hereafter, to  revenge their father&#x27;s death. [Ancient and Ardintoul MSS.] Gregory, however, says (p. 219) that after his liberation, Glengarry complained to the Privy Council, who, investigating the matter, caused the  Castle of Strone, which Macdonald yielded to Mackenzie as one of the  conditions of his release, to be placed under the temporary custody of the  Earl of Argyll and Mackenzie of Kintail was detained at Edinburgh in  open ward to answer such charges as might be brought against him.  [Records of Privy Council of date 10th August and 2d December 1582;  11th January and 8th March 1582-3.] In 1586 King James VI. granted a  remission to &quot;Colin M&#x27;Kainzie of Kintaill and Rodoric M&#x27;Kainzie of  Auchterfailie&quot; (Redcastle), &quot;his brother, for being art and part in `the cruel   murder of Rodoric M&#x27;Allester in  Stroll; Gorie M&#x27;Allester, his brother, in  Stromcraig; Ronnald M&#x27;Gorie, the son of the latter; John Roy M&#x27;Allane v&#x27; Allester, in Pitnean; John Dow M&#x27;Allane v&#x27; Allester, in Kirktoun of  Lochcarroun; Alexander M&#x27;Allanroy, servitor of the deceased Rodoric; Sir  John Monro in Lochbrume; John Monro, his son; John Monro Hucheoun,  and the rest of their accomplices, under silence of night, upon the lands of  Ardmanichtyke, Dalmartene, Kirktoun of Lochcarroun, Blahat, and other  parts within the baronies of Lochcarroun, Lochbrume, Ros, and Kessane,  in the Sheriffdom of Innerness,&quot; and for all their other past crimes,  [Origines Parochiales Scotia and Retours.] During Colin&#x27;s reign Huntly obtained a commission of fire and sword against Mackintosh of Mackintosh, and reduced him to such a condition that he had to remove with all his family and friends for better  security to the Island of Moy.  Huntly, having determined to crush him,  came to Inverness and prepared a fleet of boats with which to besiege the island.  These preparations having been completed, and the boats ready to be drawn across the hills from Inverness to Moy, Mackenzie, who had  been advised of Huntly&#x27;s intentions, despatched a messenger--John  Mackenzie of Kinnock--to Inverness, to ask his Lordship to be as  favourable as possible to his sister, Mackintosh of Mackintosh&#x27;s wife, and  to treat her as a gentlewoman ought to be treated when he came to Moy,  and that he (Colin) would consider it as an act of personal courtesy to himself.  The messenger delivered his message, to which Huntly replied,  that if it were his good fortune, as he doubted not it would be, to  apprehend her husband and her, &quot;she would be the worst used lady in the  North; that she was an ill instrument against his cause, and therefore he would cut her tail above her houghs.&quot; &quot;Well, then,&quot; answered Kinnock,  &quot;he (Kintail) bade me tell your Lordship if that were your answer, that  perhaps he or his would be there to have a better care of her.&quot;  &quot;I do not  value his being there more than herself&quot; Huntly replied, &quot;and tell him so much from me.&quot;  The messenger departed, when some of Huntly&#x27;s  principal officers who heard the conversation remonstrated with his  Lordship for sending the Mackenzie chief so uncivil an answer, as he  might have cause to regret it if that gentleman took it amiss.  Kinnock on  his arrival at Brahan, told his master what had occurred, and delivered  Huntly&#x27;s rude message.  Colin, who was at the time in delicate health, sent  for his brother, Rory Mor of Redcastle, and sent him next day across the  ferry of Ardersier with a force of four hundred warriors.  These he  marched straight through the hills; and just as Huntly, on his way from  Inverness, was coming in sight, on the west of Moy, Rory and his  followers were marching along the face of the hill on the east side of the  Island, when his Lordship, perceiving such a large force, asked his officers who they could be.  One of them, present during the interview with Mackenzie&#x27;s messenger on the previous day, answered, &quot;Yonder is the effect of your answer to Mackenzie.&quot;  &quot; I wonder,&quot; replied Huntly, &quot;how  he could have so many men ready almost in an instant.&quot;  The officer  replied, &quot;Their leader is so active and fortunate that his men will flock to  him from all parts on a moment&#x27;s notice when he has any ado.  And before  you gain Mackintosh or his lady you will lose more than he is worth, since  now, as it seems, her friends take part in the quarrel;&quot; whereupon the Earl  retired with his forces to Inverness, &quot;so that it seemed fitter to Huntly to  agree their differs friendly than prosecute the laws further against Mackintosh.&quot; There is a complaint to the Privy Council by Christian  Scrymgeour, relict of the late Alexander, Bishop of Ross, dated 24th  January, 1578-9, in which it is stated that Colin not only stopped and debarred her late spouse from having fuel and &quot;elding&quot; to his dwelling  house in the Chanonry of Ross, where he made his residence last summer,  but stopped him also from victuals to his house, using such unhuman and  cruel dealings against him that he fell sick and never recovered &quot;till he departed this life.&quot;  During the illness of the bishop in December preceding, Colin and others &quot;of his special sending&quot; enclosed the house of the  Chanonry and debarred the complainer and her husband of meat and drink  and all other relief of company or comfort of neighbours and friends, and how soon he had intelligence of the bishop&#x27;s approaching his death he laid  ambushes of armed men within the town of Chanonry and in the neighbourhood and apprehended several of the bishop&#x27;s and dean&#x27;s servants, whom he carried &quot;immediately to the said Colin&#x27;s house of the  Redcastle,&quot; and there detained them for twenty-four hours. Further, on the  22nd of September preceding, the bishop being at the extreme point of  death, Colin with an armed following in great numbers, came to the castle and house of the Chanonry and by force and violence entered therein and  put the said Christian Scrymgeour, the bishop&#x27;s wife, and his servants,  children, and household out of the same, intromitted with their goods and gear and constrained them to leave the country by sea, not suffering them to get meat, drink. or lodging, in the town, nor letting them take away with them of their own gear as much as a plaid or blanket to protect the  children from cold in the boat, &quot;committing thair throw such cruel and  barbarous oppression upon them as the like has not been heard of in any  realm or country subject to justice or the authority of a Sovereign  Prince.&quot; Colin did not appear to answer this complaint, and he and his chief abettors were denounced rebels, put to the horn and escheated. On the same day, there is a complaint by Henry Lord Methven, in which it is stated that although his Lordship &quot;has by gift of His Highness  to him, his heirs and assignees, the gift of all and whole the temporality of  the Bishopric of Ross, and of the castle, house, and place of the Chanonry  of Ross, now vacant in our Sovereign Lord&#x27;s hands by the decease of the  late Alexander, last Bishop of Ross, of all years and terms to come, aye  and till the lawful provision of a lawful bishop and pastor to the said  bishopric,&quot; and although it is &quot;specially provided by Act of Parliament  that whatsoever person or persons takes any bishop&#x27;s places, castles, or strengths, or enters by their own authority to hold them without his  Highness&#x27; command, letters or charges, shall incur the crimes of treason  and lesemajesty,&quot; yet, &quot;Colin  Mackenzie of Kintail, in proud and high  contempt of his Majesty&#x27;s said loveable law and Act of Parliament, and of his Highness now having the administration of the Government of the  realm in his own person, lately, upon the 22nd day of September last  bypast, in the very hour of the death of the said late Alexander, Bishop of  Ross, or shortly thereafter beset and enclosed the said castle, house, and  place of the Chanonry of Ross, took the same by force and as yet detains  and holds the same as a house of war and will not render and deliver the  same to the said Lord Methven.&#x27;  Mackenzie was duly charged to give up possession of the castle and place or take the consequences.  Lord Methven appeared personally, but Colin did not, where-upon their Lordships ordained letters to be directed to him charging him to give them  up. &quot;with the whole munition and ordnance therein&quot; to Henry Lord  Methven or to any other having power to receive them, within twenty-four  hours of the charge under the pain of treason. The following complaint by Donald Mac Angus of Glengarry laid  before the Privy Council at Dalkeith on 10th of August, 1582, is that gentleman&#x27;s version of his apprehension by Roderick Mor Mackenzie of  Redcastle and Dugall Mackenzie of Kishorn, as described from family  MSS. at pp. 156-59.  Glengarry&#x27;s complaint proceeds-- After the great slaughters, herschips, and skaiths, committed upon him, his kin, friends, and servants upon the last day of February the year of  God 1581 years, estimate worth six score thousand pounds money of this  realm or thereby, and on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth days  of March last bypast thereafter by Rory Mackenzie, brother-german to  Colin Mackenzie of Kintail, Dugald Mackenzie, his brother and the  remainder of their colleagues and company, to the number of two hundred  persons, armed with two-handed swords, bows, darlochis, hagbutts,  pistols, prohibited to be worn or used, and other offensive weapons who  also upon the sixteenth day of April last bypast or thereby, came upon the said complainant he being within his own &quot;rowmes&quot; and country of Lochcarron having mind of no evil or injury to have been done to him nor  none of his, but thinking to have lived under God&#x27;s peace and our  Sovereign Lord, and then not only took himself captive, kept and detained him prisoner in coves, craigs, woods, and other desert places at their  pleasure wherethrough none of his kin nor friends had access to him for  the space of fourteen days or thereby, but also in the meantime took and  apprehended the late Rory MacAlister, father&#x27;s brother to the said  complainant, and three of their sons and other of his friends and servants  to the number of 33 persons or thereby, bound their hands with their own shirts, and cruelly and unmercifully, under promise of safety of their lives,  caused murder and slay them with dirks, appointing that they should not  be buried as Christian men, but cast forth and eaten by dogs and swine.&quot; Further, &quot;at the end of the said complainant&#x27;s captivity and detention in the manner aforesaid, being delivered by the foresaid person, his takers  and detainers, to Colin Mackenzie of Kintail, both he and they, being  armed in warlike manner as said is, upon the 24th day of the said month of  April, came to the said complainant&#x27;s town and lands of Strome, where  they also carried him  captive with  them and theirs, by hostility and way  of deed, spoiled and reft the whole goods, gear, and plenishing therein and besieged his house and Castle of Strome, threatening his friends and  servants therein that if they rendered not the same to them they would  hang the said complainant in their sight compelling him and his said  friends therefor and for safety of his life to yield to the said persons&#x27; tyrranous desires and appetites, and render to them the said castle, which  they not only wrongfully detained and withheld from him, but also  through occasion thereof still insists in their cruelty and inhumanity  against the said complainant, his kin and friends.  Like as lately, about the  end of July last, the said Colin Mackenzie Rory Mackenzie, and others aforesaid, having violently taken Donald MacMoroch Roy, one of the said  complainant&#x27;s chief kinsmen, and were not content to put him to a simple  death, but to bait them in his blood, and by a strange example to satisfy their cruel and unnatural hearts, first cut off his hands, next his feet, and  last his head, and having cast the same in a &quot;peitpott,&quot; exposed and laid out his carcase to be a prey for dogs and ravenous beasts:  Tending by  such kind of dealing to undo as many of the said complainant&#x27;s friends  and servants as they can apprehend, and to lay waste their lands,  &quot;rowmes,&quot; and possessions to the said complainant&#x27;s heavy hurt and  skaith, and dangerous example of wicked persons to attempt the like, if  remedy be not provided.&quot;  In consequence of this complaint charges had gone forth to Colin Mackenzie of Kintail, (1), to have rendered the said  Castle of Strome with the munition and goods therein to the complainer or his representatives, within twenty-four hours after being charged, under  pain of rebellion. or else to have appeared and shown cause to the  contrary; (2) to have appeared and found sufficient surety in the Books of  the Council for the safety of the complainer and his dependants in persons  and goods, or else shown cause to the contrary, under the same pain.  And now, &quot;the said Angus Mac Angus compeared personally and the said  Colin Mackenzie of Kintail being oftimes called and not compearing, the Lords (1) repeat their charge for delivery of the castle within twenty-four  hours, and, failing obedience, order Mackenzie of Kintail to be denounced rebel and put to the horn and to escheat; (2) repeat their charge to the said   Mackenzie to find sufficient caution for the safety of the complainer and his dependants in person and goods, with order that if he fail to do so  within fifteen days after being charged, he shall, for that default also, be  denounced rebel and put to the horn.&quot; On the 2nd of December, 1582, Colin finds caution in the sum of  two thousand merks that he shall deliver up Strome Castle, Lochcarron, to Donald Mac Angus of Glengarry,  in  the event of the Privy Council  finding that he should do so. Shortly after this the aspect of affairs is changed.  On the 11th of  January, 1582-83, the decree against Mackenzie for the surrender of  Strome Castle to Donald Macdonald of Glengarry is reversed. He  petitions the Privy Council and gives an entirely different complexion to the facts of the case against him to those submitted by Glengarry to the  Council.  He complains of Donald Mac Angus for having &quot;upon a certain   sinister and malicious narration&quot; obtained a decree against him charging  him upon pain of rebellion to deliver up the Castle of Strome, and to  appear before the Privy Council, on the 4th of August preceding, to find  caution that Glengarry and his friends should be kept harmless of him in  their persons and goods, and then makes the following statement:-- The officer, alleged executor of the said letters (against him), neither charged thc said Colin personally nor at his dwelling house, neither yet came any such charge to his knowledge.  Yet he hearing tell  somewhat thereof by the &quot;bruit&quot; of the country, he, for obedience of the  same, directed Alexander Mackenzie, his servant and procurator, to our  Burgh of Perth, where his Majesty was resident for the time, who from the same fourth of August, being the peremptory day of compearance, as well  there as at Ruthven, attended continually upon the calling of the said  letters till the Council dissolved, and that his Majesty passed to Dunkeld  to the hunting.  Like as immediately thereafter the said Alexander repaired  to the Burgh of Edinburgh, where he likewise awaited a certain space  thereafter when Council should have been, and the said letters should have  been called but perceiving no number of Council neither there nor actually  with his Majesty, he looked for no calling of the said letters nor  proceeding thereuntil, but that the same should have (been), deserted,  because the day was peremptory, at the least till he should have been of  new warned and heard in presence of his Highness and his Council to have  shown a reasonable cause why no such letters should be granted  simpliciter upon the said Colin to the effect above-written.  Not-withstanding for by his expectation, he being resident for the time in  Edinburgh, where he looked that the said matter should have been called, the said other letters were upon the tenth day of the said month of August  last, by moyen of the said Donald Mac Angus, called at the Castle of  Dalkeith, and there, for the said Colin&#x27;s alleged non-compearance, as he is  surely informed, decree was pronounced in the said matter and letters  ordained to be directed simpliciter against him.&quot;  Had his said servant,  then still in Edinburgh, been made aware of this meeting of Council at  Dalkeith, &quot;he would not have failed to have compeared, and had many  good and sufficient reasons and defences to have staid all giving of the  said letters simpliciter;&quot; such as that &quot;the said Colin received the said castle and fortalice of Strome by virtue of a contract passed betwixt him and the said Donald, wherein he was content and consented that the said  castle should remain in the said Colin&#x27;s hands and keeping unto the time  he had fulfilled certain other articles and clauses mentioned and contained  in the same contract;&quot; also &quot;that the said Colin was charged, by virtue of  letters passed by deliverance of the Lords of Session, to render and deliver  the said castle and fortalice of Strome to John Grant of Freuchie, as  pertaining to him in heritage, within a certain space after the charge, under the said pain of horning, so that, he being doubly charged, he is uncertain  to whom to render the said castle.&quot;  Moreover, for the satisfaction of the  King and the Lords of Council, &quot;the said Colin has found caution to render  and deliver the said castle and fortalice to the said Donald, if it shall be  found by his Highness and the said Lords that he ought to do the same.&quot;   For these reasons it is argued that the said decree and letters issued against  him ought to be suspended. Charge having been made to the said Donald Mac Angus to appear to this complaint and demand, &quot;both the said parties compeared personally,&quot; and the Lords after hearing them, &quot;suspended the foresaid  letters pur chased by the said Donald Mac Angus, effect thereof, and  process of horning contained therein, and all that has followed thereupon,  upon the said Colin simpliciter in time coming,&quot; the ground for this  decision being that &quot;the said Colin has found security acted in the books of Secret Council that the said castle and fortalice of Strome, committed to him in keeping by the King&#x27;s Majesty and Lords of Secret Council,  shall be rendered and delivered again to such person or persons as shall be  appointed by the King&#x27;s Majesty to receive the same, as the keepers  thereof shall be required thereto upon six days&#x27; warning, under the pain of  ten thousand merks&quot; and meanwhile, under the same pains, that none of  the King&#x27;s subjects shall be &quot;invaded, troubled, molested, nor persecuted,&quot;  by those who keep the castle for him, or by others resorting thither. There  is, however, this proviso-- That, in case the said Colin shall at any time hereafter sue of the  King&#x27;s Majesty to be disburdened of the keeping of the said castle, and  that some person may be appointed to receive the same out of his hands  and keeping within the space of twenty days next after his said Suit, which  notwithstanding shall happen to be refused and not done by his Highness  within the said space, that in that case he nor his cautioner be anywise  answerable thereafter for the said house and keeping thereof, but to be  free of the same, and these presents to annul and to have no further force,  effect, nor execution, against them at any time thereafter except that the  same house shall happen to be kept by the said Colin or his servants in his  name thereafter, for the which in that respect the said Colin shall always  be answerable in manner aforesaid and no otherwise. A bond of caution by Mackenzie, and Lord Lindsay of the Byres as security for him, for ten thousand merks, subscribed on the 20th of  January, 1582-83, and registered in the Chanonry of Ross, binds Colin to  surrender the Castle of Strome to any person appointed by the King for the  purpose, on six days&#x27; warning and to fulfil the other duties imposed upon him by the Act of the Privy Council dated the 11th of the same month,  already given, but with the proviso in his favour contained in that Act,  which is repeated at length in the bond of caution of this date. In terms of this bond the King and Council at a meeting held at  Holyrood on the 8th of March following &quot;for certain causes and  considerations moving them,&quot; order letters to issue charging Mackenzie  and other keepers of the Castle of Strome to deliver the same to Colin,  Earl of Argyll, Chancellor, or to his servants in his name within six days  after charge under the pains of rebellion, which being done the King  &quot;discharges thereafter the sureties found by the said Colin Mackenzie of  before, either acted in the books of Secret Council, or by contract, bond,  or promise between him and Donald Mac Angus Mac Alastair of  Glengarry,&quot; the Acts referring to the same to be deleted from the books of  the Privy Council. Colin&#x27;s name appears again on the 1st of August as surety for a  bond of three thousand merks by David Dunbar of Kilstarry and Patrick  Dunbar of Blairy. On the 5th of May, 1585, he is denounced a rebel on a complaint  by Hugh Fraser of Guisachan under the following circumstances.  Fraser says that a certain &quot;John Dow Mac Allan was lawfully denounced his Highness&#x27; rebel and put to the horn at the said Hucheon&#x27;s instance for not  removing from the half davoch of land of Kilboky pertaining to him,  conform to a decree obtained by the said Hucheon against the said John  Dow Mac Allan.&quot;  Upon this decree Hugh Fraser &quot;raised letters of caption  by deliverance of the Lords of Session to charge the Sheriff of Inverness and other judges in the country where the said John resorts, to take,  apprehend him, and keep him conform to the order observed in such  cases.&quot;  In all this process to obtain the decree, with &quot;letters in the four  forms, executions and denunciations thereof,&quot; and then raising of the said  letters of caption thereupon, the complainer has been put to great travel and expenses, having his habitation by&#x27; the space of eight score miles or thereby distant from the Burgh of Edinburgh.&quot;  Nevertheless, Colin  Mackenzie, &quot;to whom the said John Dow Mac Allan is tenant, servant,  and special depender,&quot; maintains and assists him in his violent occupation  or the complainer&#x27;s lands, &quot;keeps him in his company, receives him in his house, and otherwise debates him that he cannot be apprehended,&quot; so that  all the proceedings of the complainer Fraser are frustrated.  Colin was  thereupon charged to present Mac Allan before the Privy Council, under  pain of rebellion, and failing to appear, or present John Dow, and the  complainer having appeared personally, an order was pronounced  denouncing Mackenzie a rebel. On the 11th of December next, John Gordon of Pitlurg becomes cautioner in one thousand merks that Colin will not injure Andrew, Lord  Dingwall, his tenants, or servants.  On the 11th of April, 1586, William  Cumming of Inverallochy and others become surety in ?000 that  Mackenzie shall &quot;remove his coble, fishers, and nets, from the fishing of the water of Canon, and desist and cease therefrom in time coming,  conform to the letters raised at the instance of Andrew, Lord Dingwall, to  the same effect, in case it shall be found and declared that the said Colin  ought to do the same.&quot;  On the 4th of May following, Mackenzie binds  himself to keep his sureties scaithless in the matter of this caution. On the  16th of the same month, the King and Council &quot;for certain necessary and  weighty considerations moving his Highness, tending to the furthering and establishing of his Highness&#x27; obedience and the greatness and safety of his  peaceable and good subjects from burnings, riefs, and oppression,&quot; ordain Colin to enter in ward in Blackness Castle within twenty-four hours after being charged under pain of treason.  Two days later, being then in ward  in this stronghold, he finds caution in ten thousand merks that on being relieved from ward he will repair to Edinburgh and keep ward there until  set free.  This is deleted by a warrant subscribed by the King and the  Secretary at Falkland on the 6th of the following August.  His name  appears as one of a long list of Highland chiefs complained against to the  Privy Council on the 30th of November, 1586, by the united burghs of the  realm for obstructing the fisheries in the northern parts and making  extortionate exactions from the fishermen, and again on the 16th of  September, 1587, when an order is made to denounce him for his failure  to appear before the Council to enter John Mackenzie of Gairloch and his  accomplices, for whom Colin is held liable &quot;as master and landlord,&quot; to  answer a complaint made against them by James Sinclair, Master of  Caithness, on the 10th of August preceding.  On the 5th of March, 1587-88, John Davidson, burgess of Edinburgh, becomes cautioner in 500 merks  that Colin will, if required, enter such of his men before the Privy  Council as &quot;assegeit&quot; James, Master of Caithness, within the house of  William Robson, in the Chanonry of Ross.  On the 27th of July, 1588, he  is appointed by a Convention of the Estates member of a Commission,  charged with powers for executing the laws against Jesuits, Papists, and  other delinquents, and with other extensive powers.  On the 24th of May,  1589, he is named as the Commissioner for the shire of Inverness who is  to convene the freeholders of the county for choosing the Commissioners  to a Parliament to be held at Edinburgh on the 2nd of October in that year,  and to report his diligence in this matter to the Council before the 15th of  August, under pains of rebellion.  On the 4th of June following, he appears  in a curious position in connection with a prosecution for witchcraft  against several women, and an abridgement of the document, as recorded  in the Records of the Privy Council, is of sufficient interest to justify a  place here. It is the complaint of Katherine Ross, relict of Robert Munro  of Fowlis Margaret Sutherland, spouse of Hector Munro, portioner of Kiltearn Bessie Innes, spouse of Neil Munro, in Swordale  Margaret Ross,  spouse of John Neil Mac Donald Roy, in Caull; and Margaret Mowat, as  follows:-- Mr Hector Munro, now of Fowlis, son-in-law of the said Katherine Ross,  &quot;seeking all ways and means to possess himself in certain her tierce and  conjunct fee lands of the Barony of Fowlis, and to dispossess her  therefrom&quot; had first &quot;persued certain of her tenants and servants by way of  deed for their bodily harm and slaughter,&quot; and then, &quot;finding that he could  not prevail that way, neither by sundry other indirect means sought by  him,&quot; had at last, &quot;upon sinister and wrong information and importunate  suit, purchased a commission of the same to his Majesty, and to Colin Mackenzie of Kintail, Rory Mackenzie, his brother, John Mackenzie of Gairloch, Alexander Bain of Tulloch, Angus Mackintosh of Termitt, James Glas of Gask, William Cuthbert, in Inverness, and some others specially mentioned therein, for apprehending of the said Margaret Sutherland, Bessy Innes, Margaret Ross, and Margaret Mowat, and sundry  others, and putting them to the knowledge of an assize for witchcraft, and  other forged and feinted crimes alleged to be committed by them.&quot; Further, &quot;the said persons, by virtue of the same commission, intended to proceed against them most partially and wilfully, and thereby to drive the  said complainers to that strait that either they shall satisfy his  unreasonable desire, or then to lose their lives, with the sober portion of  goods made by them for the sustenance of themselves and their poor  bairns: howbeit it be of verity that they are honest women of repute and  holding these many years bygone, spotted at no time with any such  ungodly practices, neither any ways having committed any offence, but by  all their actions behaved themselves so discreetly and honestly as none justly could or can have occasion of complaint--they being ever ready,  like they are yet, to underlie the law for all crimes that can be laid to their  charge,&quot; and having to that effect, &quot;presently found caution for their  compearance before the justice and his deputes, or any judge unsuspected, upon fifteen days&#x27; warning.&quot; Their prayer, accordingly, is that the said commission be discharged. Hector Munro appearing for himself and his  colleagues, and the complainers by Alexander Morrison, their procurator,  the Lords ordain Mr Hector and the other commissioners to desist a from proceeding against the women, and &quot;remit their trial to be taken before the  Justice-General or his deputes a in the next justice court appointed to be held after his Majesty&#x27;s repairing to the north parts of this realm in the  month of July next, at which time, if his Majesty shall not repair thither, or  being repaired shall not before his returning cause the same trial to be  taken, &quot;in that case commission shall be given to Thomas Fraser of  Knocky, tutor of Lovat, John Urquhart of Cadboll, tutor of Cromarty, and  Alexander Bayne of Tulloch, or any two of them to administer justice  conform to the laws of the realm.&quot; On the 6th of March, 1589-90, Colin is again mentioned as one of the Commissioners for Inverness and Cromarty for executing the Acts against the Jesuits and the seminary of priests, with reconstitution of the  Commission of the preceding year for putting the Acts in force and the  appointment of a new Commission of select clergy in the shires to cooperate in the work and promote submission to the Confession of Faith  and Covenant over the whole Kingdom.  On the 8th of June, 1590, officers  of arms are ordered to arrest in the hands of David Clapen in Leith, or any  other person, any money consigned in their hands, or due by them to Sir  William Keith for Colin Mackenzie of Kintail, &quot;or remanent gentlemen  and tenants of the Earldom of Ross for their feus thereof&quot; or that rests yet  in the hands of Colin or such tenants, unpaid or not consigned by them,  and to discharge them from paying the same to Sir William or any other in his name until the King shall further declare his will, under the penalty of  paying his Majesty the same sums over again.  On the 5th of July in the  same year, Colin gives caution of ?000 that William Ross of Priesthill,  when released out of the tolbooth of Edinburgh, shall keep ward in that  city till he find surety for the entrance of himself and his bastard son, John  Ross and others, to appear before the justice to answer for certain crimes  specified in letters raised against him by David Munro of Nigg when  required upon fifteen days&#x27; warning, and satisfy the Treasurer-depute for his escheat fallen to the King through having been put to the horn at the instance of the said David Munro.  He repeats the same caution for the  same person on the 15th of August following.  He is again on record in  March, 1591-92, and in June, 1592.  He is, along with Simon Lord Lovat,  John Grant of Grant, Lachlan  Mackintosh of Mackintosh, Ross of  Balnagown, Hector Munro of Fowlis, and others, chosen an assistant  Commissioner of justiciary for the counties of Elgin, Nairn, and Inverness,  in March 1592-93.  He was appointed a member of the Privy Council in June, 1592, but he appears not to have accepted the office on that occasion, for on the 16th of February following there is an entry of the  admission of Sir William Keith of Delny &quot;in the place appointed by his  Majesty, with the advise of his Estates in his last Parliament, for Colin Mackenzie of Kintail, by reason he, being required, has not compeared nor accepted the said place.&quot; He, however, accepted the position soon after, for it is recorded under date of 5th July, 1593, that &quot;Colin Mackenzie of Kintail being admitted of the Privy Council gave his oath,&quot; in common  form. The great troubles in the Lewis, which ultimately ended in that extensive principality coming into the possession of the House of Kintail,  commenced about this time, and although the most important events connected with  and leading up to that great result will principally fall to be  treated of later on, the quarrel having originated in Colin Cam&#x27;s time, it  may be more convenient to explain its origin under the present. Roderick Macleod, X. of the Lewis,  married, first, Janet, a natural  daughter of John Mackenzie of Killin, by whom he had a son, Torquil  Cononach, so called from his having been brought up with his mother&#x27;s  relations in Strathconon.  Roderick, by all accounts, was not so  immaculate in his domestic relations as one might wish, for we find him  having no fewer than five bastard sons, named respectively, Tormod  Uigeach, Murdoch,  Neil, Donald, and Rory Og, all of whom arrived at  maturity.  In these circumstances it can hardly be supposed that his lady&#x27;s  domestic happiness was of the most felicitous and unmixed description. It  was alleged by this paragon of virtue that she had proved unfaithful to  him, and that she had criminal intimacy with the Brieve (Breitheamh), or  consistorial judge of the Island.  On the other hand, it was maintained that  the Brieve in his capacity of judge,  had been somewhat severe on the  Island chief for his reckless and immoral habits, and for his bad treatment  of his lady and that the unprincipled villain, as throughout his whole  career he proved himself to be, boldly, and in revenge, turned upon and accused the judge of committing adultery with his wife.  Be that as it may,  the unfortunate woman, attempting to escape from his cruel treatment,  while passing in a large birlinn, from the Lewis to Coigeach, on the  opposite side of the coast, was pursued and run down by some of her  husband&#x27;s followers, when she, with all on board, perished.  Roderick  thereupon disinherited her son, Torquil Cononach, grandson of John of  Killin, maintaining that Torquil was not his legitimate son and heir, but the fruit of his wife&#x27;s unfaithfulness. [Most of the MS. Histories of the family which we have perused state that Rory Macleod&#x27;s wife was a  daughter of Kenneth a Bhlair, but it is impossible that the daughter of a chief who died in 1491 could have been the wife of one who lived in the early years of the seventeenth Century. She must have been Kenneth&#x27;s granddaughter, as above described, a daughter of John of Kuhn. This  view is corroborated by a decree arbitral in 1554, in which Torquil  Cononach is called the oy (ogha, or grandson) of John Mackenzie:--Acts  and Decreets of Session, X., folio 201.  The Roderick Macleod who  married, probably as his second wife, Agnes, daughter of Kenneth a  Bhlair, was Roderick Macleod, seventh of Lewis, who died some time  after his father early in the sixteenth century.]  Roderick Macleod married  secondly, in 1541, Barbara Stewart, daughter of Andrew, Lord Avandale,  with issue--Torquil Oighre or the Heir, who died unmarried before his  father, having been drnwned along with a large number of others while on  a voyage in his birlinn, between Lewis and Skye.  Macleod married thirdly a daughter or Hector Og, XIII., and sister of Sir Lachlan Maclean, XIV., of  Duart, by whom he had two sons--Torquil Dubh, whom he named as his  heir and successor, and Tormod, known as Tormod Og. Torquil  Cononach, now designated &quot;of Coigeach,&quot; married Margaret, daughter of  Angus Macdonald, VII. of Glengarry, and widow of Cuthbert of Castlehill,  Inverness, who bore him two sons--John and Neil--and five daughters  and, raising as many men as would accompany him, he, with the  assistance of two of his natural brothers-Tormod and Murdoch-started for  the Lewis to vindicate his rights as legitimate heir to the island.  He  defeated his father, and confined him in the Castle of Stornoway for four years, when he was finally obliged to acknowledge Torquil Cononach as  his lawful son and successor.  The bastards now quarrelled among  themselves. Donald killed Tormod Uigeach.  Murdoch, in resentment,  seized Donald and carried him to Coigeach; but he afterwards escaped and complained to old Rory, who was highly offended at Murdoch for seizing  and with Torquil Cononach for detaining Donald.  Roderick ordered  Murdoch to be apprehended and confined to his own old quarters in the  Castle of Stornoway.  Torquil Cononach again returned to the Lewis,  reduced the castle, liberated  Murdoch, again confined his father, and  killed many of his followers, at the same time carrying off all the writs and charters, and depositing them for safety with his uncle, Mackenzie of Kintail.  He had meanwhile left his son John (who had been in the service of Huntly, and whom he now called home) in charge of the castle, and in  possession of the Lewis.  He imprudently banished his natural uncles,  Donald and Rory Og, out of the island.  Rory Og soon after returned with a considerable number of followers; attacked his nephew, Torquil Cononach&#x27;s son John, in Stornoway, killed him, and released his own  father, old Roderick, who was allowed after this to possess the island in peace during the remainder of his life.  &quot;Thus was the Siol Torquil  weakened, by private dissensions, and exposed to fall a prey, as it did soon  afterwards, to the growing power of the Mackenzies.&quot; In 1594 Alexander Bayne, younger of Tulloch, granted a charter of the lands of Rhindoun in favour of Colin Mackenzie of Kintail and his  heirs male, proceeding on a contract of sale between them, dated 10th of  March, 1574.  On the 10th of July in the same year there is &quot;a contract of  alienation&quot; of these lands by the same Colin Mackenzie of Kintail in  favour of Roderick Mackenzie of Ardafillie (Redcastle), his brother-german, and his heirs male.  A charter implementing this contract is dated  the 20th of October following, by which the lands are to be holden blench and for relieving Kintail of the feu-duty and services payable to his  superiors.&quot; These lands are, in 1625, resigned by Murdoch Mackenzie of  Redcastle into the hands of Colin, second Earl of Seaforth, the immediate lawful superior thereof, for new infeftments to be granted to Roderick  Mackenzie, his second lawful son. (Writs and Evidents of Lands of  Rhindoun. Antiquarian Notes, pp. 172-73.) Colin, in addition to his acquisitions in Lochalsh and. Lochcarron, &quot;feued the Lordship of Ardmeanach, and the Barony of Delnys, Brae Ross,  with the exception of Western Achnacherich, Wester Drynie, and  Tarradale, which Bayne of Tulloch had feued before, but found it his  interest to hold of him as immediate superior, which, with the former  possessions of the lands of Chanonry, greatly enhanced his influence. Albeit his predecessors were active both in war and peace, and precedent  in acquiring their estate; yet this man acquired more than all that went  before him, and made such a solid progress in it, that what he had  acquired was with the goodwill of his sovereign, and clear unquestionable purchase.&quot;  He protected his nephew, Torquil Macleod of the Lewis, when  he was oppressed by his unnatural relations and natural brothers, and from   his he acquired a right to the lands of Assynt. [Earl of Cromartie and other  MS. Histories of the Family.] Colin, in April, 1572, married Barbara, daughter of John Grant of Grant, ancestor of the Earls of Seafield, by Lady Marjory Stewart, daughter of John, third Earl of Athol (Tocher 2000 merks and the half  lands of Loch broom, then the property of her father [Chiefs of Grant]),  with issue-- I.  Kenneth, who succeeded his father, and was afterwards elevated to the Peerage by the title of Lord Mackenzie of Kintail. II.  Roderick, the renowned Sir Roderick Mor Mackenzie of  Coigeach, &quot;Tutor of Kin tail &quot;and progenitor of the Earls of Cromarty, of the families of Scatwell, Tarvie, Ballone, and other minor Mackenzie septs, of whom in their proper place. III.  Alexander, first of Kilcoy, now represented by Colonel Burton Mackenzie. IV.  Colin of Kinnock and Pitlundie. V.  Murdoch of Kernsary, whose only lawful son, John, was killed at the Battle of Auldearn, in 1645, without issue. VI.  Catherine, who married Simon, eighth Lord Lovat, with issue--Hugh, his heir and successor, and Elizabeth, who married Dunbar of Westfield, Sheriff of Moray. VII.  Janet, who married Hector Maclean, &quot;Eachainn Og,&quot; XV. of Duart, with  issue--Hector Mor, who succeeded his father Lachlan, and  Florence, who married John Garbh Maclean, VII. of Coll. VIII.  Mary, who, as his second wife, married Sir Donald Gorm  Mor Macdonald, VII., of Sleat, without issue. He had also a natural son, IX.  Alexander, by Margaret, daughter of Roderick Mackenzie, second of Davochmaluag, who became the founder of the families of Applecross and Coul, of whom in their order. Colin &quot;lived beloved by princes and people, and died, regretted by  all, on the 14th of June, 1594, at Redcastle and was buried at Bewlie.&quot; He  was succeeded by his eldest son, XII.  KENNETH  MACKENZIE, FIRST  LORD  MACKENZIE  OF  KINTAIL, who began his rule amidst  those domestic quarrels and dissensions in the Lewis, to which we have already introduced the reader, and which may,  not inappropriately, be  designated the Strife of the Bastards.  He is on record as &quot;of Kintail&quot; on  the 31st of July, 1594, within seven weeks of his father&#x27;s death, and again  on the 1st of October in the same year. On the 9th of November he made  oath in presence of the King and the Privy Council that he  should   &quot;faithfully, loyally, and  truly concur, fortify, and assist his Majesty&#x27;s  Lieutenant of the North with his advice and force at all times and  occasions as he may be required by proclamations, missive letters, or  otherwise.&quot;  The country generally was in such a lawless condition in this  year that an Act of Parliament was passed by which it was ordained &quot;that  in order that there may be a perfect distinction, by names and surnames, betwixt those that are and desire to be esteemed honest and true men, and those that are and not ashamed to be esteemed thieves, sorners, and  resetters of them in their wicked and odious crimes and deeds; that  therefore a roll and catalogue be  made of all persons, and the surnames therein mentioned, suspected of slaughter, etc.&quot;  It was also enacted &quot;that  such evil disposed persons as take upon themselves to sell the goods of  thieves, and disobedient persons and clans that dare not come to public  markets in the Lowlands themselves, whereby the execution of the Arts  made against somers, clans, and thieves, is greatly impeded,&quot; should be punished in  the manner therein contained.  Another Act provided &quot;that  the inbringer of every robber and  thief, after he is outlawed, and  denounced fugitive, shall have two hundred pounds Scots for every robber  and thief so inbrought.&quot; [Antiquarian Notes.] On the 5th of February,  1595-96, it is complained against him by Alexander Bayne of Tulloch that although upon the 7th of March, 1594,  John  MacGillechallum, Raasay, had been put to the horn for non-appearance to a complaint by the said Alexander and his son Alexander,  Fiar of Tulloch, against the Rev. John Mackenzie, minister of Urray,  touching certain oppressions and depredations committed on him and his  tenants, he remained not only unrelaxed from the horn, but continues in  &quot;his wicked and accustomed trade of rief theft, sorning, and oppression,&quot; seeking &quot;all indirect and shameful means to wreck and destroy him and  his bairns.&quot;  A short time before this, MacGillechallum sent to the  complainer desiring him to give over to him his (Bayne&#x27;s) old heritage  called Torridon, &quot;with assurance if he do not the same to burn his whole  corn and goods.&quot;  In these insolencies &quot;he is encouraged and set forward by the consort, reset, and supply which he receives of Kenneth Mackenzie  of Kintail and his friends, he being near kinsman to the said Kenneth, viz.:  --his father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son; who, in that respect, shows him all good offices  of friendship and courtesy, indirectly assisting him with his men and  moyen in all his enterprises against the said complainer and his bairns,  without whose oversight and allowance and protection it were not able to him to have a reset in any part of the country.&quot;  The complainer, Alexander Bayne, describes himself as &quot;a decrepit aged man past eighty  years of age and being blind these years he must submit himself to his  Majesty for remedy.&quot;  Kintail appeared personally, and Tulloch by his two sons, Alexander and Ranald, whereupon the King and Council remitted  the complaint to be decided before the ordinary judges. The following account from family MSS. and Sir Robert Gordon&#x27;s Earldom of Sutherland, refers no doubt to the same incidents--John MacCallum, a brother of the Laird of Raasay, annoyed the people of Torridon, which place at that time belonged to the Baynes of Tulloch.  He  alleged that Tulloch, in whose house he was fostered, had promised him  these lands as a gift of fosterage; but Tulloch, whether he had made a  previous promise to MacGillechallum or not, left the lands of Torridon to his own second son, Alexander Mor MacDhonnchaidh Mhic Alastair,  alias Bayne.  He afterwards obtained a decree against  MacGillechallum  for interfering with his lands and molesting the people, and, on a  Candlemas market, with a large following of armed men, made up of most  of the Baynes, and a considerable number of Munros, he came to the  market stance, at that time held at Logie.  John MacGillechallum, ignorant  of Tulloch &quot;getting the laws against him&quot; and in no fear of his life or  liberty, came to the market as usual, and, while standing buying some  article at a chapman&#x27;s stall, Alastair Mor and his followers came up  behind him unperceived, and, without any warning, struck him on the  head with a two-edged sword--instantly killing him.  A gentleman of the  Clann Mhurchaidh Riabhaich Mackenzies, Ian Mac Mhurchaidh Mhic  Uilleam, a very active and powerful man, was at the time standing beside  him, and he asked who dared to have spilt Mackenzie blood in that  dastardly manner.  He had no sooner said the words than he was run  through the body by ore of the swords of the enemy; and thus, without an  opportunity of drawing their weapons, fell two of the best swordsmen in  the North of Scotland. The alarm and the news of their death immediately spread through the market.  &quot;Tulloch Ard,&quot; the war cry of the Mackenzies, was instantly raised; whereupon the Baynes and the Munros took to their heels--the Munros eastward to the Ferry of Fowlis, and the Baynes northward to the hills, both followed by a band of the infuriated Mackenzies, who slaughtered every one they overtook.  Iain Dubh Mac Choinnich Mhic Mhurchaidh, of the clan Mhurchaidh Riabhaich, and Iain  Gallda Mac Fhionnla Dhuibh, two gentlemen of the Mackenzies, the latter  of whom was a Kintail man, were on their way from Chanonry to the  market, when they met in with a batch of the Munros flying in confusion  and, learning the cause to be the murder of their friends at Logie market,  they instantly pursued the fugitives, killing no less than thirteen of them  between Logie and the wood of Millechaich.  All the townships in the  neighbourhood of the market joined the Mackenzies in the pursuit, and  Alastair Mor Bayne of Tulloch only saved himself, after all his men were  killed, by taking shelter and hiding for a time in a kiln-logie.  Two of his followers, who managed to escape from the market people, met with some  Lewismen on their way to the fair, who, noticing the Baynes flying half  naked, immediately stopped them, and insisted upon their giving a proper  account of themselves.  This proving unsatisfactory they came to high  words, and from words to blows. when the Lewismen attacked and killed  them at Ach-an-eilich, near Contin. The Baynes and the Munros had good cause to regret the cowardly conduct of their leaders on this occasion at Logie market, for they lost no  less than fifty able-bodied men in return for the two gentlemen of the Clan  Mackenzie whom they had so basely murdered at the fair.  One lady of the  Clan Munro lost her three brothers, on whom she composed a lament, of  which the following is all we could obtain:-- `S olc a&#x27; fhuair mi tus an Earraich, `S na feill Bride `chaidh thairis, Chaill mi mo thriuir bhraithrean geala, Taobh ri taobh u&#x27; sileadh fala. `Se `n dithis a rinn mo sharach&#x27;, Fear beag dubh a chlaidheamh Iaidir, `S mac Fhionnla Dhuibh a Cinntaile Deadh mhearlach nan adh `s nan aigeach. When night came on, Alastair Mor Bayne escaped from the kiln, and went  to his uncle Lovat, who at once despatched James Fraser of Phopachy  south, with all speed to prevent information from the other side reaching the King before be had an opportunity of relating his version of the  quarrel.  His Majesty was at the time at Falkland, and a messenger from  Mackenzie reached him before Alastair Mor, pursuing for the slaughter of  Mackenzie&#x27;s kinsmen.  He got the ear of his Majesty and would have been  successful had not John Dubh Mac Choinnich Mhic Mhurchaidh  meanwhile taken the law into his own hands by burning, in revenge, all  Tulloch&#x27;s cornyards and barns at Lemlair, thus giving Bayne an  opportunity of presenting another and counter claim but the matter was  ultimately arranged by the King and Council obliging Kintail and Tulloch  mutually to subscribe a contract of agreement and peaceful behaviour  towards each other. Under date of 18th February, 1395-96, there is an entry in the Privy Council Records that Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail &quot;being elected and  chosen to be one of the ordinary members&quot; of the Council, and being  personally preset, makes faith and gives oath in the usual manner.  In a  complaint against him, on the 5th of August, 1596, by Habbakuk Bisset,  he is assoilzied in all time coming by a decree of their Lordships in his favour. Upon the death of Old Roderick of the Lewis, Torquil Dubh  succeeded him, excluding Torquil Cononach from the succession on the  plea of his being a bastard.  The latter, however, held Coigeach and his other possessions on the mainland, with a full recognition by the Government of his rights to the lands of his forefathers in the Lewis. His  two sons having been killed, and his eldest daughter, Margaret, having  married Roderick Mackenzie of Coigeach, progenitor of the Cromarty  family, better known as the Tutor of Kintail, Torquil Cononach threw  himself into the hands of Kintail for aid against the bastards.  By Roderick  Mackenzie&#x27;s marriage with Torquil Cononach&#x27;s eldest daughter, he  became heir of line to the ancient family of Macleod, an honour which  still remains to his descendants, the Cromarty family.  Torquil Dubh  secured considerable support by marriage with a daughter of Tormod, XI.,  and sister of William Macleod, XII. of Harris and Dunvegan, and, thus  strengthened, made a descent on Coigeach and Lochbroom, desolating the  whole district, aiming at permanent occupation.  Kintail, following the example of his predecessors--always prudent, and careful to keep within  the laws of the realm--in 1596 laid the following complaint before King  James VI.:-- Please your Majesty,--Torquil Dow of the Lews, not contenting himself with the avowit misknowledging of your Hieness authority wherebe he has violat the promises and compromit made before your Majesty, now lately the 25th day of December last, has ta&#x27;n upon him  being accompanied w 7 or 800 men, not only of his own by ylands neist  adjacent, to prosecute with fire and sword by all kind of gud order, the  hail bounds of the Strath Coigach pertaining to M&#x27;Leod his eldest brother,  likewise my Strath of Lochbroom, quhilks Straths, to your Majesty&#x27;s great dishonour, but any fear of God ourselves, hurt and skaith that he hath  wasted w fire and sword, in such barbarous and cruel manner, that neither man, wife, bairn, horse, cattle, corns, nor bigging has been spared, but all barbarously slain, burnt, and destroyit, quhilk barbarity and cruelty, seeing  he was not able to perform it but by the assistance and furderance of his neighbouring Ylesmen, therefore beseeches your Majesty by advice of  Council to find some sure remeid wherebe sick cruel tyrannie may be  resisted in the beginning.  Otherway nothing to be expectit for but dailly  increasing of his malicious forces to our utter ruin, quha possesses your Majesty&#x27;s obedience, the consideration quharof and inconveniences quhilk  may thereon ensue.  I remit to your Highness guid consideration of whom  taking my leif with maist humble commendations of service, I commit  your Majesty to the holy protection of God eternal.  At the Canonry of Ross, the 3d day, Jany. 1596-97.  Your Majesty&#x27;s most humble and obt.  subject. KENNETH  MACKENZIE of Kintail. The complaint came before the Privy Council, at Holyrood, on the 11th of  February, following, and Torquil Dubh, failing to appear, was denounced  a rebel.  Kenneth thereupon obtained a commission of fire and sword  against him, as also the forfeiture of the Lewis, upon which Torquil  Cononach made over his rights to Mackenzie, on the plea that he was the  next male heir, but reserving the lands of Coigeach to his own son-in-law. The Mackenzies did all they could to obtain the estste for Torquil Cononach, the legitimate heir, but mainly through his own want of activity  and indolent disposition, they failed with their united efforts to secure undisturbed possession for him.  They succeeded, however, in destroying  the family of Macleod of the Lewis, and most of the Siol-Torquil, and  ultimately became complete masters of the island.  The Brieve by  stratagem captured Torquil Dubh, with some of his friends, and delivering them up to Torquil Cononach, they were, by his orders, beheaded in July,  1597.  &quot;It fell out that the Breve (that is to say, the judge) in the Lewis,  who was chief of the Clan Illevorie (Morrison),, being sailing from the Isle of Lewis to Ronay in a great galley, met with a Dutch ship loaded  with wine, which he took; and advising with his friends, who were all with  him there, what he would do with the ship lest Torqull Du should take her from him, they resolved to return to Stornoway and call for Torqull Du to receive the wine, and if he came to the ship, to sail away with him where Torqull Cononach was, and then they might be sure of the ship and the  wine to be their own, and besides, he would grant them tacks in the best  parts in the Lewis; which accordingly they did, and called for Torqull to come and receive the wine.  Torqull Du noways mistrusting them that  were formerly so obedient, entered the ship with seven others in company, where he was welcomed, and he commended them as good fellows that  brought him such a prize.  They invited him to the quay to take his  pleasure of the feast of their wine.  He goes, but instead of wine they  brought cords to tie him, telling him he had better render himself and his  wrongously possessed estate to his eldest brother; that they resolved to put  him in his mercy, which he was forced to yield to.  So they presently sail  for Coigeach, and delivered him to his brother, who he had no sooner got  but he made him short by the head in the month of July, 1597. Immediately he was beheaded there arose a great earthquake, which astonished the actors and all the inhabitants about them as a sign of God&#x27;s  judgment.&quot; [Ancient MS.] In 1598 some gentlemen in Fife, afterwards known as the &quot;Fife Adventurers,&quot; obtained a grant of the Lewis with the professed object of  civilising the inhabitants.  It is not intended here to detail their  proceedings or to describe at much length the squabbles and constant  disorders, murders, and robberies which took place while they held  possession of the Island.  The speculation proved ruinous to the  Adventurers, who in the end lost their estates, and were obliged to leave the islanders to their fate. A brief summary of it will suffice, and those  who desire more information on the subject will find a full account of it in  the History of the Macleods. [By the same author.  A. &amp; W. Mackenzie, Inverness, 1889.] On the 15th of June, 1599, Sir William Stewart of Houston, Sir  James Spence of Wormistoun, and Thomas Cunningham appeared  personally before the Privy Council &quot;to take a day for the pursuit of  Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail upon such crimes as criminally they had to  lay to his charge for themselves and in the name of the gentlemen-ventuaries of their society,&quot; and the 26th of September was fixed for the purpose. On the 14th of September Kenneth enters into a bond for a  thousand merks that John Dunbar, Fiar of Avoch, and James Dunbar of  Little Suddie, four sons of John of Avoch, and several others, in five hundred merks each, that they will not harm Roderick Dingwall of Kildin,  Duncan Bayne, apparent heir of Tulloch, Alexander Bayne of Loggie, and  other sons and grandsons of Bayne of Tulloch. Sir James Stewart of Newton enters into a bond, on the 6th of October, for six hundred merks that Kenneth will not harm James Crambie, a burgess of Perth, signed at Dunkeld in presence of Murdo Mackenzie, apparent heir of Redcastle, John Mackenzie, minister of Dingwall, and Alexander Mackenzie, writer. On the 16th of April, 1600, Tormod Macleod complains that  Kenneth had apprehended him and detained him as a prisoner without just cause, and failing to appear the King and Council, understanding that  Tormod &quot;is a chief and special man of that clan (Macleod), and that  therefore it is necessary that order be taken for his dutiful obedience and  good behaviour,&quot; order Kenneth to present him before the Council on a  day to be afterwards fixed. Kenneth, on the 11th of December, brings under the notice of the Council a case which places the unlawful practices of the times in a strong  light.  He says that upon the 16th of October preceding, while Duncan  MacGillechallum in Kintail, his man, was bringing twenty-four cows to  the fair of Glammis, three men, whose names he gives, violently robbed  him of the cattle.  Upon the 1st of November, 1599, the same persons had  reft Duncan MacGillechriosd in Kintail, his tenant, at the fair of Elycht, of  twenty-six cows and four hundred merks of silver, and robbed Murdo Mac  Ian Mhic Mhurchaidh, also his tenant in Kintail, of twenty-six cows at the same market.  On the 30th of October, 1600, he sent his servants, John  and Dougall MacVanish, in Lochalsh, to the fair of Elycht with a hundred  and fifty-four cows and oxen to be sold, &quot;for outred and certane the said complenaris adois in thir pairtis,&quot; and his servants being at the foot of Drummuir with his said cattle, two of the three who robbed his men at  Glammis, with Patrick Boll in Glenshee, and Alexander Galld Macgregor,  took from them the whole of the cattle and &quot;hes sparpellit and disponit&quot;  upon the same at their pleasure.  This violence and rief at free markets and  fairs, he says, is not only hurtful to him, but it &quot;discourages all peaceable  and good subjects to direct or send any goods to the market and fairs of  the incountry.&quot;  Kenneth Mackenzie of Kilchrist appeared for Kintail, and the defenders, in absence, were denounced rebels. He is ordered on the 31st of January, 1602, as one of the leading Highland chiefs, to hold a general muster and wapinschaw of his followers each year within his bounds, on the 10th of March, as the other chiefs are  in their respective districts.  On the same day he is requested to provide a  hundred men to aid the Queen of England &quot;against the rebels in Ireland;&quot;  is authorised to raise this number compulsorily, if need be, and appoint the  necessary officers to command them.  On the 28th of July following,  Alexander Dunbar of Cumnock, Sheriff-Principal of Elgin and Forres, and David Brodie of Brodie, become cautioners to the amount of three thousand merks that Kenneth will appear before the King and Council, when charged with some unnamed offence, upon twenty days warning. On the 9th of September Mackenzie complains to the Council that about  St Andrews Day, 1601, when he sent eighty cattle to the St. Andrew  market for sale, Campbell of Glenlyon, with a large number of his men,  &quot;all thieves and broken Highland men,&quot; had set upon his servants and  spuilzied them of the whole; and that eighty cattle he had sent to the  Michaelmas market had been reft from him in the same way by the said  Campbell, for which Duncan Campbell, younger of Glenlyon, having  failed to produce his father, who &quot;was in his custody and keeping,&quot; was  denounced a rebel. There being some variance and controversy &quot;between Mackenzie  and Donald Mac Angus of Glengarry, they were both ordered at the same meeting of Council to subscribe, within three hours after being charged,  such forms of mutual assurance as should be presented to them, to endure  till the 1st of May, 1603, under pain of rebellion. By warrant of the King, Kenneth is admitted a member of the Privy Council and is sworn in, in common form, on the 9th of December, 1602.   On the following day he gives caution for James Dunbar of Little Suddie,  and John Dunbar, Fiar of Avoch, in two hundred merks, for their  relaxation by the 1st of February next from several hornings used against them. At a meeting of the Privy Council, held at Edinburgh on the 30th of September, 1605, Kenneth receives a commission to act for the King  against Neil MacNeill of Barra, the Captain of Clanranald, and several  other Highland and Island chiefs, who had &quot;of late amassed together a  force and company of the barbarous and rebellious thieves and limmers of  the Isles,&quot; and with them entered the Lewis, &quot;assailed the camp of his  Majesty&#x27;s good subjects,&quot; and &quot;committed barbarous and detestable  murders and slaughters upon them.&quot; Mackenzie is in consequence  commissioned to convocate the lieges in arms and to pursue these  offenders with fire and sword by sea or land, &quot;take and slay them,&quot; or  present them to their Lordships for justice, with power also to the said  Kenneth to pass to the Lewis for thc relief of the subjects &quot;distressed and  grieved&quot; by the said rebellious &quot;lymmairis,&quot; or of prisoners in  their hands, and to procure their liberty by &quot;force or policy, as he may best have it.&quot; He is also ordered to charge the lieges within the shires of Inverness and  Nairn, burgh and landward, to rise and assist him in the execution of his office, whenever he requires them, &quot;by his precepts and proclamations.&quot; This was the beginning of Kenneth&#x27;s second conquest of the Lewis. Mackenzie is, on the 2nd of June, 1607, appointed by the Privy  Council, along with the Bishop of Ross, a commissioner to the  Presbyteries of Tam and Ardmeanach, and on the 14th of July following,  he is summoned before their Lordships to report his diligence in that matter, under pain of rebellion.  Kenneth does not appear, and he is  denounced a rebel.  On the 30th of July he takes the oath of allegiance,  along with the Earl of Wyntoun and James Bishop of Orkney, in terms of  a Royal letter issued on the 2nd of June preceding imposing a special oath  acknowledging the Royal Supremacy in Church and state on all Scotsmen  holding any civic or ecclesiastical office. He receives another commission on the 1st of September, 1607. Understanding that &quot;Neil Macleod and others, the rebellious thieves and  limmers of the Isles, have of late surprised and taken the Castle of  Stornoway in the Lewis, and other houses and biggings, pertaining to the  gentlemen portioners of the Lewis, and have demolished and cast down  some of the said houses, and keep others of them as houses of war,  victualled and fortified with men and armour, and in the meantime  commit barbarous and detestable insolencies and cruelties upon so many  of the poor inhabitants of that country as gave their obedience to his  Majesty,&quot; the Lords give commission to Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail to  convocate the lieges in arms  pass to the Lewis, and pursue the said Neil Macleod with fire and sword, using all kinds of &quot;warlike engines&quot; for  recovering the houses, and having power to keep trysts and intercommune  with the inhabitants of the Isles.  This commission is to continue in force  for six months. Mackenzie is one of the Highland chiefs to whom missive letters are ordered to be sent on the 23rd of June, 1608, to attend his Majesty&#x27;s service under Lord Ochiltree, at Troternish, in the Isle of Skye, on the 20th  of August following, on which occasion the soldiers must &quot;furnish  themselves with powder and bullets out of their own pay, and not out of  the King&#x27;s charges.&quot;  It is ordered at a meeting of the Privy Council held  on the 6th of February, 1609, that he, along with Simon Lord Lovat, Grant of Grant, the Earl of Caithness, Ross of Balnagown, John Mackenzie of  Gairloch, and others, be charged to appear personally before their  Lordships on the 25th of March following, to come under such order as  shall be prescribed to them touching the finding of surety and caution for the quietness and obedience of their bounds, and that no fugitive and  disobedient Islesmen shall be reset or supplied within the same, under  pain of rebellion and horning.  He appears, with some of the others, before  the Council on the 28th of March, and gives the necessary bond, but the  amount in his case is not named.  On the 7th of April, however, it appears  that he and Grant become personally bound for each other, in ?000 each,  that those for whom they are answerable shall keep the King&#x27;s peace and  that they will not reset or favour any fugitives from the Isles.  Kenneth becomes similarly bound in ?000 for John Mackenzie of Gairloch and  Donald Neilsoun Macleod of Assynt. He was one of the eight Lesser Barons who constituted the Lords of the Articles in the Scottish Parliament which met for the first time on  the 17th of June, 1609. The Privy Council, on the 22nd of the same month, committed to the Earl of Glencairn and Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail the charge of  conveying Hector Maclean of Duart from the Castle of Dumbarton to  Edinburgh and bringing him before their Lordships, &quot;for order to be taken with  him anent the affairs of the Isles, and they became bound in ?0,000  to produce him on the first Council day after the end of that year&#x27;s  Parliament.  On the 28th of the same month they enter formally into a  bond to this amount that Maclean will appear on the first Thursday of  November, he, in turn, binding himself and his heirs for their relief.  On  the 22nd of February, 1610, the bond is renewed for Maclean&#x27;s  appearance on the first Council day after that date. He appears on the 28th  of June following, and Mackenzie and the Earl of Glencairn are released from their cautionary obligations.  On the 30th of June, 1609, Kenneth and Sir George become  cautioners for Donald Gorm Macdonald of Sleat to the amount of ?0,000  that he will appear before the Lords Commissioners on the 2nd of  February next, to come under their orders, and Kenneth is charged to keep Donald Gorm&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son, &quot;who is now in his hands,&quot; until Macdonald  presents himself before the Lords Commissioners.  On the 22nd of  February, 1610, this caution is repeated for Donald&#x27;s appearance on the  8th of March.  He appears and Mackenzie is finally relieved of the bond on the 28th of June following. On the 5th of July, 1609, Mackenzie and Sir John Home of  Coldenknowes, undertake, under a penalty of ten thousand merks, that  George Earl of Caithness, shall make a free, peaceable, and sure passage to all his Majesty&#x27;s lawful subjects through his country of Caithness, in their passage to and from Orkney. At a meeting of the Council held on the 20th of February, 1610, a  commission is granted to Simon Lord Lovat, Kenneth Mackenzie of  Kintail, John Mackenzie of Gairloch, Hugh Mackay of Farr, and Roderick  Mackenzie of Redcastle, to apprehend Allan Mac Donald Duibh Mhic  Rory of Culnacnock, in Troternish, Isle of Skye, and several others,  including  &quot;Murdo Mac Gillechallum, brother of Gillecallum Raasay,  Laird of Raasay, Gillecallum Mac Rory Mhic Leoid, in Lewis, Norman  Mac Ghillechallum Mhoir, there, and Rory Mac Ghillechallum Mhoir, his  brother,&quot; all of whom &quot;remain unrelaxed from a horning of 18th January  last, raised  against them by Christian, Nighean Ian Leith, relict of Donald  Mac Alastair Roy, in Dibaig,&quot; Murdo, his son, his other kin and friends,  tenant and servants, &quot;for not finding caution to answer before the justice for the stealing of forty cows and oxen, with all the insight and plenishing  of the said late Donald Mac Alastair&#x27;s house in Dibaig, worth ?000, and  for murdering the said Donald,&quot; his tenant, and servants.  The  Commissioners are to convocate the lieges in arms for apprehending the  said rebels, and to enter them, when taken, before the justice to be suitably  punished for their crimes. Another commission is issued in favour of  Simon Lord Lovat, Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail, Donald Gorm  Macdonald of Sleat, and Donald Mac Allan Mhic Ian of Eilean Tirrim,  Captain of Clanranald, against John Mac Allan Mac Ranald, who is  described as &quot;having this long time been a murderer, common thief, and  masterful oppressor&quot; of the King&#x27;s subjects. Although Kenneth had been raised to the Peerage on the 19th of November, 1609, by the title of Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, he is not so  designated in the Privy Council Records until the 31st of May, 1610, when the patent of his creation is read and received by their Lordships, and he is  thereupon acknowledged to be a free baron in all time coming.  He is one  of the Highland chiefs charged and made answerable for good rule in the  North on the 28th of June of that year and to find caution within fifteen days, under pain of rebellion, not to reset within their bounds any  notorious thieves, rievers, fugitives, and rebels, for theft and murder,  under a further penalty, in Mackenzie&#x27;s case, of five thousand merks. At a meeting of the Privy Council held on the 19th of July, 1610, the following commission was issued in Kenneth&#x27;s favour as justiciary of  the Lewis, against Neil Macleod:-- Forasmuch as a number of the chieftains and principal men of the  Isles and continent next adjacent are come in and presented themselves  before the Lords of his Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council, and have given  satisfaction unto the said Lords anent their obedience and conformity in  time coming, so as that now there is no part of the Isles rebellious and  disobedient  but the Lewis, which being possessed and inhabited by a  number of thieves, murderers, and an infamous byke of lawless and  insolent limmers under the charge and command of the traitor Neil  Macleod, who has usurped upon him the authority and possession of the  Lewis, and they, concurring altogether in a rebellious society, do commit many murders, slaughters, riefs, and villianies, not only among themselves  but upon his Majesty&#x27;s peaceable and good subjects who resorted among them in their trade of fishing, and by their barbarous and savage behaviour  against his Majesty&#x27;s good subjects they have made the trade of fishing in  the Lewis, which was most profitable for the whole country, to become  always unprofitable, to the great hurt of the commonweal.  And the Lords  of Secret Council finding it a discredit to the country that such a parcel of  ground, possessed by a number of miserable caitiffs, shall be suffered to continue rebellious, whereas the whole remanent Isles are become  peaceable and obedient, and the said Lords understand the good affection  of Kenneth, Lord Kintail and his willing disposition to undergo all pains and trouble in his Majesty&#x27;s service.  Therefore the said Lords has made  and constituted, and by the tenour hereof makes and constitutes, the said Kenneth Lord Kintail, his Majesty&#x27;s justice and commissioner over the  whole boundaries of the Lewis, to the effect under-written, with full  power, commission, and authority to him to convocate his Majesty&#x27;s  lieges in arms, to levy and take up men of war, to appoint captains and  commanders over them, and with them to pass to the Lewis, and there,  with tire and sword, and all kind of hostility, to search, seek, hunt, follow,  and pursue the said Neil, his accomplices, assistants, and partakers, by sea and land, wherever they may be apprehended, and to mell, confiscate, and  intromit with their goods and gear, and to dispone thereupon at their  pleasure, and to keep such of their persons as shall be taken in sure  firmance till justice he ministered upon them, conform to the laws of this  realm, courts of justiciary within the said bounds to sit, begin, affix, hold,  and continue suits to be made called &quot;absentis to amerchiat,&quot; trespasses to  punish, all and sundry persons inhabitants of the Lewis suspected and  delayed of murder, slaughter, fire-raising, theft, and reset of theft, and other capital crimes, to search, seek, take, apprehend, commit to prison, and to enter them upon panel by dittay to accuse them, and to put them to the knowledge of an assize, and as they shall happen to be found culpable or innocent of the said crimes, or any of them, to cause justice be  administered upon them conform to the laws of this realm  assize needful  to this effect, each person under the pain of forty pounds, to summon,  warn, chase, and cause be sworn, clerks, serjeants, dempsters, and all  other officers and members of court needful, to make, create, substitute  and ordain, for whom he shall be held to answer with power likewise to  our said justice, for the better execution of this commission to take the lymphads, galleys, birlinns, and boats, in the next adjacent Isles, and in the  Lewis, for the furtherance of them in their service, the said justice being  always answerable to the owners of the said lymphads, galleys, birlinns,  and bouts for redelivery of the same at the finishing of his Majesty&#x27;s  service  with power likewise to the said justice and persons assisting him  in the execution of this commission to bear, wear, and use hagbutis, pistols, and petards.  And if in pursuit of this commission there shall  happen slaughter, mutilation fire-raising, or any other inconvenience, to follow, the said Lords decern and declare that the same shall not be  imputed as crime or offence to the said justice nor persons assisting him in  the execution of this Commission, nor that they, nor none of them, shall  not be called nor accused therefore criminally nor civilly by any manner  of way in time coming; exonerating them of all pain, crime, and danger,  that they may incur therethrough for ever.  And generally all and sundry other things to do, exercise, and use, which for execution of this commission are requisite and necessary, firm, and stable, holding and for to hold all and whatsoever things shall be lawfully done herein.  And that  letters of publication be directed hereupon charging all his Majesty&#x27;s  lieges within the whole boundaries of the North Isles of this Kingdom and within the bounds of the said Lord&#x27;s own lands, heritages, possessions,  offices, and baillies, excepting always the persons of the name of Fraser,  Ross, and Munro, their tenants and servants, to reverance. acknowledge,  and obey, rise, concur, pass forward, fortify, and assist the said Kenneth,  Lord Kintail, in all things tending to the execution of his commission, and  to convene in arms with him at such times, days, and places, as he shall  please appoint, as they and each one of them will answer upon their  obedience at their highest peril. This commission for the space of two  years after the date hereof, without revocation, to endure. Soon after this, Neil apprehended a crew of English pirates who had been carrying on their nefarious traffic among the fishermen from the South and other places who frequented the prolific fishing banks, by  which, then as now, the island was surrounded.  This meritorious public  service secured some consideration for him at Court, as appears from the  following letter addressed to Lord Kintail under date of 29th August, 1610 -- After our very hearty commendations to your good Lordship:--  Whereas Neil Macleod in the Lewis has of late done some good service to  his Majesty and the country by the taking and apprehension of certain English pirates upon the coast of the Lewis, common enemies to all lawful traffic, whereby he has merited his Majesty&#x27;s grace and pardon in some  measure to be shown unto him, and he having made promise and  condition for delivery of the pirates and their ships to such persons as shall  be directed by us to receive them we have thereupon given an assurance to him to come here to us and to remain at his pleasure until Whitsunday  next, that some good course may be taken for settling him in quietness;  and in this meantime we have promised that all hostility and persuit of  him and his followers shall rest and cease until the said term, and also that  we shall deal and trouble with your Lordship for some reasonable ease and condition to be given to him and his followers, all tenants to your Lordship  of the lands and possessions claimed by them.  And, we being careful that our word and promise made and given hereupon shall be effectual and  valid we have therefore thought meet to acquaint your Lordship therewith, requesting your Lordship to forbear all persuit, trouble, and invasion of the  said Neil and his followers until the said term, and that your Lordship will  take some such course with them as upon reasonable conditions they may  be received and acknowledged by your Lordship as tenants of those lands  claimed by them.  Wherein looking to find your Lordship conformable, we  commit you to God. Neil does not then appear to have gone to Edinburgh, but he gave up the pirate, the captain, and ten of her crew to Patrick Grieve, a burgess  of Burntisland, who, on the 10th of September, received a commission &quot;to  sail with a hired ship&quot; to the Lewis for that purpose.  On the 10th of  October, Macleod writes to the Council acknowledging receipt, &quot;from this  bearer, Patrick Grieve,&quot; of their Lordships&#x27; order upon him to deliver up the pirate and all her belongings. On the 19th of July, the same day on which the Commission  against Neil Macleod was granted to Lord Kintail, the Council &quot;being careful that the present peace and quietness in the Isles shall be fostered,  kept, and entertained, and all such occasions removed and taken away  whereby any new disorder, trouble, or misrule may be reinstated within  the same, has therefore thought meet that Rory Macleod, son to the late  Torquil Dubh Macleod, who has been this long time in the keeping of  Donald Gorm of Sleat, and (Torquil) Macleod, another of the said late  Torquil&#x27;s sons, who has been this long time in keeping of Rory Macleod  of Harris, shall be delivered to Kenneth Lord Kintail, to be kept by him  until the said  Lord take order with them for their obedience.&quot;  Charges are  thereupon made upon the chiefs of Sleat and Harris &quot;to bring, present, and  deliver&quot; Torquil Dubh&#x27;s two sons, &quot;in their keeping,&quot; to the Mackenzie  chief, to be kept by him until such order is taken for their good behaviour. They are to be delivered within thirty days, under the usual pains of  rebellion and horning. He is one of the Commissioners of the Peace appointed by the  King on the 6th of November, in 1610, in terms of a newly-passed Act of Parliament, for Inverness-shire (including Ross) and Cromarty, his colleagues from among the clan for these counties being Roderick Mackenzie of Redcastle, Roderick Mackenzie of Coigeach, and John Mackenzie of Gairloch.  He was at the same time appointed in a similar  capacity for Elgin, Forres, and Nairn. Mackenzie had for some time kept Tormod Macleod, the lawful  brother of Torquil Dubh, a prisoner, but he now released him, correctly premising that on his appearance in the Lewis all the islanders would rise  in his favour.  In the meantime, early in 1600, Murdoch Dubh was taken  by the Fife Adventurers to St Andrews, and there put to death; but at his execution he revealed, in his confession, the designs of Mackenzie, who  was in  consequence apprehended and committed to Edinburgh Castle,  from which, however, he contrived to escape without trial, through his  influence with the Lord Chancellor. There is an entry in the Records of the Privy Council under date of  15th August, 1599, which shows that Kintail must at an earlier date have  been confined in Edinburgh Castle, for some previous offence, for &quot;it  having pleased the King to suffer Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail to repair  furth of the Castle of Edinburgh for four or five miles, when he shall think  expedient, for repose, health, and recreation&quot; on caution being given by  himself as principal, and Robert Lord Seton as surety, that he shall re-enter the Castle every night, under pain of ten thousand merks.  The bond is signed on the same date, and is deleted by warrant signed by the King, and the Treasurer, on the 25th of September following. After various battles had been fought between the brothers, the Adventurers returned in strong force to the island, armed with a commission of fire and sword, and all the Government power at their back, against Tormod.  The fight between the combatants continued with  varied success and failure on either side; the Adventurers again  relinquished their settlement, and returned to Fife to bewail their losses,  having solemnly promised never again to return to the Island or molest  Mackenzie and his friends. Kintail now, in virtue of Torquil Cononach&#x27;s resignation in his favour, obtained a gift, under the Great Seal, of the Lewis for himself  through the influence of the Lord Chancellor.  This he had, however,  ultimately to resign into the hands of the King, and his Majesty, in 1608,  vested these rights in the persons of Lord Balmerino, Sir George Hay, and Sir James Spence, of Wormistoun, who undertook the colonisation of the  island.  For this purpose they made great preparations, and, assisted by the  neighbouring tribes, invaded the Lewis for the double purpose of planting a colony in it and of subduing and apprehending Neil Macleod, who now  alone defended it.  Mackenzie dispatched his brother Roderick, and Alexander Mackenzie of Coul, with a party of followers numbering 400,  ostensibly to aid the colonists now acting under the King&#x27;s commission to whom he promised active friendship.  At the same time he despatched a  vessel from Ross loaded with provisions, but privately sent word to Neil  Macleod to intercept her on the way, so that the settlers, being  disappointed of their supply of the provisions to which they trusted  for maintenance,  should  be obliged  to abandon the island for want of the  necessaries of life. Matters turned out exactly as Kintail anticipated. Sir  George Hay and Sir James Spence (Lord Balmerino having meanwhile been convicted of high treason, and forfeited) abandoned the Lewis, leaving a party behind them to hold the garrison, and intending to send a fresh supply of men and provisions back to the island on their arrival in Fife.  But Neil Macleod and his followers took and burnt the fort,  apprehended its defenders, and sent them safely to their homes &quot;on giving their oath that they would never come on that pretence again, which they  never did.&quot;  Finding this, the Adventurers gave up all hope of establishing  themselves in the island, and sold their acquired rights therein, as also their share of the forfeited districts of Troternish and Waternish in Skye, to Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail, who at the same time obtained a grant  from the King of Balmerino&#x27;s forfeited share of the Lewis, thus finally  acquiring what he had so long and so anxiously desired.  In addition to a fixed sum of money, Mackenzie granted the Adventurers &quot;a lease of the  woods of Letterewe, where there was an iron mine, which they wrought by  English miners, casting guns and other implements till their fuel was  exhausted and their lease expired.&quot;  The King confirmed this agreement,  and &quot;to encourage Kintail and his brother Roderick in their work of  civilizing the people of the Lewis,&quot; he elevated the former to the peerage  as Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, on the 19th of November, 1609, at the same  time conferring the honour of knighthood on his brother, Roderick Mor  Mackenzie of Coigeach. Referring to this period Mr Fraser-Tytler, in his History of  Scotland, says--&quot;So dreadful indeed was now the state of those portions of his (the King&#x27;s) dominions, that, to prevent an utter dissevering from  the  Scottish crown, something must be done, and many were the projects  suggested.  At one time the King resolved to proceed to the disturbed  districts in person, and fix his headquarters in Kentire; at another, a deputy  was to be sent, armed with regal powers; and twice the Duke of Lennox  was nominated to this arduous office.  The old plan, too, might have been repeated, of granting a Royal Commission to one or other of the northern  Reguli, who were ever prepared, under the plea of loyalty, to strengthen  their own hands, and exterminate their brethren; but this, as had been often felt before, was to abandon the country to utter devastation; and a more pacific and singular policy was now adopted.  One association of  Lowland barons, chiefly from Fife, took a lease from the Crown of the Isle  of Lewis, for which they agreed, after seven years&#x27; possession, to give the  King an annual rent of one hundred and forty chalders of victual; and  came under an obligation to conquer their farm at their own charges. Another company of noble-men and gentlemen in Lothian offered, under a  similar agreement, to subdue Skye.  And this kind of feudal joint-stock  company actually commenced their operations with a force of six hundred  soldiers, and a motley multitude of farmers, ploughmen, artificers, and  pedlars.  But the Celtic population and their haughty chiefs could not  consent to be handed over, in this wholesale fashion, to the tender mercies  and agricultural lectures of a set of Saxon adventurers.  The Lowland  barons arrived, only to be attacked with the utmost fury, and to have the leases of their farms, in the old Douglas phrase, written on their own skins  with steel pens and bloody ink.  For a time, however, they continued the  struggle and having entered into alliance with some of the native chiefs, fought the Celts with their own weapons, and more than their own  ferocity.  Instead of agricultural and pastoral produce, importations of  wool, or samples of grain, from the infant colony, there was sent to the  Scottish Court a ghastly cargo of twelve human heads in sacks; and it was hoped that, after such an example of severity, matters might succeed  better.  But the settlers were deceived.  After a feeble and protracted  struggle for a few years, sickness and famine, perils by land and perils by  water, incessant war, and frequent assassinations, destroyed the colony; and the three great western chiefs, Macdonald of Sleat, Macleod of Harris,  and Mackenzie of Kintail, enjoyed the delight of seeing the principal  gentlemen adventurers made captive by Tormod Macleod; who, after  extorting from them a renunciation of their titles, and an oath never to  return to the Lewis, dismissed them to carry to the Scottish Court the  melancholy reflection that a Celtic population, and the islands on which it  was scattered, were not yet the materials or the field for the further  operations of the economists of Fife and Mid-Lothian.&quot; In 1610 his Lordship returned to the Lewis with 700 men, and finally brought the whole island to submission, with the exception of Neil  Macleod and a few of his followers, who retired to the rock of Berissay,  and took possession of it.  At this period religion must have been at a very  low ebb--almost extinct among the inhabitants; and, to revive Christianity  among them, his Lordship selected and took along with him the Rev.  Farquhar Macrae, a native of Kintail and minister of Gairloch, [He  brought with him Mr Farquhar Macrae, who was then a young man and  minister of Gairloch and appointed by the Bishop of Ross (Lesley) to stay with Sir George Hay and the Englishmen that were with him in Letterewe,  being a peaceful and eloquent preacher.--Ardintoul MS.] who had been recommended to the latter charge by the bishop of Ross.  Mr Macrae found quite enough to do on his arrival in the island, but he appears to  have been very successful among the uncivilised natives; for he reports  having gained many over to Christianity; baptised a large number in the  fortieth year of their age; and, to legitimise their children, marrying many  others to those women with whom they had been for years cohabiting.   Leaving the reverend gentleman in the prosecution of his mission, his  Lordship returned home, having established good order in the island, and  promising to return again the following year, to the great satisfaction of  the people. Some time before this Alexander MacGorrie and Ranald MacRory, sons of Glengarry&#x27;s uncles murdered in 1580 in Lochcarron, having arrived at maturity, and being brave and intrepid fellows, determined to  revenge upon Mackenzie the death of their parents.  With this object they went to Appelcross, where lived one of the murderers, John Og, son of  Angus, MacEachainn, surrounded his house, and set lire to it, burning to  death himself and his whole family.  Kintail sought redress from  Glengarry, who, while he did not absolutely refuse, did not grant it or  punish the wrong-doers; and encouraged by Glengarry&#x27;s eldest son, Angus,  who had now attained his majority, the cousins, taking advantage of the  absence of Mackenzie, who had gone on a visit to France, continued their  depredations and insolence wherever they found opportunity.  Besides,  they made a complaint against him to the Privy Council, whereupon he  was charged at the pier of Leith to appear before the Council on an appointed day under pain of forfeiture.  In this emergency, Mr John  Mackenzie, minister of Dingwall, went privately to France in search of his  chief, whom he found and brought back in the most secret manner to  Edinburgh, fortunately in time to present himself next day after his arrival  before the Council, in terms of the summons at Glengarry&#x27;s instance; and, after consulting his legal adviser and other friends, he appeared quite  unexpectedly before their Lordships. Meantime, while the gentlemen were on their way from France, Alexander MacGorrie and Alexander MacRory killed in his bed Donald Mackenneth Mhic Alastair, a gentleman of the family of Davochmaluag, who lived at Kishorn.  The shirt, covered with his blood, had been sent to  Edinburgh to await the arrival of Mackenzie, who the same day presented  it before the Privy Council, as evidence of the foul crime committed by his  accusers.  Glengarry was unable to prove anything material against Kintail  or his followers.  On the contrary, the Rev. John Mackenzie, of Dingwall, charged Glengarry with being instrumental in the murder of John Og and  his family at Applecross, as also in that of Donald Mackenzie of  Davochmaluag, and undertook not only to prove this, but also that he was  a sorner, an oppressor of his own and of his neighbours&#x27; tenants, an idolater, who had a man in Lochbroom making images, in testimony of  which he carried south the image of St. Coan, which Glengarry worshipped, called in Edinburgh Glengarry&#x27;s god, and which was, by  public order, burnt at the Town Cross that Glengarry was a man who lived  in constant adultery with the Captain of Clan Ranald&#x27;s daughter, after he had put away Grant of Grant&#x27;s daughter, his lawful wife; whereupon  Glengarry was summoned there and then to appear next day before the  Council, and to lodge defences to this unexpected charge.  He naturally  became alarmed, and fearing the worst, fled from the city during the night,  &quot;took to his heels,&quot; and gave up further legal proceedings against  Mackenzie.  Being afterwards repeatedly summoned, and failing to put in  an appearance, most of the charges were found proven against him; and in  1602, [Records of Privy Council, 9th September, 1602; Sir Robert  Gordon&#x27;s Earldom of Sutherland, p. 248; Letterfearn, Ardintoul, and other MS. Histories of the Mackenzies.] he was declared outlaw and rebel; a  commission of fire and sword was granted to Mackenzie against him and  all his followers, with a decree of ransom for the loss of those who were burnt and plundered by him, and for Kintail&#x27;s charges and expenses,  making altogether a very large sum.  But while these legal matters were  being arranged, Angus Macdonald, younger of Glengarry, who was of a  restless, daring disposition, went along with some of his followers under silence of night to Kintail, burnt the township of Cro, killed and burnt  several men, women, and children, and carried away a large spoil of  cattle. Mackenzie, hearing of this sudden raid, became much concerned about the loss of his Kintail tenants, and decided to requite the quarrel by  at once executing his commission against the Macdonalds of Glengarry,  and immediately set out in pursuit, leaving a sufficient number of men at home to secure the safety of his property.  He took along with him a force  of seventeen hundred men, at the same time taking three hundred cows  from his farm of Strathbraan to maintain his followers.  Ross of  Balnagowan sent a party of a hundred and eighty men, under command of  Alexander Ross of Invercharron, to aid his neighbour of Kintail, while  John Gordon of Embo commanded a hundred and twenty men sent to his  aid by the Earl of Sutherland, in virtue of the long standing bond of  manrent which existed between the two families; but Sir John &quot;retired at  Monar, growing faint-hearted before he saw the enemie&quot;.  Andrew Munro  of Novar also accompanied Kintail on this, as on several previous  expeditions. The Macdonalds, hearing of Mackenzie&#x27;s approach, drove  all their cattle to Monar, where they gathered in strong force to guard  them. Kintail, learning this, marched straight where they were; harried and wasted all the country through which he had to pass; defeated and  routed the Macdonalds, and drove into Kintail the largest booty ever heard  of in the Highlands of Scotland, &quot;both of cows, horses, small bestial, duinuasals, and plenishing, which he most generously distributed amongst his  soldiers, and especially amongst such strangers as were with him, so that John Gordon of Embo was at his repentance for his return.&quot; Mackenzie  had only two men killed in this expedition, though a few of the Kintail  men, whom he caused to be carried home on litters, were wounded. Several instances are recorded of the prowess and intrepidity of  Alexander of Coul on this occasion.  He was, excepting John MacMhurchaidh Mhic Gillechriost, the fastest runner in the Mackenzie country.  On his way to Kintail, leading his men and driving the creach  before them, he met three or four hundred Camerons, who sent Mackenzie  a message demanding &quot;a bounty of the booty&quot; for passing through their  territory.  This Kenneth was about to grant, and ordered thirty cows and a  few of the younger animals to be given, saying that it &quot;was fit that hungry  dogs should get a collop;&quot; whereupon Alexander of Coul and his brave  band of one hundred and twenty followers started aside and swore with a  great oath that if the Camerons dared to take away a single head, they  would, before night, pay dearly for them, and have to light for their collop; for he and his men, he said, had already nearly lost their lives driving them  through a wild and narrow pass where eighteen of the enemy fell to their  swords before they were able to get the cattle through; but he would now  let them pass in obedience to his chief&#x27;s commands.  The messengers,  hearing the ominous threat, notwithstanding Kenneth&#x27;s personal  persuasion, declined on any account to take the cattle, and marched away  &quot;empty as they came.&quot; Before starting from home on this expedition Kintail drove every one of Glengarry&#x27;s followers out of their holdings in Lochalsh and  Lochcarron, except a few of the &quot;Mathewsons and the Clann Jan Uidhir,&quot;  and any others who promised to submit to him and engaged to prove their  sincerity by &quot;imbrowing their bands in the enemy&#x27;s blood.&quot;  The Castle of Strome, however, still continued in possession of the Macdonalds. Mackenzie, after his return home, had not well dissolved his camp when Alexander MacGorrie and Ranald MacRory made an incursion to  the district of Kenlochewe, and there meeting some women and children who had fled from Lochcarron with their cattle, he attacked them unexpectedly, killed several of the defenceless women, all the male  children, slaughtered and took away many of the cattle, and &quot;houghed&quot; all they were not able to carry along with them. In the following autumn, Alexander MacGorrie made a voyage to  Applecross in a great galley, contrary to the advice of all his friends, who looked upon that place as a sanctuary which all Highlanders had hitherto  respected as the property of the Church.  Notwithstanding that many took  refuge in it in the past, he was the first man who ever pursued a fugitive to  the place, &quot;but,&quot; says our authority, &quot;it fared no better with him or he  rested, but be being informed that some Kintail men, whom he thought no  sin to kill anywhere,&quot; bad taken refuge there with their cattle, he  determined to kill them, but on his arrival he found only two poor fellows,  tending their cows.  These he murdered, slaughtered all the cows, and took away as many of them as his boat would carry. A few days after this, Glengarry combined with the Clann Alain of Moydart (whose chief was at the time captain of Clan Ranald&#x27;s men), the  Clann Ian Uidhir, and several others of the Macdonalds, who gathered  together amongst them thirty-seven birlinns with the intention of sailing to  Lochbroom, and on their return to burn and harry the whole of the  Mackenzie territories on the west coast. Coming to an arm of the sea on  the east side of Kyleakin called Loch na Beist, opposite Lochalsh, they  sent Alexander MacGorrie forward with eighty men in a large galley to  examine the coast in advance of the main body.  They first landed in  Applecross, in the same spot where MacGorrie had previously killed the  two Kintail men.  Kenneth was at the time on a visit to Mackenzie of  Gairloch, at his house on Island Rory in Loch-Maree, and hearing of  Glengarry&#x27;s approach and the object of his visit, he ordered all his coasts  to be placed in readiness, and sent Alexander Mackenzie of Achilty with sixteen men and eight oarsmen, in an eight oared galley belonging to John Tolmach Macleod, son of Rory, son of Allan Macleod, who still possessed  a small portion of Gairloch, to watch the enemy and examine the coast as  far as Kylerhea.  John Tolmach himself accompanied them, in charge of  the galley.  On their way south they landed by the merest chance at  Applecross, on the north side of the point at which MacGorrie landed,  where they noticed a woman gathering shellfish on the shore, and who no  sooner saw them than she came forward and informed them that a great  galley had landed in the morning on the other side of the promontory. This they at once suspected to contain an advanced scout of the enemy,  and, ordering their boat round the point, in charge of the oarsmen, they  took the shortest cut across the neck of land, and, when half way along,  they met one of Macdonald&#x27;s sentries lying sound asleep on the ground.   He was soon sent to his long rest; and the Mackenzies blowing up a set of bagpipes found lying beside him, rushed towards the Macdonalds, who,  suddenly surprised and alarmed by the sound of the Piob mhor, and  thinking a strong force was falling down upon them, fled to their boat,  except MacGorrie, who, when he left it, swore a great oath that he would  never return with his back to the enemy; but finding it impossible single-handed to resist, he retired a little, closely followed by the Mackenzies who furiously attacked him.  He was now forced to draw aside to a rock,  against which he placed his back, and fought right manfully, defending  himself with extraordinary intrepidity, receiving the enemy&#x27;s arrows in his  targe.  He was ultimately wounded by an arrow which struck him under  the belt, yet no one dared to approach him; but John Dubh Mac Choinnich  Mhic Mhurchaidh noticing his amazing agility, observing that his party  had arrived with the boat, and fearing they would lose Glengarry&#x27;s galley unless they at once pursued it, went round to the back of the rock against  which the brave Macdonald stood, carrying a great boulder, which he  dropped straight on to MacGorrie&#x27;s head, instantly killing him.  Thus died the most skilful and best chieftain--had he possessed equal wisdom and  discretion--then alive among the Macdonalds of Glengarry. The Mackenzies immediately took to their boat, pursuing  Macdonald&#x27;s galley to Loch na Beist, where, noticing the enemy&#x27;s whole  fleet coming out against them, John Tolmach Macleod recommended his  men to put out to sea; but finding the fleet gaining upon them, they decided to land in Applecross, where they were nearly overtaken by the  enemy.  They were obliged to leave their boat and run for their lives, hotly  pursued by the Macdonalds; and were it not that one of Mackenzie&#x27;s men  --John Mac Rory Mhic Mhurchaidh Mathewson--was so well acquainted  with the ground, and led them to a ford on the river between two rocks,  which the Macdonalds missed, and the night coming on, they would have  been unable to escape with their lives.  The Macdonalds retraced their  steps to their boats, and on the way discovered the body of Alexander  MacGorrie, whose death &quot;put their boasting to mourning,&quot; and conceiving  his fate ominous of additional misfortunes, they, carrying him along with them, prudently returned home, and disbanded all their followers.  In the flight of the Mackenzies Alexander of Achilty, being so stout that he  fainted on the way, was nearly captured.  John MacChoinnich, who  noticed him falling, threw some water on him, and, drawing his sword,  swore that he would kill him on the spot if he did not get up at once rather  than that the enemy should have the honour of killing or capturing him.   They soon arrived at Gairloch&#x27;s house in the island on Loch-Maree, and  gave a full account of their expedition, whereupon Kintail at once decided  upon taking active measures against the Macdonalds.  In the meantime he  was assured that they had returned to their own country.  He soon returned home, and found that the people of Kintail and Glengarry, tiring of those incessant slaughters and mutual injuries, agreed, during his absence, in the  month of May, to cease hostilities until the following Lammas.  Of this  agreement Kintail knew nothing; and young Glengarry, who was of an  exceedingly bold and restless disposition, against the earnest solicitations  of his father, who became a party to this agreement between his people  and those of Kintail, started with a strong force to Glenshiel and  Letterfearn, while Allan Macdonald of Lundy with another party went to  Glenelchaig, harried those places, took away a large number of cattle, and  killed some of the aged men, several women, and all the male children. They found none of the principal and able-bodied men, who had withdrawn some distance that they might with greater advantage gather together in a body and defend themselves, except Duncan MacIan Mhic  Ghillechallum in Killichirtorn, whom the enemy apprehended, and would  have killed, had not one of the Macdonalds, formerly his friend and  acquaintance, prevailed upon young Glengarry to save his life, and send  him to the Castle of Strome, where he still had a garrison, rather than kill  him. The successful result of this expedition encouraged Angus so much that he began to think fortune had at last turned in his favour, and he set  out and called personally upon all the chief and leaders of the various  branches of the Macdonalds in the west, soliciting their assistance against  the Mackenzies, which they all agreed to give him in the following spring. This soon came to Mackenzie&#x27;s knowledge, who was at the time residing in Ellandonnan Castle; and fearing the consequences of such a  powerful combination against him, he went privately to Mull by sea to  consult his brother-in-law, Hector Og Maclean of Duart, to whom he told  that he had a commission of fire and sword against &quot;the rebels of  Glengarry and such as would rise in arms to assist them, and being  informed that the Macdonalds near him (Maclean) had combined to join  them, and to put him to further trouble, that, therefore, he would, not only  as a good subject but as his fast friend, divert these whenever they should  rise in arms against him.&quot; [Ardintoul MS.]  Maclean undertook to prevent  the assistance of the Clan Ranald of Isla and the Macdonalds of Glencoe  and Ardnamurchan, by, if necessary, invading their territories, and thus  compelling them to protect their own interests at home.  It appears that old  Glengarry was still anxious to arrange a permanent peace with Mackenzie;  but his son Angus, restless and turbulent as ever, would not hear of any  peaceful settlement, and determined to start at once upon an expedition,  from which his father told him at the time he had little hopes of his ever  returning alive--a prediction which turned out only too true. Angus, taking advantage of Mackenzie&#x27;s absence in Mull,  gathered, in the latter end of November, as secretly as be could, all the boats and great galleys within his reach, and, with this large fleet loaded  with his followers passed through the Kyles under silence of night; and,  coming to Lochcarron, he sent his marauders ashore in the twilight.  The  inhabitants perceiving them, escaped to the hills, but the Macdonalds  cruelly slaughtered all the aged men who could not escape, and many of  the women and children seized all the cattle, and drove them to the Island  of Slumbay, where their boats which they filled with the carcases lay. Before, however, they had fully loaded, the alarm having gone through the districts of Lochalsh and Kintail, some of the natives of those districts were seen marching in the direction of Lochcarron. The Macdonalds  deemed it prudent to remain no longer, and set out to sea pursued by a  shower of arrows by way of farewell, which, however, had little effect  upon them, as they were already out of range. The Kintail men, by the shortest route, now returned to  Ellandonnan, sending twelve of the swiftest of their number across  country to Inverinate, where lay, newly built, a twelve-oared galley, which had never been to sea, belonging to Gillecriost MacDhonnchaidh, one of  Inverinate&#x27;s tenants.  These heroes made such rapid progress that they  were back at the castle with the boat before many of their companions  arrived from Lochcarron.  During the night they set to work, superintended  and encouraged by Lady Mackenzie in person, to make arrangements to go  out and meet the enemy.  The best men were quickly picked.  The Lady  supplied them with all the materials and necessaries for the journey within  her reach, handed them the lead and powder with her own hands, and gave  them two small pieces of brass ordnance.  She ordered Duncan  MacGillechriost, a powerful handsome fellow, to take command of the  galley in his father&#x27;s absence, and in eloquent terms charged them all with  the honour of her house and her own protection in her husband&#x27;s absence. This was hardly necessary, for the Kintail men had not yet forgotten the  breach of faith which had been committed by Macdonald regarding the  recent agreement to cease hostilities for a stated time, and other recent sores.  Her ladyship having wished them God-speed, they started on their  way rejoicing and in the best of spirits. She mounted the castle walls, and  stood there encouraging them until, by the darkness of the night, she could  no longer see them. On their way towards Kylerhea they met a boat from Lochalsh sent out to inform them of the enemy&#x27;s arrival at Kyleakin.  Learning this, they  cautiously kept their course close to the south side of the loch.  It was a  calm moonlight night, with occasional slight showers of snow.  The tide  had already begun to flow, and, judging that the Macdonalds would await  the next turning of the tide to enable them to get through Kylerhea, the  Kintail men, longing for their prey, resolved to advance and meet them. They had not proceeded far, rowing very gently, after placing seaweed in  the rowlocks so as not to make a noise, when they noticed a boat, rowing  at the hardest, coming in their direction; but from its small size they  thought it must have been sent by the Macdonalds in advance to test the  passage of Kylerhea.  They therefore allowed it to pass unmolested, and  proceeded northward, looking for Macdonald&#x27;s own galley.  As they  neared the Cailleach, a low rock midway between both Kyles, it was  observed in the distance covered with snow.  The night also favoured  them, the sea, calm, appearing black and mournful to the enemy.  Here  they met Macdonald&#x27;s first galley, and drawing up near it, they soon  discovered it to be no other than his own great birlinn, some distance  ahead of the rest of the fleet. Macdonald, as soon as he noticed them,  called out &quot;Who is there?&quot; twice in succession, but receiving no answer,  and finding the Kintail men drawing nearer, he called out the third time, when, in reply, he received a full broadside from Mackenzie&#x27;s cannon,  which disabled his galley and threw her on the Cailleach Rock. The men on board Macdonald&#x27;s galley thought they had been  driven on shore, and flocked to the fore part of the boat, striving to escape,  thus capsizing and filling the birlinn.  Discovering their position, and  seeing a long stretch of sea lying between them and the mainland, they  became quite confused, and were completely at the mercy of their  enemies, who sent some of their men ashore to despatch any of the poor  wretches who might swim ashore, while others remained in their boat  killing and drowning the Macdonalds. Such of them as managed to reach  the land were also killed or drowned by those of the Kintail men who went ashore, not a soul out of the sixty men on board the galley having escaped  except Angus Macdonald himself still breathing, though he had been  wounded twice in the head and once in the body.  He was yet alive when  they took him aboard their galley, but he died before morning.  Hearing  the uproar, several of the Lochalsh people went out with all speed in two small boats, under command of Dugall Mac Mhurchaidh Matthewson, to  take part in the fray; but by the time they arrived at the scene of action few  of Macdonald&#x27;s followers were alive.  Thus ended the career of Angus,  younger of Glengarry, a chief to whom his followers looked up, and whom  they justly regarded as a bold and intrepid leader, though deficient in  prudence and strategy. The remainder of Macdonald&#x27;s fleet, to the number of twenty-one, following behind his own galley, having heard the uproar, returned to  Kyleakin in such terror and confusion that each thought his nearest  neighbour was pursuing him.  Landing in Strathardale, they left their boats  &quot;and their ill-cooked beef to these hungry gentlemen,&quot; and before they  slept they arrived in Sleat, from whence they were sent across to the  mainland in the small boats of the laird. The great concern and anxiety of her ladyship of Ellandonnan can be easily conceived, for all that she had yet learnt was the simple fact that  an engagement of some kind had taken place, and this she only knew from  having heard the sound of cannon during the night. Early in the morning  she noticed her protectors returning with their birlinn, accompanied by  another great galley.  This brightened her hopes, and going down to the  shore to meet them, she heartily saluted them, and asked if all had gone  well with them.  &quot;Yea, Madam,&quot; answered their leader, Duncan  MacGillechriost, &quot;we have brought you a new guest, without the loss of a  single man, whom we hope is welcome to your ladyship.&quot;  She looked into  the galley, and at once recognising the body of Angus of Glengarry, she  ordered it to be carried ashore and properly attended to.  The men  proposed that he should be buried in the tomb of his predecessors, &quot;Cnoc  nan Aingeal,&quot; in Lochalsh; but this she objected to, observing that, if he  could, her husband would never allow a Macdonald, dead or alive, any  further possession in that locality, at the same time ordering young  Glengarry to be buried with her own children, and such other children of  the predecessors of the Mackenzies of Kintail as were buried in Kilduich, saying that she considered it no disparagement for him to be buried with  such cousins; and if it were her own fate to die in Kintail, she would  desire to be interred amongst them.  The proposal was agreed to, and  everything having been got ready suitable for the funeral of a gentleman of his rank-such as the place could afford in the circumstances-he was buried  next day in Kilduich, in the same tomb as Mackenzie&#x27;s own children. This is not the most generally received account regarding Angus Macdonald&#x27;s burial; but we are glad, for the credit of our common humanity, to find the following conclusive testimony in an imperfect but excellently written MS. of the seventeenth century, otherwise remarkably  correct and trustworthy:--&quot;Some person, out of what reason I cannot tell,  will needs affirm he was buried in the church door, as men go out and in, which to my certain knowledge is a malicious lie, for with my very eyes I have seen his head raised out of the same grave and returned again,  wherein there was two small cuts, noways deep.&quot; [Ancient MS.] The author of the Ardintoul MS. informs us that MacLean had  actually invaded Ardnamurchan, and carried fire and sword into that and  the adjoining territory of the Macdonalds, whereupon the Earl of Argyll, who claimed the Macdonalds of those districts as his vassals and dependants, obtained criminal letters against MacLean, who, finding this, sent for his brother-in-law, Mackenzie of Kintail, at whose request he had  invaded the country of the Macdonalds.  Both started for Inveraray.  The  Earl seemed most determined to punish MacLean, but Mackenzie  informed him that &quot;he should rather be blamed for it than MacLean, and  the King and Council than either of them, for he having obtained, upon  good grounds, a commission of fire and sword against Glengarry and such  as would assist him, and against these men&#x27;s rebellious and wicked  courses, which frequently his lordship seemed to own, that he did charge, as he did several others of the king&#x27;s loyal subjects, MacLean to assist  him.&quot;  So that, if Maclean was to be punished for acting as his friend and as a loyal subject, he hoped to obtain a hearing before the King and  Council under whose orders he acted.  After considerable discussion they  parted good friends, Argyll having agreed not to molest MacLean any  further.  Mackenzie and MacLean returned to Duart, where his lordship  was warmly received and sumptuously entertained by MacLean&#x27;s  immediate friends and kinsmen for the service which he had just rendered  to their chief.  While thus engaged, a messenger arrived at the castle from  Mackenzie&#x27;s lady and the Kintail men. After the funeral of young Angus of Glengarry, she became  concerned about her husband&#x27;s safe return, and was at the same time most anxious that he should be advised of the state of matters at home. She  therefore despatched Robert Mac Dhomh&#x27;uill Uidhir to arrange the safest  plan for bringing her lord safely home, as the Macdonalds were still  prowling among the creeks and bays further south. Robert, after the  interchange of unimportant preliminaries, on his arrival in Mull, informed  his master of all that had taken place during his absence.  MacLean,  surprised to hear of such gallant conduct by the Kintail men in the absence  of their chief, asked Mackenzie if any of his own kinsmen were amongst  them, and being informed they were not, Maclean replied, &quot;It was a great  and audacious deed to be done by fellows.&quot;  &quot;Truly, MacLean,&quot; returned Mackenzie, &quot;they were not fellows that were there, but prime gentlemen,  and such fellows as would act the enterprise better than myself and  kinsmen.&quot;  &quot;You have very great reason to make the more of them,&quot; said  Maclean; &quot;he is a happy superior who has such a following.&quot;  Both chiefs  then went outside to consult as to the best and safest means for  Mackenzie&#x27;s homeward journey. MacLean offered him all his chief and  best men to accompany him by land, but this he declined, saying that he  would not put his friend to such inconvenience, and would return home in  his own boat just as he came; but he was ultimately persuaded to take  MacLean&#x27;s great galley, his own being only a small one.  He sailed in his friend&#x27;s great birlinn, under the command of the Captain of Cairnburgh,  accompanied by several other gentlemen of the MacLeans. In the meantime, the Macdonalds, aware that Mackenzie had not  yet returned from Mull, &quot;convened all the boats and galleys they could, to  a certain island which lay in his course, and which he could not avoid  passing.  So, coming within sight of the island, having a good prospect of  a number of boats, after they bad ebbed in a certain harbour, and men also  making ready to set out to sea. This occasioned the captain to use a  stratagem, and steer directly to the harbour, and still as they came forward  be caused lower the sail, which the other party perceiving made them  forbear putting out their boats, persuading themselves that it was a galley  they expected from Ardnamurchan, but they had no sooner come forgainst the harbour but the captain caused hoist sail, set oars and steers aside, immediately bangs up a bagpiper and gives them shots.  The rest, finding  the cheat and their own mistake, made such a hurly-burly setting out their  boats, with their haste they broke some of them, and some of themselves  were bruised and bad broken shins also for their prey, and such as went  out whole, perceiving the galley so far off; thought it was folly to pursue  her any further, they all returned wiser than they came from home.  This  is, notwithstanding other men&#x27;s reports, the true and real narration of Glengarrie Younger his progress, of the Kintail men their meeting him in  Kyle Rhea, of my lord&#x27;s coming from Mull, and of the whole success,  which I have heard verbatim not only from one but from several that were  present at their actings.&quot; [Ancient MS. The authors of the Letterfearn and  Ardintoul MSS. give substantially the same account, and say that among  those who accompanied Mackenzie to Mull, was &quot;Rory Beg Mackenzie,  son to Rory More of Achiglunichan. Fairburn and Achilty&#x27;s predecessor,  and who afterwards died parson of Contine, from whom my author had  the full account of Mackenzie&#x27;s voyage to Mull.&quot;]</div></div></div><div
