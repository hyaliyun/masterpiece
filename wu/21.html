DAVID COPPERFIELD THE YOUNGER CHAPTER 1 I AM BORN Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that  station will be held by anybody else, these  pages must show. To begin my life  with the beginning of my  life, I record  that I was  born (as I  have been informed  and believe) on  a Friday,  at twelve  o&#x27;clock at  night.  It  was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously. In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the  nurse, and by some sage women in the  neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest  in me several months  before there was  any possibility of  our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that I  was  privileged  to  see ghosts  and  spirits;  both  these gifts  inevitably attaching,  as they  believed, to  all unlucky  infants of  either gender,  born towards the small hours on a Friday night. I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result.   On the second branch of the question, I will only remark, that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance  while I was still a  baby, I have not come  into it yet. But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property;  and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it. I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers, at the low price  of fifteen  guineas.  Whether  sea-going people  were short  of money about that  time, or  were short  of faith  and preferred  cork jackets, I don&#x27;t know; all I know is, that there was but one solitary bidding, and that was  from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business, who offered two pounds  in cash, and the balance in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning  on any higher bargain.  Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss - for as to sherry,  my poor  dear mother&#x27;s  own sherry was in  the  market then and ten years afterwards, the  caul was put up in  a raffle down in our  part of the country, to fifty members at  half-a-crown a head, the winner to  spend five shillings.   I  was  present  myself,   and  I  remember  to  have   felt  quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part  of myself being disposed of in  that way. The caul  was won,  I recollect,  by an  old lady  with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it the  stipulated five shillings, all in  halfpence, and twopence halfpenny short - as it  took an immense time and a great  waste of arithmetic, to endeavour without any effect to prove to her.  It is a fact which will be long remembered  as remarkable down there,  that she was never  drowned, but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two.  I have understood that it was,  to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in her  life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was extremely partial) she, to  the last,  expressed her  indignation at  the impiety  of mariners  and others, who had the  presumption to go &#x27;meandering&#x27;  about the world. It  was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences, tea perhaps included,  resulted from this objectionable  practice.  She always  returned, with greater  emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, &#x27;Let us have no meandering.&#x27; Not to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth. I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or &#x27;there by&#x27;, as they say in  Scotland. I was a posthumous  child.  My father&#x27;s eyes  had closed upon the  light of this world six months,  when mine opened  on it.  There  is something strange  to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw me; and something stranger yet  in the shadowy remembrance that I have  of my first childish associations with  his white grave-stone in the churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle,  and the doors of our house were  - almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes - bolted and locked against it. An aunt of my father&#x27;s, and consequently  a great-aunt of mine, of whom I  shall have more to relate  by and by, was  the principal magnate of  our family.  Miss Trotwood,  or  Miss  Betsey, as  my  poor  mother always  called  her,  when she sufficiently overcame her dread of  this formidable personage to mention  her at all (which was seldom), had been married to a husband younger than herself,  who was very handsome, except in the  sense of the homely adage, &#x27;handsome  is, that handsome does&#x27; - for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having  once, on a  disputed question of  supplies, made some  hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs&#x27; window.  These evidences of an incompatibility  of temper induced Miss  Betsey to pay him  off, and effect a separation by mutual  consent.  He went to India with  his capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he was once seen riding  on an elephant, in company with a  Baboon;  but I think it  must have been  a Baboo or a Begum.  Anyhow, from India  tidings of his  death reached home,  within ten years.   How  they affected  my  aunt, nobody  knew;  for immediately  upon  the separation, she took her maiden name again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on  the sea-coast a long way off, established  herself there as a single woman  with one servant, and was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an  inflexible retirement. My father had  once been a  favourite of hers,  I believe; but  she was mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground  that my mother was &#x27;a wax doll&#x27;.   She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not yet twenty.  My father  and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double my mother&#x27;s age when he married,  and of but a delicate constitution.  He died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came into the world. This was the state of  matters, on the afternoon of,  what I may be excused  for calling, that eventful and important Friday.   I can make no claim therefore  to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to have any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what follows. My  mother was  sitting by  the fire,  but poorly  in health,  and very  low  in spirits, looking at it through  her tears, and desponding heavily  about herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by some grosses  of prophetic pins,  in a  drawer upstairs,  to a  world not  at all  excited on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting by the fire, that  bright, windy March  afternoon, very  timid and  sad, and  very doubtful  of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her, when, lifting her eyes as she  dried them, to the window opposite, she saw a strange lady coming up the garden. MY mother had a sure foreboding at  the second glance, that it was Miss  Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the garden-fence, and  she came walking  up to  the door  with a  fell rigidity  of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else. When she reached the  house, she gave another  proof of her identity.  My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary  Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell,  she came and looked in at that  identical window, pressing the end of her nose  against the glass to that extent, that  my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment. She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am  indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday. My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly, began on the  other side, and carried  her eyes on,  like a Saracen&#x27;s  Head in a  Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made  a frown and a gesture to my  mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to come and open the door.  My mother went. &#x27;Mrs. David  Copperfield, I  think,&#x27; said  Miss Betsey;  the emphasis referring, perhaps, to my mother&#x27;s mourning weeds, and her condition. &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said my mother, faintly. &#x27;Miss Trotwood,&#x27; said the visitor.  &#x27;You have heard of her, I dare say?&#x27; My  mother answered  she had  had that  pleasure.  And  she had  a  disagreeable consciousness  of  not appearing  to  imply that  it  had been  an  overpowering pleasure. &#x27;Now you see her,&#x27; said Miss Betsey.  My mother bent her head, and begged her to walk in. They went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire in the best room on the other  side of  the passage  not being  lighted -  not having  been lighted, indeed, since  my father&#x27;s  funeral; and  when they  were both  seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother,  after vainly trying to restrain  herself, began to cry. &#x27;Oh tut, tut, tut!&#x27; said Miss Betsey, in a hurry.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t do that! Come, come!&#x27; My mother couldn&#x27;t help it notwithstanding,  so she cried until she had  had her cry out. &#x27;Take off your cap, child,&#x27; said Miss Betsey, &#x27;and let me see you.&#x27; MY mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request, if she had any disposition to do so.  Therefore she did as she was told, and did it with such  nervous hands that  her hair (which  was luxuriant and  beautiful) fell all about her face. &#x27;Why, bless my heart!&#x27; exclaimed Miss Betsey.  &#x27;You are a very Baby!&#x27; My mother was, no  doubt, unusually youthful in  appearance even for her  years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing, and said, sobbing,  that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow, and would be but a  childish mother if she  lived. In a  short pause which  ensued, she had  a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, and that with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid hope, she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her  dress tucked up, her hands folded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender,  frowning at the fire. &#x27;In the name of Heaven,&#x27; said Miss Betsey, suddenly, &#x27;why Rookery?&#x27; &#x27;Do you mean the house, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; asked my mother. &#x27;Why Rookery?&#x27; said Miss Betsey.  &#x27;Cookery would have been more to the  purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either of you.&#x27; &#x27;The name was  Mr. Copperfield&#x27;s choice,&#x27;  returned my mother.   &#x27;When he bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.&#x27; The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old elm-trees at  the bottom  of the  garden, that  neither my  mother nor  Miss Betsey  could forbear glancing that  way.  As the  elms bent to  one another, like  giants who were whispering secrets,  and after a  few seconds of  such repose, fell  into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind, some weatherbeaten ragged old  rooks&#x27; nests, burdening their higher branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea. &#x27;Where are the birds?&#x27; asked Miss Betsey. &#x27;The -? &#x27; My mother had been thinking of something else. &#x27;The rooks - what has become of them?&#x27; asked Miss Betsey. &#x27;There have not been any since we have lived here,&#x27; said my mother. &#x27;We  thought - Mr. Copperfield  thought - it  was quite a  large rookery; but  the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a long while.&#x27; &#x27;David Copperfield all over!&#x27; cried  Miss Betsey.  &#x27;David Copperfield from  head to foot!  Calls a house a rookery when there&#x27;s not a rook near it, and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!&#x27; &#x27;Mr.  Copperfield,&#x27; returned  my mother,  &#x27;is dead,  and if  you dare  to  speak unkindly of him to me -&#x27; My poor dear mother,  I suppose, had some  momentary intention of committing  an assault and battery  upon my aunt,  who could easily  have settled her  with one hand, even if my  mother had been in  far better training for  such an encounter than she  was that  evening. But  it passed  with the  action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very meekly, and fainted. When she came  to herself, or  when Miss Betsey  had restored her,  whichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window.  The twilight was by this time shading down into  darkness; and dimly  as they saw  each other, they  could not have done that without the aid of the fire. &#x27;Well?&#x27; said  Miss Betsey,  coming back  to her  chair, as  if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect; &#x27;and when do you expect -&#x27; &#x27;I am all in a tremble,&#x27; faltered my mother.  &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the matter. I shall die, I am sure!&#x27; &#x27;No, no, no,&#x27; said Miss Betsey.  &#x27;Have some tea.&#x27; &#x27;Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?&#x27; cried my mother in a helpless manner. &#x27;Of course it  will,&#x27; said Miss  Betsey.  &#x27;It&#x27;s nothing  but fancy. What  do you call your girl?&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know that it will be a girl, yet, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said my mother innocently. &#x27;Bless  the  Baby!&#x27;  exclaimed Miss  Betsey,  unconsciously  quoting the  second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs, but applying it to my mother instead of me, &#x27;I don&#x27;t mean that.  I mean your servant-girl.&#x27; &#x27;Peggotty,&#x27; said my mother. &#x27;Peggotty!&#x27; repeated Miss Betsey, with  some indignation.  &#x27;Do you mean  to say, child, that any human  being has gone into  a Christian church, and  got herself named Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s her surname,&#x27; said my mother, faintly.  &#x27;Mr.  Copperfield called her by it, because her Christian name was the same as mine.&#x27; &#x27;Here!  Peggotty!&#x27;  cried Miss  Betsey, opening  the parlour  door. &#x27;Tea.   Your mistress is a little unwell.  Don&#x27;t dawdle.&#x27; Having  issued this  mandate with  as much  potentiality as  if she  had been  a recognized authority in  the house ever  since it had  been a house,  and having looked out  to confront  the amazed  Peggotty coming  along the  passage with  a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut the door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on  the fender, the skirt of her dress  tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee. &#x27;You were speaking about its being a girl,&#x27; said Miss Betsey.  &#x27;I have no  doubt it will be a girl.   I have a presentiment that  it must be a girl.   Now child, from the moment of the birth of this girl -&#x27; &#x27;Perhaps boy,&#x27; my mother took the liberty of putting in. &#x27;I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,&#x27; returned Miss Betsey. &#x27;Don&#x27;t contradict.  From the moment of this girl&#x27;s birth, child, I intend to  be her friend.   I intend  to be  her godmother,  and I  beg you&#x27;ll call her Betsey Trotwood  Copperfield.  There must  be  no mistakes  in  life with  THIS  Betsey Trotwood.  There must be no trifling  with HER affections, poor dear.  She  must be well brought up, and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved.  I must make that MY care.&#x27; There was a twitch of Miss Betsey&#x27;s  head, after each of these sentences, as  if her  own old  wrongs were  working within  her, and  she repressed  any  plainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected, at least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire: too much scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy  in  herself,  and  too subdued  and  bewildered  altogether,  to observe anything very clearly, or to know what to say. &#x27;And was David good to you, child?&#x27; asked Miss Betsey, when she had been  silent for a little while, and these  motions of her head had gradually  ceased.  &#x27;Were you comfortable together?&#x27; &#x27;We were very  happy,&#x27; said my  mother.  &#x27;Mr. Copperfield  was only too  good to me.&#x27; &#x27;What, he spoilt you, I suppose?&#x27; returned Miss Betsey. &#x27;For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world again, yes, I fear he did indeed,&#x27; sobbed my mother. &#x27;Well!  Don&#x27;t cry!&#x27; said Miss Betsey.  &#x27;You were not equally matched, child - if any two people can be equally matched  - and so I asked the question.   You were an orphan, weren&#x27;t you?&#x27; &#x27;Yes.&#x27; &#x27;And a governess?&#x27; &#x27;I was nursery-governess in a family  where Mr. Copperfield came to visit.   Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of notice of me, and paid me a good deal of  attention, and at last proposed  to me.  And I accepted  him. And so we were married,&#x27; said my mother simply. &#x27;Ha!  Poor Baby!&#x27; mused  Miss Betsey, with her  frown still bent upon  the fire. &#x27;Do you know anything?&#x27; &#x27;I beg your pardon, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; faltered my mother. &#x27;About keeping house, for instance,&#x27; said Miss Betsey. &#x27;Not much, I fear,&#x27; returned my mother.  &#x27;Not so much as I could wish.  But  Mr. Copperfield was teaching me -&#x27; (&#x27;Much he knew about it himself!&#x27;) said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis. - &#x27;And I hope I should have  improved, being very anxious to learn, and  he very patient to teach  me, if the  great misfortune of  his death&#x27; -  my mother broke down again here, and could get no farther. &#x27;Well, well!&#x27; said Miss Betsey. -&#x27;I kept my  housekeeping-book regularly, and  balanced it with  Mr. Copperfield every night,&#x27; cried my  mother in another burst  of distress, and breaking  down again. &#x27;Well, well!&#x27; said Miss Betsey.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t cry any more.&#x27; - &#x27;And I am sure  we never had a word  of difference respecting it, except  when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each  other, or to  my putting  curly tails  to my  sevens and  nines,&#x27; resumed  my mother in another burst, and breaking down again. &#x27;You&#x27;ll make yourself  ill,&#x27; said Miss  Betsey, &#x27;and you  know that will  not be good either for you or for my god-daughter.  Come!  You mustn&#x27;t do it!&#x27; This  argument had  some share  in quieting  my mother,  though her   increasing indisposition had a larger one.  There  was an interval of silence, only  broken by Miss Betsey&#x27;s occasionally  ejaculating &#x27;Ha!&#x27; as she  sat with her feet  upon the fender. &#x27;David had bought an annuity for himself  with his money, I know,&#x27; said she,  by and by.  &#x27;What did he do for you?&#x27; &#x27;Mr.  Copperfield,&#x27; said  my mother,  answering with  some difficulty,  &#x27;was  so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me.&#x27; &#x27;How much?&#x27; asked Miss Betsey. &#x27;A hundred and five pounds a year,&#x27; said my mother. &#x27;He might have done worse,&#x27; said my aunt. The  word was  appropriate to  the moment.   My mother  was so  much worse  that Peggotty, coming in with  the teaboard and candles,  and seeing at a  glance how ill she was,  - as Miss  Betsey might have  done sooner if  there had been light enough, - conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all speed; and  immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, who had been for some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my mother, as a special messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse and doctor. Those allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived within a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of portentous appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied over her left arm, stopping her ears  with jewellers&#x27; cotton.  Peggotty knowing  nothing about  her, and  my mother  saying nothing about her, she was quite a  mystery in the parlour; and the fact  of her having a magazine of jewellers&#x27; cotton  in her pocket, and sticking the  article in her ears in that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her presence. The  doctor having  been upstairs  and come  down again,  and having   satisfied himself,  I suppose,  that there  was a  probability of  this unknown  lady  and himself having to sit there, face to  face, for some hours, laid himself out  to be polite and social.  He was the meekest of his sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to take up the less space.  He walked as  softly as the  Ghost in  Hamlet, and  more slowly.   He carried  his head  on one side, partly  in modest  depreciation of  himself, partly  in modest  propitiation  of everybody else.  It is nothing to say that  he hadn&#x27;t a word to throw at a  dog. He couldn&#x27;t have  thrown a word  at a mad  dog.  He might  have offered him  one gently, or  half a  one, or  a fragment  of one;  for he  spoke as  slowly as he walked; but he wouldn&#x27;t have been rude  to him, and he couldn&#x27;t have been  quick with him, for any earthly consideration. Mr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side, and making her a little bow, said, in allusion  to the jewellers&#x27; cotton, as he  softly touched his left ear: &#x27;Some local irritation, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; &#x27;What!&#x27; replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork. Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her  abruptness - as he told my mother  afterwards that it  was a  mercy he  didn&#x27;t lose  his presence  of mind.   But he  repeated sweetly: &#x27;Some local irritation, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; &#x27;Nonsense!&#x27; replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one blow. Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly, as  she sat and  looked at  the fire,  until he  was called  upstairs again.  After some quarter of an hour&#x27;s absence, he returned. &#x27;Well?&#x27; said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him. &#x27;Well, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; returned Mr. Chillip, &#x27;we are- we are progressing slowly, ma&#x27;am.&#x27; &#x27;Ba--a--ah!&#x27;  said  my   aunt,  with  a   perfect  shake  on   the  contemptuous interjection.  And corked herself as before. Really - really - as Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked; speaking in a professional point  of view alone, he  was almost shocked.  But  he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours, as she sat looking at  the fire, until he was again called out.  After another absence, he again returned. &#x27;Well?&#x27; said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again. &#x27;Well, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; returned Mr. Chillip, &#x27;we are - we are progressing slowly, ma&#x27;am.&#x27; &#x27;Ya--a--ah!&#x27;  said  my  aunt.   With  such a  snarl  at  him,  that  Mr. Chillip absolutely could not bear it.  It was really calculated to break his spirit,  he said afterwards.  He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs, in the dark and  a strong draught, until he was again sent for. Ham Peggotty,  who went  to the  national school,  and was  a very dragon at his catechism, and  who may  therefore be  regarded as  a credible witness, reported next day, that happening to peep in  at the parlour-door an hour after this,  he was instantly descried  by Miss Betsey,  then walking to  and fro in  a state of agitation, and pounced upon  before he could make  his escape.  That there  were now occasional sounds of feet and  voices overhead which he inferred the  cotton did not exclude, from  the circumstance of his  evidently being clutched by  the lady as a victim on whom  to expend her superabundant agitation when  the sounds were loudest.  That, marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had been taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled  his hair, made light of his linen, stopped  his ears as if she confounded them  with her own, and otherwise tousled and  maltreated him.  This was in part  confirmed by his aunt, who  saw him at half  past twelve o&#x27;clock, soon  after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was. The mild Mr. Chillip could  not possibly bear malice at  such a time, if at  any time.  He sidled into the parlour as soon  as he was at liberty, and said to  my aunt in his meekest manner: &#x27;Well, ma&#x27;am, I am happy to congratulate you.&#x27; &#x27;What upon?&#x27; said my aunt, sharply. Mr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt&#x27;s manner; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to mollify her. &#x27;Mercy on  the man,  what&#x27;s he  doing!&#x27; cried  my aunt,  impatiently. &#x27;Can&#x27;t  he speak?&#x27; &#x27;Be calm, my dear ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents. &#x27;There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma&#x27;am.  Be calm.&#x27; It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn&#x27;t shake him, and shake what he had to say, out of  him.  She only shook her own head at  him, but in a way that made him quail. &#x27;Well, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; resumed Mr.  Chillip, as soon as  he had courage, &#x27;I  am happy to congratulate you.  All is now over, ma&#x27;am, and well over.&#x27; During the five minutes or so that  Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery of  this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly. &#x27;How is she?&#x27; said my aunt, folding  her arms with her bonnet still tied  on one of them. &#x27;Well, ma&#x27;am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,&#x27; returned Mr. Chillip. &#x27;Quite  as comfortable  as we  can expect  a young  mother to  be, under   these melancholy domestic circumstances.  There cannot be any objection to your seeing her presently, ma&#x27;am.  It may do her good.&#x27; &#x27;And SHE.  How is SHE?&#x27; said my aunt, sharply. Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my aunt  like an amiable bird. &#x27;The baby,&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;How is she?&#x27; &#x27;Ma&#x27;am,&#x27; returned Mr. Chillip, &#x27;I apprehended you had known.  It&#x27;s a boy.&#x27; My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in the manner  of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip&#x27;s head with it, put it on bent, walked out, and never came  back.  She vanished  like a discontented  fairy; or like  one of those supernatural beings, whom it was popularly supposed I was entitled to see; and never came back any more. No.  I  lay in  my basket,  and my  mother lay  in her  bed; but Betsey Trotwood Copperfield was  for ever  in the  land of  dreams and  shadows, the  tremendous region whence I had  so lately travelled; and  the light upon the  window of our room shone out  upon the earthly  bourne of all  such travellers, and  the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he, without whom I had never been. CHAPTER 2 I OBSERVE The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look far back, into the blank of  my infancy, are my  mother with her pretty  hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at  all, and eyes so dark that they  seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood  in her face, and  cheeks and arms so  hard and red that I wondered the birds didn&#x27;t peck her in preference to apples. I believe I  can remember these  two at a  little distance apart,  dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going unsteadily from the one to the other.   I have an impression  on my mind which  I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of  the touch of Peggotty&#x27;s  forefinger as she used  to hold it  out to  me, and  of its  being roughened  by needlework,  like a pocket nutmeg-grater. This may be fancy, though I think the  memory of most of us can go farther  back into  such times  than many  of us   suppose; just  as I  believe the  power  of observation in  numbers of  very young  children to  be quite  wonderful for its closeness and accuracy.  Indeed, I think that most grown men who are  remarkable in  this respect,  may with  greater propriety  be said  not to  have lost   the faculty, than to have acquired it;  the rather, as I generally observe  such men to retain a  certain freshness, and  gentleness, and capacity  of being pleased, which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood. I might have  a misgiving that  I am &#x27;meandering&#x27;  in stopping to  say this, but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in part upon my  own experience of myself; and  if it should appear  from anything I may  set down in this narrative that I was a child of close observation, or that as a man I  have a  strong memory  of my  childhood, I  undoubtedly lay  claim to  both of  these characteristics. Looking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first objects I can remember as standing  out by themselves from  a confusion of things,  are my mother and Peggotty.  What else do I remember?  Let me see. There comes out of the cloud, our house - not new to me, but quite familiar,  in its earliest remembrance.   On the ground-floor  is Peggotty&#x27;s kitchen,  opening into a  back yard;  with a  pigeon-house on  a pole,  in the centre, without any pigeons in it; a great dog- kennel in a corner, without any dog; and a  quantity of  fowls that  look terribly  tall to  me, walking  about, in  a menacing   and ferocious manner.  There is one cock who gets upon a post to crow, and seems  to take particular notice of  me as I look  at him through the  kitchen window, who makes me shiver, he is so fierce.   Of the geese outside the side-gate who  come waddling after  me with  their long  necks stretched  out when  I go that way, I dream at night: as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions. Here is a long passage  - what an enormous perspective  I make of it! -  leading from Peggotty&#x27;s kitchen to the front  door.  A dark store-room opens out  of it, and that is a place to be run past at night; for I don&#x27;t know what may be  among those tubs and  jars and old  tea-chests, when there  is nobody in  there with a dimly-burning light, letting a mouldy air  come out of the door, in  which there is the smell of  soap, pickles, pepper, candles,  and coffee, all at  one whiff. Then there are the two parlours: the  parlour in which we sit of an  evening, my mother and I and Peggotty - for  Peggotty is quite our companion, when her  work is done  and we  are alone  - and  the best  parlour where  we sit  on a Sunday; grandly, but not so comfortably.  There is something of a doleful air about that room to me, for Peggotty  has told me - I  don&#x27;t know when, but apparently  ages ago - about my father&#x27;s funeral,  and the company having their black  cloaks put on.  One Sunday night my mother reads  to Peggotty and me in there, how  Lazarus was raised up from  the dead.  And I  am so frightened that  they are afterwards obliged to  take me  out of  bed, and  show me  the quiet  churchyard out of the bedroom window,  with the  dead all  lying in  their graves  at rest,  below the solemn moon. There is  nothing half  so green  that I  know anywhere,  as the  grass of  that churchyard; nothing half  so shady as  its trees; nothing  half so quiet  as its tombstones.  The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up, early in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within  my mother&#x27;s room, to look out at it;  and I see the red light shining on the sun-dial, and think within myself, &#x27;Is the  sun dial glad, I wonder, that it can tell the time again?&#x27; Here is our pew in the church.  What a high-backed pew!  With a window near  it, out of which our house can be seen, and IS seen many times during the  morning&#x27;s service, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it&#x27;s not being robbed, or is  not in flames.  But  though Peggotty&#x27;s eye wanders,  she is much offended if mine does, and frowns to  me, as I stand upon the seat, that  I am to  look at  the clergyman.   But I  can&#x27;t always  look at  him -  I know him without that white thing on,  and I am afraid of  his wondering why I stare  so, and perhaps  stopping the  service to  inquire -  and what  am I  to do?  It&#x27;s a dreadful thing to gape, but I must  do something.  I look at my mother,  but she pretends not to see me.  I look at a boy in the aisle, and he makes faces at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch, and there I see a stray sheep - I don&#x27;t mean a sinner, but mutton - half making up his  mind to come into the church.  I feel that if I looked at him any longer, I might  be tempted to say something out loud; and what would become of me then!  I look  up at the monumental tablets on the wall,  and try to think of Mr. Bodgers  late of this  parish,  and  what the  feelings  of  Mrs. Bodgers  must  have  been, when affliction sore, long  time Mr. Bodgers  bore, and physicians  were in vain.   I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain; and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week.  I look from Mr. Chillip, in his  Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and  think what a good place  it would be to play  in, and what a castle it would make, with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head.   In time my eyes gradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman  singing a drowsy song  in the heat,  I hear nothing,  until I fall  off the seat  with a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty. And  now I  see the  outside of  our house,  with the  latticed  bedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the ragged old  rooks&#x27;-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the front garden.  Now I am  in the garden at the  back, beyond the  yard where the  empty pigeon-house and  dog kennel are  - a  very preserve  of butterflies,  as I  remember it,  with a high fence, and a gate and padlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper  and richer than fruit has ever been since, in any other garden, and where my  mother gathers some in a  basket, while I stand  by, bolting furtive gooseberries,  and trying to look unmoved.  A great wind rises, and the summer is gone in a moment. We are playing in the winter twilight, dancing about the parlour. When my mother is out of breath  and rests herself in  an elbow-chair, I watch  her winding her bright curls  round her  fingers, and  straitening her  waist, and  nobody knows better than  I do  that she  likes to  look so  well, and  is proud  of being so pretty. That is among my very earliest impressions.  That, and a sense that we were both a little  afraid of  Peggotty, and  submitted ourselves  in most  things to  her direction, were among  the first opinions  - if they  may be so  called - that I ever derived from what I saw. Peggotty and I  were sitting one  night by the  parlour fire, alone.  I had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles.   I must have read very  perspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I remember she had a  cloudy impression, after I had done, that they  were a sort of vegetable.  I was  tired of reading, and dead sleepy; but having leave, as a high treat, to sit up  until my mother came home from spending  the evening at a neighbour&#x27;s, I  would rather have died upon my post  (of course) than have gone  to bed.  I had reached  that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty seemed  to swell and grow immensely large.   I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers, and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work;  at the  little bit  of wax-candle she kept  for  her thread how old it looked,  being so wrinkled in  all directions! - at  the little house with a  thatched roof,  where the  yard-measure lived;  at her  work-box with  a sliding lid, with a view of St.  Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted  on the top; at the brass thimble on her finger; at herself, whom I thought  lovely. I felt so sleepy, that  I knew if I lost  sight of anything for a  moment, I was gone. &#x27;Peggotty,&#x27; says I, suddenly, &#x27;were you ever married?&#x27; &#x27;Lord, Master Davy,&#x27; replied Peggotty.  &#x27;What&#x27;s put marriage in your head?&#x27; She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me.  And then she stopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its thread&#x27;s length. &#x27;But WERE you ever married, Peggotty?&#x27; says I.  &#x27;You are a very handsome  woman, an&#x27;t you?&#x27; I thought her  in a different  style from my  mother, certainly; but  of another school of beauty,  I considered her  a perfect example.  There was a  red velvet footstool in the best  parlour, on which my  mother had painted a  nosegay.  The ground-work of that stool,  and Peggotty&#x27;s complexion appeared  to me to be  one and the same thing. The stool was smooth, and Peggotty was rough, but that  made no difference. &#x27;Me handsome, Davy!&#x27; said Peggotty.  &#x27;Lawk, no, my dear!  But what put  marriage in your head?&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know!  - You mustn&#x27;t  marry more than  one person at  a time, may  you, Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;Certainly not,&#x27; says Peggotty, with the promptest decision. &#x27;But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you may marry  another person, mayn&#x27;t you, Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;YOU MAY,&#x27; says Peggotty, &#x27;if you choose, my dear.  That&#x27;s a matter of opinion.&#x27; &#x27;But what is your opinion, Peggotty?&#x27; said I. I asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked so curiously at me. &#x27;My  opinion  is,&#x27;  said Peggotty,  taking  her  eyes from  me,  after  a little indecision and going on with her work, &#x27;that I never was married myself,  Master Davy, and that I don&#x27;t expect to be.  That&#x27;s all I know about the subject.&#x27; &#x27;You an&#x27;t cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you?&#x27; said I, after sitting quiet  for a minute. I  really thought  she was,  she had  been so  short with  me; but  I was  quite mistaken: for she  laid aside her  work (which was  a stocking of  her own), and opening her  arms wide,  took my  curly head  within them,  and gave  it a  good squeeze.  I know it was a good squeeze, because, being very plump, whenever  she made any little exertion after she was dressed, some of the buttons on the  back of her gown flew off.  And I recollect two bursting to the opposite side of  the parlour, while she was hugging me. &#x27;Now let me hear some more  about the Crorkindills,&#x27; said Peggotty, who  was not quite right in the name yet, &#x27;for I an&#x27;t heard half enough.&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t  quite understand  why Peggotty  looked so  queer, or  why she was so ready to go  back to the  crocodiles.  However, we  returned to those  monsters, with fresh wakefulness on my  part, and we left their  eggs in the sand for  the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled them by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on account of their unwieldy make; and  we went into the water after them, as natives, and put sharp pieces of timber  down their throats;  and in  short we  ran the  whole crocodile  gauntlet.  I did, at least; but I had my doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms, all the time. We had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when the  garden bell rang.  We went out to the door; and there was my mother, looking  unusually pretty,  I thought,  and with  her a  gentleman with  beautiful black  hair  and whiskers, who had walked home with us from church last Sunday. As my mother stooped down on the threshold  to take me in her arms and kiss  me, the gentleman said I was a  more highly privileged little fellow than  a monarch or something like that; for my  later understanding comes, I am sensible,  to my aid here. &#x27;What does that mean?&#x27; I asked him, over her shoulder. He patted me on the head; but somehow, I didn&#x27;t like him or his deep voice,  and I was jealous that his hand should  touch my mother&#x27;s in touching me -  which it did.  I put it away, as well as I could. &#x27;Oh, Davy!&#x27; remonstrated my mother. &#x27;Dear boy!&#x27; said the gentleman.  &#x27;I cannot wonder at his devotion!&#x27; I never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother&#x27;s face before. She gently  chid me for  being rude;  and, keeping  me close  to her  shawl, turned  to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home.  She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with his own, she glanced, I thought,  at me. &#x27;Let us say &quot;good night&quot;, my fine boy,&#x27; said the gentleman, when he had bent his head - I saw him! - over my mother&#x27;s little glove. &#x27;Good night!&#x27; said I. &#x27;Come!  Let us be the best friends in the world!&#x27; said the gentleman,  laughing. &#x27;Shake hands!&#x27; My right hand was in my mother&#x27;s left, so I gave him the other. &#x27;Why, that&#x27;s the Wrong hand, Davy!&#x27; laughed the gentleman. MY mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for my former  reason, not to  give it  him, and  I did  not.  I  gave him  the other,  and he shook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, and went away. At this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last look  with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut. Peggotty, who  had not  said a  word or  moved a  finger, secured the fastenings instantly, and we all went into  the parlour.  My mother, contrary to  her usual habit, instead of coming to the  elbow-chair by the fire, remained at  the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself. - &#x27;Hope  you have  had a  pleasant evening,  ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said  Peggotty, standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a candlestick in her hand. &#x27;Much obliged to  you, Peggotty,&#x27; returned  my mother, in  a cheerful voice,  &#x27;I have had a VERY pleasant evening.&#x27; &#x27;A stranger or so makes an agreeable change,&#x27; suggested Peggotty. &#x27;A very agreeable change, indeed,&#x27; returned my mother. Peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room, and my mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I was not so sound asleep but that I could hear voices, without hearing what they said.  When I half awoke from  this uncomfortable doze,  I found  Peggotty and  my mother  both in  tears, and  both talking. &#x27;Not such a one  as this, Mr. Copperfield  wouldn&#x27;t have liked,&#x27; said  Peggotty. &#x27;That I say, and that I swear!&#x27; &#x27;Good Heavens!&#x27; cried my mother, &#x27;you&#x27;ll  drive me mad!  Was ever any  poor girl so ill-used  by her  servants as  I am!   Why do  I do  myself the  injustice of calling myself a girl?  Have I never been married, Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;God knows you have, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; returned  Peggotty. &#x27;Then, how can you dare,&#x27;  said my mother - &#x27;you know I don&#x27;t mean  how can you dare, Peggotty, but how can  you have the heart - to make me  so uncomfortable and say such bitter things  to me, when you are well aware  that I haven&#x27;t, out of  this place, a single friend  to turn to?&#x27; &#x27;The more&#x27;s the reason,&#x27; returned Peggotty,  &#x27;for saying that it won&#x27;t do.   No! That it won&#x27;t  do.  No!  No  price could make  it do. No!&#x27;  - I thought Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away, she was so emphatic with it. &#x27;How  can you  be so  aggravating,&#x27; said  my mother,  shedding more  tears  than before, &#x27;as to talk in  such an unjust manner!  How  can you go on as  if it was all settled and  arranged, Peggotty, when  I tell you  over and over  again, you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed!  You  talk of admiration.  What am  I to  do?  If  people are  so silly  as to  indulge the sentiment, is it my fault?   What am I to do,  I ask you?  Would you  wish me to shave my head and black my face, or disfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something of that sort?  I dare say you would, Peggotty.  I dare say you&#x27;d quite enjoy it.&#x27; Peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I thought. &#x27;And my dear boy,&#x27;  cried my mother, coming  to the elbow-chair in  which I was, and caressing  me, &#x27;my  own little  Davy!  Is  it to  be hinted  to me that I am wanting in affection  for my precious  treasure, the dearest  little fellow that ever was!&#x27; &#x27;Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing,&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;You did, Peggotty!&#x27; returned my mother.   &#x27;You know you did.  What else  was it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature, when you know as well as I  do, that  on his  account only  last quarter  I wouldn&#x27;t  buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed the whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy?  You know it is, Peggotty.  You can&#x27;t deny it.&#x27;  Then,  turning affectionately to me, with her cheek against mine, &#x27;Am I a naughty mama to  you, Davy?  Am I a nasty,  cruel, selfish, bad mama? Say  I am, my child; say  &quot;yes&quot;, dear boy, and Peggotty will love you; and Peggotty&#x27;s love is a great deal better than mine, Davy. I don&#x27;t love you at all, do I?&#x27; At this, we all fell a-crying together.  I think I was the loudest of the party, but I am sure  we were all sincere  about it.  I was  quite heart-broken myself, and  am afraid  that in  the first  transports of  wounded tenderness  I  called Peggotty a &#x27;Beast&#x27;.   That honest creature  was in deep  affliction, I remember, and must have become  quite buttonless on the  occasion; for a little  volley of those explosives went  off, when, after  having made it  up with my  mother, she kneeled down by the elbow-chair, and made it up with me. We went to bed greatly dejected.  My  sobs kept waking me, for a long  time; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted  me up in bed, I found my  mother sitting on the coverlet, and  leaning over me.  I  fell asleep in her  arms, after that, and slept soundly. Whether it was the following Sunday  when I saw the gentleman again,  or whether there was any greater  lapse of time before  he reappeared, I cannot  recall.  I don&#x27;t profess  to be  clear about  dates.  But  there he  was, in church, and he walked home with us afterwards.  He came  in, too, to look at a famous  geranium we had, in the parlour-window.  It did not appear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked  my mother to give him a bit of  the blossom. She begged him to choose it for himself, but he refused to do that - I could not understand why - so she plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand.  He  said he would never, never part  with it any more; and  I thought he must be  quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two. Peggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always been.   My mother deferred to her very much - more  than usual, it occurred to me - and  we were all three excellent friends; still  we were different from what we  used to be,  and were  not so  comfortable among  ourselves.  Sometimes  I fancied  that Peggotty perhaps objected to my mother&#x27;s wearing all the pretty dresses she  had in her drawers,  or to her  going so often  to visit at  that neighbour&#x27;s; but I couldn&#x27;t, to my satisfaction, make out how it was. Gradually, I became  used to seeing  the gentleman with  the black whiskers.   I liked him no better than at first, and had the same uneasy jealousy of him;  but if I had any reason for it  beyond a child&#x27;s instinctive dislike, and a  general idea that  Peggotty and  I could  make much  of my  mother without  any help, it certainly was not THE reason  that I might have found  if I had been older.   No such thing came into my mind, or near it.  I could observe, in little pieces, as it were;  but as  to making  a net  of a  number of  these pieces,  and catching anybody in it, that was, as yet, beyond me. One autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when Mr.  Murdstone - I knew him by that name now  - came by, on horseback.  He reined up  his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to Lowestoft to see some friends  who were there with a  yacht, and merrily proposed  to take me on  the saddle before him if I would like the ride. The air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the idea of  the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the garden-gate, that I had a great desire to go.  So I was sent upstairs to Peggotty to be made spruce; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone dismounted, and, with his horse&#x27;s bridle drawn over his  arm, walked  slowly up  and down  on the  outer side of the sweetbriar fence, while  my mother  walked slowly  up and  down on  the inner  to keep  him company.  I recollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little  window; I recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between them, as they  strolled along;  and how,  from being  in a  perfectly angelic  temper, Peggotty  turned  cross  in  a  moment,  and  brushed  my  hair  the  wrong way, excessively hard. Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off,  and trotting along on the green turf  by the side of the road.  He held me quite easily with one arm, and I don&#x27;t think I was restless usually; but I could not make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning my  head sometimes,  and looking  up in  his face.   He had that kind of shallow black eye - I want a better word to express an eye that has no depth  in it to be looked into - which, when it is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to  be disfigured, for  a moment at  a time, by  a cast.  Several times when I  glanced at  him, I  observed that  appearance with  a sort  of awe,  and wondered what  he was  thinking about  so closely.   His hair  and whiskers were blacker and thicker, looked  at so near, than  even I had given  them credit for being.  A squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me of the wax-work that had travelled  into our neighbourhood  some half-a-year before.   This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white,  and  black, and brown, of his  complexion confound his complexion,  and his memory!  - made me  think him, in  spite of my misgivings, a  very handsome  man.  I  have no  doubt that  my poor  dear mother thought him so too. We went to  an hotel by  the sea, where  two gentlemen were  smoking cigars in a room by themselves.  Each of them was  lying on at least four chairs, and  had a large rough jacket on.  In a corner  was a heap of coats and boat-cloaks,  and a flag, all bundled up together. They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner, when we came  in, and said, &#x27;Halloa, Murdstone!  We thought you were dead!&#x27; &#x27;Not yet,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone. &#x27;And who&#x27;s this shaver?&#x27; said one of the gentlemen, taking hold of me. &#x27;That&#x27;s Davy,&#x27; returned Mr. Murdstone. &#x27;Davy who?&#x27; said the gentleman.  &#x27;Jones?&#x27; &#x27;Copperfield,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone. &#x27;What!  Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield&#x27;s  encumbrance?&#x27; cried the gentleman.   &#x27;The pretty little widow?&#x27; &#x27;Quinion,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone, &#x27;take care, if you please. Somebody&#x27;s sharp.&#x27; &#x27;Who is?&#x27; asked the gentleman, laughing. I looked up, quickly; being curious  to know. &#x27;Only Brooks of Sheffield,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone. I was  quite relieved  to find  that it  was only  Brooks of  Sheffield; for, at first, I really thought it was I. There seemed to  be something very  comical in the  reputation of Mr.  Brooks of Sheffield, for both  the gentlemen laughed  heartily when he  was mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a  good deal amused also.  After some laughing, the  gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said: &#x27;And what is the opinion of  Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to  the projected business?&#x27; &#x27;Why, I don&#x27;t know  that Brooks understands much  about it at present,&#x27;  replied Mr. Murdstone; &#x27;but he is not generally favourable, I believe.&#x27; There was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring the bell for some sherry in which to drink to  Brooks.  This he did; and when the  wine came, he made me have a little, with a  biscuit, and, before I drank it, stand up  and say, &#x27;Confusion  to Brooks  of Sheffield!&#x27;   The toast  was received  with great applause, and  such hearty  laughter that  it made  me laugh  too; at which they laughed the more.  In short, we quite enjoyed ourselves. We walked about  on the cliff  after that, and  sat on the  grass, and looked at things through a telescope - I could make out nothing myself when it was put  to my eye, but I pretended I could - and then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner.  All the time we were out, the two gentlemen smoked incessantly - which, I thought, if I might judge from the smell of their rough coats, they must  have been doing, ever since the coats had first come home from the tailor&#x27;s.  I  must not forget that we went on board the yacht, where they all three descended  into the cabin, and were busy with some papers.  I saw them quite hard at work,  when I looked down through the open skylight.  They left me, during this time, with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it, who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat on, with &#x27;Skylark&#x27; in  capital letters across the chest.  I  thought it was his name;  and that as he lived  on board ship and hadn&#x27;t a street door to put his name on, he put it there instead; but when I called him Mr. Skylark, he said it meant the vessel. I observed  all day  that Mr.  Murdstone was  graver and  steadier than  the two gentlemen.   They  were very  gay  and careless.   They  joked freely  with  one another, but seldom  with him.  It  appeared to me  that he was  more clever and cold  than they  were, and  that they  regarded him  with something  of my   own feeling.  I remarked that, once or twice when Mr. Quinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, as if to  make sure of his not being displeased;  and that once when Mr. Passnidge (the other gentleman) was in high spirits, he  trod upon his  foot, and  gave him  a secret  caution with  his eyes,  to observe Mr. Murdstone,  who was  sitting stern  and silent.   Nor do  I recollect  that  Mr. Murdstone laughed at all that day, except  at the Sheffield joke - and that,  by the by, was his own. We went home early in  the evening.  It was a  very fine evening, and my  mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar, while I was sent in to get my  tea. When he was gone, my mother asked me all about the day I had had, and what  they had said and done.  I mentioned what  they had said about her, and she  laughed, and told  me they  were impudent  fellows who  talked nonsense  - but  I knew it pleased her.  I knew it quite as well as I know it now.  I took the  opportunity of asking if  she was at  all acquainted with  Mr. Brooks of  Sheffield, but she answered No, only she supposed he must  be a manufacturer in the knife and  fork way. Can I say of her face - altered  as I have reason to remember it, perished  as I know it is - that it is gone,  when here it comes before me at this  instant, as distinct as any face that  I may choose to look  on in a crowded street?   Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it faded, and was no more, when its breath  falls on  my cheek  now, as  it fell  that night?   Can I  say she  ever changed, when my remembrance brings her  back to life, thus only; and,  truer to its loving youth  than I have  been, or man  ever is, still  holds fast what  it cherished then? I write of her just as she was when  I had gone to bed after this talk, and  she came to bid me good night.  She  kneeled down playfully by the side of  the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and laughing, said: &#x27;What was it they said, Davy?  Tell me again.  I can&#x27;t believe it.&#x27; &#x27;&quot;Bewitching -&quot;&#x27; I began. My mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me. &#x27;It  was never  bewitching,&#x27; she  said, laughing.   &#x27;It never  could have   been bewitching, Davy.  Now I know it wasn&#x27;t!&#x27; &#x27;Yes,  it  was.   &quot;Bewitching  Mrs.  Copperfield&quot;,&#x27;  I  repeated  stoutly. &#x27;And, &quot;pretty.&quot;&#x27; &#x27;No, no, it  was never pretty.   Not pretty,&#x27; interposed  my mother, laying  her fingers on my lips again. &#x27;Yes it was.  &quot;Pretty little widow.&quot;&#x27; &#x27;What foolish, impudent creatures!&#x27; cried  my mother, laughing and covering  her face.  &#x27;What ridiculous men!  An&#x27;t they?  Davy dear -&#x27; &#x27;Well, Ma.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t tell Peggotty; she might be angry with them.  I am dreadfully angry  with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn&#x27;t know.&#x27; I promised, of course; and we kissed one another over and over again, and I soon fell fast asleep. It seems  to me,  at this  distance of  time, as  if it  were the  next day when Peggotty  broached  the  striking  and adventurous  proposition  I  am  about to mention; but it was probably about two months afterwards. We were sitting as  before, one evening (when  my mother was out  as before), in company with the stocking and the yard-measure, and the bit of wax, and the  box with St. Paul&#x27;s on the lid, and the crocodile book, when Peggotty, after looking at me  several times,  and opening  her mouth  as if  she were  going to  speak, without doing  it -  which I  thought was  merely gaping,  or I should have been rather alarmed - said coaxingly: &#x27;Master Davy, how should you like to  go along with me and spend a  fortnight at my brother&#x27;s at Yarmouth?  Wouldn&#x27;t that be a treat?&#x27; &#x27;Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?&#x27; I inquired, provisionally. &#x27;Oh, what an agreeable man he is!&#x27; cried Peggotty, holding up her hands.   &#x27;Then there&#x27;s the sea; and the boats and ships; and the fishermen; and the beach;  and Am to play with -&#x27; Peggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned  in my first chapter; but she  spoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar. I was flushed by her summary of delights, and replied that it would indeed be  a treat, but what would my mother say? &#x27;Why then I&#x27;ll  as good as  bet a guinea,&#x27;  said Peggotty, intent  upon my face, &#x27;that she&#x27;ll let us go.   I&#x27;ll ask her, if you  like, as soon as ever  she comes home.  There now!&#x27; &#x27;But what&#x27;s she to do while we&#x27;re away?&#x27; said I, putting my small elbows on  the table to argue the point.  &#x27;She can&#x27;t live by herself.&#x27; If Peggotty  were looking  for a  hole, all  of a  sudden, in  the heel  of that stocking, it must have been a very little one indeed, and not worth darning. &#x27;I say!  Peggotty!  She can&#x27;t live by herself, you know.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, bless you!&#x27; said  Peggotty, looking at me  again at last. &#x27;Don&#x27;t  you know? She&#x27;s going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper.  Mrs. Grayper&#x27;s going  to have a lot of company.&#x27; Oh!   If  that was  it,  I was  quite  ready to  go.   I waited,  in  the utmost impatience, until  my mother  came home  from Mrs.  Grayper&#x27;s (for  it was  that identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea.  Without  being nearly  so much  surprised as  I had  expected, my  mother entered into it readily;  and it was all  arranged that night, and  my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for. The day soon came for  our going.  It was such  an early day that it  came soon, even  to  me, who  was  in a  fever  of expectation,  and  half afraid  that  an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other great convulsion of nature,  might interpose to  stop the  expedition.  We  were to  go in  a carrier&#x27;s cart, which departed in the morning after breakfast.   I would have given any money  to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night, and sleep in my hat and boots. It touches me nearly now, although I  tell it lightly, to recollect how eager  I was to leave my happy home; to think how little I suspected what I did leave for ever. I am glad  to recollect that  when the carrier&#x27;s  cart was at  the gate, and  my mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness for her and for the old place I had never turned my back upon before, made me cry.  I am glad to know that  my mother cried too, and that I felt her heart beat against mine. I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move, my mother ran out at the gate, and called  to him to stop,  that she might kiss  me once more.  I  am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine, and did so. As we left her standing in the road, Mr. Murdstone came up to where she was, and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved.  I was looking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what business it was of his.  Peggotty, who was also looking back on the other side, seemed anything but satisfied; as the  face she brought back in the cart denoted. I sat looking  at Peggotty for  some time, in  a reverie on  this supposititious case: whether, if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale, I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed. CHAPTER 3 I HAVE A CHANGE The carrier&#x27;s  horse was  the laziest  horse in  the world,  I should  hope, and shuffled along, with  his head down,  as if he  liked to keep  people waiting to whom the packages were directed.  I fancied, indeed, that he sometimes  chuckled audibly over this reflection, but the  carrier said he was only troubled  with a cough. The carrier had a  way of keeping his head  down, like his horse, and  of drooping sleepily  forward as  he drove,  with one  of his  arms on  each of his knees.   I say  &#x27;drove&#x27;, but  it struck  me that  the cart  would have  gone  to Yarmouth quite  as well  without him,  for the  horse did  all that;  and as  to conversation, he had no idea of it but whistling. Peggotty had a basket  of refreshments on her  knee, which would have  lasted us out handsomely, if we had been going to London by the same conveyance.  We ate a good deal, and slept  a good deal. Peggotty  always went to sleep  with her chin upon the handle of the basket, her hold of which never relaxed; and I could  not have believed unless  I had heard  her do it,  that one defenceless  woman could have snored so much. We  made so  many deviations  up and   down lanes,  and were  such a  long  time delivering a bedstead at a public-house, and calling at other places, that I was quite tired, and very glad, when  we saw Yarmouth.  It looked rather  spongy and soppy, I thought, as I carried my eye over the great dull waste that lay  across the river; and I could not help wondering, if the world were really as round  as my geography book said, how any part of  it came to be so flat. But I  reflected that Yarmouth might be situated at one of the poles; which would account for it. As we drew a little nearer, and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying a straight low line  under the  sky, I  hinted to  Peggotty that  a mound  or so might have improved it; and also that if the land had been a little more separated from the sea, and the town and the tide had  not been quite so much mixed up, like  toast and water, it would have been  nicer.  But Peggotty said, with greater  emphasis than usual, that we must take things  as we found them, and that, for  her part, she was proud to call herself a Yarmouth Bloater. When we got into the street (which was strange enough to me) and smelt the fish, and pitch, and oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors walking about, and the  carts jingling up and down over the stones, I felt that I had done so busy a place  an injustice; and said  as much to  Peggotty, who heard  my expressions of  delight with great complacency, and  told me it was  well known (I suppose  to those who had the good fortune to be born Bloaters) that Yarmouth was, upon the whole, the finest place in the universe. &#x27;Here&#x27;s my Am!&#x27; screamed Peggotty, &#x27;growed out of knowledge!&#x27; He was waiting for us,  in fact, at the public-house;  and asked me how I  found myself, like an old acquaintance.  I did not feel, at first, that I knew him  as well as he knew me, because he had never come to our house since the night I was born, and  naturally he  had the  advantage of  me.  But  our intimacy  was much advanced by his taking me  on his back to carry  me home.  He was, now,  a huge, strong fellow of six feet  high, broad in proportion, and  round-shouldered; but with a simpering boy&#x27;s face and curly light hair that gave him quite a  sheepish look.  He was dressed in a canvas jacket, and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have  stood quite as well  alone, without any legs  in them. And you couldn&#x27;t so properly have said  he wore a hat, as  that he was covered in  a top, like an old building, with something pitchy. Ham carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm, and  Peggotty carrying another small box of ours,  we turned down lanes bestrewn with  bits of chips and little  hillocks of  sand, and  went past  gas-works, rope-walks, boat builders&#x27;  yards,  shipwrights&#x27; yards,  ship-breakers&#x27;  yards, caulkers&#x27;  yards, riggers&#x27; lofts, smiths&#x27; forges, and a great litter of such places, until we came out upon the dull waste I had already seen at a distance; when Ham said, &#x27;Yon&#x27;s our house, Mas&#x27;r Davy!&#x27; I looked in  all directions, as  far as I  could stare over  the wilderness, and away at the sea, and  away at the river, but  no house could I make  out.  There was a black barge, or some other  kind of superannuated boat, not far off,  high and dry on the ground, with an iron funnel sticking out of it for a chimney  and smoking  very cosily;  but nothing  else in  the way  of a  habitation that  was visible to me. &#x27;That&#x27;s not it?&#x27; said I.  &#x27;That ship-looking thing?&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s it, Mas&#x27;r Davy,&#x27; returned Ham. If it had been Aladdin&#x27;s palace, roc&#x27;s  egg and all, I suppose I could  not have been  more  charmed  with the  romantic  idea  of living  in  it.   There was  a delightful door cut  in the side,  and it was  roofed in, and  there were little windows in it; but the wonderful charm of it was, that it was a real boat  which had no doubt  been upon the  water hundreds of  times, and which  had never been intended to be lived in, on dry land.  That was the captivation of it to me.  If it  had ever  been meant  to be  lived in,  I might  have thought  it small,  or inconvenient, or lonely;  but never having  been designed for  any such use,  it became a perfect abode. It was beautifully clean  inside, and as tidy  as possible.  There was  a table, and a Dutch clock, and a chest of drawers, and on the chest of drawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a lady with a parasol, taking a walk with  a military-looking  child  who was  trundling  a hoop.   The  tray was  kept  from tumbling down,  by a  bible; and  the tray,  if it  had tumbled down, would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers and a teapot that were grouped around the book.  On the walls there were some common coloured pictures, framed and glazed, of scripture subjects; such as I have never seen since in the hands of  pedlars, without seeing the  whole interior of  Peggotty&#x27;s brother&#x27;s house  again, at one view.  Abraham in  red going to  sacrifice Isaac in  blue, and Daniel  in yellow cast into  a den  of green  lions, were  the most  prominent of these.  Over the little  mantelshelf,  was  a  picture  of  the  &#x27;Sarah  Jane&#x27;  lugger,  built at Sunderland, with  a real  little wooden  stern stuck  on to  it; a  work of art, combining composition with carpentry, which I  considered to be one of the  most enviable possessions that the world could afford.  There were some hooks in  the beams of the ceiling, the use of  which I did not divine then; and  some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort, which served for seats and eked out the chairs. All this I saw in the first  glance after I crossed the threshold -  child-like, according to my theory - and then Peggotty opened a little door and showed me my bedroom.  It was the  completest and most desirable  bedroom ever seen -  in the stern of the vessel; with a little window, where the rudder used to go  through; a little looking-glass, just the right  height for me, nailed against the  wall, and framed with oyster-shells; a little bed, which there was just room enough to get into; and a nosegay of seaweed in  a blue mug on the table.  The walls  were whitewashed as white as milk, and  the patchwork counterpane made my eyes  quite ache with its brightness.  One  thing I particularly noticed in  this delightful house, was the smell of  fish; which was so searching,  that when I took out  my pocket-handkerchief to  wipe my  nose, I  found it  smelt exactly  as if  it had wrapped up a lobster.  On my imparting this discovery in confidence to Peggotty, she informed me that her brother  dealt in lobsters, crabs, and crawfish;  and I afterwards  found  that a  heap  of these  creatures,  in a  state  of wonderful conglomeration with one  another, and never  leaving off pinching  whatever they laid hold of,  were usually to  be found in  a little wooden  outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept. We  were welcomed  by a  very civil  woman in  a white  apron, whom  I had  seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham&#x27;s back, about a quarter of a mile  off. Likewise by a most beautiful little girl  (or I thought her so) with a  necklace of blue beads on, who wouldn&#x27;t let me  kiss her when I offered to, but ran  away and hid herself.  By and by, when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off  boiled dabs, melted butter, and potatoes, with a  chop for me, a hairy man with  a very good-natured face  came home.   As he  called Peggotty  &#x27;Lass&#x27;, and  gave her  a hearty smack on  the cheek, I  had no doubt,  from the general  propriety of her conduct,  that he  was her  brother; and  so he  turned out  - being   presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty, the master of the house. &#x27;Glad to  see you,  sir,&#x27; said  Mr. Peggotty.   &#x27;You&#x27;ll find  us rough, sir, but you&#x27;ll find us ready.&#x27; I  thanked  him, and  replied  that I  was  sure I  should  be happy  in  such a delightful place. &#x27;How&#x27;s your Ma, sir?&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;Did you leave her pretty jolly?&#x27; I gave Mr.  Peggotty to understand  that she was  as jolly as  I could wish, and that she desired her compliments - which was a polite fiction on my part. &#x27;I&#x27;m much obleeged to her, I&#x27;m sure,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;Well, sir, if you can make out here, fur a fortnut, &#x27;long  wi&#x27; her,&#x27; nodding at his sister, &#x27;and  Ham, and little Em&#x27;ly, we shall be proud of your company.&#x27; Having done the  honours of his  house in this  hospitable manner, Mr.  Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water, remarking that &#x27;cold would never get his muck off&#x27;.  He soon returned, greatly improved in appearance;  but so rubicund, that I couldn&#x27;t help thinking his face had this in common with  the lobsters, crabs, and crawfish, - that it went into the hot water very black, and came out very red. After tea, when the door was shut  and all was made snug (the nights  being cold and misty now), it seemed to me the most delicious retreat that the  imagination of man could conceive.  To hear the wind getting up out at sea, to know that the fog was creeping over  the desolate flat outside,  and to look at  the fire, and think that there was no house near but  this one, and this one a boat, was  like enchantment.  Little Em&#x27;ly had overcome her shyness, and was sitting by my  side upon the lowest  and least of  the lockers, which  was just large  enough for us two, and  just fitted  into the  chimney corner.   Mrs. Peggotty  with the white apron,  was  knitting  on  the  opposite side  of  the  fire.   Peggotty  at her needlework was as much at home with St. Paul&#x27;s and the bit of wax-candle, as  if they had  never known  any other  roof.  Ham,  who had  been giving  me my first lesson in all-fours, was trying to  recollect a scheme of telling fortunes  with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions of his thumb on all  the cards he turned.  Mr. Peggotty was smoking  his pipe.  I felt it was a  time for conversation and confidence. &#x27;Mr. Peggotty!&#x27; says I. &#x27;Sir,&#x27; says he. &#x27;Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort of ark?&#x27; Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered: &#x27;No, sir.  I never giv him no name.&#x27; &#x27;Who gave  him that  name, then?&#x27;  said I,  putting question  number two  of the catechism to Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;Why, sir, his father giv it him,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;I thought you were his father!&#x27; &#x27;My brother Joe was his father,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;Dead, Mr. Peggotty?&#x27; I hinted, after a respectful pause. &#x27;Drowndead,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. I was very much surprised that Mr.  Peggotty was not Ham&#x27;s father, and began  to wonder whether I was mistaken about  his relationship to anybody else there.   I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind to have it out with Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;Little Em&#x27;ly,&#x27; I said, glancing at her.  &#x27;She is your daughter, isn&#x27;t she,  Mr. Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;No, sir.  My brother-in-law, Tom, was her father.&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t help it.  &#x27;- Dead, Mr. Peggotty?&#x27; I hinted, after another  respectful silence. &#x27;Drowndead,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got to the bottom  of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow.  So I said: &#x27;Haven&#x27;t you ANY children, Mr. Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;No, master,&#x27; he answered with a short laugh.  &#x27;I&#x27;m a bacheldore.&#x27; &#x27;A bachelor!&#x27; I said, astonished.  &#x27;Why, who&#x27;s that, Mr. Peggotty?&#x27; pointing  to the person in the apron who was knitting. &#x27;That&#x27;s Missis Gummidge,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty?&#x27; But  at this  point Peggotty  - I  mean my  own peculiar  Peggotty -  made  such impressive motions to me  not to ask any  more questions, that I  could only sit and look at all the  silent company, until it was  time to go to bed.   Then, in the privacy of my own little cabin,  she informed me that Ham and Em&#x27;ly  were an orphan nephew and niece,  whom my host had  at different times adopted  in their childhood, when they were left destitute:  and that Mrs. Gummidge was the  widow of his  partner in  a boat,  who had  died very  poor.  He  was but  a poor  man himself, said Peggotty, but as  good as gold and as  true as steel - those  were her similes.   The only  subject, she  informed me,  on which  he ever  showed a violent temper or swore an oath, was this generosity of his; and if it were ever referred to, by any one of them, he struck the table a heavy blow with his right hand (had  split it  on one  such occasion),  and swore  a dreadful oath that he would be &#x27;Gormed&#x27; if he  didn&#x27;t cut and run for  good, if it was ever  mentioned again.  It appeared, in answer to  my inquiries, that nobody had the  least idea of the etymology of this terrible verb  passive to be gormed; but that they  all regarded it as constituting a most solemn imprecation. I was very sensible  of my entertainer&#x27;s goodness,  and listened to the  women&#x27;s going to bed in another little crib  like mine at the opposite end of  the boat, and to him  and Ham hanging  up two hammocks  for themselves on  the hooks I had noticed in the  roof, in a  very luxurious state  of mind, enhanced  by my being sleepy.  As slumber gradually stole upon me, I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the flat so fiercely, that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the  night.  But I bethought myself  that I was in a  boat, after all; and  that a man  like Mr. Peggotty  was not a  bad person to  have on board if anything did happen. Nothing happened, however, worse than morning.  Almost as soon as it shone  upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out with little Em&#x27;ly, picking up stones upon the beach. &#x27;You&#x27;re quite  a sailor,  I suppose?&#x27;  I said  to Em&#x27;ly.   I don&#x27;t  know that  I supposed  anything of  the kind,  but I   felt it  an act  of gallantry  to  say something; and a  shining sail close  to us made  such a pretty  little image of itself, at the moment, in her bright eye, that it came into my head to say this. &#x27;No,&#x27; replied Em&#x27;ly, shaking her head, &#x27;I&#x27;m afraid of the sea.&#x27; &#x27;Afraid!&#x27; I said, with a becoming air  of boldness, and looking very big at  the mighty ocean.  &#x27;I an&#x27;t!&#x27; &#x27;Ah! but it&#x27;s  cruel,&#x27; said Em&#x27;ly.   &#x27;I have seen  it very cruel  to some of our men.  I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house, all to pieces.&#x27; &#x27;I hope it wasn&#x27;t the boat that -&#x27; &#x27;That father was drownded in?&#x27; said Em&#x27;ly.  &#x27;No.  Not that one, I never see that boat.&#x27; &#x27;Nor him?&#x27; I asked her. Little Em&#x27;ly shook her head.  &#x27;Not to remember!&#x27; Here was a coincidence!  I immediately went into an explanation how I had  never seen my own father; and how my mother and I had always lived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable, and lived so  then, and always meant to live  so; and how my  father&#x27;s grave  was in  the churchyard  near our  house, and shaded by a tree, beneath the boughs of which I  had walked and heard the birds sing  many a pleasant morning.  But  there were some  differences between Em&#x27;ly&#x27;s  orphanhood and mine, it appeared.  She had lost her mother before her father; and where her father&#x27;s grave was no  one knew, except that  it was somewhere in  the depths of the sea. &#x27;Besides,&#x27; said Em&#x27;ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles, &#x27;your  father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father was a fisherman and  my mother was a fisherman&#x27;s daughter, and my uncle Dan is a fisherman.&#x27; &#x27;Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he?&#x27; said I. &#x27;Uncle Dan - yonder,&#x27; answered Em&#x27;ly, nodding at the boat-house. &#x27;Yes.  I mean him.  He must be very good, I should think?&#x27; &#x27;Good?&#x27; said Em&#x27;ly.  &#x27;If I was ever to  be a lady, I&#x27;d give him a sky-blue  coat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a cocked hat,  a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money.&#x27; I said I had no doubt that  Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures.  I  must acknowledge that I  felt it difficult  to picture him  quite at his  ease in the raiment  proposed  for  him  by  his  grateful  little  niece,  and  that  I was particularly  doubtful  of  the policy  of  the  cocked hat;  but  I  kept these sentiments to myself. Little Em&#x27;ly had stopped  and looked up at  the sky in her  enumeration of these articles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on again, picking up shells and pebbles. &#x27;You would like to be a lady?&#x27; I said. Emily looked at me, and laughed and nodded &#x27;yes&#x27;. &#x27;I should like it very much.   We would all be gentlefolks together,  then.  Me, and uncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge.  We wouldn&#x27;t mind then, when there  comes stormy  weather.  -  Not for  our own  sakes, I  mean.  We  would for  the  poor fishermen&#x27;s, to  be sure,  and we&#x27;d  help &#x27;em  with money  when they come to any hurt.&#x27;  This seemed  to me to  be a very  satisfactory and therefore  not at all improbable picture.  I expressed  my pleasure  in the  contemplation of  it, and little Em&#x27;ly was emboldened to say, shyly, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you think you are afraid of the sea, now?&#x27; It  was quiet  enough to  reassure me,  but I  have no  doubt if  I had  seen  a moderately large wave come tumbling in, I should have taken to my heels, with an awful recollection of her drowned relations. However, I said &#x27;No,&#x27; and I  added, &#x27;You don&#x27;t seem  to be either,  though you say  you are,&#x27; -  for she was walking much  too near  the brink  of a  sort of  old jetty  or wooden  causeway we  had strolled upon, and I was afraid of her falling over. &#x27;I&#x27;m not afraid in this way,&#x27; said little Em&#x27;ly.  &#x27;But I wake when it blows, and tremble to think  of Uncle Dan  and Ham and  believe I hear  &#x27;em crying out  for help.  That&#x27;s why I  should like so much  to be a lady.   But I&#x27;m not afraid  in this way.  Not a bit.  Look here!&#x27; She started from my side, and ran along a jagged timber which protruded from the place we stood  upon, and overhung  the deep water  at some height,  without the least defence.  The incident is so impressed on my remembrance, that if I were a draughtsman I could draw  its form here, I  dare say, accurately as  it was that day, and little Em&#x27;ly  springing forward to her  destruction (as it appeared  to me), with a look that I have never forgotten, directed far out to sea. The light, bold, fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to me, and I soon laughed at my fears, and at the cry I had uttered; fruitlessly in any case, for there was no one near.  But there have been times since, in my manhood, many times  there  have  been,  when  I  have  thought,  Is  it  possible,  among the possibilities of hidden things, that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off, there was any merciful attraction of her into danger,  any tempting her towards him permitted on the part of her dead father, that her life might have a chance of ending that day? There has been a time since when I  have wondered whether, if  the life before  her could have  been revealed to  me at a glance, and so revealed  as that a child  could fully comprehend it,  and if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand, I ought to have held it up to save her.  There has been a time since - I do not say it lasted long,  but it has been - when I have  asked myself the question, would it have  been better for little Em&#x27;ly to have had the waters close above her head that morning in  my sight; and when I have answered Yes, it would have been. This may be premature.  I have set it down too soon, perhaps.  But let it stand. We  strolled  a long  way,  and loaded  ourselves  with things  that  we thought curious, and put some stranded starfish carefully back into the water - I hardly know enough  of the  race at  this moment  to be  quite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to  us for doing so, or  the reverse - and then  made our way home to Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s  dwelling.  We stopped under  the lee of the  lobster outhouse to exchange  an innocent kiss,  and went in  to breakfast glowing  with health and pleasure. &#x27;Like two young mavishes,&#x27; Mr. Peggotty  said.  I knew this meant, in  our local dialect, like two young thrushes, and received it as a compliment. Of course I was in love with little Em&#x27;ly.  I am sure I loved that baby quite as truly, quite as tenderly, with  greater purity and more disinterestedness,  than can enter into the best love of a  later time of life, high and ennobling as  it is.  I  am sure  my fancy  raised up  something round  that blue-eyed  mite of a child,  which  etherealized,  and made  a  very  angel of  her.   If,  any sunny forenoon, she had spread a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes, I don&#x27;t think I  should have regarded  it as much  more than I  had had reason  to expect. We used to walk about  that dim old flat at  Yarmouth in a loving manner,  hours and hours.  The days sported by us, as if Time had not grown up himself yet, but were a child too, and always at play. I told Em&#x27;ly I adored her, and that unless she confessed  she adored  me I  should be  reduced to  the necessity of killing myself with a sword.  She said she did, and I have no doubt she did. As to any sense of inequality, or youthfulness, or other difficulty in our  way, little Em&#x27;ly and I had  no such trouble, because we  had no future.  We made  no more provision for growing older, than we did for growing younger.  We were  the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty, who used to whisper of an evening when we sat, lovingly, on our little locker side by side, &#x27;Lor! wasn&#x27;t it beautiful!&#x27; Mr. Peggotty smiled at us from behind his pipe, and Ham grinned all the  evening and did  nothing else.   They had  something of  the sort  of pleasure  in us, I suppose, that they  might have had  in a pretty  toy, or a  pocket model of  the Colosseum. I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself so agreeable  as she might have  been expected to  do, under the  circumstances of her  residence with Mr. Peggotty.   Mrs. Gummidge&#x27;s was  rather a fretful  disposition, and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable  for other parties in so small  an establishment.  I was very sorry for  her; but there were moments when  it would have been  more agreeable,  I thought,  if Mrs.  Gummidge had  had a  convenient apartment of  her own  to retire  to, and  had stopped  there until  her spirits revived. Mr. Peggotty  went occasionally  to a  public-house called  The Willing Mind.  I discovered this, by his being out on  the second or third evening of our  visit, and by Mrs. Gummidge&#x27;s  looking up at the  Dutch clock, between eight  and nine, and saying he was there, and that,  what was more, she had known in  the morning he would go there. Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state  all day, and had burst into tears in  the forenoon,  when  the  fire smoked.   &#x27;I  am  a lone  lorn  creetur&#x27;,&#x27;  were Mrs. Gummidge&#x27;s words, when  that unpleasant occurrence  took place, &#x27;and  everythink goes contrary with me.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;ll soon  leave off,&#x27; said  Peggotty - I  again mean our  Peggotty - &#x27;and besides, you know, it&#x27;s not more disagreeable to you than to us.&#x27; &#x27;I feel it more,&#x27; said Mrs. Gummidge. It was a very cold day,  with cutting blasts of wind.  Mrs.  Gummidge&#x27;s peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and snuggest in the place, as her chair was certainly the easiest, but it didn&#x27;t suit her that day at  all. She was constantly complaining of the cold, and of its occasioning a  visitation in her  back which  she called  &#x27;the creeps&#x27;.   At last  she shed  tears on that subject, and said again that she  was &#x27;a lone lorn creetur&#x27; and  everythink went contrary with her&#x27;. &#x27;It is certainly very cold,&#x27; said Peggotty.  &#x27;Everybody must feel it so.&#x27; &#x27;I feel it more than other people,&#x27; said Mrs. Gummidge. So at dinner; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately after me, to whom the preference was given as a  visitor of distinction.  The fish were  small and bony, and the potatoes  were a little burnt.   We all acknowledged that  we felt this something of a disappointment; but Mrs. Gummidge said she felt it more than we  did, and  shed tears  again, and  made that  former declaration  with  great bitterness. Accordingly, when Mr.  Peggotty came home  about nine o&#x27;clock,  this unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge  was knitting  in her  corner, in  a very  wretched and  miserable condition.  Peggotty had  been working cheerfully.   Ham had been  patching up a great pair of waterboots; and I, with little Em&#x27;ly by my side, had been  reading to them. Mrs. Gummidge had never made any other remark than a forlorn sigh,  and had never raised her eyes since tea. &#x27;Well, Mates,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty, taking his seat, &#x27;and how are you?&#x27; We  all  said  something,  or looked  something,  to  welcome  him, except  Mrs. Gummidge, who only shook her head over her knitting. &#x27;What&#x27;s amiss?&#x27;  said Mr.  Peggotty, with  a clap  of his  hands. &#x27;Cheer up, old Mawther!&#x27;  (Mr. Peggotty meant old girl.) Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up.  She took out an old  black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes;  but instead of putting it in  her pocket, kept it out, and wiped them again, and still kept it out, ready for use. &#x27;What&#x27;s amiss, dame?&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;Nothing,&#x27; returned Mrs. Gummidge.  &#x27;You&#x27;ve come from The Willing Mind, Dan&#x27;l?&#x27; &#x27;Why  yes, I&#x27;ve  took a  short spell  at The  Willing Mind  tonight,&#x27; said   Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry I should drive you there,&#x27; said Mrs. Gummidge. &#x27;Drive!  I don&#x27;t want no driving,&#x27;  returned Mr. Peggotty with an honest  laugh. &#x27;I only go too ready.&#x27; &#x27;Very ready,&#x27; said Mrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, and wiping her eyes.   &#x27;Yes, yes, very ready.  I am sorry it should be along of me that you&#x27;re so ready.&#x27; &#x27;Along o&#x27; you!  It an&#x27;t along o&#x27;  you!&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t ye believe  a bit on it.&#x27; &#x27;Yes, yes, it is,&#x27; cried Mrs. Gummidge.  &#x27;I know what I am.  I know that I am  a lone lorn creetur&#x27;, and not only that everythink goes contrary with me, but that I go contrary with everybody.  Yes, yes. I feel more than other people do, and I show it more.  It&#x27;s my misfortun&#x27;.&#x27; I  really  couldn&#x27;t  help thinking,  as  I  sat taking  in  all  this, that  the misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides Mrs.  Gummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made  no such retort, only  answering with another entreaty  to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up. &#x27;I an&#x27;t what I could wish myself to be,&#x27; said Mrs. Gummidge.  &#x27;I am far from it. I know what  I am.  My  troubles has made  me contrary. I  feel my troubles, and they make me contrary.  I wish I didn&#x27;t  feel &#x27;em, but I do.  I wish I  could be hardened to &#x27;em, but I an&#x27;t. I make the house uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t wonder  at it.  I&#x27;ve made your sister so all day, and Master Davy.&#x27; Here I was suddenly melted, and roared out, &#x27;No, you haven&#x27;t, Mrs. Gummidge,&#x27; in great mental distress. &#x27;It&#x27;s far from right that I should  do it,&#x27; said Mrs. Gummidge.  &#x27;It an&#x27;t  a fit return.  I had better go into the house and die.  I am a lone lorn creetur&#x27;, and had much better not make myself contrary here.  If thinks must go contrary  with me, and I must go contrary myself, let me go contrary in my parish.  Dan&#x27;l,  I&#x27;d better go into the house, and die and be a riddance!&#x27; Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words, and betook herself to bed. When she  was gone,  Mr. Peggotty,  who had  not exhibited  a trace  of any  feeling but   the profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us,  and nodding his head with a  lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face, said in a whisper: &#x27;She&#x27;s been thinking of the old &#x27;un!&#x27; I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was supposed to have fixed her mind upon, until  Peggotty, on seeing me  to bed, explained that  it was the late Mr. Gummidge; and that her brother always took that for a received truth on such occasions,  and that  it always  had a  moving effect  upon him.  Some time after he was in his hammock that night, I heard him myself repeat to Ham,  &#x27;Poor thing!  She&#x27;s been  thinking of the  old &#x27;un!&#x27;  And  whenever Mrs. Gummidge  was overcome in a similar  manner during the remainder  of our stay (which  happened some  few  times),  he  always  said  the  same  thing  in  extenuation  of  the circumstance, and always with the tenderest commiseration. So the fortnight slipped away, varied by nothing but the variation of the  tide, which altered Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s times of going out and coming in, and altered Ham&#x27;s engagements also.  When the latter  was unemployed, he sometimes walked  with us to show us the boats and ships, and once or twice he took us for a row.  I don&#x27;t know why one  slight set of  impressions should be  more particularly associated with a place than  another, though I believe  this obtains with most  people, in reference especially to the associations  of their childhood.  I never  hear the name, or  read the  name, of  Yarmouth, but  I am  reminded of  a certain Sunday morning on the beach, the bells  ringing for church, little Em&#x27;ly leaning  on my shoulder, Ham lazily dropping stones into  the water, and the sun, away  at sea, just breaking through the heavy mist,  and showing us the ships, like  their own shadows. At last the day came for going home.  I bore up against the separation from  Mr. Peggotty and Mrs.  Gummidge, but my  agony of mind  at leaving little  Em&#x27;ly was piercing.  We went arm-in-arm to the public-house where the carrier put up,  and I promised, on the road, to write to her.  (I redeemed that promise  afterwards, in characters  larger than  those in  which apartments  are usually announced in manuscript, as being to let.) We were greatly overcome at parting; and if  ever, in my life, I have had a void made in my heart, I had one made that day. Now, all  the time  I had  been on  my visit,  I had  been ungrateful to my home again, and had thought little or nothing  about it.  But I was no sooner  turned towards it, than my reproachful young conscience seemed to point that way with a ready finger; and I felt,  all the more for the  sinking of my spirits, that  it was my nest, and that my mother was my comforter and friend. This gained  upon me  as we  went along;  so that  the nearer  we drew, the more familiar the objects became that we passed, the more excited I was to get there, and to run into her arms.  But Peggotty, instead of sharing in those transports, tried to check them (though very kindly), and looked confused and out of sorts. Blunderstone Rookery would  come, however, in  spite of her,  when the carrier&#x27;s horse pleased -  and did.  How  well I recollect  it, on a  cold grey afternoon, with a dull sky, threatening rain! The door  opened, and  I looked,  half laughing  and half  crying in my pleasant agitation, for my mother.  It was not she, but a strange servant. &#x27;Why, Peggotty!&#x27; I said, ruefully, &#x27;isn&#x27;t she come home?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, yes, Master Davy,&#x27; said Peggotty.   &#x27;She&#x27;s come home.  Wait a bit,  Master Davy, and I&#x27;ll - I&#x27;ll tell you something.&#x27; Between her agitation, and her natural  awkwardness in getting out of the  cart, Peggotty was  making a  most extraordinary  festoon of  herself, but  I felt too blank and strange to  tell her so.  When  she had got down,  she took me by  the hand; led me, wondering, into the kitchen; and shut the door. &#x27;Peggotty!&#x27; said I, quite frightened.  &#x27;What&#x27;s the matter?&#x27; &#x27;Nothing&#x27;s the matter, bless you,  Master Davy dear!&#x27; she answered,  assuming an air of sprightliness. &#x27;Something&#x27;s the matter, I&#x27;m sure.  Where&#x27;s mama?&#x27; &#x27;Where&#x27;s mama, Master Davy?&#x27; repeated Peggotty. &#x27;Yes.  Why hasn&#x27;t she come out to the  gate, and what have we come in here  for? Oh, Peggotty!&#x27;  My eyes were full, and I felt as if I were going to tumble down. &#x27;Bless the  precious boy!&#x27;  cried Peggotty,  taking hold  of me.   &#x27;What is  it? Speak, my pet!&#x27; &#x27;Not dead, too!  Oh, she&#x27;s not dead, Peggotty?&#x27; Peggotty cried out No! with an  astonishing volume of voice; and then  sat down, and began to pant, and said I had given her a turn. I gave her a hug to take away the turn, or to give her another turn in the right direction, and then stood before her, looking at her in anxious inquiry. &#x27;You see, dear, I should have told you before now,&#x27; said Peggotty, &#x27;but I hadn&#x27;t an opportunity.  I  ought to  have made  it, perhaps,  but I  couldn&#x27;t  azackly&#x27; that was always  the substitute  for exactly,  in Peggotty&#x27;s  militia of   words &#x27;bring my mind to it.&#x27; &#x27;Go on, Peggotty,&#x27; said I, more frightened than before. &#x27;Master  Davy,&#x27; said  Peggotty, untying  her bonnet  with a  shaking hand,   and speaking in a breathless sort of way.  &#x27;What do you think?  You have got a Pa!&#x27; I trembled, and turned white.  Something - I don&#x27;t know what, or how - connected with the grave in the churchyard, and the raising of the dead, seemed to  strike me like an unwholesome wind. &#x27;A new one,&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;A new one?&#x27; I repeated. Peggotty gave a gasp,  as if she were  swallowing something that was  very hard, and, putting out her hand, said: &#x27;Come and see him.&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to see him.&#x27; - &#x27;And your mama,&#x27; said Peggotty. I ceased to draw back, and we went straight to the best parlour, where she  left me.  On one side of  the fire, sat my mother;  on the other, Mr. Murdstone.   My mother dropped her work, and arose hurriedly, but timidly I thought. &#x27;Now, Clara my dear,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone.  &#x27;Recollect! control yourself,  always control yourself!  Davy boy, how do you do?&#x27; I gave him my hand.   After a moment of suspense,  I went and kissed my  mother: she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down again to her work. I could not look at her, I could not look at him, I knew quite well that he  was looking at us  both; and I  turned to the  window and looked  out there, at some shrubs that were drooping their heads in the cold. As soon  as I  could creep  away, I  crept upstairs.   My old  dear bedroom  was changed, and I was to lie a long way off.  I rambled downstairs to find anything that was like  itself, so altered  it all seemed;  and roamed into  the yard.  I very soon started back from there, for the empty dog-kennel was filled up with a great dog - deep mouthed  and black-haired like Him -  and he was very angry  at the sight of me, and sprang out to get at me. CHAPTER 4 I FALL INTO DISGRACE If the room to which  my bed was removed were  a sentient thing that could  give evidence, I might appeal to it  at  this day - who  sleeps there now,  I wonder! to bear witness for  me what a heavy  heart I carried to  it.  I went up  there, hearing the  dog in  the yard  bark after  me all  the way  while I  climbed the stairs; and, looking as blank and strange upon the room as the room looked  upon me, sat down with my small hands crossed, and thought. I thought of the oddest things.  Of the shape of the room, of the cracks in  the ceiling, of  the paper  on the  walls, of  the flaws  in the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect,  of the washing-stand being rickety on  its three legs, and having a discontented  something about it, which reminded me  of Mrs. Gummidge under the  influence of the old  one.  I was crying  all the time, but, except that I was conscious of  being cold and dejected, I am sure  I never thought why I cried.  At  last in my desolation I  began to consider that I  was dreadfully in love with  little Em&#x27;ly, and had  been torn away from  her to come here where no one seemed  to want me, or to  care about me, half as  much as she did.  This made  such a very  miserable piece of  business of it,  that I rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane, and cried myself to sleep. I was awoke  by somebody saying  &#x27;Here he is!&#x27;  and uncovering my  hot head.  My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it was one of them who had done it. &#x27;Davy,&#x27; said my mother.  &#x27;What&#x27;s the matter?&#x27; I thought it was very strange that she should ask me, and answered, &#x27;Nothing.&#x27; I turned over on my  face, I recollect, to  hide my trembling lip,  which answered her with greater truth. &#x27;Davy,&#x27; said my mother.  &#x27;Davy, my child!&#x27; I dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected me so much, then, as her calling me her child.  I hid my tears in the bedclothes, and pressed  her from me with my hand, when she would have raised me up. &#x27;This is  your doing,  Peggotty, you  cruel thing!&#x27;  said my  mother. &#x27;I have no doubt at all about it.  How can  you reconcile it to your conscience, I  wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is dear to me?   What do you mean by it, Peggotty?&#x27; Poor Peggotty  lifted up  her hands  and eyes,  and only  answered, in a sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, &#x27;Lord forgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, and  for what  you have  said this  minute, may  you never be truly sorry!&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s enough to distract me,&#x27; cried  my mother.  &#x27;In my honeymoon, too,  when my most inveterate enemy might  relent, one would think,  and not envy me  a little peace  of mind  and happiness.   Davy, you  naughty boy!   Peggotty, you  savage creature!  Oh, dear me!&#x27; cried my mother,  turning from one of us to the  other, in her pettish wilful  manner, &#x27;what a troublesome  world this is, when  one has the most right to expect it to be as agreeable as possible!&#x27; I felt the  touch of a  hand that I  knew was neither  hers nor Peggotty&#x27;s,  and slipped to my feet at the bed-side.  It was Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s hand, and he kept it on my arm as he said: &#x27;What&#x27;s this?  Clara, my love, have you forgotten? - Firmness, my dear!&#x27; &#x27;I am very sorry, Edward,&#x27; said my mother.   &#x27;I meant to be very good, but I  am so uncomfortable.&#x27; &#x27;Indeed!&#x27; he answered.  &#x27;That&#x27;s a bad hearing, so soon, Clara.&#x27; &#x27;I say it&#x27;s  very hard I  should be made  so now,&#x27; returned  my mother, pouting; &#x27;and it is - very hard - isn&#x27;t it?&#x27; He drew her to him, whispered in her ear, and kissed her.  I knew as well,  when I saw my mother&#x27;s head lean down upon his shoulder, and her arm touch his neck I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature into any form he chose,  as I know, now, that he did it. &#x27;Go you  below, my  love,&#x27; said  Mr. Murdstone.   &#x27;David and  I will  come down, together.  My friend,&#x27; turning a darkening face on Peggotty, when he had watched my mother  out, and  dismissed her  with a  nod and  a smile;  &#x27;do you know your mistress&#x27;s name?&#x27; &#x27;She has been my mistress a long time, sir,&#x27; answered Peggotty, &#x27;I ought to know it.&#x27;  &#x27;That&#x27;s  true,&#x27; he  answered.   &#x27;But I  thought  I heard  you,  as I  came upstairs, address her by a name that is not hers.  She has taken mine, you know. Will you remember that?&#x27; Peggotty, with  some uneasy  glances at  me, curtseyed  herself out  of the room without replying; seeing,  I suppose, that  she was expected  to go, and  had no excuse  for remaining.   When we  two were  left alone,  he shut  the door,  and sitting on a chair, and holding me standing before him, looked steadily into  my eyes.  I felt my own attracted, no less steadily, to his.  As I recall our being opposed thus, face to face, I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high. &#x27;David,&#x27; he said, making his lips thin, by pressing them together, &#x27;if I have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with, what do you think I do?&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know.&#x27; &#x27;I beat him.&#x27; I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper, but I felt, in my silence,  that my breath was shorter now. &#x27;I make him wince, and smart.  I say to myself, &quot;I&#x27;ll conquer that fellow&quot;;  and if it were to cost him all the blood he had, I should do it.  What is that  upon your face?&#x27; &#x27;Dirt,&#x27; I said. He knew it was the mark of tears as well as I.  But if he had asked the question twenty times, each time  with twenty blows, I  believe my baby heart  would have burst before I would have told him so. &#x27;You have  a good  deal of  intelligence for  a little  fellow,&#x27; he said, with a grave smile that belonged to him, &#x27;and you understood me very well, I see.  Wash that face, sir, and come down with me.&#x27; He pointed to the washing-stand, which I had made out to be like Mrs.  Gummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly. I had little doubt then, and I have  less doubt  now, that  he would  have knocked  me down without the least compunction, if I had hesitated. &#x27;Clara, my dear,&#x27; he said,  when I had done his  bidding, and he walked me  into the parlour, with his hand still on my arm; &#x27;you will not be made  uncomfortable any more, I hope.  We shall soon improve our youthful humours.&#x27; God help me,  I might have  been improved for  my whole life,  I might have been made another creature perhaps, for life, by a kind word at that season.  A  word of encouragement and explanation, of pity for my childish ignorance, of  welcome home, of reassurance to me that it  was home, might have made me dutiful  to him in my heart henceforth,  instead of in my  hypocritical outside, and might  have made me respect instead of  hate him.  I thought my  mother was sorry to see  me standing in the room so scared and strange, and that, presently, when I stole to a  chair,  she followed  me  with her  eyes  more sorrowfully  still  - missing, perhaps, some freedom in  my childish tread -  but the word was  not spoken, and the time for it was gone. We dined alone, we three together.  He seemed  to be very fond of my mother -  I am afraid I liked him none the better for that - and she was very fond of him. I gathered from what  they said, that  an elder sister  of his was  coming to stay with them, and that she was expected  that evening.  I am not certain whether  I found out  then, or  afterwards, that,  without being  actively concerned in any business, he had  some share in,  or some annual  charge upon the  profits of, a wine-merchant&#x27;s house in London, with  which his family had been  connected from his great-grandfather&#x27;s time,  and in which  his sister had  a similar interest; but I may mention it in this place, whether or no. After dinner, when we were sitting by  the fire, and I was meditating an  escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away, lest it should offend the master of the  house, a coach  drove up to  the garden-gate and  he went out  to receive the visitor. My mother followed him.  I was timidly following her,  when she turned round at the parlour door, in the dusk, and taking me in her  embrace as she had been used to do, whispered  me to love my new father and be  obedient to him.  She did this hurriedly and secretly, as if it were wrong, but tenderly; and, putting out  her hand behind  her, held mine  in it, until  we came near to where he  was standing  in the  garden, where  she let  mine go,  and drew  hers through his arm. It was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking lady she was;  dark, like her brother, whom  she greatly resembled in  face and voice; and  with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over her large nose, as if, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing  whiskers, she had carried them to  that account. She brought with her two uncompromising  hard black boxes, with her initials  on the lids in hard brass nails.  When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel purse, and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a  heavy chain, and shut up  like a bite.  I had  never, at that time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was. She was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome, and there formally recognized my  mother as  a new  and near  relation. Then  she looked at me, and said: &#x27;Is that your boy, sister-in-law?&#x27; My mother acknowledged me. &#x27;Generally speaking,&#x27;  said Miss  Murdstone, &#x27;I  don&#x27;t like  boys.  How d&#x27;ye do, boy?&#x27; Under these encouraging circumstances, I replied that I was very well, and  that I hoped she was  the same; with such  an indifferent grace, that  Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words: &#x27;Wants manner!&#x27; Having uttered which,  with great distinctness,  she begged the  favour of being shown to her room, which  became to me from that  time forth a place of  awe and dread, wherein  the two  black boxes  were never  seen open  or known to be left unlocked, and where (for  I peeped in once  or twice when she  was out) numerous little steel fetters and rivets,  with which Miss Murdstone embellished  herself when she was dressed, generally hung upon the looking-glass in formidable array. As well as I could make out, she had come for good, and had no intention of ever going again.  She began to &#x27;help&#x27; my mother next morning, and was in and out  of the store-closet all day, putting things to rights, and making havoc in the  old arrangements.  Almost the  first remarkable thing  I observed in  Miss Murdstone was, her being  constantly haunted by  a suspicion that  the servants had  a man secreted somewhere on the premises.   Under the influence of this  delusion, she dived into the coal-cellar at the most untimely hours, and scarcely ever  opened the door of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again, in the belief that she had got him. Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone, she was a perfect  Lark in point of getting up.  She was up (and, as I believe to this hour, looking for that man) before  anybody in the  house was stirring.   Peggotty gave it  as her opinion that she even slept  with one eye open; but  I could not concur in  this idea; for I tried it myself  after hearing the suggestion thrown out,  and found it couldn&#x27;t be done. On the very first morning after her  arrival she was up and ringing her  bell at cock-crow.  When my mother came down to breakfast and was going to make the tea, Miss Murdstone  gave her  a kind  of peck  on the  cheek, which  was her nearest approach to a kiss, and said: &#x27;Now, Clara,  my dear,  I am  come here,  you know,  to relieve  you of  all the trouble I can.  You&#x27;re much too pretty and thoughtless&#x27; - my mother blushed  but laughed, and seemed not to dislike this character - &#x27;to have any duties  imposed upon you that can  be undertaken by me.   If you&#x27;ll be so  good as give me  your keys, my dear, I&#x27;ll attend to all this sort of thing in future.&#x27; From that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all day, and under her pillow all  night, and my mother  had no more to  do with them than  I had. My mother  did not  suffer her  authority to  pass from  her without a shadow of protest.  One night  when Miss Murdstone  had been developing  certain household plans to her brother, of which he signified his approbation, my mother  suddenly began to cry, and said she thought she might have been consulted. &#x27;Clara!&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone sternly.  &#x27;Clara!  I wonder at you.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;s very well to say you wonder, Edward!&#x27; cried my mother, &#x27;and it&#x27;s  very well for you to talk about firmness, but you wouldn&#x27;t like it yourself.&#x27; Firmness,  I may  observe, was  the grand  quality on  which both  Mr. and  Miss Murdstone took their stand.  However I might have expressed my comprehension  of it  at  that  time, if  I  had  been called  upon,  I  nevertheless did  clearly comprehend in  my own  way, that  it was  another name  for tyranny;  and for  a certain gloomy, arrogant, devil&#x27;s humour, that was in them both.  The creed,  as I should state it  now, was this.  Mr.  Murdstone was firm; nobody  in his world was to be so firm as Mr. Murdstone;  nobody else in his world was to be  firm at all,  for everybody  was to  be bent  to his  firmness.  Miss  Murdstone was  an exception.  She might be firm, but only by relationship, and in an inferior  and tributary degree.  My mother was another exception.  She might be firm, and must be; but only in bearing their firmness, and firmly believing there was no  other firmness upon earth. &#x27;It&#x27;s very hard,&#x27; said my mother, &#x27;that in my own house -&#x27; &#x27;My own house?&#x27; repeated Mr. Murdstone.  &#x27;Clara!&#x27; &#x27;OUR own house, I mean,&#x27; faltered my mother, evidently frightened - &#x27;I hope  you must know what I mean, Edward - it&#x27;s very hard that in YOUR own house I may  not have a word to say about domestic matters.  I am sure I managed very well before we were married. There&#x27;s evidence,&#x27; said my mother, sobbing; &#x27;ask Peggotty if  I didn&#x27;t do very well when I wasn&#x27;t interfered with!&#x27; &#x27;Edward,&#x27; said Miss Murdstone, &#x27;let there be an end of this.  I go tomorrow.&#x27; &#x27;Jane Murdstone,&#x27; said her brother, &#x27;be silent!  How dare you to insinuate  that you don&#x27;t know my character better than your words imply?&#x27; &#x27;I am sure,&#x27; my poor mother went  on, at a grievous disadvantage, and with  many tears, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want anybody to go.   I should be very miserable and unhappy  if anybody was to go.  I don&#x27;t ask much.  I am not unreasonable.  I only want to be consulted sometimes.  I am  very much obliged to  anybody who assists me,  and I only  want to  be consulted  as a  mere form,  sometimes.  I  thought you   were pleased, once, with my being a  little inexperienced and girlish, Edward -  I am sure you said so - but you seem to hate me for it now, you are so severe.&#x27; &#x27;Edward,&#x27;  said Miss  Murdstone, again,  &#x27;let there  be an  end of  this. I   go tomorrow.&#x27; &#x27;Jane Murdstone,&#x27; thundered Mr. Murdstone.  &#x27;Will you be silent? How dare you?&#x27; Miss Murdstone  made a  jail-delivery of  her pocket-handkerchief,  and held  it before her eyes. &#x27;Clara,&#x27; he continued, looking at my mother, &#x27;you surprise me!  You astound  me! Yes,  I had  a satisfaction  in the  thought of  marrying an  inexperienced  and artless person, and forming her character,  and infusing into it some amount  of that firmness and decision of which  it stood in need.  But when  Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my assistance in this endeavour, and to assume, for my sake, a condition something like a housekeeper&#x27;s, and when she meets with a base return -&#x27; &#x27;Oh, pray, pray, Edward,&#x27; cried my mother, &#x27;don&#x27;t accuse me of being ungrateful. I am sure  I am not  ungrateful.  No one  ever said I  was before.  I  have many faults, but not that.  Oh, don&#x27;t, my dear!&#x27; &#x27;When Jane Murdstone meets,  I say,&#x27; he went  on, after waiting until  my mother was silent, &#x27;with a base return, that feeling of mine is chilled and altered.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t,  my love,  say that!&#x27;  implored my  mother very  piteously. &#x27;Oh,  don&#x27;t, Edward!  I can&#x27;t bear to hear it.   Whatever I am, I am affectionate.  I  know I am affectionate.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it, if I wasn&#x27;t sure that I am.  Ask  Peggotty. I am sure she&#x27;ll tell you I&#x27;m affectionate.&#x27; &#x27;There is no extent of mere weakness, Clara,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone in reply, &#x27;that can have the least weight with me.  You lose breath.&#x27; &#x27;Pray let us  be friends,&#x27; said  my mother, &#x27;I  couldn&#x27;t live under  coldness or unkindness.  I am so sorry.  I have a great many defects, I know, and it&#x27;s  very good of you, Edward,  with your strength of  mind, to endeavour to  correct them for me.  Jane, I don&#x27;t object to anything.  I should be quite broken-hearted  if you thought of leaving -&#x27; My mother was too much overcome to go on. &#x27;Jane Murdstone,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone to his sister, &#x27;any harsh words between  us are, I hope,  uncommon.  It is  not my fault  that so unusual  an occurrence has taken place tonight.  I was betrayed into it by another.  Nor is it your  fault. You were betrayed  into it by  another.  Let us  both try to  forget it.  And as this,&#x27; he added, after these magnanimous words, &#x27;is not a fit scene for the  boy - David, go to bed!&#x27; I could hardly find the door, through the tears that stood in my eyes.  I was so sorry for my mother&#x27;s distress; but I groped my way out, and groped my way up to my  room in  the dark,  without even   having the  heart to  say good  night  to Peggotty, or to get a  candle from her.  When her  coming up to look for  me, an hour or so afterwards, awoke me, she said that my mother had gone to bed poorly, and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were sitting alone. Going down next morning rather earlier than usual, I paused outside the  parlour door,  on  hearing  my  mother&#x27;s  voice.   She  was  very  earnestly  and humbly entreating  Miss Murdstone&#x27;s  pardon, which  that lady  granted, and  a  perfect reconciliation took place.  I never knew my mother afterwards to give an opinion on any  matter, without  first appealing  to Miss  Murdstone, or  without having first ascertained by some sure means,  what Miss Murdstone&#x27;s opinion was; and  I never saw Miss Murdstone, when out of temper (she was infirm that way), move her hand towards her  bag as if  she were going  to take out  the keys and  offer to resign  them to  my mother,  without seeing  that my  mother was  in a  terrible fright. The  gloomy  taint that  was  in the  Murdstone  blood, darkened  the  Murdstone religion,  which was  austere and  wrathful.  I  have thought,  since, that  its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s firmness, which  wouldn&#x27;t allow  him to  let anybody  off from  the utmost  weight of  the severest penalties  he could  find any  excuse for.   Be this  as it may, I well remember the  tremendous visages  with which  we used  to go  to church, and the changed air of  the place.  Again,  the dreaded Sunday  comes round, and  I file into the old pew first, like  a guarded captive brought to a  condemned service. Again, Miss Murdstone, in a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made out of a pall, follows close upon  me; then my mother; then her husband.   There is no  Peggotty now,  as in  the old  time.  Again,  I listen  to Miss Murdstone mumbling the responses, and emphasizing all the dread words with a cruel relish. Again,  I see  her dark  eyes roll  round the  church when  she says  &#x27;miserable sinners&#x27;, as if  she were calling  all the congregation  names.  Again, I  catch rare glimpses of my mother, moving her lips timidly between the two, with one of them muttering at each ear like low thunder.  Again, I wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that our good old clergyman can be wrong, and Mr. and  Miss Murdstone right, and  that all the  angels in Heaven  can be destroying  angels. Again, if I move a finger or relax a muscle of my face, Miss Murdstone pokes  me with her prayer-book, and makes my side ache. Yes, and again, as we walk home, I note some neighbours looking at my mother and at me,  and whispering.   Again, as  the three  go on  arm-in-arm, and  I linger behind alone, I follow  some of those looks,  and wonder if my  mother&#x27;s step be really not so light as I have seen it, and if the gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried  away.  Again,  I wonder  whether any  of the  neighbours call to mind, as  I do,  how we  used to  walk home  together, she  and I;  and I wonder stupidly about that, all the dreary dismal day. There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding- school.  Mr.  and Miss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother had of course agreed with  them. Nothing, however, was concluded on the  subject yet.  In the meantime, I  learnt lessons at home.  Shall I ever  forget those lessons!   They were presided  over nominally by my  mother, but really  by Mr. Murdstone  and his sister,  who were always  present, and  found them  a favourable  occasion for  giving my   mother lessons in that  miscalled firmness, which  was the bane  of both our  lives.  I believe I was kept at  home for that purpose.  I  had been apt enough to  learn, and  willing enough,  when my  mother and  I had  lived alone  together.  I  can faintly remember learning the  alphabet at her knee.   To this day, when  I look upon the fat black letters in the primer, the puzzling novelty of their  shapes, and the  easy good-nature  of O  and Q  and S,  seem to present themselves again before  me as  they used  to do.    But they  recall no  feeling of  disgust  or reluctance.  On the contrary, I seem to  have walked along a path of flowers  as far as  the crocodile-book,  and to  have been  cheered by  the gentleness of my mother&#x27;s voice and manner all the way.  But these solemn lessons which succeeded those, I remember as the death-blow  of my peace, and a grievous  daily drudgery and  misery.   They  were  very  long,  very  numerous,  very  hard  - perfectly unintelligible, some of them, to me - and I was generally as much bewildered  by them as I believe my poor mother was herself. Let me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back again. I come  into the  second-best parlour  after breakfast,  with my  books, and  an exercise-book, and a slate.  My mother is ready for me at her writing-desk,  but not half so ready  as Mr. Murdstone in  his easy-chair by the  window (though he pretends to be  reading a book),  or as Miss  Murdstone, sitting near  my mother stringing steel beads. The  very sight of these  two has such an  influence over me, that I begin to feel the words I have been at infinite pains to get into  my head, all sliding away,  and going I don&#x27;t  know where.  I wonder  where they do go, by the by? I hand the first book to my mother.  Perhaps it is a grammar, perhaps a history, or geography.  I take  a last drowning look  at the page as  I give it into  her hand, and start off aloud  at a racing pace while  I have got it fresh.   I trip over a word.  Mr. Murdstone looks up.  I trip over another word.  Miss Murdstone looks up.   I redden,  tumble over  half-a-dozen words,  and stop.   I think  my mother would show me the book if she dared, but she does not dare, and she  says softly: &#x27;Oh, Davy, Davy!&#x27; &#x27;Now, Clara,&#x27; says Mr. Murdstone, &#x27;be firm with the boy.  Don&#x27;t say, &quot;Oh,  Davy, Davy!&quot;  That&#x27;s childish.  He knows his lesson, or he does not know it.&#x27; &#x27;He does NOT know it,&#x27; Miss Murdstone interposes awfully. &#x27;I am really afraid he does not,&#x27; says my mother. &#x27;Then, you see, Clara,&#x27;  returns Miss Murdstone, &#x27;you  should just give him  the book back, and make him know it.&#x27; &#x27;Yes, certainly,&#x27; says my  mother; &#x27;that is what  I intend to do,  my dear Jane. Now, Davy, try once more, and don&#x27;t be stupid.&#x27; I obey the  first clause of  the injunction by  trying once more,  but am not so successful with the second, for I am very stupid.  I tumble down before I get to the old place, at a point where I was all right before, and stop to think.   But I can&#x27;t think about the lesson.  I think  of the number of yards of net in  Miss Murdstone&#x27;s cap, or of the price  of Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s dressing-gown, or any  such ridiculous problem that I have no business with, and don&#x27;t want to have anything at all to do  with.  Mr. Murdstone makes  a movement of impatience  which I have been  expecting for  a long  time.  Miss  Murdstone does  the same.   My  mother glances submissively at them, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear to  be worked out when my other tasks are done. There  is a  pile of  these arrears  very soon,  and it  swells like  a  rolling snowball.  The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get.  The case is so  hopeless, and I feel that  I am wallowing in  such a bog of  nonsense, that I give  up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate.  The despairing way in which my mother and I look at each  other, as I blunder on, is truly  melancholy.  But the  greatest effect  in these  miserable lessons  is when  my mother  (thinking nobody is observing her) tries to give me the cue by the motion of her lips.  At that instant, Miss Murdstone,  who has been lying  in wait for nothing  else all along, says in a deep warning voice: &#x27;Clara!&#x27; My mother starts, colours, and smiles  faintly.  Mr. Murdstone comes out of  his chair, takes the book, throws  it at me or boxes  my ears with it, and  turns me out of the room by the shoulders. Even when the lessons are done, the worst  is yet to happen, in the shape of  an appalling sum.   This is  invented for  me, and  delivered to  me orally  by Mr. Murdstone,  and  begins, &#x27;If  I  go into  a  cheesemonger&#x27;s shop,  and  buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny each, present payment&#x27; - at which I see Miss  Murdstone secretly overjoyed.  I pore over  these cheeses without  any result  or enlightenment  until dinner-time,  when, having  made  a Mulatto of myself by getting the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin,  I have a slice  of bread to  help me out  with the cheeses,  and am considered  in disgrace for the rest of the evening. It seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate studies generally took  this course.   I could  have done  very well  if I  had been  without  the Murdstones; but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird.  Even when I did get through the morning with tolerable credit, there was not much gained but dinner; for Miss  Murdstone never could endure to see  me untasked, and if I  rashly made any show of  being unemployed, called  her brother&#x27;s  attention to  me by  saying, &#x27;Clara, my dear, there&#x27;s nothing like work  - give your boy  an exercise&#x27;; which caused  me to be clapped down  to some  new labour,  there and  then.  As  to any recreation with other children of my age, I had very little of that; for the gloomy theology  of the Murdstones  made all  children out  to be  a swarm  of little vipers (though there WAS a child once  set in the midst of  the Disciples), and held that  they contaminated one another. The natural result of this treatment, continued, I suppose, for some six  months or more, was to make me sullen, dull, and dogged. I was not made the less so  by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and alienated from my mother.   I believe I should have been almost stupefied but for one circumstance. It was this.  My father  had left a small collection  of books in a little  room upstairs, to which I had access (for  it adjoined my own) and which nobody  else in our  house ever  troubled.  From  that blessed  little room, Roderick Random, Peregrine  Pickle, Humphrey  Clinker, Tom  Jones, the  Vicar of  Wakefield,  Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and  Robinson Crusoe, came out,  a glorious host, to  keep me company. They kept alive  my fancy, and my  hope of something beyond  that place and time, - they, and the Arabian Nights, and the Tales of the Genii, - and  did me no harm; for whatever harm was in  some of them was not there for me;  I knew nothing of it.  It is astonishing to me  now, how I found time, in the midst  of my porings and blunderings over heavier themes, to read those books as I did. It is curious to me how I could  ever have consoled myself under my small  troubles (which were great troubles to  me), by impersonating my favourite  characters in them - as I did - and by  putting Mr.  and Miss Murdstone into all the  bad ones which  I did  too.  I  have been  Tom Jones  (a child&#x27;s  Tom Jones,  a  harmless creature) for a week together.  I have sustained my own idea of Roderick  Random for a month at  a stretch, I verily  believe.  I had a  greedy relish for a  few volumes  of Voyages  and Travels  - I  forget what,  now -  that were  on  those shelves; and for days and  days I can remember to  have gone about my region  of our house, armed  with the centre-piece  out of an  old set of  boot-trees - the perfect realization of Captain Somebody, of the Royal British Navy, in danger of being beset by  savages, and resolved  to sell his  life at a  great price.  The Captain never lost dignity, from having  his ears boxed with the Latin  Grammar. I did; but the Captain was a Captain and a hero, in despite of all the  grammars of all the languages in the world, dead or alive. This was  my only  and my  constant comfort.   When I  think of  it, the picture always  rises  in  my mind,  of  a  summer evening,  the  boys  at play  in  the churchyard, and I sitting on my bed, reading as if for life.  Every barn in  the neighbourhood, every stone in the church, and every foot of the churchyard,  had some association of its own, in  my mind, connected with these books,  and stood for some locality made famous in them.  I have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple; I have watched Strap, with the knapsack on his back, stopping to rest himself upon the wicket-gate; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held  that club with Mr. Pickle, in the parlour of our little village alehouse. The reader now  understands, as well  as I do,  what I was  when I came  to that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again. One morning  when I  went into  the parlour  with my  books, I  found my  mother looking  anxious,  Miss  Murdstone  looking  firm,  and  Mr.  Murdstone  binding something round the bottom of  a cane - a lithe  and limber cane, which he  left off binding when I came in, and poised and switched in the air. &#x27;I tell you, Clara,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone, &#x27;I have been often flogged myself.&#x27; &#x27;To be sure; of course,&#x27; said Miss Murdstone. &#x27;Certainly, my dear Jane,&#x27; faltered my mother, meekly.  &#x27;But - but do you  think it did Edward good?&#x27; &#x27;Do you think it did Edward harm, Clara?&#x27; asked Mr. Murdstone, gravely. &#x27;That&#x27;s the point,&#x27; said his sister. To this my mother returned, &#x27;Certainly, my dear Jane,&#x27; and said no more. I  felt apprehensive  that I  was personally  interested in  this dialogue,  and sought Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s eye as it lighted on mine. &#x27;Now, David,&#x27; he said - and I saw that  cast again as he said it - &#x27;you must  be far more careful today than usual.&#x27;  He gave the cane another poise, and another switch; and having finished his preparation of it, laid it down beside him, with an impressive look, and took up his book. This was a  good freshener to  my presence of  mind, as a  beginning. I felt the words of my lessons slipping  off, not one by one,  or line by line, but  by the entire page; I tried to lay hold of  them; but they seemed, if I may so  express it, to have put skates on, and to skim away from me with a smoothness there  was no checking. We began badly, and went on worse.  I had come in with an idea of distinguishing myself rather, conceiving that I was very well prepared; but it turned out to be quite  a mistake.   Book after  book was  added to  the heap  of failures,  Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the time.  And when we came at last to the five thousand  cheeses (canes he  made it that  day, I remember),  my mother burst out crying. &#x27;Clara!&#x27; said Miss Murdstone, in her warning voice. &#x27;I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think,&#x27; said my mother. I saw him  wink, solemnly, at  his sister, as  he rose and  said, taking up  the cane: &#x27;Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear, with perfect firmness, the worry and torment that David has occasioned her today.  That would be stoical.   Clara is greatly strengthened and improved, but we can hardly expect so much from her. David, you and I will go upstairs, boy.&#x27; As he took me out at the  door, my mother ran towards us.  Miss  Murdstone said, &#x27;Clara! are you a perfect fool?&#x27; and  interfered. I saw my mother stop her  ears then, and I heard her crying. He walked me up to my room slowly and gravely - I am certain he had a delight in that  formal parade  of executing  justice -  and when  we got  there,  suddenly twisted my head under his arm. &#x27;Mr. Murdstone!  Sir!&#x27;  I cried to  him.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t!  Pray  don&#x27;t beat me!   I have tried to learn, sir, but I can&#x27;t  learn while you and Miss Murdstone are  by.  I can&#x27;t indeed!&#x27; &#x27;Can&#x27;t you, indeed, David?&#x27; he said.  &#x27;We&#x27;ll try that.&#x27; He had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and stopped him for a moment, entreating him not  to beat me.  It was  only a moment that I  stopped him, for  he cut  me heavily  an instant  afterwards, and  in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth, between my teeth, and bit  it through.  It sets my teeth on edge to think of it. He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death.  Above all the noise we made, I heard  them running up  the stairs, and  crying out -  I heard my mother crying out - and Peggotty.  Then he  was gone; and the door was locked  outside; and I was lying, fevered and hot, and torn, and sore, and raging in my puny way, upon the floor. How well I recollect, when I became quiet, what an unnatural stillness seemed to reign through the whole house!  How  well I remember, when my smart  and passion began to cool, how wicked I began to feel! I sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound.  I crawled up  from the floor,  and saw  my face  in the  glass, so  swollen, red,  and ugly that it almost frightened me.  My stripes were  sore and stiff, and made me  cry afresh, when I moved; but they were nothing to  the guilt I felt.  It lay heavier on  my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal, I dare say. It had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (I had been lying, for  the most part,  with my  head upon  the sill,  by turns  crying, dozing, and looking listlessly out), when the key was  turned, and Miss Murdstone came in  with some bread and meat,  and milk.  These  she put down  upon the table  without a word, glaring at me the while with  exemplary firmness, and then retired, locking  the door after her. Long after it was dark I  sat there, wondering whether anybody else  would come. When this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed, and went to bed; and, there, I began to wonder fearfully what  would be done to me.  Whether it  was a criminal act that I had committed?  Whether I should be taken into custody,  and sent to prison?  Whether I was at all in danger of being hanged? I never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful and fresh  for the  first moment,  and then  the being  weighed down  by the  stale and  dismal oppression of remembrance.  Miss Murdstone  reappeared before I was out  of bed; told me, in so  many words, that I  was free to walk  in the garden for  half an hour and  no longer;  and retired,  leaving the  door open,  that I  might avail myself of that permission. I did so, and did so every  morning of my imprisonment, which lasted five  days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one, Miss Murdstone excepted,  during the whole  time -  except at  evening prayers  in the  parlour; to  which I  was escorted  by  Miss  Murdstone  after everybody  else  was  placed;  where I  was stationed, a young outlaw, all alone by  myself near the door; and whence I  was solemnly  conducted by  my jailer,  before any  one arose  from the   devotional posture.  I only observed that my mother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept her face another way so  that I never saw it; and that  Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s hand was bound up in a large linen wrapper. The length of those five  days I can convey no  idea of to any one.  They occupy the place of years in  my remembrance.  The way in  which I listened to all  the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me; the ringing of bells, the opening and shutting of doors, the murmuring of voices, the footsteps on the stairs;  to any  laughing, whistling,  or singing,  outside, which  seemed  more dismal than anything else to me in my solitude and disgrace - the uncertain pace of the hours, especially  at night, when I  would wake thinking it  was morning, and find that the family  were not yet gone to  bed, and that all the  length of night had yet to come - the  depressed dreams and nightmares I had -  the return of day, noon, afternoon, evening, when the boys played in the churchyard, and  I watched them from a  distance within the room,  being ashamed to show  myself at the window lest  they should know  I was a  prisoner - the  strange sensation of never  hearing  myself  speak  -  the  fleeting  intervals  of  something   like cheerfulness, which came with eating and  drinking, and went away with it  - the setting in of rain one evening, with  a fresh smell, and its coming down  faster and faster between  me and the  church, until it  and gathering night  seemed to quench me in gloom, and fear, and remorse - all this appears to have gone  round and round for years instead of days, it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance. On the last night of my restraint, I was awakened by hearing my own name spoken in a whisper.  I started up  in bed, and putting out my arms in  the dark, said: &#x27;Is that you, Peggotty?&#x27; There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again, in a tone so very mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone into a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the keyhole. I groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole,  whispered: &#x27;Is that you, Peggotty dear?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, my own precious Davy,&#x27; she replied.  &#x27;Be as soft as a mouse, or the Cat&#x27;ll hear us.&#x27; I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the urgency of the case; her room being close by. &#x27;How&#x27;s mama, dear Peggotty?  Is she very angry with me?&#x27; I could hear Peggotty crying softly on  her side of the keyhole, as I  was doing on mine, before she answered.  &#x27;No.  Not very.&#x27; &#x27;What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear?  Do you know?&#x27; &#x27;School.  Near  London,&#x27; was  Peggotty&#x27;s answer.   I was  obliged to  get her to repeat it, for she spoke it the first time quite down my throat, in  consequence of my having  forgotten to take  my mouth away  from the keyhole  and put my ear there; and though her words tickled me a good deal, I didn&#x27;t hear them. &#x27;When, Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;Tomorrow.&#x27; &#x27;Is that  the reason  why Miss  Murdstone took  the clothes  out of my drawers?&#x27; which she had done, though I have forgotten to mention it. &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said Peggotty.  &#x27;Box.&#x27; &#x27;Shan&#x27;t I see mama?&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said Peggotty.  &#x27;Morning.&#x27; Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close  to the keyhole, and delivered these  words through it with as much feeling and  earnestness as a keyhole has ever been  the medium  of communicating,  I will  venture to  assert: shooting  in each  broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of its own. &#x27;Davy, dear.  If I ain&#x27;t been azackly as intimate with you. Lately, as I used to be.  It  ain&#x27;t because  I don&#x27;t  love you.   just as  well and  more, my  pretty poppet.   It&#x27;s  because I  thought  it better  for  you.  And  for  someone else besides.  Davy, my darling, are you listening?  Can you hear?&#x27; &#x27;Ye-ye-ye-yes, Peggotty!&#x27; I sobbed. &#x27;My own!&#x27; said  Peggotty, with infinite  compassion.  &#x27;What I  want to say,  is. That you must  never forget me.   For I&#x27;ll never  forget you.  And  I&#x27;ll take as much care of your mama,  Davy.  As ever I took  of you.  And I won&#x27;t  leave her. The day may come when she&#x27;ll be glad to lay her poor head.  On her stupid, cross old Peggotty&#x27;s arm again.   And I&#x27;ll write to  you, my dear.  Though  I ain&#x27;t no scholar.   And I&#x27;ll  - I&#x27;ll  -&#x27; Peggotty  fell to  kissing the  keyhole, as  she couldn&#x27;t kiss me. &#x27;Thank  you, dear  Peggotty!&#x27; said  I.  &#x27;Oh,  thank you!   Thank you!  Will  you promise me one thing, Peggotty?  Will you write and tell Mr. Peggotty and little Em&#x27;ly, and Mrs. Gummidge and  Ham, that I am not  so bad as they might  suppose, and that I sent &#x27;em all my love - especially to little Em&#x27;ly?  Will you, if  you please, Peggotty?&#x27; The kind soul promised, and we both  of us kissed the keyhole with the  greatest affection - I patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had been her  honest face - and  parted.  From that  night there grew  up in my  breast a feeling for Peggotty which I cannot very well define.  She did not replace my mother; no one could do that; but she came into  a vacancy in my heart, which closed  upon her, and I felt towards her something I have never felt for any other human being. It was a sort of comical  affection, too; and yet if  she had died, I cannot  think what I should  have done, or  how I should  have acted out  the tragedy it would have been to me. In the  morning Miss  Murdstone appeared  as usual,  and told  me I was going to school; which  was not  altogether such  news to  me as  she supposed.  She also informed me that when I was dressed, I was to come downstairs into the  parlour, and have my breakfast.  There, I found  my mother, very pale and with red  eyes: into whose arms I ran, and begged her pardon from my suffering soul. &#x27;Oh, Davy!&#x27; she said.   &#x27;That you could hurt  anyone I love!  Try  to be better, pray to be better!  I  forgive you; but I am  so grieved, Davy, that you  should have such bad passions in your heart.&#x27; They had persuaded her that  I was a wicked fellow,  and she was more sorry  for that than  for my  going away.   I felt  it sorely.   I tried  to eat my parting breakfast, but my tears dropped upon my bread- and-butter, and trickled into  my tea.  I saw my mother look at me sometimes, and then glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, and than look down, or look away. &#x27;Master Copperfield&#x27;s box there!&#x27; said Miss Murdstone, when wheels were heard at the gate. I  looked for  Peggotty, but  it was  not she;  neither she  nor Mr.   Murdstone appeared.  My former acquaintance,  the carrier, was at  the door.  the box  was taken out to his cart, and lifted in. &#x27;Clara!&#x27; said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note. &#x27;Ready, my dear Jane,&#x27; returned my mother.  &#x27;Good-bye, Davy.  You are going  for your own good.  Good-bye, my child.  You will come home in the holidays, and  be a better boy.&#x27; &#x27;Clara!&#x27; Miss Murdstone repeated. &#x27;Certainly, my dear  Jane,&#x27; replied my  mother, who was  holding me. &#x27;I  forgive you, my dear boy.  God bless you!&#x27; &#x27;Clara!&#x27; Miss Murdstone repeated. Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart, and to say on the way that she hoped I would repent, before I  came to a bad end; and then I  got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it. CHAPTER 5 I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME We might have gone about half  a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was  quite wet through, when the carrier stopped short.   Looking out to ascertain for what,  I saw, to MY amazement, Peggotty burst from a hedge and climb into the cart.   She took me in both her arms, and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on  my nose was extremely painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards  when I found it very tender.  Not a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing one  of her arms, she put it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought out some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets, and a purse which she put  into my hand, but not one word did  she say.  After another and a final  squeeze with both arms, she got down from the cart  and ran away; and, my belief is, and  has always been, without a solitary button on her gown.  I picked up one, of several that were rolling about, and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time. The carrier looked at me, as if to  inquire if she were coming back. I shook  my head, and  said I  thought not.   &#x27;Then come  up,&#x27; said  the carrier to the lazy horse; who came up accordingly. Having by this time cried as much as  I possibly could, I began to think it  was of no  use crying  any more,  especially as  neither Roderick  Random, nor  that Captain in the  Royal British Navy,  had ever cried,  that I could  remember, in trying situations.  The carrier, seeing me in this resolution, proposed that  my pocket- handkerchief should be spread upon  the horse&#x27;s back to dry.  I  thanked him, and assented; and particularly small it looked, under those circumstances. I had now leisure to  examine the purse.  It was  a stiff leather purse, with  a snap,  and  had three  bright  shillings in  it,  which Peggotty  had  evidently polished  up with  whitening, for  my greater  delight.  But  its most  precious contents were two half-crowns  folded together in a  bit of paper, on  which was written, in my mother&#x27;s hand, &#x27;For Davy.   With my love.&#x27;  I was so overcome  by this, that  I  asked the  carrier  to be  so  good as  to  reach me  my   pocket handkerchief again; but  he said he  thought I had  better do without  it, and I thought I really had, so I wiped my eyes on my sleeve and stopped myself. For good,  too; though,  in consequence  of my  previous emotions,  I was  still occasionally seized with a stormy sob.   After we had jogged on for  some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going all the way. &#x27;All the way where?&#x27; inquired the carrier. &#x27;There,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Where&#x27;s there?&#x27; inquired the carrier. &#x27;Near London,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Why that horse,&#x27; said the carrier, jerking the rein to point him out, &#x27;would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground.&#x27; &#x27;Are you only going to Yarmouth then?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;That&#x27;s about it,&#x27; said the carrier.  &#x27;And there  I shall take you to the  stage cutch, and the stage-cutch that&#x27;ll take you to - wherever it is.&#x27; As this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis) to say - he being, as I observed in a  former chapter, of a phlegmatic temperament,  and not at all conversational - I  offered him a cake as  a mark of attention, which  he ate at one gulp, exactly like an elephant, and which made no more impression  on his big face than it would have done on an elephant&#x27;s. &#x27;Did  SHE  make &#x27;em,  now?&#x27;  said Mr.  Barkis,  always leaning  forward,  in his slouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each knee. &#x27;Peggotty, do you mean, sir?&#x27; &#x27;Ah!&#x27; said Mr. Barkis.  &#x27;Her.&#x27; &#x27;Yes.  She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking.&#x27; &#x27;Do she though?&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. He made up his mouth as if to whistle, but  he didn&#x27;t whistle.  He sat looking at the horse&#x27;s ears, as if he saw something  new there; and sat so, for a considerable time.  By and by, he said: &#x27;No sweethearts, I b&#x27;lieve?&#x27; &#x27;Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis?&#x27;  For I thought he wanted something else to eat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of refreshment. &#x27;Hearts,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis.  &#x27;Sweet hearts; no person walks with her!&#x27; &#x27;With Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;Ah!&#x27; he said.  &#x27;Her.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, no.  She never had a sweetheart.&#x27; &#x27;Didn&#x27;t she, though!&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. Again he  made up  his mouth  to whistle,  and again  he didn&#x27;t whistle, but sat looking at the horse&#x27;s ears. &#x27;So she makes,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis,  after a long interval of reflection,  &#x27;all the apple parsties, and doos all the cooking, do she?&#x27; I replied that such was the fact. &#x27;Well.  I&#x27;ll tell you what,&#x27; said  Mr. Barkis.  &#x27;P&#x27;raps you might be  writin&#x27; to her?&#x27; &#x27;I shall certainly write to her,&#x27; I rejoined. &#x27;Ah!&#x27; he said, slowly turning his  eyes towards me.  &#x27;Well!  If you  was writin&#x27; to her, p&#x27;raps you&#x27;d recollect to say that Barkis was willin&#x27;; would you?&#x27; &#x27;That Barkis is willing,&#x27; I repeated, innocently.  &#x27;Is that all the message?&#x27; &#x27;Ye-es,&#x27; he said, considering.  &#x27;Ye-es.  Barkis is willin&#x27;.&#x27; &#x27;But you will be at Blunderstone again tomorrow, Mr. Barkis,&#x27; I said,  faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then, and could give your  own message so much better.&#x27; As he repudiated  this suggestion, however,  with a jerk  of his head,  and once more confirmed his previous request by saying, with profound gravity, &#x27;Barkis is willin&#x27;.  That&#x27;s the  message,&#x27; I readily  undertook its transmission.   While I was  waiting for  the coach  in the  hotel at  Yarmouth that  very afternoon,  I procured a sheet of paper and an  inkstand, and wrote a note to Peggotty,  which ran thus: &#x27;My  dear Peggotty.  I  have come here  safe.  Barkis is  willing.  My love to mama.  Yours affectionately.  P.S.  He says he particularly wants you to know - BARKIS IS WILLING.&#x27; When I had  taken this commission  on myself prospectively,  Mr. Barkis relapsed into perfect silence;  and I, feeling  quite worn out  by all that  had happened lately, lay down on a sack in  the cart and fell asleep.  I slept  soundly until we got to Yarmouth; which was so entirely new and strange to me in the  inn-yard to which we drove, that I at once  abandoned a latent hope I had had of  meeting with  some  of Mr.  Peggotty&#x27;s  family there,  perhaps  even with  little  Em&#x27;ly herself. The coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without any horses to it as yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more unlikely than  its ever going to London.  I was thinking this, and wondering what would  ultimately become of my box, which Mr. Barkis had put down on the yard-pavement by the pole (he having driven up the yard to turn his cart), and also what would  ultimately become of me, when a lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of meat were hanging up, and said: &#x27;Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; I said. &#x27;What name?&#x27; inquired the lady. &#x27;Copperfield, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; I said. &#x27;That won&#x27;t do,&#x27; returned the lady.  &#x27;Nobody&#x27;s dinner is paid for here, in  that name.&#x27; &#x27;Is it Murdstone, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; I said. &#x27;If you&#x27;re Master  Murdstone,&#x27; said the  lady, &#x27;why do  you go and  give another name, first?&#x27; I explained  to the  lady how  it was,  who than  rang a  bell, and  called out, &#x27;William! show  the coffee-room!&#x27;  upon which  a waiter  came running  out of  a kitchen on the  opposite side of  the yard to  show it, and  seemed a good  deal surprised when he was only to show it to me. It was a large long  room with some large maps  in it.  I doubt if  I could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries, and I cast  away in the middle of them.  I felt it was taking a liberty to sit down, with my  cap in my hand,  on the corner  of the chair  nearest the door;  and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put  a set of castors on it, I think I  must have turned red all over with modesty. He brought  me some  chops, and  vegetables, and  took the  covers off in such a bouncing manner that I  was afraid I must  have given him some  offence.  But he greatly relieved my  mind by putting  a chair for  me at the  table, and saying, very affably, &#x27;Now, six-foot! come on!&#x27; I thanked him, and took my seat  at the board; but found it extremely  difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity, or to avoid  splashing myself with  the gravy,  while he  was standing  opposite, staring  so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful manner every time I caught his eye.   After watching me into the second chop, he said: &#x27;There&#x27;s half a pint of ale for you.  Will you have it now?&#x27; I thanked him  and said, &#x27;Yes.&#x27;   Upon which he  poured it out  of a jug  into a large tumbler, and held it up against the light, and made it look beautiful. &#x27;My eye!&#x27; he said.  &#x27;It seems a good deal, don&#x27;t it?&#x27; &#x27;It  does  seem a  good  deal,&#x27; I  answered  with a  smile.   For it  was  quite delightful to me,  to find  him so  pleasant.  He  was a  twinkling-eyed, pimple faced man, with  his hair standing  upright all over  his head; and  as he stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with the other hand,  he looked quite friendly. &#x27;There was a gentleman  here, yesterday,&#x27; he said  - &#x27;a stout gentleman,  by the name of Topsawyer - perhaps you know him?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; I said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think -&#x27; &#x27;In breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed  hat, grey coat, speckled choker,&#x27;  said the waiter. &#x27;No,&#x27; I said bashfully, &#x27;I haven&#x27;t the pleasure -&#x27; &#x27;He came in here,&#x27;  said the waiter, looking  at the light through  the tumbler, &#x27;ordered a glass of this ale - WOULD order  it - I told him not - drank it,  and fell dead.  It was too old for him.  It oughtn&#x27;t to be drawn; that&#x27;s the fact.&#x27; I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said I  thought I had better have some water. &#x27;Why you see,&#x27; said the waiter, still looking at the light through the  tumbler, with one of his  eyes shut up, &#x27;our  people don&#x27;t like things  being ordered and left.  It offends &#x27;em.  But I&#x27;ll drink it, if you like.  I&#x27;m used to it, and use is everything.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll hurt  me, if I throw my head back,  and take it off quick. Shall I?&#x27; I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought he could do it safely, but by no means otherwise.  When he did throw his head back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear,  I confess, of seeing him meet the fate  of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall lifeless on the carpet.  But it didn&#x27;t hurt him.  On the contrary, I thought he seemed the fresher for it. &#x27;What have we got here?&#x27; he said, putting a fork into my dish. &#x27;Not chops?&#x27; &#x27;Chops,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Lord bless  my soul!&#x27;  he exclaimed,  &#x27;I didn&#x27;t  know they  were chops.  Why, a chop&#x27;s the  very thing  to take  off the  bad effects  of that  beer!  Ain&#x27;t  it lucky?&#x27; So he took a chop by  the bone in one hand, and  a potato in the other, and  ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction.  He afterwards  took another  chop, and  another potato;  and after  that, another  chop and  another potato.  When we had done, he brought me a pudding, and having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become absent in his mind for some moments. &#x27;How&#x27;s the pie?&#x27; he said, rousing himself. &#x27;It&#x27;s a pudding,&#x27; I made answer. &#x27;Pudding!&#x27;  he exclaimed.   &#x27;Why, bless  me, so  it is!   What!&#x27; looking  at  it nearer.  &#x27;You don&#x27;t mean to say it&#x27;s a batter-pudding!&#x27; &#x27;Yes, it is indeed.&#x27; &#x27;Why, a  batter-pudding,&#x27; he  said, taking  up a  table-spoon, &#x27;is  my favourite pudding!  Ain&#x27;t  that lucky?   Come on,  little &#x27;un,  and let&#x27;s  see who&#x27;ll  get most.&#x27; The waiter certainly got  most.  He entreated me  more than once to  come in and win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, his dispatch to my dispatch, and his appetite to  my appetite, I was  left far behind at  the first mouthful, and had no chance with him. I never saw anyone enjoy a pudding so much, I think; and he laughed, when it was all gone, as if his enjoyment of it lasted still. Finding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I asked for the pen  and  ink  and  paper,  to  write  to  Peggotty.   He  not  only  brought it immediately, but was good enough to look over me while I wrote the letter.  When I had finished it, he asked me where I was going to school. I said, &#x27;Near London,&#x27; which was all I knew. &#x27;Oh! my eye!&#x27; he said, looking very low-spirited, &#x27;I am sorry for that.&#x27; &#x27;Why?&#x27; I asked him. &#x27;Oh, Lord!&#x27; he said, shaking his  head, &#x27;that&#x27;s the school where they  broke the boy&#x27;s ribs - two ribs - a little boy  he was.  I should say he was - let  me see how old are you, about?&#x27; I told him between eight and nine. &#x27;That&#x27;s just his  age,&#x27; he said.   &#x27;He was eight  years and six  months old when they broke his first rib; eight years  and eight months old when they broke  his second, and did for him.&#x27; I  could  not  disguise from  myself,  or  from the  waiter,  that  this was  an uncomfortable coincidence,  and inquired  how it  was done.   His answer was not cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two dismal words, &#x27;With whopping.&#x27; The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion, which made me get  up and  hesitatingly inquire,  in the  mingled pride  and diffidence  of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there were anything to pay. &#x27;There&#x27;s a sheet of  letter-paper,&#x27; he returned.  &#x27;Did  you ever buy a  sheet of letter-paper?&#x27; I could not remember that I ever had. &#x27;It&#x27;s dear,&#x27;  he said,  &#x27;on account  of the  duty.  Threepence.   That&#x27;s the way we&#x27;re taxed in  this country.  There&#x27;s  nothing else, except  the waiter.  Never mind the ink.  I lose by that.&#x27; &#x27;What should you - what should I - how much ought I to - what would it be  right to pay the waiter, if you please?&#x27; I stammered, blushing. &#x27;If I hadn&#x27;t a family, and that family hadn&#x27;t the cowpock,&#x27; said the waiter,  &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t take  a sixpence.   If I  didn&#x27;t support  a aged  pairint, and a lovely sister,&#x27; - here the waiter was  greatly agitated - &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t take  a farthing. If I had a good place, and was  treated well here, I should beg acceptance of  a trifle, instead of taking of it.  But I live on broken wittles - and I sleep  on the coals&#x27; - here the waiter burst into tears. I was very  much concerned for  his misfortunes, and  felt that any  recognition short of ninepence would be mere  brutality and hardness of heart.  Therefore  I gave him one of my three bright shillings, which he received with much  humility and veneration,  and spun  up with  his thumb,  directly afterwards,  to try the goodness of. It was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped up  behind the  coach,  that I  was  supposed to  have  eaten all  the  dinner without  any assistance.  I discovered this, from overhearing the lady in the bow-window  say to  the guard,  &#x27;Take care  of that  child, George,  or he&#x27;ll  burst!&#x27; and  from observing that the women-servants who were about the place came out to look  and giggle at me as a young  phenomenon.  My unfortunate friend the waiter,  who had quite recovered his spirits, did not appear to be disturbed by this, but  joined in the general admiration without being at all confused.  If I had any doubt  of him, I suppose this half awakened it; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple confidence of a child, and the natural reliance of a child upon  superior years (qualities  I am  very sorry  any children  should prematurely  change for worldly wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole, even then. I felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving it, the subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing heavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and  as to the greater expediency of  my travelling by waggon.  The  story of my  supposed appetite getting  wind among the  outside passengers, they were merry upon it  likewise; and asked me whether I  was going to  be  paid for,  at  school, as  two  brothers or  three,  and whether  I  was contracted for, or went upon  the regular terms; with other  pleasant questions. But the worst of it was, that I  knew I should be ashamed to eat anything,  when an opportunity offered, and that, after  a rather light dinner, I should  remain hungry all night - for I had left my cakes behind, at the hotel, in my hurry. My apprehensions  were realized.   When we  stopped for  supper I  couldn&#x27;t  muster courage to take  any, though I  should have liked  it very much,  but sat by the fire and said  I didn&#x27;t want  anything.  This did  not save me  from more jokes, either; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a rough face, who had been eating  out of a sandwich-box nearly all the way, except when he had been drinking out of  a bottle, said I was  like a boa-constrictor who  took enough at one  meal to last him a long time; after which, he  actually brought a rash out upon himself  with boiled beef. We had started from Yarmouth at three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, and we were  due in London about eight next morning.  It was Mid-summer weather, and the  evening was very pleasant.  When we passed through a village, I pictured to myself  what the insides of the  houses were like, and  what the inhabitants were  about; and when boys came running after us, and got up behind and swung there for a  little way, I wondered whether their fathers were alive, and whether they Were happy at home.  I had plenty to think of, therefore, besides my mind running  continually on the kind of place I was going to - which was an awful speculation. Sometimes, I  remember,  I  resigned  myself  to thoughts  of  home  and  Peggotty;  and to endeavouring, in a confused blind way, to  recall how I had felt, and what  sort of boy I used to be, before I bit Mr. Murdstone: which I couldn&#x27;t satisfy myself about by any means, I seemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity. The night was not so pleasant as  the evening, for it got chilly; and  being put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced  one and another) to prevent  my tumbling off the coach, I  was nearly smothered by  their falling asleep, and  completely blocking me up. They squeezed me so hard sometimes, that I could not help crying out, &#x27;Oh!   If you  please!&#x27; -  which they  didn&#x27;t like  at all, because it woke them.  Opposite me was an elderly lady  in a great fur cloak, who looked  in the dark more like a haystack than a lady, she was wrapped up to such a degree. This lady had a basket with her, and she hadn&#x27;t known what to do with it, for a  long time, until  she found  that on  account of  my legs  being short,  it could  go underneath me.  It cramped and hurt me so, that it made me perfectly  miserable; but if I  moved in the  least, and made  a glass that  was in the  basket rattle against something else (as  it was sure to  do), she gave me  the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, &#x27;Come, don&#x27;t YOU fidget.  YOUR bones are young  enough, I&#x27;m sure!&#x27; At  last the  sun rose,  and then  my companions  seemed to  sleep easier.   The difficulties  under which  they had  laboured all  night, and  which had   found utterance in the most  terrific gasps and snorts,  are not to be  conceived.  As the sun got higher, their sleep became lighter, and so they gradually one by one awoke.  I recollect being very much surprised by the feint everybody made, then, of not having been to sleep at  all, and by the uncommon indignation with  which everyone repelled the charge.  I labour  under the same kind of astonishment  to this day, having invariably  observed that of all  human weaknesses, the one  to which our common nature is the least disposed to confess (I cannot imagine  why) is the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach. What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance, and how  I believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes to be constantly enacting and re-enacting there, and how I vaguely made it out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the cities of the earth, I need not stop here to relate.  We approached it by degrees, and got, in due time, to the inn in the Whitechapel district, for which we were bound.  I forget whether it was the Blue Bull, or  the Blue  Boar; but  I know  it was  the Blue  Something, and that its likeness was painted up on the back of the coach. The  guard&#x27;s eye  lighted on  me as  he was  getting down,  and he  said at  the booking-office door: &#x27;Is there anybody  here for a  yoongster booked in  the name of  Murdstone, from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, to be left till called for?&#x27; Nobody answered. &#x27;Try Copperfield, if you please, sir,&#x27; said I, looking helplessly down. &#x27;Is there anybody here  for a yoongster, booked  in the name of  Murdstone, from Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, but owning to the name of Copperfield, to be left  till called for?&#x27; said the guard.  &#x27;Come! IS there anybody?&#x27; No.  There  was nobody.   I looked  anxiously around;  but the  inquiry made  no impression on any of the bystanders, if I except a man in gaiters, with one eye, who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round my neck, and tie  me up in the stable. A ladder was brought, and  I got down after the  lady, who was like a  haystack: not  daring to  stir, until  her basket  was removed.   The coach  was clear  of passengers by that time, the luggage  was very soon cleared out, the  horses had been taken  out before  the luggage,  and now  the coach  itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers, out  of the way.  Still, nobody appeared,  to claim the dusty youngster from Blunderstone, Suffolk. More solitary than Robinson Crusoe, who had  nobody to look at him and see  that he was solitary, I went into the booking-office, and, by invitation of the clerk on duty,  passed behind  the counter,  and sat  down on  the scale at which they weighed the  luggage.  Here,  as I  sat looking  at the  parcels, packages,  and books,  and inhaling  the smell  of stables  (ever since  associated with   that morning), a procession of most tremendous considerations began to march  through my mind.  Supposing nobody should ever fetch me, how long would they consent  to keep me there?  Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings?  Should I sleep at night in one of  those wooden bins, with the other luggage,  and wash myself at the pump in the yard in  the morning; or should I be turned out  every night, and expected to  come again to be  left till called for,  when the office opened next day?  Supposing there was no mistake in the case, and Mr.  Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me, what should I do?  If they allowed me to remain there  until my  seven shillings  were spent,  I couldn&#x27;t  hope to remain there  when  I  began  to  starve.  That  would  obviously  be  inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers, besides entailing on the Blue Whatever-it-was,  the risk of  funeral expenses.   If I  started off  at once,  and tried to walk back home, how could I ever  find my way, how could  I ever hope to walk  so far, how could I make sure of  anyone but Peggotty, even if  I got back?  If I  found out the nearest proper  authorities, and offered  myself to go  for a soldier,  or a sailor, I was such a little fellow that it was most likely they wouldn&#x27;t take me in. These thoughts, and  a hundred other such  thoughts, turned me burning  hot, and made me giddy with apprehension and dismay.  I was in the height of my fever when a man entered and whispered to the clerk, who presently slanted me off  the scale, and pushed me over to him,  as if I were weighed, bought, delivered,  and paid for. As I went out of the office, hand in hand with this new acquaintance, I stole  a look at him.  He was a gaunt,  sallow young man, with hollow cheeks, and  a chin almost  as black  as Mr.  Murdstone&#x27;s; but  there the  likeness ended,  for  his whiskers were shaved off, and his  hair, instead of being glossy, was  rusty and dry.  He was dressed in a suit of black clothes which were rather rusty and  dry too, and rather short in the sleeves and legs; and he had a white  neck-kerchief on, that was  not over-clean.   I did  not, and  do not,  suppose that this neck kerchief was all the linen  he wore, but it was  all he showed or gave  any hint of. &#x27;You&#x27;re the new boy?&#x27; he said. &#x27;Yes, sir,&#x27; I said. I supposed I was.  I didn&#x27;t know. &#x27;I&#x27;m one of the masters at Salem House,&#x27; he said. I made him a bow and felt very  much overawed.  I was so ashamed to allude  to a commonplace thing like my box, to a scholar and a master at Salem House, that we had  gone some  little distance  from the  yard before  I had  the hardihood  to mention it.  We turned back, on my humbly insinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter; and he  told the clerk that  the carrier had instructions  to call for it at noon. &#x27;If you please, sir,&#x27; I said,  when we had accomplished about the  same distance as before, &#x27;is it far?&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s down by Blackheath,&#x27; he said. &#x27;Is that far, sir?&#x27; I diffidently asked. &#x27;It&#x27;s a good step,&#x27;  he said.  &#x27;We shall  go by the stage-coach.  It&#x27;s about six miles.&#x27; I was so faint and tired, that the  idea of holding out for six miles more,  was too much for me.  I took heart to tell him that I had had nothing all night, and that if he would allow me to buy something to eat, I should be very much obliged to him.  He appeared surprised at this - I see him stop and look at me now - and after considering for a few moments, said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not far off, and that the best  way would be for me to buy some  bread, or whatever I liked best  that was wholesome, and  make my breakfast at  her house, where we could get some milk. Accordingly we looked in at a baker&#x27;s  window, and after I had made a  series of proposals to buy everything  that was bilious in  the shop, and he  had rejected them one by  one, we decided  in favour of  a nice little  loaf of brown  bread, which cost  me threepence.   Then, at  a grocer&#x27;s  shop, we  bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon; which still left  what I thought a good deal of  change, out of the second  of the bright shillings,  and made me consider  London a very cheap place.  These  provisions laid in,  we went on  through a great  noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description, and over a bridge  which, no doubt,  was London  Bridge (indeed  I think  he told  me so,  but I  was half asleep), until  we came  to the  poor person&#x27;s  house, which  was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew by their look, and by an inscription on a stone over  the gate which said they were established for twenty-five poor women. The Master at Salem House  lifted the latch of one  of a number of little  black doors that were  all alike, and  had each a  little diamond-paned window  on one side, and  another little  diamond- paned  window above;  and we  went into  the little house of one of  these poor old women, who  was blowing a fire to  make a little saucepan boil.  On  seeing the master enter,  the old woman stopped  with the bellows  on her  knee, and  said something  that I  thought sounded like &#x27;My Charley!&#x27; but on seeing me come in too, she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey. &#x27;Can you cook this young gentleman&#x27;s breakfast for him, if you please?&#x27; said the Master at Salem House. &#x27;Can I?&#x27; said the old woman.  &#x27;Yes can I, sure!&#x27; &#x27;How&#x27;s Mrs. Fibbitson today?&#x27; said the Master, looking at another old woman in a large chair by the fire, who was  such a bundle of clothes that I  feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by mistake. &#x27;Ah, she&#x27;s poorly,&#x27; said  the first old woman.   &#x27;It&#x27;s one of her  bad days.  If the fire was to go out, through any accident, I verily believe she&#x27;d go out too, and never come to life again.&#x27; As they looked at her,  I looked at her also.   Although it was a warm  day, she seemed to think of nothing but the fire.  I fancied she was jealous even of  the saucepan on it; and I have reason to know that she took its impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon, in dudgeon; for I saw her, with my  own  discomfited  eyes, shake  her  fist  at me  once,  when  those culinary operations were going on, and no one  else was looking.  The sun streamed in  at the little window, but she sat with her own back and the back of the large chair towards  it, screening  the fire  as if  she were  sedulously keeping  IT  warm, instead of it keeping  her warm, and watching  it in a most  distrustful manner. The completion of the preparations for my breakfast, by relieving the fire, gave her such extreme joy that she laughed  aloud - and a very unmelodious laugh  she had, I must say. I sat down to  my brown loaf, my  egg, and my rasher  of bacon, with a  basin of milk besides,  and made  a most  delicious meal.   While I  was yet  in the full enjoyment of it, the old woman of the house said to the Master: &#x27;Have you got your flute with you?&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; he returned. &#x27;Have a blow at it,&#x27; said the old woman, coaxingly.  &#x27;Do!&#x27; The Master,  upon this,  put his  hand underneath  the skirts  of his  coat, and brought out  his flute  in three  pieces, which  he screwed  together, and began immediately to play.  My impression is, after many years of consideration,  that there never can have  been anybody in the  world who played worse.   He made the most  dismal  sounds  I  have  ever heard  produced  by  any  means,  natural or artificial.  I don&#x27;t know what the tunes were - if there were such things in the performance at all, which I doubt - but the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make  me think of  all my sorrows  until I could  hardly keep my tears back; then to  take away my  appetite; and lastly,  to make me  so sleepy that I couldn&#x27;t keep my eyes open.  They begin to close again,  and I begin to nod,  as the recollection rises fresh upon me.  Once more the little room, with its  open corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and its angular little  staircase leading to the room above, and  its three peacock&#x27;s feathers displayed over  the mantelpiece - I remember wondering when I first went in, what that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery was doomed to come to - fades  from before me, and I nod, and sleep.  The flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach are heard instead, and I am on my journey.  The coach jolts, I wake with a start, and  the flute  has come  back again,  and the  Master at  Salem House is sitting with his legs crossed, playing it dolefully, while the old woman of  the house looks on delighted.  She fades in her  turn, and he fades,  and all fades, and there  is no  flute, no  Master, no  Salem House,  no David  Copperfield, no anything but heavy sleep. I dreamed, I thought, that once while he was blowing into this dismal flute, the old woman of the house,  who had gone nearer and  nearer to him in her  ecstatic admiration, leaned  over the  back of  his chair  and gave  him an  affectionate squeeze round the neck,  which stopped his playing  for a moment.  I  was in the middle state between sleeping and waking, either then or immediately afterwards; for, as he resumed - it was a real fact that he had stopped playing - I saw  and heard the same old woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn&#x27;t delicious (meaning  the flute), to which Mrs. Fibbitson replied, &#x27;Ay, ay! yes!&#x27; and nodded at the  fire: to which, I am persuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance. When I  seemed to  have been  dozing a  long while,  the Master  at Salem  House unscrewed his flute into  the three pieces, put  them up as before,  and took me away.  We found the coach very near at hand, and got upon the roof; but I was so dead sleepy, that when we stopped on the road to take up somebody else, they put me inside where there were no passengers, and where I slept profoundly, until  I found  the  coach going  at  a footpace  up  a steep  hill  among green  leaves. Presently, it stopped, and had come to its destination. A short walk brought us - I mean  the Master and me - to Salem House,  which was enclosed with a high brick wall, and looked very dull.  Over a door in this wall was a board with SALEM HousE upon it; and through a grating in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a surly face, which I found, on the door being opened, belonged  to a  stout man  with a  bull-neck, a  wooden leg, overhanging temples, and his hair cut close all round his head. &#x27;The new boy,&#x27; said the Master. The man with the wooden  leg eyed me all over  - it didn&#x27;t take long,  for there was not much of me  - and locked the gate  behind us, and took out  the key.  We were going up to the house, among some dark heavy trees, when he called after my conductor. &#x27;Hallo!&#x27; We looked back,  and he was  standing at the  door of a  little lodge, where  he lived, with a pair of boots in his hand. &#x27;Here!  The cobbler&#x27;s been,&#x27; he said,  &#x27;since you&#x27;ve been out, Mr. Mell,  and he says he can&#x27;t mend &#x27;em any more.  He says there ain&#x27;t a bit of the original boot left, and he wonders you expect it.&#x27; With these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell, who went back a few  paces to pick them up, and looked at  them (very disconsolately, I was afraid), as  we went on together.  I observed then, for the first time, that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear, and that his stocking was just breaking out in one place, like a bud. Salem House was a  square brick building with  wings; of a bare  and unfurnished appearance.  All about it was so very quiet, that I said to Mr. Mell I  supposed the  boys were  out; but  he seemed  surprised at  my not  knowing that  it  was holiday-time.  That all the boys were at their several homes.  That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, was down by the sea-side with Mrs. and Miss Creakle; and that  I was  sent in  holiday-time as  a punishment  for my  misdoing, all  of which  he explained to me as we went along. I gazed  upon the  schoolroom into  which he  took me,  as the  most forlorn and desolate place I had ever seen.  I see it now.  A long room with three long rows of desks,  and six  of forms,  and bristling  all round  with pegs  for hats and slates.  Scraps of  old copy-books and  exercises litter the  dirty floor.  Some silkworms&#x27; houses, made of the same materials, are scattered over the desks. Two miserable little white mice, left behind by their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made of pasteboard  and wire, looking in all the corners  with their red eyes for anything to eat.   A bird, in a cage very little  bigger than himself, makes  a mournful  rattle now  and then  in hopping  on his  perch, two inches high,  or dropping  from it;  but neither  sings nor  chirps.  There is a strange unwholesome smell upon the  room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet  apples wanting air, and rotten books.  There could not well be more ink splashed  about it, if  it had  been roofless  from its  first construction,  and the  skies had rained, snowed, hailed, and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year. Mr. Mell having  left me while  he took his  irreparable boots upstairs,  I went softly to  the upper  end of  the room,  observing all  this as  I crept  along. Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully written, which was  lying on the desk, and bore these words: &#x27;TAKE CARE OF HIM.  HE BITES.&#x27; I  got  upon  the  desk  immediately,  apprehensive  of  at  least  a  great dog underneath.  But,  though I  looked all  round with  anxious eyes,  I could  see nothing of him.  I was still engaged in peering about, when Mr. Mell came  back, and asked me what I did up there? &#x27;I beg your pardon, sir,&#x27; says I, &#x27;if you please, I&#x27;m looking for the dog.&#x27; &#x27;Dog?&#x27; he says.  &#x27;What dog?&#x27; &#x27;Isn&#x27;t it a dog, sir?&#x27; &#x27;Isn&#x27;t what a dog?&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s to be taken care of, sir; that bites.&#x27; &#x27;No, Copperfield,&#x27;  says he,  gravely, &#x27;that&#x27;s  not a  dog.  That&#x27;s  a boy.   My instructions are, Copperfield, to put this placard on your back.  I am sorry  to make such a beginning with you, but I  must do it.&#x27;  With that he took me  down, and  tied the  placard, which  was neatly  constructed for  the purpose,  on  my shoulders  like  a  knapsack;  and  wherever  I  went,  afterwards,  I  had  the consolation of carrying it. What I suffered from that placard, nobody can imagine.  Whether it was  possible for people to see me or not, I always fancied that somebody was reading it.   It was no relief to turn round and  find nobody; for wherever my back was,  there I imagined somebody always to be.  That  cruel man with the wooden leg  aggravated my sufferings.  He  was in authority;  and if he  ever saw me  leaning against a tree, or a wall, or the house, he roared out from his lodge door in a stupendous voice, &#x27;Hallo, you sir!  You Copperfield!  Show that badge conspicuous, or  I&#x27;ll report you!&#x27; The playground was a bare  gravelled yard, open to all the back  of the house and the offices; and I knew that the servants read it, and the butcher read it, and the  baker read it; that  everybody, in a word,  who came backwards and forwards to the house, of a  morning when I was ordered to walk  there, read that I was to be taken care of,  for I bit, I recollect that I positively  began to have a dread of myself, as a kind of wild boy who did bite. There was an  old door in  this playground, on  which the boys  had a custom  of carving their names.  It was  completely covered with such inscriptions.   In my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming back, I could not read a boy&#x27;s name, without inquiring in what tone and with what emphasis HE would read, &#x27;Take care of him. He bites.&#x27;  There was one  boy - a certain J. Steerforth - who  cut his name very deep and very often,  who, I conceived, would read it in  a rather strong voice, and  afterwards pull my  hair.  There was  another boy, one  Tommy Traddles, who  I dreaded  would make  game of  it, and  pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me.  There  was a third, George  Demple, who I fancied  would sing it.  I have looked, a little shrinking creature, at that door, until the  owners of all the  names - there  were five-and-forty of  them in the  school then, Mr. Mell said -  seemed to send  me to Coventry  by general acclamation,  and to cry out, each in his own way, &#x27;Take care of him.  He bites!&#x27; It was the same with  the places at the desks  and forms.  It was the  same with the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at,  on my way to, and when I was  in, my own bed.  I remember dreaming night  after night, of being with my mother  as she used  to be,  or of  going to  a party  at Mr.  Peggotty&#x27;s, or of travelling outside  the stage-coach,  or of  dining again  with my  unfortunate friend  the waiter, and in all  these circumstances making people  scream and stare, by  the unhappy disclosure that  I had nothing  on but my  little night-shirt, and  that placard. In the monotony of my life, and in my constant apprehension of the re-opening of the school, it was such an insupportable affliction! I had long tasks every  day to do with Mr. Mell; but I did them, there being no Mr. and Miss Murdstone here, and got through them without disgrace.   Before, and after them, I walked  about supervised, as I have mentioned, by the  man with the wooden leg. How vividly  I call to  mind the  damp about  the house,  the green  cracked flagstones  in the court, an old leaky water-butt, and  the discoloured trunks of some of  the grim trees, which seemed to  have dripped more in  the rain than other  trees, and to have blown less in the sun!  At one  we dined, Mr. Mell and I, at the  upper end of a long bare dining-room, full of  deal tables, and smelling of fat. Then,  we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Mell  drank out of a blue teacup, and I  out of a tin pot.  All day long, and until seven or eight in the evening, Mr.  Mell, at his own detached  desk in the schoolroom,  worked hard with pen,  ink, ruler, books, and writing- paper, making out the bills (as I found) for last half-year. When he had put up his things for  the night he took out his flute, and  blew at it, until  I almost  thought he  would gradually  blow his  whole being into the large hole at the top, and ooze away at the keys. I picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms, sitting with my head upon my hand, listening to the doleful  performance of Mr. Mell, and  conning tomorrow&#x27;s lessons.  I picture myself with my books shut up, still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell,  and listening through it  to what used to  be at home, and to  the blowing  of the  wind on  Yarmouth flats,  and feeling  very sad and solitary.  I picture myself going up to bed, among the unused rooms, and sitting on my bed-side crying  for a comfortable word  from Peggotty.  I picture  myself coming downstairs in the morning, and  looking through a long ghastly gash  of a staircase window at the  school-bell hanging on the  top of an out-house  with a weathercock above it; and dreading the time when it shall ring J. Steerforth and the rest to work: which is  only second, in my foreboding apprehensions,  to the time when  the man  with the  wooden leg  shall unlock  the rusty  gate to  give admission to  the awful  Mr. Creakle.   I cannot  think I  was a  very dangerous character in any of these aspects, but in all of them I carried the same warning on my back. Mr. Mell never said much to me, but he was never harsh to me.  I suppose we were company to each other, without talking.  I forgot to mention that he would  talk to himself sometimes, and  grin, and clench his  fist, and grind his  teeth, and pull his hair in an unaccountable  manner.  But he had these peculiarities:  and at first they frightened me, though I soon got used to them. CHAPTER 6 I ENLARGE MY CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE I HAD led this  life about a month,  when the man with  the wooden leg began  to stump  about with  a mop  and a  bucket of  water, from  which I  inferred  that preparations  were  making to  receive  Mr. Creakle  and  the boys.   I  was not mistaken; for the mop came into  the schoolroom before long, and turned  out Mr. Mell and me, who lived where we could,  and got on how we could, for some  days, during which we  were always in  the way of  two or three  young women, who  had rarely shown themselves  before, and were  so continually in  the midst of  dust that I sneezed almost as much as if Salem House had been a great snuff-box. One day I was informed by Mr. Mell that Mr. Creakle would be home that  evening. In the  evening, after  tea, I  heard that  he was  come. Before  bedtime, I was fetched by the man with the wooden leg to appear before him. Mr. Creakle&#x27;s part of the house was a good deal more comfortable than ours,  and he had a  snug bit of  garden that looked  pleasant after the  dusty playground, which was such a desert  in miniature, that I thought  no one but a camel,  or a dromedary, could have felt at home in it.  It seemed to me a bold thing even  to take notice that the passage looked comfortable, as I went on my way, trembling, to Mr. Creakle&#x27;s presence: which so abashed me, when I was ushered into it, that I hardly saw Mrs. Creakle or Miss Creakle (who were both there, in the parlour), or anything but Mr. Creakle, a  stout gentleman with a bunch of  watch-chain and seals, in an arm-chair, with a tumbler and bottle beside him. &#x27;So!&#x27; said  Mr. Creakle.   &#x27;This is  the young  gentleman whose  teeth are to be filed!  Turn him round.&#x27; The wooden-legged man turned me about  so as to exhibit the placard;  and having afforded time for a full  survey of it, turned me  about again, with my face  to Mr. Creakle, and posted himself at  Mr. Creakle&#x27;s side.  Mr. Creakle&#x27;s face  was fiery, and his eyes were small, and deep in his head; he had thick veins in  his forehead, a little nose, and a large chin.  He was bald on the top of his  head; and had some thin  wet-looking hair that was  just turning grey, brushed  across each  temple,  so  that the  two  sides  interlaced on  his  forehead.   But the circumstance about him which impressed me  most, was, that he had no  voice, but spoke in a whisper.  The exertion this cost him, or the consciousness of talking in that feeble way, made his angry face so much more angry, and his thick  veins so much thicker,  when he spoke,  that I am  not surprised, on  looking back, at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one. &#x27;Now,&#x27; said Mr. Creakle.  &#x27;What&#x27;s the report of this boy?&#x27; &#x27;There&#x27;s nothing against him yet,&#x27; returned the man with the wooden leg.  &#x27;There has been no opportunity.&#x27; I thought Mr.  Creakle was disappointed.   I thought Mrs.  and Miss Creakle  (at whom I now glanced for the first time, and who were, both, thin and quiet)  were not disappointed. &#x27;Come here, sir!&#x27; said Mr. Creakle, beckoning to me. &#x27;Come here!&#x27; said the man with the wooden leg, repeating the gesture. &#x27;I have  the happiness  of knowing  your father-in-law,&#x27;  whispered Mr. Creakle, taking me by the ear; &#x27;and a worthy man he is, and a man of a strong  character. He knows me, and I know him.  Do YOU know me?  Hey?&#x27; said Mr. Creakle,  pinching my ear with ferocious playfulness. &#x27;Not yet, sir,&#x27; I said, flinching with the pain. &#x27;Not yet?  Hey?&#x27; repeated Mr. Creakle.  &#x27;But you will soon.  Hey?&#x27; &#x27;You will soon.  Hey?&#x27; repeated the man with the wooden leg.  I afterwards found that he generally acted, with his strong voice, as Mr. Creakle&#x27;s interpreter  to the boys. I was very  much frightened, and  said, I hoped  so, if he  pleased. I felt, all this while, as if my ear were blazing; he pinched it so hard. &#x27;I&#x27;ll tell you what I am,&#x27; whispered Mr. Creakle, letting it go at last, with  a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes. &#x27;I&#x27;m a Tartar.&#x27; &#x27;A Tartar,&#x27; said the man with the wooden leg. &#x27;When I say I&#x27;ll do a thing, I do it,&#x27; said Mr. Creakle; &#x27;and when I say I  will have a thing done, I will have it done.&#x27; &#x27;- Will  have a  thing done,  I will  have it  done,&#x27; repeated  the man with the wooden leg. &#x27;I am a determined  character,&#x27; said Mr. Creakle.   &#x27;That&#x27;s what I am.   I do my duty.  That&#x27;s what I do.  My flesh and blood&#x27; - he looked at Mrs. Creakle as  he said this - &#x27;when it rises against me, is not my flesh and blood.  I discard it. Has that fellow&#x27; - to the man with the wooden leg -&#x27;been here again?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; was the answer. &#x27;No,&#x27; said Mr. Creakle.  &#x27;He knows better.  He knows me.  Let him keep away.   I say let him keep away,&#x27; said Mr. Creakle, striking his hand upon the table,  and looking at Mrs. Creakle, &#x27;for he knows  me.  Now you have begun to know  me too, my young friend, and you may go.  Take him away.&#x27; I was very glad to be ordered  away, for Mrs. and Miss Creakle were  both wiping their eyes, and I felt as uncomfortable for them as I did for myself.  But I had a petition on my mind which concerned me so nearly, that I couldn&#x27;t help saying, though I wondered at my own courage: &#x27;If you please, sir -&#x27; Mr. Creakle whispered, &#x27;Hah!  What&#x27;s this?&#x27; and bent his eyes upon me, as if  he would have burnt me up with them. &#x27;If you  please, sir,&#x27;  I faltered,  &#x27;if I  might be  allowed (I  am very  sorry indeed, sir, for what I did) to take this writing off, before the boys come back -&#x27; Whether Mr. Creakle was in earnest, or whether he only did it to frighten me,  I don&#x27;t know, but he made a burst  out of his chair, before which I  precipitately retreated, without waiting for  the escort Of the  man with the wooden  leg, and never once  stopped until  I reached  my own  bedroom, where,  finding I was not pursued, I went to bed, as it was time, and lay quaking, for a couple of hours. Next morning Mr. Sharp came back.  Mr. Sharp was the first master, and  superior to Mr. Mell.   Mr. Mell took  his meals with  the boys, but  Mr. Sharp dined and supped at  Mr. Creakle&#x27;s  table.  He  was a  limp, delicate-looking gentleman, I thought, with a good deal of nose, and  a way of carrying his head on one  side, as if it were a  little too heavy for him.   His hair was very smooth  and wavy; but I was  informed by the  very first boy  who came back  that it was  a wig (a second-hand one HE said), and that  Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday  afternoon to get it curled. It was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of intelligence.   He was the first boy  who returned.  He introduced  himself by informing me  that I should find his name on the right-  hand corner of the gate, over the  top-bolt; upon that I said, &#x27;Traddles?&#x27; to which he replied, &#x27;The same,&#x27; and then he asked me for a full account of myself and family. It was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first. He enjoyed  my placard so much, that he saved me from the embarrassment of either disclosure or concealment, by presenting me to every other boy who came back, great or  small, immediately on his arrival, in this form of introduction, &#x27;Look here!  Here&#x27;s  a game!&#x27;  Happily, too, the greater part  of the boys came back low-spirited,  and were not so boisterous at my expense as I had expected.  Some of them  certainly did dance about me like wild Indians, and the greater part could not resist  the temptation of pretending that I was a  dog, and patting and soothing me, lest  I should  bite, and  saying, &#x27;Lie  down, sir!&#x27;  and calling  me Towzer.  This  was naturally confusing, among so many strangers, and cost me some tears, but on the whole it was much better than I had anticipated. I was not considered as being formally received into the school, however,  until J. Steerforth arrived.  Before this boy, who was reputed to be a great  scholar, and was  very good-looking,  and at  least half-a-dozen  years my  senior, I was carried as before a  magistrate.  He inquired, under  a shed in the  playground, into the particulars of  my punishment, and was  pleased to express his  opinion that it was &#x27;a jolly shame&#x27;; for which I became bound to him ever afterwards. &#x27;What money have you got, Copperfield?&#x27;  he said, walking aside with me  when he had disposed of my affair in these terms.  I told him seven shillings. &#x27;You had better give it to me to take care of,&#x27; he said.  &#x27;At least, you can  if you like.  You needn&#x27;t if you don&#x27;t like.&#x27; I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion, and opening Peggotty&#x27;s purse, turned it upside down into his hand. &#x27;Do you want to spend anything now?&#x27; he asked me. &#x27;No thank you,&#x27; I replied. &#x27;You can, if you like, you know,&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;Say the word.&#x27; &#x27;No, thank you, sir,&#x27; I repeated. &#x27;Perhaps you&#x27;d like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;You belong to my bedroom, I find.&#x27; It certainly had not occurred to me before, but I said, Yes, I should like that. &#x27;Very good,&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;You&#x27;ll be glad to spend another shilling or  so, in almond cakes, I dare say?&#x27; I said, Yes, I should like that, too. &#x27;And  another  shilling or  so  in biscuits,  and  another in  fruit,  eh?&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;I say, young Copperfield, you&#x27;re going it!&#x27; I smiled because he smiled, but I was a little troubled in my mind, too. &#x27;Well!&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;We must make it stretch as far as we can; that&#x27;s all. I&#x27;ll do  the best  in my  power for  you.  I  can go  out when  I like, and I&#x27;ll smuggle the  prog in.&#x27;   With these  words he  put the  money in his pocket, and kindly told me not to  make myself uneasy; he would  take care it should be  all right. He was as good as his word,  if that were all right which I had  a secret misgiving was nearly all wrong - for I feared it was a waste of my mother&#x27;s  two half-crowns - though I  had preserved the piece  of paper they were  wrapped in: which was  a precious  saving.  When  we went  upstairs to  bed, he produced the whole seven shillings&#x27;worth, and laid it out on my bed in the moonlight, saying: &#x27;There you are, young Copperfield, and a royal spread you&#x27;ve got.&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t think of doing the honours of the feast, at my time of life, while he was by; my  hand shook at  the very thought  of it.  I  begged him to  do me the favour of presiding; and my request being seconded by the other boys who were in that room, he acceded to it, and  sat  upon my pillow, handing round the  viands with perfect fairness, I must say - and dispensing the currant wine in a  little glass without a foot, which was his own  property.  As to me, I sat on his  left hand, and the rest were grouped about us, on the nearest beds and on the floor. How well I recollect our sitting  there, talking in whispers; or their  talking, and my respectfully listening,  I ought rather to  say; the moonlight falling  a little way  into the  room, through  the window,  painting a  pale window on the floor, and the  greater part of  us in shadow,  except when Steerforth  dipped a match into a phosphorus-box, when he  wanted to look for anything on  the board, and shed  a blue  glare over  us that  was gone  directly!  A certain mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness, the  secrecy of the revel, and the  whisper in which everything  was said, steals  over me again,  and I listen  to all they tell me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that they are  all so  near, and  frightens me  (though I  feign to  laugh) when  Traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner. I heard all kinds of things about  the school and all belonging to it.   I heard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred  his claim to being a Tartar  without reason; that he was  the sternest and  most severe of  masters; that he  laid about him, right  and left,  every day  of his  life, charging  in among  the boys  like  a trooper, and slashing away, unmercifully.  That he knew nothing himself, but the art of slashing, being more ignorant (J. Steerforth said) than the lowest boy in the school; that he had been, a  good many years ago, a small hop-dealer  in the Borough, and had taken to the  schooling business after being bankrupt in  hops, and making away with Mrs. Creakle&#x27;s money.  With a good deal more of that  sort, which I wondered how they knew. I  heard that  the man  with the   wooden leg,  whose name  was Tungay,  was  an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business, but had  come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence, as was supposed among the boys, of his having broken his leg in Mr. Creakle&#x27;s service, and having done a deal of dishonest  work for him, and  knowing his secrets.  I  heard that with the single exception of Mr. Creakle, Tungay considered the whole  establishment, masters and boys, as his natural enemies, and that the only delight of his  life was to be sour and malicious.  I heard  that Mr. Creakle had a son, who had  not been Tungay&#x27;s  friend, and  who, assisting  in the  school, had  once held  some remonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very cruelly exercised, and  was supposed,  besides, to  have protested  against his father&#x27;s usage of his mother.  I heard that  Mr. Creakle had turned him out of  doors, in consequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had been in a sad way, ever since. But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there being one boy  in the school  on whom  he never  ventured to  lay a  hand, and  that boy  being J. Steerforth.  Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was stated, and said that he should like to begin to see him do it.  On being asked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed if  he did begin to see  him do it, he dipped  a match into his phosphorus-box on purpose to shed a glare over his reply, and said he  would commence by knocking him  down with a  blow on the  forehead from the  seven-and sixpenny ink-bottle that was always on the mantelpiece.  We sat in the dark  for some time, breathless. I heard that Mr.  Sharp and Mr. Mell  were both supposed to  be wretchedly paid; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at Mr. Creakle&#x27;s table, Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he preferred cold; which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth, the only parlour-boarder.  I heard that Mr. Sharp&#x27;s wig didn&#x27;t fit him; and that he needn&#x27;t be so &#x27;bounceable&#x27; - somebody else said &#x27;bumptious&#x27; - about it, because his own red hair was very plainly to be seen behind. I heard that one boy, who was  a coal-merchant&#x27;s son, came as a set-off  against the coal-bill, and was  called, on that account,  &#x27;Exchange or Barter&#x27; -  a name selected from the arithmetic book as expressing this arrangement.  I heard  that the table beer was a robbery of parents, and the pudding an imposition.  I heard that Miss Creakle was  regarded by the school  in general as being  in love with Steerforth; and I am sure, as I sat in the dark, thinking of his nice voice, and his fine  face, and  his easy  manner, and  his curling  hair, I thought it very likely.  I  heard that  Mr. Mell  was not  a bad  sort of  fellow, but  hadn&#x27;t a sixpence to bless himself with; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs.  Mell, his mother, was as poor  as job.  I thought of  my breakfast then, and what  had sounded like &#x27;My Charley!&#x27; but I was, I am glad to remember, as mute as a  mouse about it. The hearing of all this, and a good deal more, outlasted the banquet some  time. The  greater part  of the  guests had  gone to  bed as  soon as  the eating  and drinking were  over; and  we, who  had remained  whispering and  listening  half undressed, at last betook ourselves to bed, too. &#x27;Good night,  young Copperfield,&#x27;  said Steerforth.   &#x27;I&#x27;ll take  care of  you.&#x27; &#x27;You&#x27;re very kind,&#x27; I gratefully returned.  &#x27;I am very much obliged to you.&#x27; &#x27;You haven&#x27;t got a sister, have you?&#x27; said Steerforth, yawning. &#x27;No,&#x27; I answered. &#x27;That&#x27;s a pity,&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;If you had had one, I should think she would have been  a pretty,  timid, little,  bright-eyed sort  of girl.   I should have liked to know her.  Good night, young Copperfield.&#x27; &#x27;Good night, sir,&#x27; I replied. I thought of him very much after I went to bed, and raised myself, I  recollect, to look at him where he lay in the moonlight, with his handsome face turned  up, and his head reclining easily on his arm.  He was a person of great power in  my eyes; that  was, of  course, the  reason of  my mind  running on him.  No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams.  There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps, in the garden that I dreamed of walking in all night. CHAPTER 7 MY &#x27;FIRST HALF&#x27; AT SALEM HOUSE School began in  earnest next day.   A profound impression  was made upon  me, I remember, by the roar  of voices in the  schoolroom suddenly becoming hushed  as death when Mr. Creakle entered after breakfast, and stood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a story-book surveying his captives. Tungay stood at Mr. Creakle&#x27;s elbow.  He had no occasion, I thought, to cry  out &#x27;Silence!&#x27;  so  ferociously,  for  the  boys  were  all  struck  speechless  and motionless. Mr. Creakle was seen to speak, and Tungay was heard, to this effect. &#x27;Now, boys, this is a new half.  Take care what you&#x27;re about, in this new  half. Come  fresh  up to  the  lessons, I  advise  you, for  I  come fresh  up  to the punishment.  I won&#x27;t flinch.  It will be of no use your rubbing yourselves;  you won&#x27;t rub the marks out that I shall give you.  Now get to work, every boy!&#x27; When this  dreadful exordium  was over,  and Tungay  had stumped  out again, Mr. Creakle came to where I  sat, and told me that  if I were famous for  biting, he was famous for  biting, too.  He  then showed me  the cane, and  asked me what I thought of  THAT, for  a tooth?   Was it  a sharp  tooth, hey?   Was it a double tooth, hey?  Had  it a deep  prong, hey?  Did  it bite, hey?   Did it bite?   At every question he gave  me a fleshy cut  with it that made  me writhe; so I  was very soon made free  of Salem House (as  Steerforth said), and was  very soon in tears also. Not that I  mean to say  these were special  marks of distinction,  which only I received.  On the contrary, a large majority of the boys (especially the smaller ones) were visited  with similar instances  of notice, as  Mr. Creakle made  the round of the schoolroom.  Half the establishment was writhing and crying, before the day&#x27;s work began; and how much of it had writhed and cried before the  day&#x27;s work  was  over,  I  am  really afraid  to  recollect,  lest  I  should seem  to exaggerate. I should think there never can have  been a man who enjoyed his profession  more than Mr. Creakle did.  He had a  delight in cutting at the boys, which  was like the satisfaction of a craving appetite. I am confident that he couldn&#x27;t resist a chubby boy, especially; that  there was a fascination  in such a subject,  which made him restless in his mind, until he had scored and marked him for the day. I was chubby myself, and ought to know.  I am sure when I think of the fellow now, my blood rises against him with the disinterested indignation I should feel if I could have known  all about him  without having ever  been in his  power; but it rises hotly, because I know him to have been an incapable brute, who had no more right to be possessed of the great trust he held, than to be Lord High  Admiral, or Commander-in-Chief -  in either of  which capacities it  is probable that  he would have done infinitely less mischief. Miserable little propitiators of a remorseless Idol, how abject we were to  him! What a launch in life I think it now, on looking back, to be so mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions! Here I sit at the desk again, watching his eye - humbly watching his eye, as  he rules a ciphering-book for another  victim whose hands have just  been flattened by that identical ruler, and who is trying  to wipe the sting out with a  pocket handkerchief.  I  have plenty  to do.   I don&#x27;t  watch his  eye in idleness, but because I am morbidly attracted to it, in a dread desire to know what he will do next, and whether it will  be my turn to suffer,  or somebody else&#x27;s. A lane  of small boys beyond me, with the same interest in his eye, watch it too.  I  think he knows it, though he pretends he  don&#x27;t. He makes dreadful mouths as he  rules the ciphering-book; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane, and we all droop over our books and tremble.  A moment afterwards we are again eyeing  him. An  unhappy  culprit, found  guilty  of imperfect  exercise,  approaches at  his command.   The culprit  falters excuses,  and professes  a determination  to  do better tomorrow.  Mr. Creakle cuts a joke  before he beats him, and we laugh  at it, - miserable little dogs, we laugh,  with our visages as white as ashes,  and our hearts sinking into our boots. Here I sit at the desk again, on  a drowsy summer afternoon.  A buzz and hum  go up around me, as if the boys were so many bluebottles. A cloggy sensation of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me (we dined an hour or two ago), and my head is as heavy as so much lead.   I would give the world  to go to sleep.  I  sit with my eye on Mr. Creakle, blinking at him  like a young owl; when sleep overpowers  me for a minute, he still  looms through my slumber, ruling  those ciphering-books, until he softly comes behind me and wakes me to plainer perception of him,  with a red ridge across my back. Here I am in the playground, with my eye still fascinated by him, though I can&#x27;t see him.  The  window at a  little distance from  which I know  he is having his dinner, stands for him, and I eye  that instead.  If he shows his face  near it, mine assumes an  imploring and submissive  expression.  If he  looks out through the glass, the boldest boy (Steerforth excepted) stops in the middle of a  shout or yell, and becomes contemplative.  One day, Traddles (the most unfortunate boy in the world) breaks that window  accidentally, with a ball.  I shudder  at this moment with the  tremendous sensation of  seeing it done,  and feeling that  the ball has bounded on to Mr. Creakle&#x27;s sacred head. Poor Traddles!  In a tight sky-blue suit that made his arms and legs like German sausages, or roly-poly puddings, he was  the merriest and most miserable of  all the boys.  He was always being caned - I think he was caned every day that  half year, except one holiday Monday when he was only ruler&#x27;d on both hands - and was always going to write  to his uncle about  it, and never did.   After laying his head on the desk for a little while, he would cheer up, somehow, begin to  laugh again, and draw skeletons all over his slate, before his eyes were dry.  I  used at first to  wonder what comfort  Traddles found in  drawing skeletons; and  for some time looked  upon him as  a sort of  hermit, who reminded  himself by those symbols of mortality that caning couldn&#x27;t last for ever.  But I believe he  only did it because they were easy, and didn&#x27;t want any features. He was very honourable, Traddles was, and  held it as a solemn duty in  the boys to  stand  by one  another.   He suffered  for  this on  several  occasions; and particularly once, when Steerforth laughed in church, and the Beadle thought  it was Traddles, and took him out.  I see him now, going away in custody,  despised by the congregation.  He never said who was the real offender, though he smarted for it next  day, and was  imprisoned so many  hours that he  came forth with  a whole churchyard-full of skeletons swarming all over his Latin Dictionary.   But he had his reward.  Steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in  Traddles, and we all felt that to be the  highest praise.  For my part, I could have  gone through a good  deal (though I  was much less  brave than Traddles,  and nothing like so old) to have won such a recompense. To see Steerforth walk  to church before us,  arm-in-arm with Miss Creakle,  was one of the great sights of my life.  I didn&#x27;t think Miss Creakle equal to little Em&#x27;ly in point of beauty, and I  didn&#x27;t love her (I didn&#x27;t dare); but  I thought her a young lady of extraordinary attractions, and in point of gentility not  to be surpassed.  When Steerforth, in white trousers, carried her parasol for  her, I felt proud to know him; and  believed that she could not choose but  adore him with all her heart.  Mr. Sharp and  Mr. Mell were both notable personages in  my eyes; but Steerforth was to them what the sun was to two stars. Steerforth continued  his protection  of me,  and proved  a very  useful friend; since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his countenance.  He  couldn&#x27;t -  or at  all events  he didn&#x27;t  - defend me from Mr. Creakle, who was very severe with me; but whenever I had been treated worse than usual, he  always told  me that  I wanted  a little  of his  pluck, and  that he wouldn&#x27;t have stood it himself; which I felt he intended for encouragement,  and considered to be very kind of him.  There was one advantage, and only one that I know of, in Mr. Creakle&#x27;s severity.  He found my placard in his way when he came up or down behind  the form on which  I sat, and wanted  to make a cut  at me in passing; for this reason it was soon taken off, and I saw it no more. An accidental circumstance cemented the intimacy between Steerforth and me, in a manner that inspired me with  great pride and satisfaction, though  it sometimes led to inconvenience.   It happened on  one occasion, when  he was doing  me the honour of talking to me in the playground, that I hazarded the observation  that something or somebody -  I forget what now  - was like something  or somebody in Peregrine Pickle.  He said nothing at the  time; but when I was going to  bed at night, asked me if I had got that book? I told him no, and explained how it was that I had read it, and all those  other books of which I have made mention. &#x27;And do you recollect them?&#x27; Steerforth said. &#x27;Oh yes,&#x27; I replied; I had a good memory, and I believed I recollected them very well. &#x27;Then I tell you what, young Copperfield,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;you shall tell  &#x27;em to me.  I can&#x27;t get  to sleep very early at  night, and I generally wake  rather early in the  morning.  We&#x27;ll go  over &#x27;em one  after another.  We&#x27;ll  make some regular Arabian Nights of it.&#x27; I felt  extremely flattered  by this  arrangement, and  we commenced carrying it into execution  that very  evening.  What  ravages I  committed on  my favourite authors in the course of my interpretation  of them, I am not in a  condition to say, and should be very unwilling to  know; but I had a profound faith  in them, and I had, to the best of my belief, a simple, earnest manner of narrating  what I did narrate; and these qualities went a long way. The drawback  was, that  I was  often sleepy  at night,  or out  of spirits  and indisposed to resume the story; and then it was rather hard work, and it must be done; for  to disappoint  or to  displease Steerforth  was of  course out of the question.  In  the morning,  too, when  I felt  weary, and  should have  enjoyed another hour&#x27;s repose very much, it was a tiresome thing to be roused, like  the Sultana Scheherazade, and  forced into a  long story before  the getting-up bell rang; but Steerforth was resolute; and as he explained to me, in return, my sums and exercises, and anything in my tasks that was too hard for me, I was no loser by the  transaction.  Let  me do  myself justice,  however.  I  was moved  by no interested or selfish  motive, nor was  I moved by  fear of him.   I admired and loved him, and his approval was return enough.  It was so precious to me that  I look back on these trifles, now, with an aching heart. Steerforth was considerate, too; and showed his consideration, in one particular instance, in an unflinching manner that was a little tantalizing, I suspect,  to poor Traddles  and the  rest.  Peggotty&#x27;s  promised letter  - what a comfortable letter it was!  - arrived before  &#x27;the half&#x27; was  many weeks old;  and with it a cake  in a  perfect nest  of oranges,  and two  bottles of  cowslip wine.   This treasure, as in duty bound, I laid at the feet of Steerforth, and begged him  to dispense. &#x27;Now, I&#x27;ll tell you what, young  Copperfield,&#x27; said he: &#x27;the wine shall  be kept to wet your whistle when you are story-telling.&#x27; I blushed at the idea, and begged him,  in my modesty, not to think of it.   But he said he had observed  I was sometimes hoarse -  a little roopy was his  exact expression  - and  it should  be, every  drop, devoted  to the  purpose he   had mentioned.  Accordingly, it was locked up  in his box, and drawn off  by himself in a phial, and administered to me through a piece of quill in the cork, when  I was supposed  to be  in want  of a  restorative.  Sometimes,  to make  it a more sovereign specific, he  was so kind  as to squeeze  orange juice into  it, or to stir it  up with  ginger, or  dissolve a  peppermint drop  in it; and although I cannot assert that the flavour was improved by these experiments, or that it was exactly the compound one  would have chosen for  a stomachic, the last  thing at night and the  first thing in  the morning, I  drank it gratefully  and was very sensible of his attention. We seem, to  me, to have  been months over  Peregrine, and months  more over the other stories.  The institution never flagged for want of a story, I am certain; and the wine lasted out almost as  well as the matter.  Poor Traddles -  I never think of that boy but with a strange disposition to laugh, and with tears in  my eyes - was a sort of chorus, in general; and affected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts, and to be  overcome with fear when there was any  passage of an alarming character in the narrative.  This rather put me out, very often.  It was a great jest of his, I recollect, to pretend that he couldn&#x27;t keep his teeth from chattering, whenever mention was made of an Alguazill in connexion with the adventures of Gil Blas; and I remember that when Gil Blas met the captain of the robbers in Madrid, this unlucky joker counterfeited such an ague of terror, that he  was  overheard by  Mr.  Creakle, who  was  prowling about  the  passage, and handsomely flogged for disorderly conduct in the bedroom. Whatever I had  within me that was romantic and dreamy, was encouraged by so much story-telling in  the dark; and in that respect the pursuit  may not have been very profitable to  me. But the being cherished as a kind of plaything in my room, and the consciousness that this accomplishment of mine was bruited about among the boys, and attracted a good deal of notice  to me though I was  the youngest there, stimulated me  to exertion.  In a school carried on by sheer cruelty, whether it is presided  over by a dunce or not,  there is not likely to  be much learnt.  I believe  our boys were, generally, as ignorant a set as any schoolboys in existence; they were too much  troubled  and knocked  about  to learn;  they  could no  more  do that  to advantage, than  any one  can do  anything to  advantage in  a life  of constant misfortune, torment,  and worry.  But my  little vanity,  and Steerforth&#x27;s help, urged me on somehow; and without saving me from much, if anything, in the way of punishment, made me, for the time I was there, an exception to the general body, insomuch that I did steadily pick up some crumbs of knowledge. In this  I was  much assisted  by Mr.  Mell, who  had a  liking for me that I am grateful to remember.  It always gave me pain to observe that Steerforth treated him with systematic disparagement, and  seldom lost an occasion of  wounding his feelings, or inducing  others to do  so.  This troubled  me the more  for a long time, because I had soon told Steerforth, from whom I could no more keep such  a secret, than I could keep a cake or any other tangible possession, about the two old women Mr. Mell had taken me to see; and I was always afraid that  Steerforth would let it out, and twit him with it. We little thought, any one of us, I dare say, when I ate my breakfast that first morning, and went  to sleep under  the shadow of  the peacock&#x27;s feathers  to the sound of the flute, what consequences would come of the introduction into  those alms-houses  of  my insignificant  person.   But the  visit  had its  unforeseen consequences; and of a serious sort, too, in their way. One day  when Mr.  Creakle kept  the house  from indisposition,  which naturally diffused a lively joy through the school, there was a good deal of noise in  the course of the morning&#x27;s work.  The great relief and satisfaction experienced  by the boys made them  difficult to manage; and  though the dreaded Tungay  brought his wooden leg in  twice or thrice, and  took notes of the  principal offenders&#x27; names, no great impression was made by  it, as they were pretty sure of  getting into trouble tomorrow,  do what they  would, and thought  it wise, no  doubt, to enjoy themselves today. It was,  properly, a  half-holiday; being  Saturday.  But  as the  noise in  the playground would have disturbed Mr. Creakle, and the weather was not  favourable for going out  walking, we were  ordered into school  in the afternoon,  and set some lighter tasks than usual, which were made for the occasion.  It was the day of the week on which Mr. Sharp went out to get his wig curled; so Mr. Mell,  who always did the  drudgery, whatever it  was, kept school  by himself. If  I could associate the idea of a bull or a bear with anyone so mild as Mr. Mell, I should think  of him,  in connexion  with that  afternoon when  the uproar  was at  its height, as of  one of those  animals, baited by  a thousand dogs.   I recall him bending his aching head, supported on his bony hand, over the book on his  desk, and wretchedly endeavouring to get on  with his tiresome work, amidst an  uproar that might have made the Speaker of the House of Commons giddy.  Boys started in and out of their  places, playing at puss  in the corner with  other boys; there were laughing boys, singing boys, talking boys, dancing boys, howling boys; boys shuffled  with  their feet,  boys  whirled about  him,  grinning, making  faces, mimicking him behind his  back and before his  eyes; mimicking his poverty,  his boots, his coat, his mother, everything  belonging to him that they should  have had consideration for. &#x27;Silence!&#x27; cried Mr. Mell,  suddenly rising up, and  striking his desk with  the book.  &#x27;What does this mean!  It&#x27;s impossible to bear it.  It&#x27;s maddening.   How can you do it to me, boys?&#x27; It  was my  book that  he struck  his desk  with; and  as I  stood beside   him, following his eye as it  glanced round the room, I  saw the boys all stop,  some suddenly surprised, some half afraid, and some sorry perhaps. Steerforth&#x27;s place was at the bottom of  the school, at the opposite end of  the long room.  He was lounging with his back against the wall, and his hands in his pockets, and looked at Mr. Mell with his mouth shut up as if he were  whistling, when Mr. Mell looked at him. &#x27;Silence, Mr. Steerforth!&#x27; said Mr. Mell. &#x27;Silence yourself,&#x27; said Steerforth, turning red.  &#x27;Whom are you talking to?&#x27; &#x27;Sit down,&#x27; said Mr. Mell. &#x27;Sit down yourself,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;and mind your business.&#x27; There was a titter, and some applause;  but Mr. Mell was so white, that  silence immediately succeeded; and one boy, who had darted out behind him to imitate his mother again, changed his mind, and pretended to want a pen mended. &#x27;If you think, Steerforth,&#x27;  said Mr. Mell, &#x27;that  I am not acquainted  with the power  you  can establish  over  any mind  here&#x27;  - he  laid  his hand,  without considering what he  did (as I  supposed), upon my  head - &#x27;or  that I have  not observed you,  within a  few minutes,  urging your  juniors on  to every sort of outrage against me, you are mistaken.&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t give myself the trouble of thinking at all about you,&#x27; said Steerforth, coolly; &#x27;so I&#x27;m not mistaken, as it happens.&#x27; &#x27;And when you make use of  your position of favouritism here, sir,&#x27;  pursued Mr. Mell, with his lip trembling very much, &#x27;to insult a gentleman -&#x27; &#x27;A what? - where is he?&#x27; said Steerforth. Here somebody  cried out,  &#x27;Shame, J.  Steerforth!  Too  bad!&#x27;  It was Traddles; whom Mr. Mell instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his tongue. - &#x27;To insult one who is not fortunate  in life, sir, and who never gave you  the least offence, and the  many reasons for not  insulting whom you are  old enough and wise enough to understand,&#x27; said Mr. Mell, with his lips trembling more  and more, &#x27;you commit a mean and base action.   You can sit down or stand up as  you please, sir. Copperfield, go on.&#x27; &#x27;Young Copperfield,&#x27; said Steerforth, coming forward up the room, &#x27;stop a bit. I tell you what, Mr. Mell, once for all.  When you take the liberty of calling  me mean or base,  or anything of  that sort, you  are an impudent  beggar.  You are always a beggar, you know; but when you do that, you are an impudent beggar.&#x27; I am not clear whether he was going to strike Mr. Mell, or Mr. Mell was going to strike him, or there  was any such intention  on either side.  I  saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned into stone, and found  Mr. Creakle in the midst of us, with  Tungay at his side, and Mrs. and  Miss Creakle looking in at the door as if they were frightened.  Mr. Mell, with his elbows on his desk and his face in his hands, sat, for some moments, quite still. &#x27;Mr. Mell,&#x27; said  Mr. Creakle, shaking  him by the  arm; and his  whisper was so audible now, that Tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words; &#x27;you have  not forgotten yourself, I hope?&#x27; &#x27;No, sir, no,&#x27; returned the Master, showing his face, and shaking his head,  and rubbing his hands in great agitation.  &#x27;No, sir.  No. I have remembered  myself, I - no, Mr. Creakle, I have not forgotten myself, I - I have remembered  myself, sir.  I - I - could wish you had remembered me a little sooner, Mr. Creakle.  It - it - would have been more kind,  sir, more just, sir.  It would have saved  me something, sir.&#x27; Mr. Creakle, looking hard  at Mr. Mell, put  his hand on Tungay&#x27;s  shoulder, and got his feet upon the form close by, and sat upon the desk.  After still looking hard at Mr. Mell from  his throne, as he shook  his head, and rubbed his  hands, and remained in the same state  of agitation, Mr. Creakle turned to  Steerforth, and said: &#x27;Now, sir, as he don&#x27;t condescend to tell me, what is this?&#x27; Steerforth evaded the question for a little while; looking in scorn and anger on his opponent,  and remaining  silent.  I  could not  help thinking  even in that interval, I remember, what a noble  fellow he was in appearance, and  how homely and plain Mr. Mell looked opposed to him. &#x27;What did he mean by talking about favourites, then?&#x27; said Steerforth at length. &#x27;Favourites?&#x27; repeated  Mr. Creakle,  with the  veins in  his forehead  swelling quickly.  &#x27;Who talked about favourites?&#x27; &#x27;He did,&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;And  pray, what  did you  mean by  that, sir?&#x27;  demanded Mr.  Creakle,  turning angrily on his assistant. &#x27;I meant, Mr. Creakle,&#x27; he  returned in a low voice,  &#x27;as I said; that no  pupil had a right to avail himself of his position of favouritism to degrade me.&#x27; &#x27;To degrade YOU?&#x27; said Mr. Creakle.  &#x27;My  stars!  But give me leave to ask  you, Mr. What&#x27;s-your-name&#x27;; and here Mr. Creakle folded his arms, cane and all,  upon his chest, and made such  a knot of his brows  that his little eyes were  hardly visible below them; &#x27;whether, when you talk about favourites, you showed  proper respect to me?  To me, sir,&#x27; said Mr. Creakle, darting his head at him suddenly, and  drawing it  back again,  &#x27;the principal  of this  establishment, and   your employer.&#x27; &#x27;It was not judicious, sir, I am willing to admit,&#x27; said Mr. Mell. &#x27;I should not have done so, if I had been cool.&#x27; Here Steerforth struck in. &#x27;Then he said I was mean, and then he  said I was base, and then I called him  a beggar.  If I had been cool, perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have called him a beggar.   But I did, and I am ready to take the consequences of it.&#x27; Without considering, perhaps, whether there were any consequences to be taken, I felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech.  It made an impression on the  boys too, for there was a low stir among them, though no one spoke a word. &#x27;I am surprised, Steerforth - although  your candour does you honour,&#x27; said  Mr. Creakle, &#x27;does you honour, certainly -  I am surprised, Steerforth, I must  say, that you should attach such an epithet to any person employed and paid in  Salem House, sir.&#x27; Steerforth gave a short laugh. &#x27;That&#x27;s not an  answer, sir,&#x27; said  Mr. Creakle, &#x27;to  my remark.  I  expect more than that from you, Steerforth.&#x27; If Mr.  Mell looked  homely, in  my eyes,  before the  handsome boy, it would be quite impossible to say how homely  Mr. Creakle looked. &#x27;Let him deny  it,&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Deny that he is a beggar, Steerforth?&#x27; cried Mr. Creakle.  &#x27;Why, where does  he go a-begging?&#x27; &#x27;If he is not a beggar himself, his near relation&#x27;s one,&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;It&#x27;s all the same.&#x27; He glanced at  me, and Mr.  Mell&#x27;s hand gently  patted me upon  the shoulder.  I looked up with a flush upon my face and remorse in my heart, but Mr. Mell&#x27;s eyes were fixed on Steerforth.  He continued to pat me kindly on the shoulder, but he looked at him. &#x27;Since you expect me, Mr. Creakle, to justify myself,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;and  to say what I mean, - what I have to say is, that his mother lives on charity in an alms-house.&#x27; Mr. Mell still looked  at him, and still  patted me kindly on  the shoulder, and said to himself, in a whisper, if I heard right: &#x27;Yes, I thought so.&#x27; Mr.  Creakle  turned  to  his  assistant,  with  a  severe  frown  and  laboured politeness: &#x27;Now, you hear what  this gentleman says, Mr.  Mell.  Have the goodness,  if you please, to set him right before the assembled school.&#x27; &#x27;He is right,  sir, without correction,&#x27;  returned Mr. Mell,  in the midst  of a dead silence; &#x27;what he has said is true.&#x27; &#x27;Be so good then as declare  publicly, will you,&#x27; said Mr. Creakle,  putting his head on one side, and rolling his  eyes round the school, &#x27;whether it ever  came to my knowledge until this moment?&#x27; &#x27;I believe not directly,&#x27; he returned. &#x27;Why, you know not,&#x27; said Mr. Creakle.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t you, man?&#x27; &#x27;I  apprehend you  never supposed  my worldly  circumstances to  be very  good,&#x27; replied the  assistant.  &#x27;You  know what  my position  is, and  always has been, here.&#x27; &#x27;I apprehend, if you  come to that,&#x27; said  Mr. Creakle, with his  veins swelling again bigger than ever,  &#x27;that you&#x27;ve been in  a wrong position altogether,  and mistook this for a  charity school.  Mr. Mell,  we&#x27;ll part, if you  please.  The sooner the better.&#x27; &#x27;There is no time,&#x27; answered Mr. Mell, rising, &#x27;like the present.&#x27; &#x27;Sir, to you!&#x27; said Mr. Creakle. &#x27;I take my leave of you, Mr.  Creakle, and all of you,&#x27; said Mr.  Mell, glancing round  the  room,  and  again  patting  me  gently  on  the  shoulders.   &#x27;James Steerforth, the best wish I can leave you is that you may come to be ashamed  of what you have done today.  At present I would prefer to see you anything  rather than a friend, to me, or to anyone in whom I feel an interest.&#x27; Once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder; and then taking his flute and a few books from his desk, and leaving the key in it for his successor, he went out of the school, with his  property under his arm.   Mr. Creakle then made  a speech, through Tungay, in which he thanked Steerforth for asserting (though perhaps too warmly) the independence and respectability  of Salem House; and which  he wound up by  shaking hands  with Steerforth,  while we  gave three  cheers - I did not quite  know what  for, but  I supposed  for Steerforth,  and so  joined in  them ardently, though I  felt miserable.  Mr.  Creakle then caned  Tommy Traddles for being  discovered  in  tears,  instead  of  cheers,  on  account  of  Mr. Mell&#x27;s departure; and went back to his sofa, or his bed, or wherever he had come from. We  were left  to ourselves  now, and  looked very  blank, I  recollect, on  one another.  For myself, I felt so much self-reproach and contrition for my part in what had happened, that nothing would have enabled me to keep back my tears  but the  fear  that Steerforth,  who  often looked  at  me, I  saw,  might think  it unfriendly - or,  I should rather  say, considering our  relative ages, and  the feeling with which  I regarded him,  undutiful - if  I showed the  emotion which distressed me.  He  was very angry  with Traddles, and  said he was  glad he had caught it. Poor Traddles, who had  passed the stage of  lying with his head  upon the desk, and was relieving  himself as usual  with a burst  of skeletons, said  he didn&#x27;t care.  Mr. Mell was ill-used. &#x27;Who has ill-used him, you girl?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Why, you have,&#x27; returned Traddles. &#x27;What have I done?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;What have you done?&#x27; retorted Traddles.   &#x27;Hurt his feelings, and lost him  his situation.&#x27; &#x27;His feelings?&#x27; repeated Steerforth  disdainfully.  &#x27;His feelings will  soon get the  better  of it,  I&#x27;ll  be bound.   His  feelings are  not  like yours,  Miss Traddles.  As to his situation - which  was a precious one, wasn&#x27;t it? -  do you suppose I am  not going to  write home, and  take care that  he gets some money? Polly?&#x27; We thought this intention  very noble in Steerforth,  whose mother was a  widow, and rich, and would do almost anything, it was said, that he asked her.  We were all extremely glad to  see Traddles so put  down, and exalted Steerforth  to the skies: especially when he  told us, as he  condescended to do, that  what he had done  had been  done expressly  for us,   and for  our cause;  and that  he  had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly doing it. But I must say that when I was going on with a story in the dark that night, Mr. Mell&#x27;s old flute  seemed more than once to sound mournfully in my ears; and that when at last  Steerforth was  tired, and  I lay  down in  my bed,  I fancied  it playing  so  sorrowfully somewhere, that I was quite wretched. I soon forgot him  in the contemplation of  Steerforth, who, in an  easy amateur way, and without any  book (he seemed to  me to know everything  by heart), took some of his classes until  a new master was found.   The new master came from  a grammar school; and before  he entered on his  duties, dined in the  parlour one day, to  be introduced  to Steerforth.   Steerforth approved  of him highly, and told us he was a Brick.  Without exactly understanding what learned  distinction was meant by this, I respected him greatly for it, and had no doubt whatever  of his superior knowledge: though he never took the pains with me - not that I  was anybody - that Mr. Mell had taken. There was only one other event in this half-year, out of the daily  school-life, that made  an impression  upon me  which still  survives. It  survives for  many reasons. One afternoon, when we were all harassed into a state of dire confusion, and Mr. Creakle was laying about him dreadfully,  Tungay came in, and called out  in his usual strong way: &#x27;Visitors for Copperfield!&#x27; A few words were interchanged between him and Mr. Creakle, as, who the  visitors were, and what room they were to  be shown into; and then I, who  had, according to custom, stood up  on the announcement being  made, and felt quite  faint with astonishment, was told to go by the back stairs and get a clean frill on, before I repaired to  the dining-room.  These  orders I obeyed,  in such a  flutter and hurry of my young  spirits as I had  never known before; and  when I got to  the parlour door, and the thought came into my  head that it might be my mother -  I had only thought of Mr. or Miss Murdstone until then - I drew back my hand  from the lock, and stopped to have a sob before I went in. At first I saw nobody; but feeling  a pressure against the door, I looked  round it, and there, to  my amazement, were Mr.  Peggotty and Ham, ducking  at me with their  hats, and  squeezing one  another against  the wall.   I could  not  help laughing; but  it was  much more  in the  pleasure of  seeing them,  than at the appearance they made. We  shook hands in a  very cordial way; and  I laughed and laughed, until I pulled out my pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes. Mr. Peggotty  (who never  shut his  mouth once,  I remember,  during the  visit) showed great concern when he saw me do this, and nudged Ham to say something. &#x27;Cheer up, Mas&#x27;r Davy bor&#x27;!&#x27; said Ham, in his simpering way.  &#x27;Why, how you have growed!&#x27; &#x27;Am  I  grown?&#x27; I  said,  drying my  eyes.   I was  not  crying at  anything  in particular that I know of; but somehow it made me cry, to see old friends. &#x27;Growed, Mas&#x27;r Davy bor&#x27;?  Ain&#x27;t he growed!&#x27; said Ham. &#x27;Ain&#x27;t he growed!&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. They made  me laugh  again by  laughing at  each other,  and then  we all  three laughed until I was in danger of crying again. &#x27;Do you know how mama  is, Mr. Peggotty?&#x27; I said.   &#x27;And how my dear, dear,  old Peggotty is?&#x27; &#x27;Oncommon,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;And little Em&#x27;ly, and Mrs. Gummidge?&#x27; &#x27;On - common,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty. There was a silence.  Mr. Peggotty, to relieve it, took two prodigious lobsters, and an enormous crab, and a large canvas bag of shrimps, out of his pockets, and piled them up in Ham&#x27;s arms. &#x27;You see,&#x27; said  Mr. Peggotty, &#x27;knowing  as you was  partial to a  little relish with your  wittles when  you was  along with  us, we  took the liberty.  The old Mawther biled &#x27;em, she did.  Mrs. Gummidge biled &#x27;em.  Yes,&#x27; said Mr.  Peggotty, slowly, who I thought appeared to stick  to the subject on account of having  no other subject ready, &#x27;Mrs. Gummidge, I do assure you, she biled &#x27;em.&#x27; I expressed my thanks; and Mr. Peggotty, after looking at Ham, who stood smiling sheepishly over the shellfish, without making any attempt to help him, said: &#x27;We  come, you  see, the  wind and  tide making  in our  favour, in  one of  our Yarmouth lugs to  Gravesen&#x27;.  My sister  she wrote to  me the name  of this here place, and wrote to me as if ever I chanced to come to Gravesen&#x27;, I was to  come over and inquire for Mas&#x27;r Davy and give her dooty, humbly wishing him well  and reporting of  the fam&#x27;ly  as they  was oncommon  toe-be-sure.  Little Em&#x27;ly, you see, she&#x27;ll  write to  my sister  when I  go back,  as I  see you and as you was similarly oncommon, and so we make it quite a merry- go-rounder.&#x27; I was obliged to consider a  little before I understood what Mr.  Peggotty meant by this figure, expressive of a complete circle of intelligence.  I then thanked him  heartily; and  said, with  a consciousness  of reddening,  that I  supposed little Em&#x27;ly was altered too, since we used to pick up shells and pebbles on the beach? &#x27;She&#x27;s  getting  to be  a  woman, that&#x27;s  wot  she&#x27;s getting  to  be,&#x27; said  Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;Ask HIM.&#x27; He meant Ham, who beamed with delight and assent over  the bag of shrimps. &#x27;Her pretty face!&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty, with his own shining like a light. &#x27;Her learning!&#x27; said Ham. &#x27;Her writing!&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;Why it&#x27;s  as black as jet!  And so large  it is, you might see it anywheres.&#x27; It was perfectly delightful to  behold with what enthusiasm Mr.  Peggotty became inspired when he thought of his little favourite. He stands before me again, his bluff hairy face irradiating with a joyful love and pride, for which I can  find no description.  His honest eyes fire  up, and sparkle, as if their  depths were stirred by something bright.  His broad chest heaves with pleasure.  His  strong loose hands  clench themselves,  in his  earnestness; and  he emphasizes what he says with a right arm that shows, in my pigmy view, like a sledge-hammer. Ham was quite as earnest as he.  I dare say they would have said much more about her, if they  had not been  abashed by the  unexpected coming in  of Steerforth, who, seeing me in a corner speaking with two strangers, stopped in a song he was singing, and said: &#x27;I didn&#x27;t know you were here, young Copperfield!&#x27; (for it was not the usual visiting room) and crossed by us on his way out. I am not sure whether it was in the pride of having such a friend as Steerforth, or in  the desire  to explain  to him  how I  came to  have such a friend as Mr. Peggotty, that I called  to him as   he was going  away.  But I  said,  modestly Good Heaven, how it all comes back to me this long time afterwards! - &#x27;Don&#x27;t go, Steerforth,  if you please.   These are two  Yarmouth boatmen -  very kind, good people - who are relations of my nurse, and have come from  Gravesend to see me.&#x27; &#x27;Aye, aye?&#x27; said  Steerforth, returning.  &#x27;I  am glad to  see them. How  are you both?&#x27; There was  an ease  in his  manner -  a gay  and light  manner it  was, but  not swaggering - which I still believe to have borne a kind of enchantment with  it. I  still  believe him,  in  virtue of  this  carriage, his  animal  spirits, his delightful voice, his handsome face and  figure, and, for aught I know,  of some inborn power of attraction besides (which I think a few people possess), to have carried a spell with him to which it was a natural weakness to yield, and  which not many persons  could withstand.  I  could not but  see how pleased  they were with him, and how they seemed to open their hearts to him in a moment. &#x27;You must let  them know at  home, if you  please, Mr. Peggotty,&#x27;  I said, &#x27;when that letter is sent, that  Mr. Steerforth is very kind  to me, and that I  don&#x27;t know what I should ever do here without him.&#x27; &#x27;Nonsense!&#x27; said Steerforth, laughing.  &#x27;You  mustn&#x27;t tell them anything of  the sort.&#x27; &#x27;And if  Mr. Steerforth  ever comes  into Norfolk  or Suffolk,  Mr. Peggotty,&#x27; I said, &#x27;while I am there, you may  depend upon it I shall bring him  to Yarmouth, if  he  will let  me,  to see  your  house. You  never  saw such  a  good house, Steerforth.  It&#x27;s made out of a boat!&#x27; &#x27;Made out of a boat, is it?&#x27;  said Steerforth.  &#x27;It&#x27;s the right sort of  a house for such a thorough-built boatman.&#x27; &#x27;So  &#x27;tis,  sir,  so  &#x27;tis, sir,&#x27;  said  Ham,  grinning.   &#x27;You&#x27;re right,  young gen&#x27;l&#x27;m&#x27;n!  Mas&#x27;r Davy bor&#x27;, gen&#x27;l&#x27;m&#x27;n&#x27;s right.  A thorough- built boatman! Hor, hor!  That&#x27;s what he is, too!&#x27; Mr. Peggotty was no less pleased than his nephew, though his modesty forbade him to claim a personal compliment so vociferously. &#x27;Well, sir,&#x27;  he said,  bowing and  chuckling, and  tucking in  the ends  of his neckerchief at his breast: &#x27;I thankee, sir, I thankee!  I do my endeavours in my line of life, sir.&#x27; &#x27;The best of men can do no more, Mr. Peggotty,&#x27; said Steerforth. He had got  his name already. &#x27;I&#x27;ll pound it, it&#x27;s wot you  do yourself, sir,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty,  shaking his head, &#x27;and wot you do well - right well!  I thankee, sir.  I&#x27;m obleeged to  you, sir, for  your welcoming  manner of  me. I&#x27;m  rough, sir,  but I&#x27;m ready - least ways, I hope I&#x27;m  ready, you unnerstand.  My  house ain&#x27;t much for  to see, sir, but it&#x27;s hearty at your service if ever you should come along with Mas&#x27;r Davy to see it.   I&#x27;m a  reg&#x27;lar Dodman,  I am,&#x27;  said Mr.  Peggotty, by  which he meant snail, and this was in allusion to his being slow to go, for he had attempted to go after every sentence, and had somehow  or other come back again; &#x27;but I  wish you both well, and I wish you happy!&#x27; Ham echoed this sentiment, and we  parted with them in the heartiest  manner.  I was almost tempted  that evening to  tell Steerforth about  pretty little Em&#x27;ly, but I was too timid of mentioning her name, and too much afraid of his  laughing at me.  I remember  that I thought a  good deal, and in  an uneasy sort of  way, about Mr. Peggotty  having said that  she was getting  on to be  a woman; but  I decided that was nonsense. We  transported the  shellfish, or  the &#x27;relish&#x27;  as Mr.  Peggotty had  modestly called it, up into  our room unobserved, and  made a great supper  that evening. But Traddles couldn&#x27;t get happily out of it. He was too unfortunate even to come through a  supper like  anybody else.   He was  taken ill  in the  night - quite prostrate he was -  in consequence of Crab;  and after being drugged  with black draughts and blue pills, to an  extent which Demple (whose father was  a doctor) said was enough to undermine a  horse&#x27;s constitution, received a caning and  six chapters of Greek Testament for refusing to confess. The rest of the half-year is a jumble in my recollection of the daily strife and struggle of  our lives;  of the  waning summer  and the  changing season; of the frosty mornings when we were  rung out of bed, and  the cold, cold smell of  the dark nights when we  were rung into bed  again; of the evening  schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed, and  the morning schoolroom which was  nothing but a  great shivering-machine;  of the  alternation of  boiled beef  with roast beef, and boiled mutton with roast  mutton; of clods of bread-and-butter,  dog&#x27;s eared lesson-books, cracked slates, tear-blotted copy-books, canings, rulerings, hair-cuttings,  rainy Sundays,  suet-puddings, and  a dirty  atmosphere of  ink, surrounding all. I well remember though, how the distant idea of the holidays, after seeming  for an immense time to be a stationary speck, began to come towards us, and to  grow and grow.  How from counting months, we came to weeks, and then to days; and how I then began to be afraid that I  should not be sent for and when I  learnt from Steerforth that  I had  been sent  for, and  was certainly  to go  home, had dim forebodings that I might  break my leg first.   How the breaking-up day  changed its place fast, at last, from the  week after next to next week, this  week, the day after tomorrow, tomorrow,  today, tonight - when  I was inside the  Yarmouth mail, and going home. I had many a broken sleep inside the Yarmouth mail, and many an incoherent dream of all  these things.   But when  I awoke  at intervals,  the ground outside the window was not the playground of Salem  House, and the sound in my ears  was not the sound of Mr.  Creakle giving it to  Traddles, but the sound  of the coachman touching up the horses. CHAPTER 8 MY HOLIDAYS.  ESPECIALLY ONE HAPPY AFTERNOON When we arrived before day at the inn where the mail stopped, which was not  the inn where my friend the waiter lived,  I was shown up to a nice  little bedroom, with DOLPHIN painted on the door.  Very cold I was, I know, notwithstanding  the hot tea they had given me before a large fire downstairs; and very glad I was to turn into the Dolphin&#x27;s bed, pull  the Dolphin&#x27;s blankets round my head,  and go to sleep. Mr. Barkis the carrier was to call for me in the morning at nine o&#x27;clock.  I got up at eight, a little giddy from the shortness of my night&#x27;s rest, and was ready for him before the appointed time. He received me exactly as if not five minutes had elapsed since we were last together,  and I had only been into the  hotel to get change for sixpence, or something of that sort. As soon as I and my box were in the cart, and the carrier seated, the lazy horse walked away with us all at his accustomed pace. &#x27;You look very well, Mr. Barkis,&#x27; I said, thinking he would like to know it. Mr. Barkis rubbed his cheek with his cuff, and then looked at his cuff as if  he expected to find some of the bloom upon it; but made no other acknowledgement of the compliment. &#x27;I gave your message, Mr. Barkis,&#x27; I said: &#x27;I wrote to Peggotty.&#x27; &#x27;Ah!&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. Mr. Barkis seemed gruff, and answered drily. &#x27;Wasn&#x27;t it right, Mr. Barkis?&#x27; I asked, after a little hesitation. &#x27;Why, no,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. &#x27;Not the message?&#x27; &#x27;The message was right enough, perhaps,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis; &#x27;but it come to an end there.&#x27; Not understanding what he meant, I repeated inquisitively: &#x27;Came to an end,  Mr. Barkis?&#x27; &#x27;Nothing come of it,&#x27; he explained, looking at me sideways.  &#x27;No answer.&#x27; &#x27;There was an answer expected, was there, Mr. Barkis?&#x27; said I, opening my  eyes. For this was a new light to me. &#x27;When a man says he&#x27;s willin&#x27;,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis, turning his glance slowly on me again, &#x27;it&#x27;s as much as to say, that man&#x27;s a-waitin&#x27; for a answer.&#x27; &#x27;Well, Mr. Barkis?&#x27; &#x27;Well,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis, carrying his eyes back to his horse&#x27;s ears; &#x27;that man&#x27;s been a-waitin&#x27; for a answer ever since.&#x27; &#x27;Have you told her so, Mr. Barkis?&#x27; &#x27;No - no,&#x27; growled Mr. Barkis, reflecting about it.  &#x27;I ain&#x27;t got no call to  go and tell her so.  I never said six words to her myself, I ain&#x27;t a-goin&#x27; to  tell her so.&#x27; &#x27;Would you like me  to do it, Mr.  Barkis?&#x27; said I, doubtfully.  &#x27;You might tell her, if you would,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis, with another slow look at me, &#x27;that  Barkis was a-waitin&#x27; for a answer.  Says you - what name is it?&#x27; &#x27;Her name?&#x27; &#x27;Ah!&#x27; said Mr. Barkis, with a nod of his head. &#x27;Peggotty.&#x27; &#x27;Chrisen name?  Or nat&#x27;ral name?&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;s not her Christian name.  Her Christian name is Clara.&#x27; &#x27;Is it though?&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. He seemed to find  an immense fund of  reflection in this circumstance,  and sat pondering and inwardly whistling for some time. &#x27;Well!&#x27; he resumed at  length.  &#x27;Says you, &quot;Peggotty!   Barkis is waitin&#x27; for  a answer.&quot;  Says she, perhaps, &quot;Answer to what?&quot;  Says you, &quot;To what I told  you.&quot; &quot;What is that?&quot; says she.  &quot;Barkis is willin&#x27;,&quot; says you.&#x27; This extremely  artful suggestion  Mr. Barkis  accompanied with  a nudge  of his elbow that gave me quite a stitch in my side.  After that, he slouched over  his horse in his usual  manner; and made no  other reference to the  subject except, half an hour afterwards,  taking a piece of  chalk from his pocket,  and writing up, inside  the tilt  of the  cart, &#x27;Clara  Peggotty&#x27; -  apparently as a private memorandum. Ah, what a strange feeling it was to be going home when it was not home, and  to find that every object I looked at, reminded me of the happy old home, which was like a  dream I  could never  dream again!  The days  when my  mother and  I and Peggotty were all in all  to one another, and there  was no one to come  between us, rose up before me so sorrowfully on the road, that I am not sure I was  glad to be there - not sure but that I would rather have remained away, and forgotten it in Steerforth&#x27;s company.  But there I was; and soon I was at our house, where the bare  old elm-trees  wrung their  many hands  in the  bleak wintry  air, and shreds of the old rooks&#x27;-nests drifted away upon the wind. The carrier put my box down at the garden-gate, and left me.  I walked along the path towards the house,  glancing at the windows,  and fearing at every  step to see  Mr. Murdstone  or Miss  Murdstone lowering  out of  one of  them.  No  face appeared, however;  and being  come to  the house,  and knowing  how to open the door, before dark, without knocking, I went in with a quiet, timid step. God knows how infantine the memory may have been, that was awakened within me by the sound of my mother&#x27;s voice in the old parlour, when I set foot in the  hall. She was singing in a low tone.  I think I must have lain in her arms, and  heard her singing so to me when I was but  a baby.  The strain was new to me, and  yet it was so old that it filled my heart brim-full; like a friend come back from  a long absence. I believed, from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother murmured her song, that she was alone.  And I went softly into the room.  She was sitting  by the fire, suckling an  infant, whose tiny hand  she held against her  neck.  Her eyes were looking down upon its face, and  she sat singing to it.  I was so  far right, that she had no other companion. I spoke to her, and  she started, and cried out.   But seeing me, she called  me her dear Davy, her own boy! and coming half across the room to meet me,  kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me, and laid my head down on her bosom near  the little creature that was nestling there, and put its hand to my lips. I wish I had died.   I wish I had died  then, with that feeling in  my heart!  I should have been more fit for Heaven than I ever have been since. &#x27;He is your brother,&#x27;  said my mother, fondling  me.  &#x27;Davy, my pretty  boy!  My poor child!&#x27;  Then she kissed me more  and more, and clasped me round the  neck. This she was doing when Peggotty came running in, and bounced down on the ground beside us, and went mad about us both for a quarter of an hour. It seemed that I  had not been expected  so soon, the carrier  being much before his usual time.  It seemed, too, that Mr. and Miss Murdstone had gone out upon a visit in  the neighbourhood,  and would  not return  before night.   I had never hoped for this.  I had never thought it possible that we three could be together undisturbed, once more; and I felt, for  the time, as if the old days  were come back. We dined together by the fireside.  Peggotty was in attendance to wait upon  us, but my mother wouldn&#x27;t let her do it,  and made her dine with us.  I had  my own old  plate, with  a brown  view of  a man-of-war  in full  sail upon  it,  which Peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time I had been away, and would not  have had broken, she said, for a hundred pounds.  I had my own old mug with David  on it, and my own old little knife and fork that wouldn&#x27;t cut. While we  were at  table, I  thought it  a favourable  occasion to tell Peggotty about Mr. Barkis, who, before  I had finished what I  had to tell her, began  to laugh, and throw her apron over her face. &#x27;Peggotty,&#x27; said my mother.  &#x27;What&#x27;s the matter?&#x27; Peggotty only laughed the more, and held  her apron tight over her face when  my mother tried to pull it away, and sat as if her head were in a bag. &#x27;What are you doing, you stupid creature?&#x27; said my mother, laughing. &#x27;Oh, drat the man!&#x27; cried Peggotty.  &#x27;He wants to marry me.&#x27; &#x27;It would be a very good match for you; wouldn&#x27;t it?&#x27; said my mother. &#x27;Oh!  I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; said Peggotty.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t  ask me.  I wouldn&#x27;t have him if  he was made of gold.  Nor I wouldn&#x27;t have anybody.&#x27; &#x27;Then, why don&#x27;t you tell him so, you ridiculous thing?&#x27; said my mother. &#x27;Tell him so,&#x27; retorted Peggotty, looking out of her apron.  &#x27;He has never  said a word to me  about it.  He knows  better.  If he was  to make so bold  as say a word to me, I should slap his face.&#x27; Her own was as red as  ever I saw it, or any  other face, I think; but she  only covered it again, for a few moments at a time, when she was taken with a violent fit of  laughter; and  after two  or three  of those  attacks, went  on with her dinner. I remarked that my mother, though she smiled when Peggotty looked at her, became more serious and  thoughtful.  I had  seen at first  that she was  changed.  Her face was very pretty  still, but it looked  careworn, and too delicate;  and her hand was so thin and white that  it seemed to me to be almost  transparent.  But the change to which I  now refer was superadded to  this: it was in her  manner, which became anxious and fluttered.  At last she said, putting out her hand, and laying it affectionately on the hand of her old servant, &#x27;Peggotty, dear, you are not going to be married?&#x27; &#x27;Me, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; returned Peggotty, staring.  &#x27;Lord bless you, no!&#x27; &#x27;Not just yet?&#x27; said my mother, tenderly. &#x27;Never!&#x27; cried Peggotty. My mother took her hand, and said: &#x27;Don&#x27;t leave me,  Peggotty.  Stay with  me.  It will  not be for  long, perhaps. What should I ever do without you!&#x27; &#x27;Me leave you,  my precious!&#x27; cried  Peggotty.  &#x27;Not for  all the world  and his wife.  Why, what&#x27;s put that in your silly little head?&#x27; - For Peggotty had  been used of old to talk to my mother sometimes like a child. But my mother made no answer, except to thank her, and Peggotty went running  on in her own fashion. &#x27;Me leave you?  I think I see myself.  Peggotty go away from you? I should  like to catch her at it!  No, no,  no,&#x27; said Peggotty, shaking her head, and  folding her arms; &#x27;not she, my dear.  It isn&#x27;t that there ain&#x27;t some Cats that would  be well enough  pleased if  she did,  but they  sha&#x27;n&#x27;t be  pleased.  They shall be aggravated. I&#x27;ll stay with you till I am a cross cranky old woman.  And when I&#x27;m too deaf, and too lame, and too blind,  and too mumbly for want of teeth, to  be of any use at all, even to be found fault with, than I shall go to my Davy,  and ask him to take me in.&#x27; &#x27;And, Peggotty,&#x27;  says I,  &#x27;I shall  be glad  to see  you, and  I&#x27;ll make you as welcome as a queen.&#x27; &#x27;Bless your dear heart!&#x27; cried Peggotty.  &#x27;I know you will!&#x27;  And she kissed  me beforehand,  in grateful  acknowledgement of  my hospitality.   After that,  she covered her head up with her apron again and had another laugh about Mr. Barkis. After that, she took  the baby out of  its little cradle, and  nursed it.  After that, she cleared the dinner table; after that, came in with another cap on, and her work-box, and the yard-measure, and the bit of wax-candle, all just the same as ever. We sat round the fire, and talked delightfully.  I told them what a hard  master Mr. Creakle was, and they pitied me  very much.  I told them what a  fine fellow Steerforth was, and what  a patron of mine,  and Peggotty said she  would walk a score of miles to see him. I took the little baby in my arms when it was  awake, and nursed it lovingly.  When it was asleep again, I crept close to my  mother&#x27;s side according to my old  custom, broken now a long  time, and sat with my  arms embracing her waist, and my little red cheek on her shoulder, and once more felt her beautiful hair drooping over me - like an angel&#x27;s wing as I used to think, I recollect - and was very happy indeed. While I sat thus, looking at the fire, and seeing pictures in the red-hot coals, I almost believed that I had never  been away; that Mr. and Miss Murdstone  were such  pictures, and  would vanish  when the  fire got  low; and  that there  was nothing real in all that I remembered, save my mother, Peggotty, and I. Peggotty darned away at a stocking as  long as she could see, and then  sat with it drawn on her left  hand like a glove, and  her needle in her right,  ready to take  another  stitch whenever  there  was a  blaze.   I cannot  conceive  whose stockings they can have been that Peggotty was always darning, or where such  an unfailing supply of stockings  in want of darning  can have come from.   From my earliest  infancy  she seems  to  have been  always  employed in  that  class of needlework, and never by any chance in any other. &#x27;I wonder,&#x27; said Peggotty, who was  sometimes seized with a fit of  wondering on some  most  unexpected  topic,  &#x27;what&#x27;s  become  of  Davy&#x27;s  great-aunt?&#x27;  &#x27;Lor, Peggotty!&#x27; observed my  mother, rousing herself  from a reverie,  &#x27;what nonsense you talk!&#x27; &#x27;Well, but I really do wonder, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;What can have put  such a person in  your head?&#x27; inquired my  mother. &#x27;Is there nobody else in the world to come there?&#x27; &#x27;I  don&#x27;t know  how it  is,&#x27; said  Peggotty, &#x27;unless  it&#x27;s on  account of  being stupid, but my head never can pick and choose its people. They come and they go, and they  don&#x27;t come  and they  don&#x27;t go,  just as  they like.   I wonder what&#x27;s become of her?&#x27; &#x27;How absurd  you are,  Peggotty!&#x27; returned  my mother.   &#x27;One would  suppose you wanted a second visit from her.&#x27; &#x27;Lord forbid!&#x27; cried Peggotty. &#x27;Well then, don&#x27;t  talk about such  uncomfortable things, there&#x27;s  a good soul,&#x27; said my mother.  &#x27;Miss Betsey  is shut up in her  cottage by the sea, no  doubt, and will  remain there.   At all  events, she  is not  likely ever to trouble us again.&#x27; &#x27;No!&#x27; mused Peggotty.  &#x27;No, that ain&#x27;t likely at all.  - I wonder, if she was to die, whether she&#x27;d leave Davy anything?&#x27; &#x27;Good gracious me, Peggotty,&#x27; returned my mother, &#x27;what a nonsensical woman  you are! when you know that she took offence at the poor dear boy&#x27;s ever being  born at all.&#x27; &#x27;I suppose she wouldn&#x27;t be inclined to forgive him now,&#x27; hinted Peggotty. &#x27;Why should she be inclined to forgive him now?&#x27; said my mother, rather sharply. &#x27;Now that he&#x27;s got a brother, I mean,&#x27; said Peggotty. MY mother immediately began to cry, and wondered how Peggotty dared to say  such a thing. &#x27;As if this poor little innocent in its cradle had ever done any harm to you  or anybody else, you jealous thing!&#x27; said  she.  &#x27;You had much better go  and marry Mr. Barkis, the carrier.  Why don&#x27;t you?&#x27; &#x27;I should make Miss Murdstone happy, if I was to,&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;What a bad  disposition you have,  Peggotty!&#x27; returned my  mother. &#x27;You are  as jealous of Miss Murdstone as it is possible for a ridiculous creature to be. You want to  keep the  keys yourself,  and give  out all  the things,  I suppose?  I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if you did.  When  you know that she only does it  out of kindness and the  best intentions!  You  know she does,  Peggotty - you  know it well.&#x27; Peggotty muttered something to the  effect of &#x27;Bother the best  intentions!&#x27; and something else  to the  effect that  there was  a little  too much  of the  best intentions going on. &#x27;I know what  you mean, you  cross thing,&#x27; said  my mother.  &#x27;I  understand you, Peggotty, perfectly.  You know I do, and I wonder you don&#x27;t colour up like fire. But one point  at a time.   Miss Murdstone is  the point now,  Peggotty, and you sha&#x27;n&#x27;t escape from it.   Haven&#x27;t you heard her  say, over and over  again, that she thinks I am too thoughtless and too - a - a -&#x27; &#x27;Pretty,&#x27; suggested Peggotty. &#x27;Well,&#x27; returned my mother, half laughing, &#x27;and if she is so silly as to say so, can I be blamed for it?&#x27; &#x27;No one says you can,&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;No, I should  hope not, indeed!&#x27;  returned my mother.   &#x27;Haven&#x27;t you heard  her say, over and over again,  that on this account she  wished to spare me a  great deal of trouble, which she thinks I am not suited for, and which I really  don&#x27;t know myself that I AM suited for; and isn&#x27;t she up early and late, and going  to and fro continually - and doesn&#x27;t she do all sorts of things, and grope into all sorts of places, coal-holes and pantries  and I don&#x27;t know where, that  can&#x27;t be very agreeable  - and  do you  mean to  insinuate that  there is  not a  sort of devotion in that?&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t insinuate at all,&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;You do,  Peggotty,&#x27; returned  my mother.   &#x27;You never  do anything else, except your work.  You are always insinuating.  You revel in it.  And when you talk  of Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s good intentions -&#x27; &#x27;I never talked of &#x27;em,&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;No, Peggotty,&#x27; returned my mother, &#x27;but you insinuated.  That&#x27;s what I told you just now.  That&#x27;s the worst of you.  You WILL insinuate.  I said, at the moment, that I understood you, and you see I did.  When you talk of Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s good intentions, and pretend to  slight them (for I  don&#x27;t believe you really  do, in your heart, Peggotty), you must be as well convinced as I am how good they  are, and how they actuate him in everything.   If he seems to have been at  all stern with a certain person,  Peggotty - you understand,  and so I am  sure does Davy, that I am not alluding to anybody present - it is solely because he is satisfied that it is for a certain person&#x27;s benefit.  He naturally loves a certain person, on my account; and acts solely for a certain person&#x27;s good. He is better able to judge of it than  I am; for I  very well know that  I am a weak,  light, girlish creature, and that  he is a  firm, grave, serious  man.  And he  takes,&#x27; said my mother,  with  the  tears  which were  engendered  in  her  affectionate nature, stealing down her face, &#x27;he  takes great pains with me;  and I ought to be  very thankful to him, and very submissive to  him even in my thoughts; and when  I am not, Peggotty, I worry  and condemn myself, and  feel doubtful of my  own heart, and don&#x27;t know what to do.&#x27; Peggotty sat with her chin on the foot of the stocking, looking silently at  the fire. &#x27;There, Peggotty,&#x27; said  my mother, changing  her tone, &#x27;don&#x27;t  let us fall  out with one another, for I couldn&#x27;t bear it.  You are my true friend, I know, if  I have any in the  world.  When I call  you a ridiculous creature,  or a vexatious thing, or  anything of  that sort,  Peggotty, I  only mean  that you are my true friend, and always have  been, ever since the  night when Mr. Copperfield  first brought me home here, and you came out to the gate to meet me.&#x27; Peggotty was not slow to respond, and ratify the treaty of friendship by  giving me one of her best hugs.  I think  I had some glimpses of the real character  of this  conversation at  the time;  but I  am sure,  now, that  the good  creature originated it,  and took  her part  in it,  merely that  my mother might comfort herself with the  little contradictory summary  in which she  had indulged.  The design was efficacious; for I remember that my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening, and that Peggotty observed her less. When we had had our tea, and the ashes were thrown up, and the candles  snuffed, I read Peggotty a chapter out of the Crocodile Book, in remembrance of old times - she took it out of her pocket: I don&#x27;t know whether she had kept it there ever since - and then  we talked about Salem  House, which brought me  round again to Steerforth, who was my great subject.  We were very happy; and that evening,  as the last of  its race, and  destined evermore to  close that volume  of my life, will never pass out of my memory. It was almost ten o&#x27;clock  before we heard the sound  of wheels.  We all got  up then; and my  mother said hurriedly  that, as it  was so late,  and Mr. and Miss Murdstone approved of early hours for  young people, perhaps I had better  go to bed.  I kissed her, and went upstairs with my candle directly, before they  came in.  It appeared to my childish fancy, as I ascended to the bedroom where I  had been imprisoned, that they brought a cold blast of air into the house which blew away the old familiar feeling like a feather. I felt  uncomfortable about  going down  to breakfast  in the  morning, as I had never set  eyes on  Mr. Murdstone  since the  day when  I committed my memorable offence.  However, as  it must be  done, I went  down, after two  or three false starts half-way, and as many runs back  on tiptoe to my own room, and  presented myself in the parlour. He was standing before the fire with  his back to it, while Miss Murdstone  made the tea.  He looked at me steadily as I entered, but made no sign of recognition whatever. I went up to him, after  a moment of confusion, and said: &#x27;I  beg your pardon, sir.  I am very sorry for what I did, and I hope you will forgive me.&#x27; &#x27;I am glad to hear you are sorry, David,&#x27; he replied. The hand he gave me was the hand I had bitten.  I could not restrain my eye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it; but it was not so red as I turned, when I met that sinister expression in his face. &#x27;How do you do, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; I said to Miss Murdstone. &#x27;Ah, dear me!&#x27; sighed Miss Murdstone,  giving me the tea-caddy scoop instead  of her fingers.  &#x27;How long are the holidays?&#x27; &#x27;A month, ma&#x27;am.&#x27; &#x27;Counting from when?&#x27; &#x27;From today, ma&#x27;am.&#x27; &#x27;Oh!&#x27; said Miss Murdstone.  &#x27;Then here&#x27;s one day off.&#x27; She kept a calendar of the holidays in this way, and every morning checked a day off in exactly the same manner.  She did it gloomily until she came to ten,  but when  she  got into  two  figures she  became  more hopeful,  and,  as the  time advanced, even jocular. It was on this very first day that I had the misfortune to throw her, though she was  not  subject  to  such  weakness  in  general,  into  a  state  of  violent consternation.  I came into the room  where she and my mother were  sitting; and the baby (who was only a few weeks old) being on my mother&#x27;s lap, I took it very carefully in my arms. Suddenly Miss Murdstone gave such a scream that I all  but dropped it. &#x27;My dear Jane!&#x27; cried my mother. &#x27;Good heavens, Clara, do you see?&#x27; exclaimed Miss Murdstone. &#x27;See what, my dear Jane?&#x27; said my mother; &#x27;where?&#x27; &#x27;He&#x27;s got it!&#x27; cried Miss Murdstone.  &#x27;The boy has got the baby!&#x27; She was limp with horror; but stiffened  herself to make a dart at me,  and take it out of my arms.  Then, she turned  faint; and was so very ill that they  were obliged to give her  cherry brandy.  I was  solemnly interdicted by her,  on her recovery, from touching  my brother any  more on any  pretence whatever; and  my poor mother, who, I could see, wished otherwise, meekly confirmed the interdict, by saying: &#x27;No doubt you are right, my dear Jane.&#x27; On another occasion, when we three were  together, this same dear baby - it  was truly dear  to me,  for our  mother&#x27;s sake  - was  the innocent occasion of Miss Murdstone&#x27;s going into a passion.  My  mother, who had been looking at  its eyes as it lay upon her lap, said: &#x27;Davy! come here!&#x27; and looked at mine. I saw Miss Murdstone lay her beads down. &#x27;I declare,&#x27; said my  mother, gently, &#x27;they are  exactly alike.  I suppose  they are  mine.  I  think they  are the  colour of  mine.  But  they are  wonderfully alike.&#x27; &#x27;What are you talking about, Clara?&#x27; said Miss Murdstone. &#x27;My dear Jane,&#x27; faltered my mother, a  little abashed by the harsh tone of  this inquiry, &#x27;I find that the baby&#x27;s eyes and Davy&#x27;s are exactly alike.&#x27; &#x27;Clara!&#x27;  said  Miss  Murdstone,  rising  angrily,  &#x27;you  are  a  positive  fool sometimes.&#x27; &#x27;My dear Jane,&#x27; remonstrated my mother. &#x27;A positive fool,&#x27;  said Miss Murdstone.   &#x27;Who else could  compare my brother&#x27;s baby with your boy?  They are not at all alike.  They are exactly unlike.   They are utterly dissimilar  in all respects.   I hope they  will ever remain  so.  I will not sit here, and hear such comparisons made.&#x27;  With that she stalked  out, and made the door bang after her. In short, I  was not a  favourite with Miss  Murdstone.  In short,  I was not  a favourite there with anybody,  not even with myself;  for those who did  like me could not show  it, and those  who did not,  showed it so  plainly that I  had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained, boorish, and dull. I felt that I made  them as uncomfortable as they  made me.  If I came  into the room  where they  were, and  they were  talking together  and my  mother  seemed cheerful, an  anxious cloud  would steal  over her  face from  the moment  of my entrance.  If Mr.  Murdstone were in  his best humour,  I checked him.   If Miss Murdstone were in her worst, I intensified it.  I had perception enough to  know that my mother was the victim always; that  she was afraid to speak to me or  to be kind to me, lest she should give them some offence by her manner of doing so, and receive a lecture  afterwards; that she was  not only ceaselessly afraid  of her own offending, but  of my offending, and  uneasily watched their looks  if I only moved. Therefore I resolved  to keep myself as much  out of their way as  I could; and many  a wintry hour  did I hear  the church clock  strike, when I was sitting in my cheerless bedroom, wrapped in my little great-coat, poring over  a book. In the evening, sometimes, I went and sat with Peggotty in the kitchen.  There I was comfortable, and not afraid of being myself. But neither of these  resources was approved of in the parlour.  The tormenting humour which was dominant  there stopped  them both.   I was  still held  to be  necessary to  my poor   mother&#x27;s training, and, as one of her trials, could not be suffered to absent myself. &#x27;David,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone, one day after dinner when I was going to leave  the room as usual; &#x27;I am sorry to observe that you are of a sullen disposition.&#x27; &#x27;As sulky as a bear!&#x27; said Miss Murdstone. I stood still, and hung my head. &#x27;Now, David,&#x27;  said Mr.  Murdstone, &#x27;a  sullen obdurate  disposition is,  of all tempers, the worst.&#x27; &#x27;And the boy&#x27;s is, of all such dispositions that ever I have seen,&#x27; remarked his sister, &#x27;the most confirmed and stubborn.  I think, my dear Clara, even you must observe it?&#x27; &#x27;I beg your pardon, my dear Jane,&#x27; said  my mother, &#x27;but are you quite sure -  I am certain you&#x27;ll excuse me, my dear Jane - that you understand Davy?&#x27; &#x27;I should be somewhat ashamed of myself, Clara,&#x27; returned Miss Murdstone, &#x27;if  I could not understand the boy, or any boy.  I don&#x27;t profess to be profound; but I do lay claim to common sense.&#x27; &#x27;No  doubt, my  dear Jane,&#x27;  returned my  mother, &#x27;your  understanding is   very vigorous -&#x27; &#x27;Oh dear, no!  Pray don&#x27;t say that, Clara,&#x27; interposed Miss Murdstone, angrily. &#x27;But I am sure it is,&#x27; resumed my mother; &#x27;and everybody knows it is.  I  profit so much by it myself, in  many ways - at least I  ought to - that no one  can be more convinced of it than myself;  and therefore I speak with great  diffidence, my dear Jane, I assure you.&#x27; &#x27;We&#x27;ll  say  I  don&#x27;t  understand  the  boy,  Clara,&#x27;  returned  Miss Murdstone, arranging the little fetters on her wrists.  &#x27;We&#x27;ll agree, if you please, that I don&#x27;t understand  him at  all.  He  is much  too deep  for me.   But perhaps  my brother&#x27;s penetration may  enable him to  have some insight  into his character. And I believe my brother was speaking on the subject when we - not very decently - interrupted him.&#x27; &#x27;I think, Clara,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone, in  a low grave voice, &#x27;that there may  be better and more dispassionate judges of such a question than you.&#x27; &#x27;Edward,&#x27;  replied  my mother,  timidly,  &#x27;you are  a  far better  judge  of all questions than I pretend to be.  Both you and Jane are.  I only said -&#x27; &#x27;You only said something weak and inconsiderate,&#x27; he replied.  &#x27;Try not to do it again, my dear Clara, and keep a watch upon yourself.&#x27; MY mother&#x27;s lips moved, as if she  answered &#x27;Yes, my dear Edward,&#x27; but she  said nothing aloud. &#x27;I was sorry, David, I remarked,&#x27;  said Mr. Murdstone, turning his head  and his eyes stiffly towards me, &#x27;to observe that you are of a sullen disposition.  This is not a character that I can  suffer to develop itself beneath my eyes  without an  effort at  improvement. You  must endeavour,  sir, to  change it.   We  must endeavour to change it for you.&#x27; &#x27;I beg your pardon, sir,&#x27; I faltered.  &#x27;I have never meant to be sullen since  I came back.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t take refuge in a lie, sir!&#x27; he returned so fiercely, that I saw my mother involuntarily put out her  trembling hand as if  to interpose between us.   &#x27;You have withdrawn yourself in your sullenness to your own room.  You have kept your own room when you ought to have been  here.  You know now, once for all, that  I require you to  be here, and  not there.  Further,  that I require  you to bring obedience here.  You know me, David.  I will have it done.&#x27; Miss Murdstone gave a hoarse chuckle. &#x27;I  will  have a  respectful,  prompt, and  ready  bearing towards  myself,&#x27;  he continued, &#x27;and  towards Jane  Murdstone, and  towards your  mother.  I will not have this room shunned as if it were infected, at the pleasure of a child.   Sit down.&#x27; He ordered me like a dog, and I obeyed like a dog. &#x27;One thing more,&#x27; he  said.  &#x27;I observe that  you have an attachment  to low and common company.  You are  not to associate with  servants. The kitchen will  not improve you, in the many respects  in which you need improvement.  Of  the woman who abets  you, I  say nothing  - since  you, Clara,&#x27;  addressing my mother in a lower  voice,  &#x27;from  old  associations  and  long-established  fancies,  have a weakness respecting her which is not yet overcome.&#x27; &#x27;A most unaccountable delusion it is!&#x27; cried Miss Murdstone. &#x27;I only say,&#x27; he resumed, addressing  me, &#x27;that I disapprove of your  preferring such company as Mistress Peggotty, and that it is to be abandoned.  Now,  David, you understand me, and you know what will be the consequence if you fail to obey me to the letter.&#x27; I knew  well -  better perhaps  than he  thought, as  far as  my poor mother was concerned - and I obeyed him to the letter.  I retreated to my own room no more; I took refuge with  Peggotty no more; but  sat wearily in the  parlour day after day, looking forward to night, and bedtime. What irksome  constraint I  underwent, sitting  in the  same attitude hours upon hours, afraid to move  an arm or a  leg lest Miss Murdstone  should complain (as she did on  the least pretence)  of my restlessness,  and afraid to  move an eye lest she should light  on some look of  dislike or scrutiny that  would find new cause for complaint in mine!  What  intolerable dulness to sit listening to  the ticking of the clock; and watching Miss Murdstone&#x27;s little shiny steel beads  as she strung them; and wondering whether she would ever be married, and if so,  to what sort  of unhappy  man; and  counting the  divisions in  the moulding of the chimney-piece; and wandering away, with my eyes, to the ceiling, among the curls and corkscrews in the paper on the wall! What walks I took alone, down  muddy lanes, in the bad winter  weather, carrying that parlour, and  Mr. and Miss  Murdstone in it,  everywhere: a monstrous  load that I was obliged to bear, a daymare that there was no possibility of  breaking in, a weight that brooded on my wits, and blunted them! What meals I had in silence and embarrassment, always feeling that there were  a knife and fork too many, and that  mine; an appetite too many, and that  mine; a plate and chair too many, and those mine; a somebody too many, and that I! What evenings, when the candles came, and I was expected to employ myself,  but, not daring to  read an  entertaining book,  pored over  some hard-headed, harder hearted treatise  on arithmetic;  when the  tables of  weights and  measures set themselves to tunes, as &#x27;Rule  Britannia&#x27;, or &#x27;Away with Melancholy&#x27;;  when they wouldn&#x27;t  stand still  to be  learnt, but  would go  threading my  grandmother&#x27;s needle through my  unfortunate head, in  at one ear  and out at  the other! What yawns and dozes I lapsed into, in spite  of all my care; what starts I came  out of concealed sleeps with; what answers I never got, to little observations  that I rarely made; what a blank space I seemed, which everybody overlooked, and  yet was in everybody&#x27;s way; what a heavy  relief it was to hear Miss Murdstone  hail the first stroke of nine at night, and order me to bed! Thus the holidays lagged away, until the morning came when Miss Murdstone  said: &#x27;Here&#x27;s the last day off!&#x27; and gave me the closing cup of tea of the vacation. I was not sorry to go.  I had lapsed into a stupid state; but I was recovering a little and looking forward to Steerforth, albeit Mr. Creakle loomed behind  him. Again Mr. Barkis appeared at the  gate, and again Miss Murdstone in  her warning voice, said: &#x27;Clara!&#x27; when my mother bent over me, to bid me farewell. I kissed her, and my baby brother, and was very sorry then; but not sorry to  go away, for the gulf between us was  there, and the parting was there, every  day. And it is not so much the embrace she gave me, that lives in my mind, though  it was as fervent as could be, as what followed the embrace. I was in the carrier&#x27;s cart when I  heard her calling to me.  I looked out,  and she stood at the garden-gate  alone, holding her baby up  in her arms for me  to see.  It was cold still weather; and not  a hair of her head, nor a fold  of her dress, was stirred, as she looked intently at me, holding up her child. So I  lost her.   So I  saw her  afterwards, in  my sleep  at school  - a silent presence near my bed - looking at me with the same intent face - holding up  her baby in her arms. CHAPTER 9 I HAVE A MEMORABLE BIRTHDAY I PASS over all  that happened at school,  until the anniversary of  my birthday came round in March.  Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever, I remember nothing.  He was going away at the end of the half-year, if not sooner, and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes, and therefore more engaging than before; but beyond this I remember nothing.  The great remembrance by which that time is marked in  my mind, seems to have swallowed up  all lesser recollections, and to exist alone. It is even difficult for me to believe  that there was a gap of full two  months between my return to Salem House and  the arrival of that birthday.  I can  only understand that the fact was so, because I know it must have been so;  otherwise I should feel convinced  that there was no  interval, and that the  one occasion trod upon the other&#x27;s heels. How well I recollect the  kind of day it was!   I smell the fog that  hung about the place; I see the hoar frost,  ghostly, through it; I feel my rimy  hair fall clammy on my cheek; I look along  the dim perspective of the schoolroom, with  a sputtering candle here and there to  light up the foggy morning, and  the breath of the  boys wreathing  and smoking  in the  raw cold  as they  blow upon  their fingers, and tap their feet upon the floor.  It was after breakfast, and we  had been summoned in from the playground, when Mr. Sharp entered and said: &#x27;David Copperfield is to go into the parlour.&#x27; I expected a hamper from Peggotty, and brightened at the order. Some of the boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the distribution of the  good things, as I got out of my seat with great alacrity. &#x27;Don&#x27;t  hurry, David,&#x27;  said Mr.  Sharp.  &#x27;There&#x27;s  time enough,  my boy,  don&#x27;t hurry.&#x27; I might have  been surprised by  the feeling tone  in which he  spoke, if I  had given it a thought; but I gave  it none until afterwards. I hurried away  to the parlour; and there I found Mr.  Creakle, sitting at his breakfast with  the cane and a newspaper before him, and Mrs. Creakle with an opened letter in her  hand. But no hamper. &#x27;David Copperfield,&#x27; said Mrs. Creakle, leading  me to a sofa, and sitting  down beside me.  &#x27;I want to speak to you very particularly. I have something to  tell you, my child.&#x27; Mr. Creakle, at whom of course I  looked, shook his head without looking at  me, and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast. &#x27;You are too young to know how the world changes every day,&#x27; said Mrs.  Creakle, &#x27;and how the people in it pass away.   But we all have to learn it, David;  some of us when we are young, some of us when we are old, some of us at all times  of our lives.&#x27; I looked at her earnestly. &#x27;When you came away  from home at the  end of the vacation,&#x27;  said Mrs. Creakle, after a pause, &#x27;were they all well?&#x27;  After another pause, &#x27;Was your mama well?&#x27; I trembled without  distinctly knowing why,  and still looked  at her earnestly, making no attempt to answer. &#x27;Because,&#x27; said she, &#x27;I grieve to tell you that I hear this morning your mama is very ill.&#x27; A mist rose between Mrs. Creakle and me, and her figure seemed to move in it for an instant.  Then I felt the burning  tears run down my face, and it  was steady again. &#x27;She is very dangerously ill,&#x27; she added. I knew all now. &#x27;She is dead.&#x27; There was no need to tell me so.  I had already broken out into a desolate  cry, and felt an orphan in the wide world. She  was  very kind  to  me.  She  kept  me there  all  day, and  left  me alone sometimes; and I  cried, and wore  myself to sleep,  and awoke and  cried again. When I could cry no more, I began to think; and then the oppression on my breast was heaviest, and my grief a dull pain that there was no ease for. And yet my thoughts were idle; not  intent on the calamity that weighed upon  my heart, but idly loitering near it.  I thought of our house shut up and hushed. I thought of the  little baby, who,  Mrs. Creakle said,  had been pining  away for some time,  and who,  they believed,  would die  too.  I  thought of my father&#x27;s grave in the churchyard, by our house, and of my mother lying there beneath  the tree I knew so  well.  I stood upon  a chair when I  was left alone, and  looked into the  glass to  see how  red my  eyes were,  and how  sorrowful my  face.  I considered, after some  hours were gone,  if my tears  were really hard  to flow now, as they seemed to be, what,  in connexion with my loss, it would  affect me most to think of when I drew near home - for I was going home to the funeral.  I am sensible of having felt that a  dignity attached to me among the rest  of the boys, and that I was important in my affliction. If ever child were stricken with sincere grief, I was.  But I remember that this importance was a  kind of satisfaction  to me, when  I walked in  the playground that afternoon while the  boys were in school.   When I saw them  glancing at me out of the windows, as they went up to their classes, I felt distinguished,  and looked more melancholy, and walked slower.  When school was over, and they  came out and spoke to me, I felt it rather  good in myself not to be proud to any  of them, and to take exactly the same notice of them all, as before. I was to  go home next  night; not by  the mail, but  by the heavy  night-coach, which  was  called  the  Farmer,  and  was  principally  used  by country-people travelling short intermediate distances upon the road.  We had no  story-telling that evening, and Traddles insisted on lending me his pillow.  I don&#x27;t know what good he thought it would do me, for I  had one of my own: but it was all  he had to lend, poor fellow, except a sheet of letter-paper full of skeletons; and that he gave me at parting, as a soother of my sorrows and a contribution to my peace of mind. I left Salem House upon the morrow afternoon.  I little thought then that I left it, never to return.  We travelled very  slowly all night, and did not get  into Yarmouth  before nine  or ten  o&#x27;clock in  the morning.   I looked  out for  Mr. Barkis, but he  was not  there; and  instead of  him a  fat, short-winded, merry looking, little old man  in black, with rusty  little bunches of ribbons  at the knees of his breeches, black stockings, and a broad-brimmed hat, came puffing up to the coach window, and said: &#x27;Master Copperfield?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27; &#x27;Will you come with  me, young sir, if  you please,&#x27; he said,  opening the door, &#x27;and I shall have the pleasure of taking you home.&#x27; I put my hand in his,  wondering who he was, and we  walked away to a shop in  a narrow street, on which was  written OMER, DRAPER, TAILOR, HABERDASHER,  FUNERAL FURNISHER, &amp;c.  It was  a close and stifling  little shop; full of  all sorts of clothing, made and unmade, including one window full of beaver-hats and bonnets. We went into a little back-parlour  behind the shop, where we found  three young women at  work on  a quantity  of black  materials, which  were heaped  upon the table, and little bits and cuttings  of which were littered all over  the floor. There was a good fire in the room, and  a breathless smell of warm black crape I did not know what the smell was then, but I know now. The three  young women,  who appeared  to be  very industrious  and comfortable, raised their heads  to look at  me, and then  went on with  their work.  Stitch, stitch, stitch.  At  the same time  there came from  a workshop across  a little yard outside the window, a regular sound of hammering that kept a kind of  tune: RAT - tat-tat, RAT - tat-tat, RAT - tat-tat, without any variation. &#x27;Well,&#x27; said my conductor to one of the three young women.  &#x27;How do you get  on, Minnie?&#x27; &#x27;We shall be ready  by the trying-on time,&#x27;  she replied gaily, without  looking up.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t you be afraid, father.&#x27; Mr. Omer took off his broad-brimmed hat, and sat down and panted. He was so  fat that he was obliged to pant some time before he could say: &#x27;That&#x27;s right.&#x27; &#x27;Father!&#x27; said Minnie, playfully.  &#x27;What a porpoise you do grow!&#x27; &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t know how it is,  my dear,&#x27; he replied, considering about it.   &#x27;I am rather so.&#x27; &#x27;You are such  a comfortable man,  you see,&#x27; said  Minnie.  &#x27;You take  things so easy.&#x27; &#x27;No use taking &#x27;em otherwise, my dear,&#x27; said Mr. Omer. &#x27;No, indeed,&#x27; returned his daughter.  &#x27;We are all pretty gay here, thank Heaven! Ain&#x27;t we, father?&#x27; &#x27;I hope so, my dear,&#x27; said Mr. Omer.  &#x27;As I have got my breath now, I think I&#x27;ll measure this young scholar.  Would you walk into the shop, Master Copperfield?&#x27; I preceded Mr. Omer, in compliance with his request; and after showing me a roll of cloth which he said was extra super, and too good mourning for anything short of parents, he took my various dimensions,  and put them down in a book.   While he was  recording them  he called  my attention  to his  stock in  trade, and to certain fashions which he said had &#x27;just come up&#x27;, and to certain other fashions which he said had &#x27;just gone out&#x27;. &#x27;And by that sort of thing we very often lose a little mint of money,&#x27; said  Mr. Omer.  &#x27;But fashions are  like human beings.  They  come in, nobody knows  when, why, or how;  and they go  out, nobody knows  when, why, or  how.  Everything is like life, in my opinion, if you look at it in that point of view.&#x27; I was  too sorrowful  to discuss  the question,  which would  possibly have been beyond me under any circumstances; and  Mr. Omer took me back into  the parlour, breathing with some difficulty on the way. He then called down a little break-neck range of steps behind a door: &#x27;Bring  up that  tea and  bread-and-butter!&#x27; which,  after some  time, during  which I  sat looking about me and  thinking, and listening to  the stitching in the  room and the tune that was being hammered across the yard, appeared on a tray, and turned out to be for me. &#x27;I have been  acquainted with you,&#x27;  said Mr. Omer,  after watching me  for some minutes, during which I had not  made much impression on the breakfast,  for the black things  destroyed my  appetite, &#x27;I  have been  acquainted with  you a long time, my young friend.&#x27; &#x27;Have you, sir?&#x27; &#x27;All your  life,&#x27; said  Mr. Omer.   &#x27;I may  say before  it.  I  knew your father before you.  He was five foot nine  and a half, and he lays in  five-and-twen-ty foot of ground.&#x27; &#x27;RAT - tat-tat, RAT - tat-tat, RAT - tat-tat,&#x27; across the yard. &#x27;He lays in five and twen-ty foot of ground, if he lays in a fraction,&#x27; said Mr. Omer, pleasantly.  &#x27;It was either his request or her direction, I forget which.&#x27; &#x27;Do you know how my little brother is, sir?&#x27; I inquired. Mr. Omer shook his head. &#x27;RAT - tat-tat, RAT - tat-tat, RAT - tat-tat.&#x27; &#x27;He is in his mother&#x27;s arms,&#x27; said he. &#x27;Oh, poor little fellow!  Is he dead?&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t mind it more than you can help,&#x27; said Mr. Omer.  &#x27;Yes.  The baby&#x27;s dead.&#x27; My wounds  broke out  afresh at  this intelligence.   I left the scarcely-tasted breakfast, and  went and  rested my  head on  another table,  in a corner of the little room, which Minnie hastily cleared, lest I should spot the mourning  that was lying there with my tears.  She was a pretty, good-natured girl, and put  my hair away from  my eyes with  a soft, kind  touch; but she  was very cheerful at having nearly finished  her work and  being in good  time, and was  so different from me! Presently the tune  left off, and  a good-looking young  fellow came across  the yard into the  room.  He had  a hammer in  his hand, and  his mouth was  full of little nails, which he was obliged to take out before he could speak. &#x27;Well, Joram!&#x27; said Mr. Omer.  &#x27;How do you get on?&#x27; &#x27;All right,&#x27; said Joram.  &#x27;Done, sir.&#x27; Minnie coloured a little, and the other two girls smiled at one another. &#x27;What! you were at it by candle-light last night, when I was at the club,  then? Were you?&#x27; said Mr. Omer, shutting up one eye. &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said Joram.  &#x27;As you said we could make a little trip of it, and go  over together, if it was done, Minnie and me - and you.&#x27; &#x27;Oh!  I  thought you  were going  to leave  me out  altogether,&#x27; said  Mr. Omer, laughing till he coughed. &#x27;- As you was so good as to  say that,&#x27; resumed the young man, &#x27;why I  turned to with a will, you see.  Will you give me your opinion of it?&#x27; &#x27;I will,&#x27; said Mr.  Omer, rising.  &#x27;My dear&#x27;;  and he stopped and  turned to me: &#x27;would you like to see your -&#x27; &#x27;No, father,&#x27; Minnie interposed. &#x27;I thought it might be agreeable, my dear,&#x27; said Mr. Omer.  &#x27;But perhaps  you&#x27;re right.&#x27; I can&#x27;t say how I  knew it was my dear,  dear mother&#x27;s coffin that they  went to look at.  I had never  heard one making; I  had never seen one  that I know  of. but it came into my mind what the noise was, while it was going on; and when the young man entered, I am sure I knew what he had been doing. The work being now finished, the two girls, whose names I had not heard, brushed the shreds and threads from their dresses, and went into the shop to put that to rights, and wait for  customers. Minnie stayed behind  to fold up what  they had made, and pack it in two baskets.  This she did upon her knees, humming a lively little tune the  while.  Joram, who  I had no  doubt was her  lover, came in and stole a kiss from her while she was busy (he didn&#x27;t appear to mind me, at  all), and said her  father was gone  for the chaise,  and he must  make haste and  get himself  ready.  Then  he went  out again;  and then  she put  her thimble   and scissors in her pocket, and stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly  in the bosom of her gown, and put on her outer clothing smartly, at a little  glass behind the door, in which I saw the reflection of her pleased face. All this I observed, sitting at the table in the corner with my head leaning  on my hand, and my thoughts running on very different things.  The chaise soon came round to the front of the shop, and the baskets being put in first, I was put in next, and those three  followed.  I remember it  as a kind of  half chaise-cart, half pianoforte-van, painted of a sombre colour, and drawn by a black horse with a long tail.  There was plenty of room for us all. I do not think  I have ever experienced  so strange a feeling  in my life (I  am wiser now, perhaps) as  that of being with  them, remembering how they  had been employed, and seeing them enjoy the ride.  I was not angry with them; I was more afraid of  them, as  if I  were cast  away among  creatures with  whom I  had no community of  nature.  They  were very  cheerful.  The  old man  sat in front to drive, and the two  young people sat behind  him, and whenever he  spoke to them leaned forward, the  one on one  side of his  chubby face and  the other on  the other, and made a  great deal of him.  They would have talked  to me too, but  I held back, and  moped in my  corner; scared by  their love-making and  hilarity, though it was far from boisterous,  and almost wondering that no judgement  came upon them for their hardness of heart. So,  when  they  stopped to  bait  the  horse, and  ate  and  drank and  enjoyed themselves, I could touch nothing that they touched, but kept my fast  unbroken. So, when  we reached  home, I  dropped out  of the  chaise behind, as quickly as possible, that  I might  not be  in their  company before  those solemn windows, looking blindly on me like closed eyes  once bright.  And oh, how little need  I had had  to think  what would  move me  to tears  when I  came back - seeing the window of  my mother&#x27;s  room, and  next it  that which,  in the better time, was mine! I was in  Peggotty&#x27;s arms before  I got to  the door, and  she took me  into the house.  Her grief burst out when she  first saw me; but she controlled it  soon, and spoke in whispers, and walked softly, as if the dead could be disturbed. She had not been in bed, I found, for  a long time.  She sat up at night  still, and watched.  As long as  her poor dear pretty  was above the ground,  she said, she would never desert her. Mr. Murdstone took no heed of me when I went into the parlour where he was,  but sat by the fireside, weeping  silently, and pondering in his  elbow-chair.  Miss Murdstone, who was busy at her writing-desk, which was covered with letters  and papers, gave me her  cold finger-nails, and asked  me, in an iron  whisper, if I had been measured for my mourning. I said: &#x27;Yes.&#x27; &#x27;And your shirts,&#x27; said Miss Murdstone; &#x27;have you brought &#x27;em home?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, ma&#x27;am.  I have brought home all my clothes.&#x27; This was  all the  consolation that  her firmness  administered to  me. I do not doubt that she  had a  choice pleasure  in exhibiting  what she  called her self command, and her firmness, and her  strength of mind, and her common  sense, and the whole diabolical catalogue of her unamiable qualities, on such an  occasion. She was particularly proud  of her turn for  business; and she showed  it now in reducing everything to pen and ink, and being moved by nothing.  All the rest of that day, and from morning to night afterwards, she sat at that desk, scratching composedly  with a  hard pen,  speaking in  the same  imperturbable whisper   to everybody; never  relaxing a  muscle of  her face,  or softening  a tone  of her voice, or appearing with an atom of her dress astray. Her brother took a book sometimes, but  never read it that I saw. He  would open it and  look at  it as  if he  were reading,  but would  remain for a whole hour without turning the leaf, and then put it down and walk to and fro in the  room. I used to sit with folded  hands watching him, and counting his  footsteps, hour after hour. He very seldom spoke to her,  and never to me.  He seemed to be  the only restless thing, except the clocks, in the whole motionless house. In these days before the funeral, I saw but little of Peggotty, except that,  in passing up or down stairs, I always found her close to the room where my  mother and her baby  lay, and except  that she came  to me every  night, and sat  by my bed&#x27;s head while I went to sleep.  A  day or two before the burial - I  think it was a day or two before, but I  am conscious of confusion in my mind about  that heavy time, with nothing to  mark its progress - she  took me into the room.   I only recollect that underneath some white covering on the bed, with a  beautiful cleanliness and freshness all around it, there seemed to me to lie embodied  the solemn stillness that was in the house; and that when she would have turned  the cover gently back, I cried: &#x27;Oh no!  oh no!&#x27; and held her hand. If the funeral had been yesterday, I could not recollect it better. The very air of the best  parlour, when I  went in at  the door, the  bright condition of the fire, the shining of the wine in the decanters, the patterns of the glasses  and plates, the faint sweet smell of cake, the odour of Miss Murdstone&#x27;s dress,  and our black clothes.  Mr. Chillip is in the room, and comes to speak to me. &#x27;And how is Master David?&#x27; he says, kindly. I cannot tell him very well.  I give him my hand, which he holds in his. &#x27;Dear me!&#x27; says Mr. Chillip, meekly smiling, with something shining in his  eye. &#x27;Our little friends grow up around us.  They grow out of our knowledge,  ma&#x27;am?&#x27; This is to Miss Murdstone, who makes no reply. &#x27;There is a great improvement here, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; says Mr. Chillip. Miss Murdstone  merely answers  with a  frown and  a formal  bend: Mr.  Chillip, discomfited, goes into  a corner, keeping  me with him,  and opens his  mouth no more. I remark  this, because  I remark  everything that  happens, not  because I care about myself, or have done since I came home.  And now the bell begins to sound, and Mr. Omer and another  come to make us ready.   As Peggotty was wont to  tell me, long ago, the followers  of my father to the  same grave were made ready  in the same room. There are Mr. Murdstone, our neighbour Mr. Grayper, Mr. Chillip, and I.  When we go out to the door, the Bearers and their load are in the garden; and they  move before us down the path, and past  the elms, and through the gate, and  into the churchyard, where I have so often heard the birds sing on a summer morning. We stand around the grave.  The day seems different to me from every other  day, and the  light not  of the  same colour  - of  a sadder  colour.  Now there is a solemn hush, which we have brought from home with what is resting in the  mould; and while  we stand  bareheaded, I  hear the  voice of  the clergyman,  sounding remote  in  the  open  air,  and yet  distinct  and  plain,  saying:  &#x27;I am  the Resurrection and the  Life, saith the  Lord!&#x27;  Then I  hear sobs; and,  standing apart among the lookers-on,  I see that good  and faithful servant, whom  of all the people  upon earth  I love  the best,  and unto  whom my  childish heart  is certain that the Lord will one day say: &#x27;Well done.&#x27; There are many faces that I know,  among the little crowd; faces that I  knew in church, when mine was  always wondering there; faces  that first saw my  mother, when she came to the village in her youthful bloom.  I do not mind them - I mind nothing  but my  grief -  and yet  I see  and know  them all;  and even  in  the background,  far  away, see  Minnie  looking on,  and  her eye  glancing  on her sweetheart, who is near me. It is over,  and the earth  is filled in,  and we turn  to come away.  Before us stands our house, so pretty and unchanged,  so linked in my mind with the  young idea of what is gone, that all my sorrow has been nothing to the sorrow it calls forth.  But they take me on; and Mr. Chillip talks to me; and when we get  home, puts some  water to  my lips;  and when  I ask  his leave  to go  up to my room, dismisses me with the gentleness of a woman. All this, I say, is yesterday&#x27;s  event.  Events of later date have  floated from me to the shore where all forgotten things will reappear, but this stands like a high rock in the ocean. I knew that Peggotty would come to me in my room.  The Sabbath stillness of  the time (the day was so like Sunday!  I have forgotten that) was suited to us both. She sat down by my side upon  my little bed; and holding my hand,  and sometimes putting it to her lips, and sometimes smoothing it with hers, as she might  have comforted my  little brother,  told me,  in her  way, all  that she  had to tell concerning what had happened. &#x27;She was never well,&#x27; said Peggotty, &#x27;for a long time.  She was uncertain in her mind, and not happy.  When her baby  was born, I thought at first she  would get better, but she  was more delicate,  and sunk a  little every day.   She used to like to sit alone before her baby  came, and then she cried; but afterwards  she used to sing to it - so soft, that I once thought, when I heard her, it was like a voice up in the air, that was rising away. &#x27;I think she got to be more timid, and more frightened-like, of late; and that a hard word was like a blow to her.  But she was always the same to me.  She never changed to her foolish Peggotty, didn&#x27;t my sweet girl.&#x27; Here Peggotty stopped, and softly beat upon my hand a little while. &#x27;The last time that I saw her like her own old self, was the night when you came home, my dear.  The  day you went away,  she said to me,  &quot;I never shall see  my pretty darling again.  Something tells me so, that tells the truth, I know.&quot; &#x27;She tried to hold up  after that; and many a  time, when they told her  she was thoughtless and light-hearted, made  believe to be so;  but it was all  a bygone then.  She  never told  her husband  what she  had told  me -  she was afraid of saying it to anybody else - till one night, a little more than a week before  it happened, when she said to him: &quot;My dear, I think I am dying.&quot; &#x27;&quot;It&#x27;s off my mind now, Peggotty,&quot; she told me, when I laid her in her bed  that night.  &quot;He will believe it more and more, poor fellow, every day for a few days to come; and then it will be past. I am very tired.  If this is sleep, sit by me while I sleep:  don&#x27;t leave me.   God bless both  my children!  God  protect and keep my fatherless boy!&quot; &#x27;I never left  her afterwards,&#x27; said  Peggotty.  &#x27;She often  talked to them  two downstairs - for she  loved them; she couldn&#x27;t  bear not to love  anyone who was about her - but when they went away from her bed-side, she always turned to  me, as if there was rest where Peggotty was, and never fell asleep in any other way. &#x27;On the last night, in the evening, she kissed me, and said: &quot;If my baby  should die too, Peggotty, please  let them lay him  in my arms, and  bury us together.&quot; (It was done; for the poor lamb lived but a day beyond her.) &quot;Let my dearest boy go with us to our resting-place,&quot; she said, &quot;and tell him that his mother,  when she lay here, blessed him not once, but a thousand times.&quot;&#x27; Another silence followed this, and another gentle beating on my hand. &#x27;It was pretty  far in the  night,&#x27; said Peggotty,  &#x27;when she asked  me for some drink; and when she had taken it, gave  me such a patient smile, the dear! -  so beautiful! &#x27;Daybreak had come, and the  sun was rising, when she  said to me, how kind  and considerate Mr. Copperfield had  always been to her,  and how he had  borne with her, and told her, when she doubted herself, that a loving heart was better  and stronger than wisdom, and that he was a happy man in hers.  &quot;Peggotty, my dear,&quot; she said then, &quot;put me  nearer to you,&quot; for she  was very weak.  &quot;Lay your  good arm underneath my neck,&quot; she said, &quot;and  turn me to you, for your face  is going far off, and I  want it to be  near.&quot;  I put it  as she asked; and  oh Davy! the time had come when my first parting words  to you were true - when she was  glad to lay her poor head on her stupid cross old Peggotty&#x27;s arm - and she died  like a child that had gone to sleep!&#x27; Thus ended Peggotty&#x27;s narration.  From the moment of my knowing of the death  of my mother, the  idea of her  as she had  been of late  had vanished from  me.  I remembered her,  from that  instant, only  as the  young mother  of my  earliest impressions, who  had been  used to  wind her  bright curls  round and round her finger, and to dance with me at twilight in the parlour.  What Peggotty had told me now, was so far from bringing me back to the later period, that it rooted the earlier image in my mind.  It may be curious, but it is true.  In her death  she winged her way back to her calm untroubled youth, and cancelled all the rest. The mother  who lay  in the  grave, was  the mother  of my  infancy; the  little creature in her  arms, was myself,  as I had  once been, hushed  for ever on her bosom. CHAPTER 10 I BECOME NEGLECTED, AND AM PROVIDED FOR The first act of business Miss Murdstone performed when the day of the solemnity was over, and light was freely admitted  into the house, was to give Peggotty  a month&#x27;s warning.  Much as Peggotty would have disliked such a service, I believe she would have retained it, for my  sake, in preference to the best upon  earth. She told me we must part, and told me why; and we condoled with one another,  in all sincerity. As to me or my future, not a  word was said, or a step taken.  Happy  they would have been, I dare say, if they could have dismissed me at a month&#x27;s warning too. I mustered courage once, to ask Miss Murdstone when I was going back to  school; and she answered dryly, she  believed I was not going  back at all.  I was  told nothing more. I was very anxious to know what was going to be done with me,  and so was  Peggotty; but  neither she  nor I  could pick  up any information on the subject. There was one  change in my  condition, which, while  it relieved me  of a great deal  of present  uneasiness, might  have made  me, if  I had  been capable   of considering it closely, yet more  uncomfortable about the future.  It  was this. The constraint that  had been put  upon me, was  quite abandoned.  I  was so far from  being required  to keep  my dull  post in  the parlour,  that on   several occasions, when I took my seat there, Miss Murdstone frowned to me to go away. I was so far from being warned  off from Peggotty&#x27;s society, that, provided  I was not in Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s, I was never sought out or inquired for.  At first I  was in daily dread of his taking my education in hand again, or of Miss  Murdstone&#x27;s devoting  herself  to  it; but  I  soon  began to  think  that  such fears  were groundless, and that all I had to anticipate was neglect. I do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then.  I was still giddy with the shock of my  mother&#x27;s death, and in a  kind of stunned state as  to all tributary things.  I can recollect, indeed, to have speculated, at odd times, on the possibility  of my  not being  taught any  more, or  cared for any more; and growing up  to be  a shabby,  moody man,  lounging an  idle life away, about the village; as  well as  on the  feasibility of  my getting  rid of this picture by going away somewhere, like  the hero in a  story, to seek my  fortune: but these were transient visions, daydreams  I sat looking at  sometimes, as if they  were faintly painted or  written on the  wall of my  room, and which,  as they melted away, left the wall blank again. &#x27;Peggotty,&#x27; I said in a thoughtful  whisper, one evening, when I was  warming my hands at the  kitchen fire, &#x27;Mr.  Murdstone likes me  less than he  used to.  He never liked me much, Peggotty;  but he would rather not  even see me now, if  he can help it.&#x27; &#x27;Perhaps it&#x27;s his sorrow,&#x27; said Peggotty, stroking my hair. &#x27;I am sure, Peggotty, I am sorry too.  If I believed it was his sorrow, I should not think of it at all.  But it&#x27;s not that; oh, no, it&#x27;s not that.&#x27; &#x27;How do you know it&#x27;s not that?&#x27; said Peggotty, after a silence. &#x27;Oh, his sorrow  is another and  quite a different  thing.  He is  sorry at this moment, sitting  by the  fireside with  Miss Murdstone;  but if  I was to go in, Peggotty, he would be something besides.&#x27; &#x27;What would he be?&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;Angry,&#x27; I answered, with  an involuntary imitation of  his dark frown.  &#x27;If  he was only sorry, he wouldn&#x27;t look at me as he does. I am only sorry, and it makes me feel kinder.&#x27; Peggotty said nothing for  a little while; and  I warmed my hands,  as silent as she. &#x27;Davy,&#x27; she said at length. &#x27;Yes, Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;I  have tried, my  dear, all ways  I could think  of - all the ways there  are, and  all the  ways there  ain&#x27;t, in  short -  to get a suitable service here, in Blunderstone; but there&#x27;s no such a thing, my love.&#x27; &#x27;And what do you mean to do,  Peggotty,&#x27; says I, wistfully.  &#x27;Do you mean  to go and seek your fortune?&#x27; &#x27;I expect  I shall  be forced  to go  to Yarmouth,&#x27;  replied Peggotty, &#x27;and live there.&#x27; &#x27;You might have gone  farther off,&#x27; I said,  brightening a little, &#x27;and  been as bad as lost.  I shall see you sometimes, my dear old Peggotty, there.  You won&#x27;t be quite at the other end of the world, will you?&#x27; &#x27;Contrary ways, please God!&#x27; cried  Peggotty, with great animation. &#x27;As  long as you are here, my pet, I shall come  over every week of my life to see  you.  One day, every week of my life!&#x27; I felt a great weight taken off my  mind by this promise: but even this was  not all, for Peggotty went on to say: &#x27;I&#x27;m a-going,  Davy, you  see, to  my brother&#x27;s,  first, for another fortnight&#x27;s visit - just till I have had time to look about me, and get to be something like myself again.  Now, I  have been thinking that  perhaps, as they don&#x27;t  want you here at present, you might be let to go along with me.&#x27; If anything,  short of  being in  a different  relation to  every one  about me, Peggotty excepted,  could have  given me  a sense  of pleasure  at that time, it would have been this project of all others.  The idea of being again  surrounded by those honest faces,  shining welcome on me;  of renewing the peacefulness  of the sweet Sunday morning,  when the bells were  ringing, the stones dropping  in the water, and the  shadowy ships breaking through  the mist; of roaming  up and down with little Em&#x27;ly, telling her my troubles, and finding charms against them in the shells and pebbles on the beach; made a calm in my heart.  It was ruffled next moment, to be sure, by a doubt of Miss Murdstone&#x27;s giving her consent;  but even that was set at rest soon, for she came out to take an evening grope in the store-closet while we  were yet in  conversation, and Peggotty,  with a boldness that amazed me, broached the topic on the spot. &#x27;The boy will be  idle there,&#x27; said Miss  Murdstone, looking into a  pickle-jar, &#x27;and idleness is the root of all evil.   But, to be sure, he would be idle  here or anywhere, in my opinion.&#x27; Peggotty had an  angry answer ready,  I could see;  but she swallowed  it for my sake, and remained silent. &#x27;Humph!&#x27; said Miss Murdstone,  still keeping her eye  on the pickles; &#x27;it  is of more importance than  anything else -  it is of  paramount importance -  that my brother should not be disturbed or  made uncomfortable.  I suppose I had  better say yes.&#x27; I thanked her, without  making any demonstration of  joy, lest it should  induce her to withdraw her  assent.  Nor could I  help thinking this a  prudent course, since  she looked  at me  out of  the pickle-jar,  with as  great an  access  of sourness  as  if  her  black  eyes  had  absorbed  its  contents.   However, the permission was  given, and  was never  retracted; for  when the  month was  out, Peggotty and I were ready to depart. Mr. Barkis came into the house for  Peggotty&#x27;s boxes.  I had never known him  to pass the garden-gate before, but on  this occasion he came into the  house.  And he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and went out, which I thought had meaning  in it,  if meaning  could ever  be said  to find  its way  into Mr. Barkis&#x27;s visage. Peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home so  many years, and  where the  two strong  attachments of  her life  - for my mother and myself - had  been formed.  She  had been walking  in the churchyard,  too, very early; and she  got into the  cart, and sat  in it with  her handkerchief at her eyes. So long  as she  remained in  this condition,  Mr. Barkis  gave no  sign of life whatever.  He sat in his usual  place and attitude like a great  stuffed figure. But when she began to look about her, and to speak to me, he nodded his head and grinned several times.  I have not the least notion at whom, or what he meant by it. &#x27;It&#x27;s a beautiful day, Mr. Barkis!&#x27; I said, as an act of politeness. &#x27;It ain&#x27;t bad,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis, who generally qualified his speech, and  rarely committed himself. &#x27;Peggotty  is  quite  comfortable  now,   Mr.  Barkis,&#x27;  I  remarked,  for   his satisfaction. &#x27;Is she, though?&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. After reflecting about it, with a sagacious air, Mr. Barkis eyed her, and said: &#x27;ARE you pretty comfortable?&#x27; Peggotty laughed, and answered in the affirmative. &#x27;But really and truly, you know.   Are you?&#x27; growled Mr. Barkis, sliding  nearer to her on the seat, and nudging her with his elbow. &#x27;Are you?  Really and  truly pretty comfortable?  Are you?  Eh?&#x27; At each  of these  inquiries Mr.  Barkis shuffled  nearer to  her, and  gave her another nudge; so  that at last  we were all  crowded together in  the left-hand corner of the cart, and I was so squeezed that I could hardly bear it. Peggotty calling his  attention to my  sufferings, Mr. Barkis  gave me a  little more room at once, and got away by degrees.  But I could not help observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient for expressing  himself in a neat, agreeable, and pointed manner, without the inconvenience of inventing conversation.  He  manifestly chuckled  over it  for some  time.  By  and by  he turned to Peggotty  again, and repeating,  &#x27;Are you pretty  comfortable though?&#x27; bore down upon us as before, until  the breath was nearly edged out of  my body. By and by he made  another descent upon us with  the same inquiry, and the  same result.  At  length, I  got up  whenever I  saw him  coming, and standing on the foot-board, pretended to look at the prospect; after which I did very well. He was so  polite as to  stop at a  public-house, expressly on  our account, and entertain us with broiled mutton and beer.  Even when Peggotty was in the act of drinking, he was seized with one of those approaches, and almost choked her. But as we drew nearer to the end of our journey, he had more to do and less time for gallantry; and when we got on Yarmouth pavement, we were all too much shaken and jolted, I apprehend, to have any leisure for anything else. Mr. Peggotty  and Ham  waited for  us at  the old  place.  They  received me and Peggotty in an affectionate manner, and  shook hands with Mr. Barkis, who,  with his  hat  on  the very  back  of  his head,  and  a  shame-faced leer  upon  his countenance, and pervading his very  legs, presented but a vacant  appearance, I thought.  They each took one of Peggotty&#x27;s trunks, and we were going away,  when Mr. Barkis  solemnly made  a sign  to me  with his  forefinger to  come under an archway. &#x27;I say,&#x27; growled Mr. Barkis, &#x27;it was all right.&#x27; I looked up into  his face, and answered,  with an attempt to  be very profound: &#x27;Oh!&#x27; &#x27;It didn&#x27;t come to a end  there,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis, nodding confidentially.   &#x27;It was all right.&#x27; Again I answered, &#x27;Oh!&#x27; &#x27;You know who was willin&#x27;,&#x27; said my friend.  &#x27;It was Barkis, and Barkis only.&#x27; I nodded assent. &#x27;It&#x27;s all right,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis, shaking hands; &#x27;I&#x27;m a friend of your&#x27;n.   You made it all right, first.  It&#x27;s all right.&#x27; In  his  attempts  to  be  particularly  lucid,  Mr.  Barkis  was  so  extremely mysterious, that I might  have stood looking in  his face for an  hour, and most assuredly should have got as much information out of it as out of the face of  a clock that had stopped,  but for Peggotty&#x27;s calling  me away.  As we  were going along, she asked  me what he  had said; and  I told her  he had said  it was all right. &#x27;Like his impudence,&#x27; said  Peggotty, &#x27;but I don&#x27;t  mind that!  Davy dear,  what should you think if I was to think of being married?&#x27; &#x27;Why - I suppose  you would like me  as much then, Peggotty,  as you do now?&#x27;  I returned, after a little consideration. Greatly to the astonishment of the passengers  in the street, as well as of  her relations going on before, the good soul  was obliged to stop and embrace me  on the spot, with many protestations of her unalterable love. &#x27;Tell me what should you say, darling?&#x27; she asked again, when this was over, and we were walking on. &#x27;If you were thinking of being married - to Mr. Barkis, Peggotty?&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said Peggotty. &#x27;I should think it would be a very good thing.  For then you know, Peggotty, you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to see me, and could come for nothing, and be sure of coming.&#x27; &#x27;The sense of the  dear!&#x27; cried Peggotty.  &#x27;What  I have been thinking  of, this month  back!   Yes,  my precious;  and  I  think I  should  be  more independent altogether, you see; let alone my working  with a better heart in my own  house, than I could in anybody else&#x27;s now.  I don&#x27;t know what I might be fit for,  now, as a servant  to a  stranger.  And  I shall  be always  near my pretty&#x27;s resting place,&#x27; said Peggotty, musing, &#x27;and  be able to see it  when I like; and when  I lie down to rest, I may be laid not far off from my darling girl!&#x27; We neither of us said anything for a little while. &#x27;But I wouldn&#x27;t so much as give it another thought,&#x27; said Peggotty, cheerily &#x27;if my Davy was anyways against it - not if I had been asked in church thirty  times three times over, and was wearing out the ring in my pocket.&#x27; &#x27;Look at me, Peggotty,&#x27; I replied; &#x27;and  see if I am not really glad,  and don&#x27;t truly wish it!&#x27;  As indeed I did, with all my heart. &#x27;Well, my life,&#x27; said Peggotty, giving me a squeeze, &#x27;I have thought of it night and day, every way I can, and I hope the right way; but I&#x27;ll think of it  again, and  speak  to my  brother  about it,  and  in the  meantime  we&#x27;ll keep  it  to ourselves, Davy, you and  me. Barkis is a  good plain creature,&#x27; said  Peggotty, &#x27;and if I tried to do my duty by  him, I think it would be my fault if  I wasn&#x27;t if  I  wasn&#x27;t  pretty  comfortable,&#x27;  said  Peggotty,  laughing  heartily.  This quotation from Mr. Barkis was so appropriate, and tickled us both so much,  that we laughed again  and again, and  were quite in  a pleasant humour  when we came within view of Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s cottage. It looked just the same, except that it may, perhaps, have shrunk a little in my eyes; and Mrs. Gummidge was waiting at  the door as if she had stood  there ever since.  All  within was  the same,  down to  the seaweed  in the  blue mug in my bedroom.   I  went into  the  out-house to  look  about me;  and  the very  same lobsters, crabs, and crawfish possessed by the same desire to pinch the world in general, appeared to be in the same state of conglomeration in the same old corner. But there was no little Em&#x27;ly to be seen, so I asked Mr. Peggotty where she was. &#x27;She&#x27;s at school,  sir,&#x27; said Mr.  Peggotty, wiping the  heat consequent on  the porterage of Peggotty&#x27;s box from his forehead; &#x27;she&#x27;ll be home,&#x27; looking at  the Dutch clock, &#x27;in from twenty minutes to half-an-hour&#x27;s time.  We all on us  feel the loss of her, bless ye!&#x27; Mrs. Gummidge moaned. &#x27;Cheer up, Mawther!&#x27; cried Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;I  feel it  more than  anybody else,&#x27;  said Mrs.  Gummidge; &#x27;I&#x27;m  a lone   lorn creetur&#x27;, and she used to be a&#x27;most the only thing that didn&#x27;t go contrary  with me.&#x27; Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering and shaking  her head, applied herself to  blowing the fire.  Mr. Peggotty, looking round upon us  while she was so engaged, said in  a low voice, which he  shaded with his hand:  &#x27;The old &#x27;un!&#x27;  From  this I rightly conjectured that no improvement had taken place since my last visit in the state of Mrs. Gummidge&#x27;s spirits. Now, the whole place was, or it should have been, quite as delightful a place as ever; and yet it did not impress me in the same way.  I felt rather disappointed with it.  Perhaps it was because little  Em&#x27;ly was not at home.  I knew  the way by which she would come, and presently found myself strolling along the path  to meet her. A figure appeared in the distance before  long, and I soon knew it to  be Em&#x27;ly, who was a little creature still in stature, though she was grown.  But when  she drew nearer, and I saw her blue eyes looking bluer, and her dimpled face looking brighter, and her whole self prettier and gayer, a curious feeling came over  me that made  me pretend  not to  know her,  and pass  by as  if I  were looking at something a long way off.  I have done such a thing since in later life, or I am mistaken. Little Em&#x27;ly didn&#x27;t care a bit.  She saw me well enough; but instead of  turning round and calling after me, ran away laughing. This obliged me to run after her, and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage before I caught her. &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;s you, is it?&#x27; said little Em&#x27;ly. &#x27;Why, you knew who it was, Em&#x27;ly,&#x27; said I. &#x27;And didn&#x27;t YOU know who it was?&#x27; said Em&#x27;ly.  I was going to kiss her, but  she covered her cherry lips with her hands, and said she wasn&#x27;t a baby now, and  ran away, laughing more than ever, into the house. She seemed to  delight in teasing  me, which was  a change in  her I wondered at very much.  The tea table  was ready, and our little  locker was put out in  its old place, but instead of coming to sit by me, she went and bestowed her company upon that grumbling Mrs. Gummidge: and on Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s inquiring why,  rumpled her hair all over her face to hide it, and could do nothing but laugh. &#x27;A little puss, it is!&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty, patting her with his great hand. &#x27;So sh&#x27; is!  so sh&#x27;  is!&#x27; cried Ham.  &#x27;Mas&#x27;r Davy  bor&#x27;, so sh&#x27; is!&#x27; and  he sat and chuckled at her for some time, in a state of mingled admiration and delight, that made his face a burning red. Little Em&#x27;ly  was spoiled  by them  all, in  fact; and  by no  one more than Mr. Peggotty himself, whom she  could have coaxed into  anything, by only going  and laying her cheek against his rough whisker.  That was my opinion, at least, when I saw her do it; and I held Mr. Peggotty to be thoroughly in the right.  But she was so affectionate and sweet-natured, and  had such a pleasant manner of  being both sly and shy at once, that she captivated me more than ever. She was tender-hearted, too;  for when, as we  sat round the fire  after tea, an allusion was made by Mr. Peggotty over his pipe to the loss I had sustained, the tears stood in her eyes, and she looked at me so kindly across the table, that I felt quite thankful to her. &#x27;Ah!&#x27; said Mr.  Peggotty, taking up  her curls, and  running them over  his hand like water, &#x27;here&#x27;s another orphan, you see, sir.  And here,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty, giving Ham a backhanded knock in the chest, &#x27;is another of &#x27;em, though he  don&#x27;t look much like it.&#x27; &#x27;If I had you for my guardian, Mr. Peggotty,&#x27; said I, shaking my head, &#x27;I  don&#x27;t think I should FEEL much like it.&#x27; &#x27;Well said, Mas&#x27;r Davy bor&#x27;!&#x27; cried Ham, in an ecstasy.  &#x27;Hoorah! Well said! Nor more you wouldn&#x27;t!  Hor!  Hor!&#x27; - Here he returned Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s back-  hander, and little Em&#x27;ly got up and kissed Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;And how&#x27;s your friend,  sir?&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty to me. &#x27;Steerforth?&#x27; said I. &#x27;That&#x27;s  the  name!&#x27; cried  Mr.  Peggotty, turning  to  Ham.  &#x27;I  knowed  it was something in our way.&#x27; &#x27;You said it was Rudderford,&#x27; observed Ham, laughing. &#x27;Well!&#x27; retorted Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;And ye steer with a rudder, don&#x27;t ye?  It ain&#x27;t fur off.  How is he, sir?&#x27; &#x27;He was very well indeed when I came away, Mr. Peggotty.&#x27; &#x27;There&#x27;s  a friend!&#x27;  said Mr.  Peggotty, stretching  out his  pipe. &#x27;There&#x27;s  a friend, if you talk of  friends!  Why, Lord love my  heart alive, if it ain&#x27;t  a treat to look at him!&#x27; &#x27;He is very handsome, is he not?&#x27; said I, my heart warming with this praise. &#x27;Handsome!&#x27; cried Mr.  Peggotty.  &#x27;He stands  up to you  like - like  a - why  I don&#x27;t know what he don&#x27;t stand up to you like.  He&#x27;s so bold!&#x27; &#x27;Yes!  That&#x27;s just his  character,&#x27; said I.  &#x27;He&#x27;s  as brave as a  lion, and you can&#x27;t think how frank he is, Mr. Peggotty.&#x27; &#x27;And I do suppose, now,&#x27; said Mr.  Peggotty, looking at me through the smoke  of his pipe,  &#x27;that in  the way  of book-larning  he&#x27;d take  the wind out of a&#x27;most anything.&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said I, delighted; &#x27;he knows everything.  He is astonishingly clever.&#x27; &#x27;There&#x27;s a friend!&#x27; murmured Mr. Peggotty, with a grave toss of his head. &#x27;Nothing seems to cost him  any trouble,&#x27; said I.  &#x27;He  knows a task if he  only looks at it.  He is the best cricketer you ever saw.  He will give you almost as many men as you like at draughts, and beat you easily.&#x27; Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: &#x27;Of course he will.&#x27; &#x27;He is such a speaker,&#x27;  I pursued, &#x27;that he can  win anybody over; and I  don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;d say if you were to hear him sing, Mr. Peggotty.&#x27; Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: &#x27;I have no doubt  of it.&#x27; &#x27;Then, he&#x27;s such a generous, fine, noble fellow,&#x27; said I, quite carried away  by my favourite theme, &#x27;that it&#x27;s hardly possible to give him as much praise as  he deserves.  I am sure  I can never feel  thankful enough for the  generosity with which  he  has protected  me,  so much  younger  and lower  in  the school  than himself.&#x27; I was running on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little Em&#x27;ly&#x27;s  face, which was bent forward over the table, listening with the deepest attention, her breath held, her blue eyes sparkling like jewels, and the colour mantling in her cheeks.  She looked so extraordinarily earnest  and pretty, that I stopped in  a sort of wonder; and they  all observed her at the  same time, for as I  stopped, they laughed and looked at her. &#x27;Em&#x27;ly is like me,&#x27; said Peggotty, &#x27;and would like to see him.&#x27; Em&#x27;ly was confused  by our all  observing her, and  hung down her  head, and her face was covered with blushes.   Glancing up presently through her  stray curls, and seeing that we were  all looking at her still  (I am sure I, for  one, could have looked at her for  hours), she ran away, and  kept away till it was  nearly bedtime. I lay down in  the old little bed  in the stern of  the boat, and the  wind came moaning  on across  the flat  as it   had done  before.  But  I could  not  help fancying, now, that it  moaned of those who  were gone; and instead  of thinking that the sea might rise in the night  and float the boat away, I thought of  the sea that had risen, since I last heard those sounds, and drowned my happy  home. I recollect, as the wind and water began to sound fainter in my ears, putting  a short clause into my prayers, petitioning  that I might grow up to  marry little Em&#x27;ly, and so dropping lovingly asleep. The days passed pretty much as they  had passed before, except - it was  a great exception- that little Em&#x27;ly  and I seldom wandered  on the beach now.   She had tasks to learn,  and needle-work to  do; and was  absent during a  great part of each day.  But I felt that we should not have had those old wanderings, even  if it had been otherwise.   Wild and full of  childish whims as Em&#x27;ly  was, she was more of a  little woman than  I had supposed.   She seemed to  have got a  great distance away  from me,  in little  more than  a year.   She liked  me, but  she laughed at me, and tormented me; and when I went to meet her, stole home another way, and  was laughing  at the  door when  I came  back, disappointed.  The best times were when she sat quietly at work in the doorway, and I sat on the  wooden step at her feet,  reading to her.  It  seems to me, at  this hour, that I  have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April afternoons; that I have  never seen such a sunny little figure as I used to see, sitting in the doorway of  the old boat; that I  have never beheld such  sky, such water, such  glorified ships sailing away into golden air. On  the  very  first  evening  after our  arrival,  Mr.  Barkis  appeared  in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition, and  with a bundle of oranges tied  up in a handkerchief.  As he made no allusion of any kind to this property, he  was supposed to have left  it behind him by  accident when he went  away; until Ham, running after  him to  restore it,  came back  with the  information that it was intended for Peggotty.  After that occasion he appeared every evening at exactly the same hour, and always with a  little bundle, to which he never alluded,  and which  he regularly  put behind  the door  and left  there. These  offerings  of affection  were of  a most  various and  eccentric description.   Among them   I remember a double set of pigs&#x27; trotters, a huge pin-cushion, half a bushel or so of apples, a  pair of jet  earrings, some Spanish  onions, a box  of dominoes, a canary bird and cage, and a leg of pickled pork. Mr. Barkis&#x27;s wooing, as  I remember it, was  altogether of a peculiar  kind.  He very seldom said anything; but would sit  by the fire in much the same  attitude as he sat  in his cart,  and stare heavily  at Peggotty, who  was opposite.  One night, being, as I suppose, inspired by love, he  made a dart at the bit of  wax candle she kept for her thread,  and put it in his waistcoat-pocket  and carried it off.  After  that, his great  delight was to  produce it when  it was wanted, sticking to the lining of his pocket, in a partially melted state, and pocket it again when it was done with.  He  seemed to enjoy himself very much, and  not to feel at all called upon to talk.  Even  when he took Peggotty out for a walk  on the flats, he had no uneasiness on that head, I believe; contenting himself with now and  then asking  her if  she was  pretty comfortable;  and I  remember that sometimes, after he was gone, Peggotty would throw her apron over her face,  and laugh for half-an-hour.  Indeed,  we were all more  or less amused, except  that miserable Mrs. Gummidge, whose courtship would appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature, she  was so continually  reminded by these  transactions of the old one. At length, when the term of my  visit was nearly expired, it was given  out that Peggotty and Mr. Barkis  were going to make  a day&#x27;s holiday together,  and that little Em&#x27;ly and I were to accompany  them.  I had but a broken sleep  the night before, in anticipation of the pleasure of a whole day with Em&#x27;ly.  We were  all astir betimes in  the morning; and  while we were  yet at breakfast,  Mr. Barkis appeared  in the  distance, driving  a chaise-cart  towards the  object of   his affections. Peggotty was dressed as  usual, in her neat  and quiet mourning; but  Mr. Barkis bloomed in a new blue coat, of which the tailor had given him such good measure, that the cuffs  would have rendered  gloves unnecessary in  the coldest weather, while the collar was so high that it pushed his hair up on end on the top of his head.  His bright buttons, too, were of the largest size.  Rendered complete  by drab pantaloons  and a  buff waistcoat,  I thought  Mr. Barkis  a phenomenon  of respectability. When we were  all in a  bustle outside the  door, I found  that Mr. Peggotty was prepared with an old shoe, which was  to be thrown after us for luck,  and which he offered to Mrs. Gummidge for that purpose. &#x27;No.  It had better be done by somebody else, Dan&#x27;l,&#x27; said Mrs. Gummidge.   &#x27;I&#x27;m a lone lorn creetur&#x27;  myself, and everythink that  reminds me of creetur&#x27;s  that ain&#x27;t lone and lorn, goes contrary with me.&#x27; &#x27;Come, old gal!&#x27; cried Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;Take and heave it.&#x27; &#x27;No, Dan&#x27;l,&#x27;  returned Mrs.  Gummidge, whimpering  and shaking  her head.  &#x27;If I felt less,  I could  do more.   You don&#x27;t  feel like  me, Dan&#x27;l; thinks don&#x27;t go contrary with you, nor you with them; you had better do it yourself.&#x27; But here Peggotty,  who had been  going about from  one to another  in a hurried way, kissing everybody, called out from the  cart, in which we all were by  this time (Em&#x27;ly and I on two little  chairs, side by side), that Mrs. Gummidge  must do it.  So Mrs. Gummidge did it; and, I am sorry to relate, cast a damp upon the festive character  of our  departure, by  immediately bursting  into tears,  and sinking subdued into the arms of  Ham, with the declaration that she  knowed she was a burden, and had  better be carried to the  House at once.  Which I  really thought was a sensible idea, that Ham might have acted on. Away we went, however, on our holiday excursion; and the first thing we did  was to stop at a church, where Mr. Barkis tied the horse to some rails, and went  in with Peggotty, leaving  little Em&#x27;ly and  me alone in  the chaise.  I  took that occasion to put my arm round Em&#x27;ly&#x27;s waist, and propose that as I was going away so very soon now,  we should determine to  be very affectionate to  one another, and very happy, all day.  Little Em&#x27;ly consenting, and allowing me to kiss  her, I became desperate; informing her, I recollect, that I never could love another, and that I was prepared  to shed the blood of  anybody who should aspire to  her affections. How merry little Em&#x27;ly made herself about it!  With what a demure assumption  of being immensely older  and wiser than  I, the fairy  little woman said  I was &#x27;a silly boy&#x27;;  and then  laughed so  charmingly that  I forgot  the pain  of being called by that disparaging name, in the pleasure of looking at her. Mr. Barkis and Peggotty were a good  while in the church, but came out  at last, and then we  drove away into  the country.  As  we were going  along, Mr. Barkis turned to me, and said, with a wink, - by the by, I should hardly have  thought, before, that he could wink: &#x27;What name was it as I wrote up in the cart?&#x27; &#x27;Clara Peggotty,&#x27; I answered. &#x27;What name would it be as I should write up now, if there was a tilt here?&#x27; &#x27;Clara Peggotty, again?&#x27; I suggested. &#x27;Clara Peggotty BARKIS!&#x27;  he returned, and  burst into a  roar of laughter  that shook the chaise. In a word, they were married, and had gone into the church for no other purpose. Peggotty was resolved that  it should be quietly  done; and the clerk  had given her away, and  there had been  no witnesses of  the ceremony.  She  was a little confused when Mr. Barkis made this abrupt announcement of their union, and could not hug  me enough  in token  of her  unimpaired affection;  but she soon became herself again, and said she was very glad it was over. We drove to a little inn in a by-road, where we were expected, and where we  had a  very comfortable  dinner, and  passed the  day with  great satisfaction.   If Peggotty had been  married every day  for the last  ten years, she  could hardly have been more at her ease about it;  it made no sort of difference in her:  she was just the same as  ever, and went out for  a stroll with little Em&#x27;ly  and me before  tea,  while Mr.  Barkis  philosophically smoked  his  pipe, and  enjoyed himself,  I  suppose,  with  the contemplation  of  his  happiness.   If so,  it sharpened his  appetite; for  I distinctly  call to  mind that,  although he had eaten a good deal of pork and greens at dinner, and had finished off with a fowl or two, he  was obliged to  have cold boiled  bacon for tea,  and disposed of  a large quantity without any emotion. I  have often  thought, since,  what an  odd, innocent,  out-of-the-way kind  of wedding it must have  been!  We got into  the chaise again soon  after dark, and drove cosily back, looking up at the stars, and talking about them.  I was their chief exponent, and opened Mr. Barkis&#x27;s  mind to an amazing extent.  I  told him all I knew, but he  would have believed anything I  might have taken it into  my head to impart to  him; for he had  a profound veneration for  my abilities, and informed his  wife in  my hearing,  on that  very occasion,  that I was &#x27;a young Roeshus&#x27; - by which I think he meant prodigy. When we had exhausted the subject of  the stars, or rather when I had  exhausted the mental faculties of Mr.  Barkis, little Em&#x27;ly and I  made a cloak of an  old wrapper, and sat  under it for  the rest of  the journey.  Ah,  how I loved her! What happiness (I thought) if we  were married, and were going away  anywhere to live among  the trees  and in  the fields,  never growing  older, never  growing wiser, children ever, rambling hand  in hand through sunshine and  among flowery meadows, laying down our heads on moss at night, in a sweet sleep of purity  and peace, and buried by  the birds when we  were dead!  Some such  picture, with no real world in it, bright with the light of our innocence, and vague as the stars afar off, was in my  mind all the way.  I  am glad to think there  were two such guileless hearts at Peggotty&#x27;s marriage as  little Em&#x27;ly&#x27;s and mine.  I am  glad to think the Loves and Graces took such airy forms in its homely procession. Well, we came to  the old boat again  in good time at  night; and there Mr.  and Mrs. Barkis bade us good-bye, and drove  away snugly to their own home.  I  felt then, for the first time, that I  had lost Peggotty.  I should have gone  to bed with a sore heart  indeed under any other  roof but that which  sheltered little Em&#x27;ly&#x27;s head. Mr. Peggotty and Ham  knew what was in  my thoughts as well  as I did, and  were ready with  some supper  and their  hospitable faces  to drive  it away.  Little Em&#x27;ly came and sat beside me on the locker for the only time in all that  visit; and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful day. It was a night tide;  and soon after we went  to bed, Mr. Peggotty and  Ham went out to fish.  I felt very brave  at being left alone in the solitary  house, the protector of Em&#x27;ly and Mrs. Gummidge, and only wished that a lion or a  serpent, or any ill-disposed monster, would make an attack upon us, that I might  destroy him, and cover  myself with glory.   But as nothing  of the sort  happened to be walking about on  Yarmouth flats that  night, I provided  the best substitute  I could by dreaming of dragons until morning. With morning came Peggotty;  who called to me,  as usual, under my  window as if Mr. Barkis the carrier had been from first to last a dream too.  After breakfast she took me to  her own home, and  a beautiful little home  it was.  Of all  the moveables in it, I must have been impressed by a certain old bureau of some dark wood in  the parlour  (the tile-floored  kitchen was  the general sitting-room), with a retreating top  which opened, let down,  and became a desk,  within which was a large quarto edition of Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs.  This precious volume,  of which I  do not  recollect one  word, I  immediately discovered  and immediately applied myself to; and I never visited the house afterwards, but I kneeled on  a chair, opened the casket where this  gem was enshrined, spread my arms  over the desk,  and fell  to devouring  the book  afresh.  I  was chiefly  edified, I  am afraid,  by the  pictures, which  were numerous,  and represented  all kinds  of dismal horrors; but the Martyrs and Peggotty&#x27;s house have been inseparable in my mind ever since, and are now. I took leave of Mr. Peggotty, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge, and little Em&#x27;ly, that day; and passed the night at Peggotty&#x27;s, in a little room in the roof (with  the Crocodile Book  on a  shelf by  the bed&#x27;s  head) which  was to  be always  mine, Peggotty said, and should always be kept for me in exactly the same state. &#x27;Young or old,  Davy dear, as  long as I  am alive and  have this house  over my head,&#x27; said  Peggotty, &#x27;you  shall find  it as  if I  expected you here directly minute.  I shall keep it every day, as  I used to keep your old little room,  my darling; and if you was to go to China, you might think of it as being kept just the same, all the time you were away.&#x27; I felt the  truth and constancy  of my dear  old nurse, with  all my heart,  and thanked her as well  as I could.  That  was not very well,  for she spoke to  me thus, with her arms round my neck, in  the morning, and I was going home in  the morning, and  I went  home in  the morning,  with herself  and Mr. Barkis in the cart.  They left  me at the  gate, not easily  or lightly; and  it was a strange sight to me to see  the cart go on, taking  Peggotty away, and leaving me  under the old elm-trees looking at  the house, in which there  was no face to look  on mine with love or liking any more. And now I fell into  a state of neglect, which  I cannot look back upon  without compassion.  I fell at once into a solitary condition, - apart from all friendly notice, apart from the society of all  other boys of my own age, apart  from all companionship but my own  spiritless thoughts, - which  seems to cast its  gloom upon this paper as I write. What would I have given, to have  been sent to the hardest school that  ever was kept! - to have  been taught something, anyhow,  anywhere!  No such hope  dawned upon me.  They disliked me; and they sullenly, sternly, steadily, overlooked me. I think  Mr. Murdstone&#x27;s  means were  straitened at  about this  time; but it is little to the  purpose.  He could  not bear me;  and in putting  me from him  he tried, as I believe, to put away the notion that I had any claim upon him -  and succeeded. I was not actively ill-used.  I was  not beaten, or starved; but the wrong  that was done  to me  had no  intervals of  relenting, and  was done in a systematic, passionless manner.  Day after  day, week after week,  month after month, I  was coldly neglected.  I wonder sometimes, when I think of it, what they would  have done if I had been taken with an illness; whether I should have lain down in  my lonely room,  and languished  through it  in my  usual solitary  way, or whether anybody would have helped me out. When Mr. and Miss Murdstone  were at home, I took  my meals with them; in  their absence, I ate and drank by myself.  At all times I lounged about the house  and neighbourhood quite disregarded, except that they were jealous of my making  any friends: thinking, perhaps,  that if I  did, I might  complain to someone.   For this reason,  though Mr.  Chillip often  asked me  to go  and see  him (he was a widower, having, some years before that, lost a little small light-haired  wife, whom I can  just remember  connecting in  my own  thoughts with  a pale tortoise shell  cat), it  was but  seldom that  I enjoyed  the happiness  of passing   an afternoon in his closet of a surgery; reading some book that was new to me, with the smell of the whole Pharmacopoeia coming up my nose, or pounding something in a mortar under his mild directions. For the same  reason, added no  doubt to the  old dislike of  her, I was  seldom allowed to visit Peggotty.  Faithful to her promise, she either came to see  me, or met me somewhere near, once every week, and never empty-handed; but many  and bitter were  the disappointments  I had,  in being  refused permission  to pay a visit to her at  her house.  Some few  times, however, at long  intervals, I was allowed to go  there; and then  I found out  that Mr. Barkis  was something of a miser, or as Peggotty  dutifully expressed it, was  &#x27;a little near&#x27;, and  kept a heap of money in a box under his bed, which he pretended was only full of  coats and trousers.  In this coffer, his  riches hid themselves with such a  tenacious modesty, that the smallest instalments could only be tempted out by artifice; so that Peggotty had to prepare a long and elaborate scheme, a very Gunpowder Plot, for every Saturday&#x27;s expenses. All this time I was so conscious of the waste of any promise I had given, and of my being utterly neglected, that I should have been perfectly miserable, I  have no doubt, but for the old books.  They  were my only comfort; and I was as  true to them as they were  to me, and read them  over and over I don&#x27;t  know how many times more. I now approach a period of my  life, which I can never lose the  remembrance of, while I remember anything: and the  recollection of which has often, without  my invocation, come before me like a ghost, and haunted happier times. I had been out, one day, loitering somewhere, in the listless, meditative manner that my  way of  life engendered,  when, turning  the corner  of a lane near our house, I came upon Mr. Murdstone walking with a gentleman.  I was confused,  and was going by them, when the gentleman cried: &#x27;What!  Brooks!&#x27; &#x27;No, sir, David Copperfield,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Don&#x27;t  tell me.   You are  Brooks,&#x27; said  the gentleman.   &#x27;You are  Brooks  of Sheffield.  That&#x27;s your name.&#x27; At these words, I observed the gentleman more attentively.  His laugh coming  to my remembrance  too, I  knew him  to be  Mr. Quinion,  whom I  had gone  over to Lowestoft with  Mr. Murdstone  to see,  before -  it is  no matter  - I need not recall when. &#x27;And how  do you  get on,  and where  are you  being educated, Brooks?&#x27; said Mr. Quinion. He had put his hand upon my shoulder, and turned me about, to walk with them.  I did not know what to reply, and glanced dubiously at Mr. Murdstone. &#x27;He  is  at home  at  present,&#x27; said  the  latter.  &#x27;He  is  not being  educated anywhere.  I don&#x27;t know what to do with him.  He is a difficult subject.&#x27; That old, double look was on me for a moment; and then his eyes darkened with  a frown, as it turned, in its aversion, elsewhere. &#x27;Humph!&#x27; said Mr. Quinion, looking at us both, I thought.  &#x27;Fine weather!&#x27; Silence ensued, and  I was considering  how I could  best disengage my  shoulder from his hand, and go away, when he said: &#x27;I suppose you are a pretty sharp fellow still?  Eh, Brooks?&#x27; &#x27;Aye!  He is  sharp enough,&#x27; said  Mr. Murdstone, impatiently.   &#x27;You had better let him go.  He will not thank you for troubling him.&#x27; On this  hint, Mr.  Quinion released  me, and  I made  the best  of my way home. Looking back  as I  turned into  the front  garden, I  saw Mr. Murdstone leaning against the wicket of the churchyard, and Mr. Quinion talking to him.  They were both looking after me, and I felt that they were speaking of me. Mr. Quinion lay at our house  that night.  After breakfast, the next  morning, I had put my chair away, and was going out of the room, when Mr. Murdstone  called me  back.  He  then gravely  repaired to  another table,  where his  sister  sat herself at her desk.  Mr. Quinion, with his hands in his pockets, stood  looking out of window; and I stood looking at them all. &#x27;David,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone, &#x27;to the young  this is a world for action; not  for moping and droning in.&#x27; - &#x27;As you do,&#x27; added his sister. &#x27;Jane Murdstone, leave it to me, if you please.  I say, David, to the young this is a world for action, and not  for moping and droning in.  It is  especially so for a young boy of your disposition, which requires a great deal of  correcting; and to which no greater service can be  done than to force it to conform to  the ways of the working world, and to bend it and break it.&#x27; &#x27;For stubbornness  won&#x27;t do  here,&#x27; said  his sister  &#x27;What it  wants is,  to be crushed.  And crushed it must be.  Shall be, too!&#x27; He gave her a look, half in remonstrance, half in approval, and went on: &#x27;I suppose you know, David, that I am  not rich.  At any rate, you know it  now. You have received some considerable education already.  Education is costly; and even if it were not, and I could afford it, I am of opinion that it would not be at all advantageous to you to be kept at school.  What is before you, is a fight with the world; and the sooner you begin it, the better.&#x27; I think it occurred to  me that I had already  begun it, in my poor  way: but it occurs to me now, whether or no. &#x27;You have heard the &quot;counting-house&quot; mentioned sometimes,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone. &#x27;The counting-house,  sir?&#x27; I  repeated. &#x27;Of  Murdstone and  Grinby, in the wine trade,&#x27; he replied. I suppose I looked uncertain, for he went on hastily: &#x27;You have heard the &quot;counting-house&quot; mentioned, or the business, or the cellars, or the wharf, or something about it.&#x27; &#x27;I think I have heard the  business mentioned, sir,&#x27; I said, remembering  what I vaguely knew of his and his sister&#x27;s resources. &#x27;But I don&#x27;t know when.&#x27; &#x27;It does not matter when,&#x27; he returned.  &#x27;Mr. Quinion manages that business.&#x27; I glanced at the latter deferentially as he stood looking out of window. &#x27;Mr. Quinion suggests that it gives  employment to some other boys, and  that he sees no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t, on the same terms, give employment to you.&#x27; &#x27;He having,&#x27; Mr. Quinion  observed in a low  voice, and half turning  round, &#x27;no other prospect, Murdstone.&#x27; Mr.  Murdstone,  with an  impatient,  even an  angry  gesture, resumed,  without noticing what he had said: &#x27;Those terms are,  that you will  earn enough for  yourself to provide  for your eating and drinking, and pocket-money.  Your lodging (which I have arranged for) will be paid by me.  So will your washing -&#x27; &#x27;- Which will be kept down to my estimate,&#x27; said his sister. &#x27;Your clothes will be  looked after for you,  too,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone;  &#x27;as you will not be able, yet awhile, to get them for yourself.  So you are now going to London, David, with Mr. Quinion, to begin the world on your own account.&#x27; &#x27;In short, you are  provided for,&#x27; observed his  sister; &#x27;and will please  to do your duty.&#x27; Though I quite understood that the  purpose of this announcement was to  get rid of me, I have no distinct  remembrance whether it pleased or frightened  me.  My impression is, that  I was in  a state of  confusion about it,  and, oscillating between the two points, touched neither.   Nor had I much time for  the clearing of my thoughts, as Mr. Quinion was to go upon the morrow. Behold me, on the  morrow, in a much-worn  little white hat, with  a black crape round it  for my  mother, a  black jacket,  and a  pair of  hard, stiff corduroy trousers - which Miss Murdstone considered the best armour for the legs in  that fight with the world which was now to come off.  behold me so attired, and  with my little worldly all before me in a small trunk, sitting, a lone lorn child (as Mrs. Gummidge might have said), in the post-chaise that was carrying Mr. Quinion to the London coach at Yarmouth!  See, how our house and church are lessening in the distance;  how the  grave beneath  the tree  is blotted  out by  intervening objects; how the spire  points upwards from my  old playground no more,  and the sky is empty! DAVID COPPERFIELD by CHARLES DICKENS AFFECTIONATELY  INSCRIBED  TO  THE  HON.   Mr.  AND  Mrs.  RICHARD  WATSON,   OF ROCKINGHAM, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE. PREFACE TO 1850 EDITION I do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this Book, in the  first sensations of having finished it, to  refer to it with the composure  which this formal heading  would seem  to require.   My interest  in it,  is so  recent and strong; and my mind is so divided between pleasure and regret - pleasure in  the achievement of a long  design,  regret in  the separation from   many companions that  I  am  in  danger  of wearying  the  reader  whom  I  love, with  personal confidences, and private emotions. Besides  which, all  that I  could say  of the  Story, to  any purpose,  I  have endeavoured to say in it. It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know, how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years&#x27; imaginative task; or how an Author  feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world, when  a crowd of the creatures of  his brain are going from  him for ever.  Yet, I  have nothing else to tell; unless, indeed, I were to confess (which might be of  less moment still) that no one can ever believe this Narrative, in the reading,  more than I have believed it in the writing. Instead of looking back,  therefore, I will look  forward.  I cannot close  this Volume more agreeably  to myself, than  with a hopeful  glance towards the  time when I  shall again  put forth  my two  green leaves  once a  month, and  with a faithful remembrance of  the genial sun  and showers that  have fallen on  these leaves of David Copperfield, and made me happy. London, October, 1850. PREFACE TO THE CHARLES DICKENS EDITION I REMARKED in the original Preface to this Book, that I did not find it easy  to get sufficiently far away  from it, in the  first sensations of having  finished it, to refer to  it with the composure  which this formal heading  would seem to require.  My interest in it was so recent and strong, and my mind was so divided between pleasure  and regret  - pleasure  in the  achievement of  a long design, regret in the separation from many companions - that I was in danger of wearying the reader with personal confidences and private emotions. Besides which, all  that I could  have said of  the Story to  any purpose, I had endeavoured to say in it. It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know how sorrowfully the pen  is laid down at the close of a two-years&#x27; imaginative task; or how an Author  feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world, when  a crowd of the  creatures of his  brain are going  from him for  ever.  Yet, I had nothing else to tell; unless, indeed, I were to confess (which might be of  less moment still), that no one can ever believe this Narrative, in the reading, more than I believed it in the writing. So true  are these  avowals at  the present  day, that  I can  now only take the reader into one  confidence more.  Of  all my books,  I like this  the best.  It will be easily believed that I am a fond parent to every child of my fancy,  and that no one can ever love that family as dearly as I love them.  But, like  many fond parents, I have in my heart  of hearts a favourite child.  And his  name is DAVID COPPERFIELD. 1869 APTER 14 MY AUNT MAKES UP HER MIND ABOUT ME On going  down in  the morning,  I found  my aunt  musing so profoundly over the breakfast table, with her  elbow on the tray,  that the contents of  the urn had overflowed the teapot and were laying the whole table-cloth under water, when my entrance put her meditations to flight.  I felt sure that I had been the subject of  her reflections,  and was  more than  ever anxious  to know  her  intentions towards  me.  Yet  I dared  not express  my anxiety,  lest it  should give   her offence. My eyes, however, not being so  much under control as my tongue,  were attracted towards my aunt very  often during breakfast.  I  never could look at  her for a few moments  together but  I found  her looking  at me  - in  an odd  thoughtful manner, as if I were an immense way  off, instead of being on the other side  of the  small round  table.  When  she had  finished her  breakfast, my  aunt  very deliberately leaned back in her chair,  knitted her brows, folded her arms,  and contemplated me at her  leisure, with such a  fixedness of attention that  I was quite  overpowered  by  embarrassment.   Not  having  as  yet  finished  my  own breakfast, I attempted to hide my confusion by proceeding with it; but my  knife tumbled over my  fork, my fork  tripped up my  knife, I chipped  bits of bacon a surprising height into the  air instead of cutting  them for my own  eating, and choked myself with my tea, which persisted in going the wrong way instead of the right one, until I  gave in altogether, and  sat blushing under my  aunt&#x27;s close scrutiny. &#x27;Hallo!&#x27; said my aunt, after a long time. I looked up, and met her sharp bright glance respectfully. &#x27;I have written to him,&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;To -?&#x27; &#x27;To your  father-in-law,&#x27; said  my aunt.   &#x27;I have  sent him  a letter that I&#x27;ll trouble him to attend to, or he and I will fall out, I can tell him!&#x27; &#x27;Does he know where I am, aunt?&#x27; I inquired, alarmed. &#x27;I have told him,&#x27; said my aunt, with a nod. &#x27;Shall I - be - given up to him?&#x27; I faltered. &#x27;I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;We shall see.&#x27; &#x27;Oh! I can&#x27;t think what I shall do,&#x27;  I exclaimed, &#x27;if I have to go back  to Mr. Murdstone!&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know anything about it,&#x27; said my aunt, shaking her head. &#x27;I can&#x27;t  say, I am sure.  We shall see.&#x27; My spirits  sank under  these words,  and I  became very  downcast and  heavy of heart.  My  aunt, without  appearing to  take much  heed of  me, put on a coarse apron with a bib, which  she took out of the  press; washed up the teacups  with her own hands; and,  when everything was washed  and set in the  tray again, and the cloth folded and put on the top  of the whole, rang for Janet to remove  it. She next swept up the  crumbs with a little broom  (putting on a pair of  gloves first), until  there did  not appear  to be  one microscopic  speck left  on the carpet; next dusted and  arranged the room, which  was dusted and arranged  to a hair&#x27;sbreadth already. When all these tasks were performed to her  satisfaction, she took off the  gloves and apron, folded  them up, put them  in the particular corner of the press from which they had been taken, brought out her work-box  to her own table in the open window,  and sat down, with the green fan  between her and the light, to work. &#x27;I wish you&#x27;d go upstairs,&#x27; said my aunt, as she threaded her needle, &#x27;and  give my compliments to Mr.  Dick, and I&#x27;ll be  glad to know how  he gets on with  his Memorial.&#x27; I rose with all alacrity, to acquit myself of this commission. &#x27;I suppose,&#x27; said my aunt, eyeing me  as narrowly as she had eyed the  needle in threading it, &#x27;you think Mr. Dick a short name, eh?&#x27; &#x27;I thought it was rather a short name, yesterday,&#x27; I confessed. &#x27;You are not to  suppose that he hasn&#x27;t  got a longer name,  if he chose to  use it,&#x27; said my aunt,  with a loftier air.   &#x27;Babley - Mr. Richard  Babley - that&#x27;s the gentleman&#x27;s true name.&#x27; I was going to suggest,  with a modest sense of  my youth and the familiarity  I had been already guilty of, that I had better give him the full benefit of  that name, when my aunt went on to say: &#x27;But don&#x27;t you call him by it, whatever you do.  He can&#x27;t bear his name.  That&#x27;s a peculiarity  of his.   Though I  don&#x27;t know  that it&#x27;s  much of a peculiarity, either; for he has been ill-used enough, by some that bear it, to have a  mortal antipathy for it, Heaven knows. Mr. Dick is his name here, and everywhere  else, now - if he ever went anywhere  else, which he don&#x27;t.  So take care,  child, you don&#x27;t call him anything BUT Mr. Dick.&#x27; I promised to obey, and went upstairs with my message; thinking, as I went, that if Mr. Dick had  been working at his  Memorial long, at the  same rate as I  had seen him working at it, through the open door, when I came down, he was probably getting on very well indeed.  I found  him still driving at it with a  long pen, and his head almost laid upon the paper.   He was so intent upon it, that I  had ample leisure  to observe  the large  paper kite  in a  corner, the confusion of bundles of manuscript, the number of  pens, and, above all, the quantity  of ink (which  he seemed  to have  in, in  half-gallon jars  by the  dozen), before  he observed my being present. &#x27;Ha! Phoebus!&#x27; said Mr. Dick, laying down his pen.  &#x27;How does the world go? I&#x27;ll tell you what,&#x27; he added, in a lower tone, &#x27;I shouldn&#x27;t wish it to be mentioned, but it&#x27;s a -&#x27; here he beckoned to me, and put his lips close to my ear - &#x27;it&#x27;s a mad world.  Mad as Bedlam, boy!&#x27; said Mr. Dick, taking snuff from a round box on the table, and laughing heartily. Without presuming to give my opinion on this question, I delivered my message. &#x27;Well,&#x27; said Mr. Dick, in  answer, &#x27;my compliments to her,  and I - I believe  I have made a  start.  I think  I have made  a start,&#x27; said  Mr. Dick, passing his hand among  his grey  hair, and  casting anything  but a  confident look  at his manuscript.  &#x27;You have been to school?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, sir,&#x27; I answered; &#x27;for a short time.&#x27; &#x27;Do you recollect the date,&#x27; said Mr. Dick, looking earnestly at me, and  taking up his pen to note it down, &#x27;when King Charles the First had his head cut  off?&#x27; I said I believed it happened in the year sixteen hundred and forty-nine. &#x27;Well,&#x27;  returned  Mr.  Dick,  scratching his  ear  with  his  pen, and  looking dubiously at me.  &#x27;So the books say; but I don&#x27;t see how that can be.   Because, if it was so long ago, how could the people about him have made that mistake  of putting some of the trouble out of his head, after it was taken off, into mine?&#x27; I was very much surprised by the inquiry; but could give no information on  this point. &#x27;It&#x27;s very strange,&#x27; said Mr. Dick, with a despondent look upon his papers,  and with his hand among his hair again,  &#x27;that I never can get that quite  right.  I never  can  make that  perfectly  clear.  But  no  matter, no  matter!&#x27;  he said cheerfully, and rousing himself, &#x27;there&#x27;s  time enough!  My compliments to  Miss Trotwood, I am getting on very well indeed.&#x27; I was going away, when he directed my attention to the kite. &#x27;What do you think of that for a kite?&#x27; he said. I answered that  it was a  beautiful one.  I  should think it  must have been as much as seven feet high. &#x27;I made it.  We&#x27;ll go and fly it, you and I,&#x27; said Mr. Dick.  &#x27;Do you see this?&#x27; He showed me that it was  covered with manuscript, very closely and  laboriously written; but so plainly, that as I looked along the lines, I thought I saw  some allusion to King Charles the First&#x27;s head again, in one or two places. &#x27;There&#x27;s plenty of string,&#x27; said Mr. Dick, &#x27;and when it flies high, it takes the facts a long way.   That&#x27;s my manner of  diffusing &#x27;em. I don&#x27;t  know where they may come down.  It&#x27;s according to circumstances, and the wind, and so forth; but I take my chance of that.&#x27; His face was  so very mild  and pleasant, and  had something so  reverend in it, though it was  hale and hearty,  that I was  not sure but  that he was  having a good-humoured jest with  me.  So I  laughed, and he  laughed, and we  parted the best friends possible. &#x27;Well, child,&#x27; said  my aunt, when  I went downstairs.   &#x27;And what of  Mr. Dick, this morning?&#x27; I  informed her  that he  sent his  compliments, and  was getting  on very  well indeed. &#x27;What do you think of him?&#x27; said my aunt. I had some shadowy idea of endeavouring to evade the question, by replying  that I thought him a very nice gentleman; but  my aunt was not to be so put  off, for she laid her work down in her lap, and said, folding her hands upon it: &#x27;Come!  Your  sister Betsey  Trotwood would  have told  me what  she thought  of anyone, directly.  Be as like your sister as you can, and speak out!&#x27; &#x27;Is he - is Mr. Dick  - I ask because I don&#x27;t  know, aunt - is he at  all out of his mind, then?&#x27; I stammered; for I felt I was on dangerous ground. &#x27;Not a morsel,&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;Oh, indeed!&#x27; I observed faintly. &#x27;If there is anything in the world,&#x27; said my aunt, with great decision and force of manner, &#x27;that Mr. Dick is not, it&#x27;s that.&#x27; I had nothing better to offer, than another timid, &#x27;Oh, indeed!&#x27; &#x27;He has been CALLED mad,&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;I have a selfish pleasure in saying he has been called  mad, or I  should not have  had the benefit  of his society and advice for these last ten years and  upwards - in fact, ever since your  sister, Betsey Trotwood, disappointed me.&#x27; &#x27;So long as that?&#x27; I said. &#x27;And nice people they  were, who had the  audacity to call him  mad,&#x27; pursued my aunt.  &#x27;Mr. Dick is a sort of distant connexion of mine - it doesn&#x27;t matter how; I needn&#x27;t enter into that.  If it hadn&#x27;t been for me, his own brother would have shut him up for life. That&#x27;s all.&#x27; I am afraid it was hypocritical in me, but seeing that my aunt felt strongly  on the subject, I tried to look as if I felt strongly too. &#x27;A proud fool!&#x27;  said my  aunt.  &#x27;Because  his brother  was a  little  eccentric though he is not  half so eccentric as  a good many people  - he didn&#x27;t like  to have him visible  about his  house, and  sent him  away to  some private  asylum place: though he had been left to his particular care by their deceased  father, who thought him almost a natural.  And a wise man he must have been to think so! Mad himself, no doubt.&#x27; Again, as my aunt looked quite convinced, I endeavoured to look quite  convinced also. &#x27;So  I stepped  in,&#x27; said  my aunt,   &#x27;and made  him an  offer.  I  said,  &quot;Your brother&#x27;s sane - a great deal more sane than you are, or ever will be, it is  to be hoped.  Let him have his little income, and come and live with me.  I am  not afraid of him, I  am not proud, I  am ready to take  care of him, and  shall not ill-treat him  as some  people (besides  the asylum-folks)  have done.&quot;  After a good deal of squabbling,&#x27; said  my aunt, &#x27;I got him;  and he has been here  ever since.  He is the most friendly  and amenable creature in existence; and  as for advice! - But nobody knows what that man&#x27;s mind is, except myself.&#x27; My aunt smoothed her  dress and shook her  head, as if she  smoothed defiance of the whole world out of the one, and shook it out of the other. &#x27;He had a favourite  sister,&#x27; said my aunt,  &#x27;a good creature, and  very kind to him.  But she did what they all do - took a husband. And HE did what they all do - made her wretched.  It  had such an effect upon  the mind of Mr. Dick  (that&#x27;s not madness, I hope!) that, combined with his fear of his brother, and his sense of his unkindness, it threw  him into a fever.  That  was before he came to  me, but the recollection of it is oppressive  to him even now.  Did he say  anything to you about King Charles the First, child?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, aunt.&#x27; &#x27;Ah!&#x27; said my aunt, rubbing her nose as if she were a little vexed. &#x27;That&#x27;s  his allegorical  way  of  expressing  it.   He  connects  his  illness  with   great disturbance and agitation, naturally, and  that&#x27;s the figure, or the  simile, or whatever it&#x27;s  called, which  he chooses  to use.   And why  shouldn&#x27;t he, if he thinks proper!&#x27; I said: &#x27;Certainly, aunt.&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s not a business-like way of speaking,&#x27; said my aunt, &#x27;nor a worldly way.  I am aware of that; and that&#x27;s the reason why I insist upon it, that there  shan&#x27;t be a word about it in his Memorial.&#x27; &#x27;Is it a Memorial about his own history that he is writing, aunt?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, child,&#x27; said my  aunt, rubbing her nose  again.  &#x27;He is memorializing  the Lord Chancellor, or  the Lord Somebody  or other -  one of those  people, at all events, who are paid to be memorialized - about his affairs.  I suppose it  will go  in, one  of these  days. He  hasn&#x27;t been  able to  draw it  up yet,  without introducing that mode of expressing himself; but it don&#x27;t signify; it keeps  him employed.&#x27; In fact, I found out afterwards that Mr. Dick had been for upwards of ten  years endeavouring to keep King Charles the First out of the Memorial; but he had been constantly getting into it, and was there now. &#x27;I  say again,&#x27;  said my  aunt, &#x27;nobody  knows what  that man&#x27;s  mind is  except myself; and he&#x27;s the  most amenable and friendly  creature in existence.  If  he likes to fly a kite  sometimes, what of that! Franklin  used to fly a kite.   He was a Quaker,  or something of  that sort, if  I am not  mistaken.  And a Quaker flying a kite is a much more ridiculous object than anybody else.&#x27; If I could  have supposed that  my aunt had  recounted these particulars  for my especial behoof, and  as a piece  of confidence in  me, I should  have felt very much distinguished, and should have augured  favourably from such a mark of  her good opinion.   But I  could hardly  help observing  that she  had launched into them, chiefly because  the question was  raised in her  own mind, and  with very little reference to me, though she had addressed herself to me in the absence of anybody else. At the same  time, I must  say that the  generosity of her  championship of poor harmless Mr. Dick, not only inspired my young breast with some selfish hope  for myself, but warmed it unselfishly towards  her.  I believe that I began  to know that there was something about my aunt, notwithstanding her many  eccentricities and odd humours, to  be honoured and trusted  in.  Though she was  just as sharp that day as  on the day  before, and was  in and out  about the donkeys  just as often, and was thrown into a tremendous state of indignation, when a young  man, going by, ogled Janet  at a window (which  was one of the  gravest misdemeanours that could be committed against my aunt&#x27;s dignity), she seemed to me to  command more of my respect, if not less of my fear. The anxiety  I underwent,  in the  interval which  necessarily elapsed  before a reply could be received to her letter to Mr. Murdstone, was extreme; but I  made an endeavour to suppress it, and to be  as agreeable as I could in a quiet  way, both to my aunt and  Mr. Dick. The latter and  I would have gone out  to fly the great  kite;  but that  I  had still  no  other clothes  than  the anything  but ornamental garments with which I had been decorated on the first day, and  which confined me to the house,  except for an hour after  dark, when my aunt, for  my health&#x27;s sake, paraded me up and down on the cliff outside, before going to bed. At length  the reply  from Mr.  Murdstone came,  and my  aunt informed me, to my infinite terror, that he was coming to speak to her herself on the next day.  On the next day,  still bundled up  in my curious  habiliments, I sat  counting the time, flushed  and heated  by the  conflict of  sinking hopes  and rising  fears within me; and  waiting to be  startled by the  sight of the  gloomy face, whose non-arrival startled me every minute. MY aunt  was a  little more  imperious and  stern than  usual, but I observed no other token of her preparing herself  to receive the visitor so much  dreaded by me.  She  sat at  work in  the window,  and I  sat by,  with my thoughts running astray on all  possible and impossible  results of Mr.  Murdstone&#x27;s visit, until pretty late in the afternoon.   Our dinner had been indefinitely  postponed; but it was growing so late,  that my aunt had ordered  it to be got ready,  when she gave a sudden alarm of donkeys, and to my consternation and amazement, I  beheld Miss Murdstone,  on a  side-saddle, ride  deliberately over  the sacred piece of green, and stop in front of the house, looking about her. &#x27;Go along with you!&#x27; cried my aunt, shaking her head and her fist at the window. &#x27;You have no business there.   How dare you trespass?   Go along!  Oh! you  bold faced thing!&#x27; MY aunt  was so  exasperated by  the coolness  with which  Miss Murdstone looked about her, that I really believe  she was motionless, and unable for  the moment to dart out according to custom.  I seized the opportunity to inform her who  it was; and that  the gentleman now  coming near the  offender (for the  way up was very steep, and he had dropped behind), was Mr. Murdstone himself. &#x27;I  don&#x27;t  care  who  it  is!&#x27;  cried  my  aunt,  still  shaking  her  head  and gesticulating anything but welcome from the bow-window.  &#x27;I won&#x27;t be  trespassed upon.  I won&#x27;t allow it.  Go away!  Janet, turn him round.  Lead him off!&#x27; and I saw, from behind my  aunt, a sort of  hurried battle-piece, in which  the donkey stood resisting everybody, with all his four legs planted different ways,  while Janet tried to pull him round by the bridle, Mr. Murdstone tried to lead him on, Miss Murdstone struck at Janet with a parasol, and several boys, who had come to see the engagement, shouted vigorously.   But my aunt, suddenly descrying  among them the young malefactor who was the donkey&#x27;s guardian, and who was one of  the most inveterate offenders against her, though hardly in his teens, rushed out to the scene  of action,  pounced upon  him, captured  him, dragged  him, with  his jacket over his head, and his  heels grinding the ground, into the  garden, and, calling upon Janet to fetch the constables and justices, that he might be taken, tried, and  executed on  the spot,  held him  at bay  there.  This  part of  the business, however, did not  last long; for the  young rascal, being expert  at a variety of  feints and  dodges, of  which my  aunt had  no conception, soon went whooping away, leaving some deep impressions of  his nailed boots in the  flower beds, and taking his donkey in triumph with him. Miss Murdstone, during  the latter portion  of the contest,  had dismounted, and was now  waiting with  her brother  at the  bottom of  the steps,  until my aunt should be at leisure to receive them.  My aunt, a little ruffled by the  combat, marched past  them into  the house,  with great  dignity, and  took no notice of their presence, until they were announced by Janet. &#x27;Shall I go away, aunt?&#x27; I asked, trembling. &#x27;No, sir,&#x27;  said my  aunt.  &#x27;Certainly  not!&#x27;  With  which she  pushed me into a corner near her, and fenced Me in with a chair, as if it were a prison or a  bar of justice.  This position I continued to occupy during the whole interview, and from it I now saw Mr. and Miss Murdstone enter the room. &#x27;Oh!&#x27; said my  aunt, &#x27;I was  not aware at  first to whom  I had the  pleasure of objecting.   But I  don&#x27;t allow  anybody to  ride over  that turf.   I make   no exceptions.  I don&#x27;t allow anybody to do it.&#x27; &#x27;Your regulation is rather awkward to strangers,&#x27; said Miss Murdstone. &#x27;Is it!&#x27; said my aunt. Mr. Murdstone seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities, and interposing began: &#x27;Miss Trotwood!&#x27; &#x27;I beg  your pardon,&#x27;  observed my  aunt with  a keen  look.  &#x27;You  are the  Mr. Murdstone  who  married the  widow  of my  late  nephew, David  Copperfield,  of Blunderstone Rookery! - Though why Rookery, I don&#x27;t know!&#x27; &#x27;I am,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone. &#x27;You&#x27;ll excuse my saying,  sir,&#x27; returned my aunt,  &#x27;that I think it  would have been a much better and happier thing if you had left that poor child alone.&#x27; &#x27;I so far agree with what Miss Trotwood has remarked,&#x27; observed Miss  Murdstone, bridling, &#x27;that I  consider our lamented  Clara to have  been, in all  essential respects, a mere child.&#x27; &#x27;It is a comfort  to you and me,  ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said my aunt,  &#x27;who are getting on  in life, and are not  likely to be made  unhappy by our personal  attractions, that nobody can say the same of us.&#x27; &#x27;No doubt!&#x27; returned Miss Murdstone, though, I thought, not with a very ready or gracious assent.  &#x27;And it  certainly might have been,  as you say, a  better and happier thing for my  brother if he had  never entered into such  a marriage.  I have always been of that opinion.&#x27; &#x27;I  have no  doubt you  have,&#x27; said  my aunt.   &#x27;Janet,&#x27; ringing  the bell,  &#x27;my compliments to Mr. Dick, and beg him to come down.&#x27; Until he came, my  aunt sat perfectly upright  and stiff, frowning at  the wall. When he came, my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction. &#x27;Mr. Dick.  An old and intimate friend.  On whose judgement,&#x27; said my aunt, with emphasis,  as an  admonition to  Mr. Dick,  who was  biting his  forefinger  and looking rather foolish, &#x27;I rely.&#x27; Mr. Dick took  his finger out  of his mouth,  on this hint,  and stood among the group, with a grave and attentive expression of face. My aunt inclined her head to Mr. Murdstone, who went on: &#x27;Miss Trotwood: on the receipt of your letter, I considered it an act of greater justice to myself, and perhaps of more respect to you-&#x27; &#x27;Thank you,&#x27; said my aunt, still eyeing him keenly.  &#x27;You needn&#x27;t mind me.&#x27; &#x27;To  answer  it  in  person,  however  inconvenient  the  journey,&#x27;  pursued Mr. Murdstone, &#x27;rather than by letter.  This  unhappy boy who has run away  from his friends and his occupation -&#x27; &#x27;And whose appearance,&#x27; interposed his sister, directing general attention to me in my indefinable costume, &#x27;is perfectly scandalous and disgraceful.&#x27; &#x27;Jane Murdstone,&#x27; said her brother, &#x27;have the goodness not to interrupt me. This unhappy boy, Miss Trotwood, has been  the occasion of much domestic trouble  and uneasiness; both during the lifetime of my late dear wife, and since.  He has  a sullen,  rebellious  spirit;  a violent  temper;  and  an untoward,  intractable disposition.  Both my sister and  myself have endeavoured to correct  his vices, but ineffectually.  And I have  felt - we both have  felt, I may say; my  sister being fully in my  confidence - that it  is right you should  receive this grave and dispassionate assurance from our lips.&#x27; &#x27;It can hardly be  necessary for me to  confirm anything stated by  my brother,&#x27; said Miss Murdstone; &#x27;but I beg to observe, that, of all the boys in the  world, I believe this is the worst boy.&#x27; &#x27;Strong!&#x27; said my aunt, shortly. &#x27;But not at all too strong for the facts,&#x27; returned Miss Murdstone. &#x27;Ha!&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;Well, sir?&#x27; &#x27;I have my own  opinions,&#x27; resumed Mr. Murdstone,  whose face darkened more  and more, the more he and my aunt observed each other, which they did very narrowly, &#x27;as to  the best  mode of  bringing him  up; they  are founded,  in part,  on my knowledge of him, and in part on my knowledge of my own means and resources.   I am responsible for  them to myself,  I act upon  them, and I  say no more  about them.  It is enough that I place this  boy under the eye of a friend of  my own, in a respectable business; that it does  not please him; that he runs away  from it; makes himself a common vagabond about the country; and comes here, in  rags, to appeal  to you,  Miss Trotwood.   I wish  to set  before you, honourably, the exact consequences - so far as they  are within my knowledge - of your  abetting him in this appeal.&#x27; &#x27;But about the respectable business first,&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;If he had been  your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?&#x27; &#x27;If he had  been my brother&#x27;s  own boy,&#x27; returned  Miss Murdstone, striking  in, &#x27;his character, I trust, would have been altogether different.&#x27; &#x27;Or if the poor child, his mother, had been alive, he would still have gone into the respectable business, would he?&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;I believe,&#x27; said Mr.  Murdstone, with an inclination  of his head, &#x27;that  Clara would  have disputed  nothing which  myself and  my sister  Jane Murdstone  were agreed was for the best.&#x27; Miss Murdstone confirmed this with an audible murmur. &#x27;Humph!&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;Unfortunate baby!&#x27; Mr. Dick,  who had  been rattling  his money  all this  time, was rattling it so loudly now,  that my  aunt felt  it necessary  to check  him with a look, before saying: &#x27;The poor child&#x27;s annuity died with her?&#x27; &#x27;Died with her,&#x27; replied Mr. Murdstone. &#x27;And there was no settlement of the little property - the house and garden - the what&#x27;s-its-name Rookery without any rooks in it - upon her boy?&#x27; &#x27;It had been left to her, unconditionally, by her first husband,&#x27; Mr.  Murdstone began, when my aunt caught him up with the greatest irascibility and impatience. &#x27;Good Lord, man, there&#x27;s no occasion to say that.  Left to her  unconditionally! I think I see David Copperfield looking forward to any condition of any sort  or kind, though it stared  him point-blank in the  face!  Of course it  was left to her unconditionally.   But when  she married  again -  when she  took that  most disastrous step of marrying you, in short,&#x27; said my aunt, &#x27;to be plain - did  no one put in a word for the boy at that time?&#x27; &#x27;My late wife loved her second husband, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said Mr. Murdstone, &#x27;and trusted implicitly in him.&#x27; &#x27;Your  late wife,  sir, was  a most  unworldly, most  unhappy, most  unfortunate baby,&#x27; returned my  aunt, shaking her  head at him.  &#x27;That&#x27;s what she  was.  And now, what have you got to say next?&#x27; &#x27;Merely this, Miss Trotwood,&#x27; he returned.  &#x27;I  am here to take David back -  to take him back unconditionally, to dispose of him as I think proper, and to  deal with him  as I  think right.   I am  not here  to make  any promise, or give any pledge to anybody.  You may possibly have some idea, Miss Trotwood, of  abetting him in his  running away, and  in his complaints  to you.  Your  manner, which I must say does not seem intended to propitiate, induces me to think it  possible. Now I must caution you that if you abet him once, you abet him for good and all; if you step  in between him  and me, now,  you must step  in, Miss Trotwood, for ever.  I cannot trifle, or be trifled  with.  I am here, for the first  and last time, to take him away.  Is he ready to  go?  If he is not - and you tell  me he is not;  on any  pretence; it  is indifferent  to me  what -  my doors  are shut against him henceforth, and yours, I take it for granted, are open to him.&#x27; To  this address,  my aunt  had listened  with the  closest attention,   sitting perfectly upright, with her hands folded on one knee, and looking grimly on  the speaker.   When he  had finished,  she turned  her eyes  so as  to command  Miss Murdstone, without otherwise disturbing her attitude, and said: &#x27;Well, ma&#x27;am, have YOU got anything to remark?&#x27; &#x27;Indeed, Miss Trotwood,&#x27; said Miss Murdstone, &#x27;all that I could say has been  so well said by my brother, and all that I know to be the fact has been so  plainly stated by him, that I have nothing to add except my thanks for your  politeness. For your very great politeness, I  am sure,&#x27; said Miss Murdstone; with  an irony which no more affected my aunt, than it discomposed the cannon I had slept by at Chatham. &#x27;And what does the boy say?&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;Are you ready to go, David?&#x27; I answered no, and entreated her not to let me go.  I said that neither Mr.  nor Miss Murdstone had ever liked  me, or had ever been  kind to me.  That they  had made my mama, who always loved me  dearly, unhappy about me, and that I  knew it well, and that Peggotty knew it.  I  said that I had been more miserable  than I thought anybody could believe, who only knew how young I was.  And I begged  and prayed my aunt - I forget in  what terms now, but I remember that  they affected me very much then - to befriend and protect me, for my father&#x27;s sake. &#x27;Mr. Dick,&#x27; said my aunt, &#x27;what shall I do with this child?&#x27; Mr. Dick considered, hesitated, brightened, and rejoined, &#x27;Have him measured for a suit of clothes directly.&#x27; &#x27;Mr. Dick,&#x27; said my aunt triumphantly, &#x27;give me your hand, for your common sense is invaluable.&#x27;  Having shaken it  with great cordiality, she pulled  me towards her and said to Mr. Murdstone: &#x27;You can go when you  like; I&#x27;ll take my chance  with the boy.  If he&#x27;s  all you say he is,  at least I  can do as  much for him  then, as you  have done.  But I don&#x27;t believe a word of it.&#x27; &#x27;Miss Trotwood,&#x27; rejoined  Mr. Murdstone, shrugging  his shoulders, as  he rose, &#x27;if you were a gentleman -&#x27; &#x27;Bah!  Stuff and nonsense!&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t talk to me!&#x27; &#x27;How  exquisitely  polite!&#x27;  exclaimed  Miss  Murdstone,  rising. &#x27;Overpowering, really!&#x27; &#x27;Do you think I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; said my aunt, turning a deaf ear to the sister, and continuing to address the  brother, and to shake  her head at him  with infinite expression, &#x27;what kind of life you must have led that poor, unhappy, misdirected baby?  Do you think I  don&#x27;t know what a woeful  day it was for the  soft little creature when you first came in her way - smirking and making great eyes at her, I&#x27;ll be bound, as if you couldn&#x27;t say boh! to a goose!&#x27; &#x27;I never heard anything so elegant!&#x27; said Miss Murdstone. &#x27;Do you think I can&#x27;t understand you as  well as if I had seen you,&#x27; pursued  my aunt, &#x27;now that I DO see and hear you - which, I tell you candidly, is  anything but  a pleasure  to me?   Oh yes,  bless us!  who so  smooth and  silky as   Mr. Murdstone at first!  The poor, benighted innocent had never seen such a man.  He was made of sweetness.  He worshipped her.  He doted on her boy - tenderly doted on him!  He was to be another father to him, and they were all to live  together in a  garden of  roses, weren&#x27;t  they?  Ugh!   Get along  with you, do!&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;I never heard anything like this person in my life!&#x27; exclaimed Miss Murdstone. &#x27;And when  you had  made sure  of the  poor little  fool,&#x27; said  my aunt  - &#x27;God forgive me that I should call her so, and she gone where YOU won&#x27;t go in a hurry - because you had not done wrong enough to her and hers, you must begin to train her, must you? begin to break her, like a poor caged bird, and wear her  deluded life away, in teaching her to sing YOUR notes?&#x27; &#x27;This is  either insanity  or intoxication,&#x27;  said Miss  Murdstone, in a perfect agony  at not  being able  to turn  the current  of my  aunt&#x27;s address   towards herself; &#x27;and my suspicion is that it&#x27;s intoxication.&#x27; Miss Betsey, without taking the  least notice of the interruption,  continued to address herself to Mr. Murdstone as if there had been no such thing. &#x27;Mr. Murdstone,&#x27; she said, shaking her finger at him, &#x27;you were a tyrant to  the simple baby, and you broke  her heart.  She was a  loving baby - I know  that; I knew it,  years before  you ever  saw her  - and  through the  best part  of her weakness you  gave her  the wounds  she died  of.  There  is the  truth for your comfort, however you like it.  And you and your instruments may make the most of it.&#x27; &#x27;Allow me to inquire, Miss  Trotwood,&#x27; interposed Miss Murdstone, &#x27;whom  you are pleased  to call,  in a  choice of   words in  which I  am not  experienced,  my brother&#x27;s instruments?&#x27; &#x27;It was clear enough, as  I have told you, years  before YOU ever saw her  - and why, in the  mysterious dispensations of  Providence, you ever  did see her,  is more than  humanity can  comprehend -  it was  clear enough  that the  poor soft little thing  would marry  somebody, at  some time  or other;  but I did hope it wouldn&#x27;t  have been  as bad  as it   has turned  out.  That  was the  time,  Mr. Murdstone, when  she gave  birth to  her boy  here,&#x27; said  my aunt; &#x27;to the poor child you sometimes  tormented her through  afterwards, which is  a disagreeable remembrance  and makes  the sight  of him  odious now.   Aye, aye!  you  needn&#x27;t wince!&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;I know it&#x27;s true without that.&#x27; He had stood by the door, all this while, observant of her with a smile upon his face, though his black eyebrows were heavily contracted.  I remarked now,  that, though the smile was on his face still, his colour had gone in a moment, and  he seemed to breathe as if he had been running. &#x27;Good day, sir,&#x27;  said my aunt,  &#x27;and good-bye!  Good  day to you,  too, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said my aunt, turning suddenly upon his  sister.  &#x27;Let me see you ride a  donkey over my green again, and  as sure as you have  a head upon your shoulders,  I&#x27;ll knock your bonnet off, and tread upon it!&#x27; It would require a painter, and no common painter too, to depict my aunt&#x27;s  face as she delivered herself of this very unexpected sentiment, and Miss Murdstone&#x27;s face as she heard it.   But the manner of the  speech, no less than the  matter, was so fiery, that Miss Murdstone, without a word in answer, discreetly put  her arm through  her brother&#x27;s,  and walked  haughtily out  of the  cottage; my aunt remaining in the window looking after  them; prepared, I have no doubt,  in case of the donkey&#x27;s reappearance, to carry her threat into instant execution. No attempt  at defiance  being made,  however, her  face gradually  relaxed, and became so pleasant,  that I was  emboldened to kiss  and thank her;  which I did with great heartiness,  and with both  my arms clasped  round her neck.   I then shook hands  with Mr.  Dick, who  shook hands  with me  a great  many times, and hailed this happy close of the proceedings with repeated bursts of laughter. &#x27;You&#x27;ll consider yourself guardian, jointly  with me, of this child,  Mr. Dick,&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;I shall be delighted,&#x27; said Mr. Dick, &#x27;to be the guardian of David&#x27;s son.&#x27; &#x27;Very good,&#x27; returned my  aunt, &#x27;that&#x27;s settled.  I  have been thinking, do  you know, Mr. Dick, that I might call him Trotwood?&#x27; &#x27;Certainly, certainly.  Call him Trotwood, certainly,&#x27; said Mr. Dick.   &#x27;David&#x27;s son&#x27;s Trotwood.&#x27; &#x27;Trotwood Copperfield, you mean,&#x27; returned my aunt. &#x27;Yes, to be sure.  Yes.  Trotwood Copperfield,&#x27; said Mr. Dick, a little abashed. My aunt took so kindly to  the notion, that some ready-made clothes,  which were purchased for me that afternoon, were marked &#x27;Trotwood Copperfield&#x27;, in her  own handwriting, and  in indelible  marking-ink, before  I put  them on;  and it was settled that  all the  other clothes  which were  ordered to  be made  for me (a complete outfit was bespoke that afternoon) should be marked in the same way. Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me.   Now that the state of doubt was over, I felt, for many days, like one in a dream.  I never thought that I had a curious couple of guardians, in my aunt and Mr. Dick. I never thought of anything  about myself, distinctly.  The two  things clearest in my mind  were, that  a remoteness  had come  upon the  old Blunderstone  life which seemed to lie in the haze of an immeasurable distance; and that a  curtain had for  ever fallen  on my  life at  Murdstone and  Grinby&#x27;s.  No  one has ever raised  that  curtain since.   I  have lifted  it  for a  moment,  even in  this narrative, with  a reluctant  hand, and  dropped it  gladly.  The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much pain to me, with so much mental suffering  and want of hope, that I have never had  the courage even to examine how long I  was doomed to lead it.   Whether it lasted for  a year, or more,  or less, I do  not know.  I only know that it was, and  ceased to be; and that I have written,  and there I leave it. CHAPTER 15 I MAKE ANOTHER BEGINNING Mr. Dick and I soon became the  best of friends, and very often, when  his day&#x27;s work was done, went out together to  fly the great kite.  Every day of  his life he had  a long  sitting at  the Memorial,  which never  made the least progress, however hard he  laboured, for King  Charles the First  always strayed into  it, sooner or  later, and  then it  was thrown  aside, and  another one  begun.  The patience and hope with which  he bore these perpetual disappointments,  the mild perception he had that there was  something wrong about King Charles the  First, the feeble efforts he made to keep him out, and the certainty with which he came in, and tumbled  the Memorial out  of all shape,  made a deep  impression on me. What Mr. Dick supposed would come  of the Memorial, if it were  completed; where he thought it was to go, or what he  thought it was to do; he knew no more  than anybody else, I  believe.  Nor was  it at all  necessary that he  should trouble himself with such questions, for if anything were certain under the sun, it  was certain that the Memorial  never would be finished.   It was quite an  affecting sight, I used to think, to see him  with the kite when it was up a  great height in  the  air. What  he  had told  me,  in his  room,  about his  belief  in  its disseminating the statements pasted on it, which were nothing but old leaves  of abortive Memorials, might have been a fancy with him sometimes; but not when  he was out, looking up at the kite in  the sky, and feeling it pull and tug  at his hand.  He never looked so serene as he  did then.  I used to fancy, as I  sat by him of an  evening, on a  green slope, and  saw him watch  the kite high  in the quiet air, that it lifted his mind  out of its confusion, and bore it  (such was my boyish thought) into the skies.  As he wound the string in and it came  lower and lower down out of the beautiful light, until it fluttered to the ground, and lay there like a dead thing, he seemed  to wake gradually out of a dream; and  I remember to have seen him  take it up, and look  about him in a lost  way, as if they had both come down together, so that I pitied him with all my heart. While I advanced in friendship and intimacy with Mr. Dick, I did not go backward in the favour of his staunch friend,  my aunt.  She took so kindly to  me, that, in the course  of a few  weeks, she shortened  my adopted name  of Trotwood into Trot; and even encouraged me to hope, that if I went on as I had begun, I  might take equal rank in her affections with my sister Betsey Trotwood. &#x27;Trot,&#x27; said my aunt one evening, when the backgammon-board was placed as  usual for herself and Mr. Dick, &#x27;we must not forget your education.&#x27; This was my only subject of anxiety, and I felt quite delighted by her referring to it. &#x27;Should you like to go to school at Canterbury?&#x27; said my aunt. I replied that I should like it very much, as it was so near her. &#x27;Good,&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;Should you like to go tomorrow?&#x27; Being already no stranger to the general rapidity of my aunt&#x27;s evolutions, I was not surprised by the suddenness of the proposal, and said: &#x27;Yes.&#x27; &#x27;Good,&#x27; said  my aunt  again.  &#x27;Janet,  hire the  grey pony  and chaise tomorrow morning at ten o&#x27;clock, and pack up Master Trotwood&#x27;s clothes tonight.&#x27; I was greatly elated by these orders; but my heart smote me for my  selfishness, when  I witnessed  their effect  on Mr.  Dick, who  was so  low-spirited at  the prospect of  our separation,  and played  so ill  in consequence,  that my aunt, after giving him several admonitory raps on the knuckles with her dice-box, shut up the board, and declined to play  with him any more.  But, on hearing  from my aunt  that  I should  sometimes  come over  on  a Saturday,  and  that he  could sometimes come and see me on a Wednesday, he revived; and vowed to make  another kite for those occasions, of proportions greatly surpassing the present one.  In the morning he was downhearted again, and would have sustained himself by giving me all the money he had in his  possession, gold and silver too, if my aunt  had not interposed, and limited  the gift to five  shillings, which, at his  earnest petition, were afterwards increased to ten.   We parted at the garden-gate in  a most affectionate manner, and Mr. Dick did  not go into the house until my  aunt had driven me out of sight of it. My aunt, who was  perfectly indifferent to public  opinion, drove the grey  pony through  Dover  in  a masterly  manner;  sitting  high and  stiff  like  a state coachman, keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went, and making a point  of not letting him have his own way in any respect.  When we came into the  country road, she permitted him to relax a little, however; and looking at me down in  a valley of cushion by her side, asked me whether I was happy? &#x27;Very happy indeed, thank you, aunt,&#x27; I said. She was much gratified; and both her hands being occupied, patted me on the head with her whip. &#x27;Is it a large school, aunt?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;Why, I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;We are going to Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s first.&#x27; &#x27;Does he keep a school?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;No, Trot,&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;He keeps an office.&#x27; I asked for no more information about Mr. Wickfield, as she offered none, and we conversed  on other  subjects until  we came  to Canterbury,  where, as  it  was market-day, my aunt had a great  opportunity of insinuating the grey pony  among carts, baskets, vegetables,  and huckster&#x27;s goods.   The hair-breadth turns  and twists we made, drew down upon us a variety of speeches from the people standing about, which were not  always complimentary; but my  aunt drove on with  perfect indifference, and I dare say would have taken her own way with as much  coolness through an enemy&#x27;s country. At length we stopped before a very old house bulging out over the road; a  house with long low lattice-windows bulging  out still farther, and beams  with carved heads on the ends bulging out too, so that I fancied the whole house was leaning forward, trying to  see who was  passing on the  narrow pavement below.   It was quite spotless in its cleanliness.   The old-fashioned brass knocker on  the low arched door, ornamented with carved garlands of fruit and flowers, twinkled like a star; the two stone steps descending to the door were as white as if they  had been covered with fair linen; and  all the angles and corners, and  carvings and mouldings, and quaint little panes of glass, and quainter little windows, though as old as the hills, were as pure as any snow that ever fell upon the hills. When the  pony-chaise stopped  at the  door, and  my eyes  were intent  upon the house, I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor  (in a little round tower that formed one side of the house), and quickly  disappear. The  low arched  door then  opened, and  the face  came out.   It was  quite  as cadaverous as it had looked in the  window, though in the grain of it  there was that tinge of red which is sometimes  to be observed in the skins of  red-haired people.  It belonged to a red-haired person  - a youth of fifteen, as I  take it now, but looking  much older -  whose hair was  cropped as close  as the closest stubble; who had hardly any eyebrows, and no eyelashes, and eyes of a red-brown, so unsheltered and unshaded, that I remember wondering how he went to sleep.  He was high-shouldered and bony;  dressed in decent black,  with a white wisp  of a neckcloth; buttoned up to the throat; and had a long, lank, skeleton hand, which particularly attracted my attention, as he stood at the pony&#x27;s head, rubbing his chin with it, and looking up at us in the chaise. &#x27;Is Mr. Wickfield at home, Uriah Heep?&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s at home, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said Uriah Heep, &#x27;if you&#x27;ll please to walk  in there&#x27; - pointing with his long hand to the room he meant. We got  out; and  leaving him  to hold  the pony,  went into  a long low parlour looking towards the street,  from the window of  which I caught a  glimpse, as I went  in, of  Uriah Heep  breathing into  the pony&#x27;s  nostrils, and  immediately covering them with his hand, as if he were putting some spell upon him. Opposite to the tall old chimney-piece were  two portraits: one of a gentleman  with grey hair (though not by  any means an old  man) and black eyebrows,  who was looking over some papers tied together with red tape; the other, of a lady, with a  very placid and sweet expression of face, who was looking at me. I believe I was turning about in search of Uriah&#x27;s picture, when, a door at  the farther end of the room opening, a gentleman entered, at sight of whom I  turned to the first-mentioned portrait again, to  make quite sure that it had  not come out of its frame.  But it was stationary; and as the gentleman advanced into the light, I  saw that  he was  some years  older than  when he  had had his picture painted. &#x27;Miss Betsey Trotwood,&#x27; said the gentleman, &#x27;pray walk in.  I was engaged for  a moment, but you&#x27;ll excuse my being busy.  You know my motive.  I have but one in life.&#x27; Miss Betsey thanked him,  and we went into  his room, which was  furnished as an office, with books, papers, tin boxes,  and so forth.  It looked into  a garden, and had an  iron safe let  into the wall;  so immediately over  the mantelshelf, that I wondered, as I sat down, how the sweeps got round it when they swept  the chimney. &#x27;Well, Miss Trotwood,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield; for I soon found that it was he,  and that he was  a lawyer, and  steward of the  estates of a  rich gentleman of  the county; &#x27;what wind blows you here?  Not an ill wind, I hope?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; replied my aunt.  &#x27;I have not come for any law.&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s right, ma&#x27;am,&#x27;  said Mr. Wickfield.   &#x27;You had better  come for anything else.&#x27; His hair was  quite white now, though  his eyebrows were still  black. He had a very agreeable  face, and, I thought,  was handsome.  There was  a certain richness in his complexion, which  I had been long accustomed,  under Peggotty&#x27;s tuition, to connect with port wine; and  I fancied it was in his voice  too, and referred his growing corpulency to the same cause.  He was very cleanly dressed, in a blue coat,  striped waistcoat, and nankeen  trousers; and his fine  frilled shirt  and  cambric neckcloth  looked  unusually soft  and  white, reminding  my strolling fancy (I call to mind) of the plumage on the breast of a swan. &#x27;This is my nephew,&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;Wasn&#x27;t aware you had one, Miss Trotwood,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;My grand-nephew, that is to say,&#x27; observed my aunt. &#x27;Wasn&#x27;t aware you had a grand-nephew, I give you my word,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;I have adopted him,&#x27; said my aunt, with a wave of her hand, importing that  his knowledge and his ignorance were all one  to her, &#x27;and I have brought him  here, to put to a school where he may be thoroughly well taught, and well treated. Now tell me where that school is, and what it is, and all about it.&#x27; &#x27;Before I can advise you properly,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield - &#x27;the old question,  you know.  What&#x27;s your motive in this?&#x27; &#x27;Deuce take  the man!&#x27;  exclaimed my  aunt.  &#x27;Always  fishing for  motives, when they&#x27;re on the surface!  Why, to make the child happy and useful.&#x27; &#x27;It must be a mixed motive, I  think,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his head  and smiling incredulously. &#x27;A mixed fiddlestick,&#x27; returned my aunt.  &#x27;You claim to have one plain motive in all you do  yourself.  You don&#x27;t  suppose, I hope,  that you are  the only plain dealer in the world?&#x27; &#x27;Ay, but I have only one  motive in life, Miss Trotwood,&#x27; he  rejoined, smiling. &#x27;Other  people have  dozens, scores,  hundreds. I  have only  one.  There&#x27;s  the difference.  However, that&#x27;s  beside the question.   The best school?   Whatever the motive, you want the best?&#x27; My aunt nodded assent. &#x27;At the best  we have,&#x27; said  Mr. Wickfield, considering,  &#x27;your nephew couldn&#x27;t board just now.&#x27; &#x27;But he could board somewhere else, I suppose?&#x27; suggested my aunt. Mr. Wickfield thought I could.  After  a little discussion, he proposed to  take my aunt to  the school, that  she might see  it and judge  for herself; also, to take her, with the same object, to two or three houses where he thought I  could be  boarded.   My aunt  embracing  the proposal,  we  were all  three  going out together, when he stopped and said: &#x27;Our little friend here  might have some motive,  perhaps, for objecting to  the arrangements.  I think we had better leave him behind?&#x27; My aunt seemed disposed to contest the point; but to facilitate matters I said I would gladly remain behind, if  they pleased; and returned into  Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s office, where  I sat  down again,  in the  chair I  had first occupied, to await their return. It so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage, which ended in the little circular room where I had seen Uriah Heep&#x27;s pale face looking out of  the window.  Uriah, having taken the pony to a neighbouring stable, was at work at a desk in this room, which had a brass frame on the top to hang paper upon, and on which the writing he was making a copy of was then hanging.  Though his face was towards me,  I thought,  for some  time, the  writing being  between us, that he could  not  see  me;  but  looking  that  way  more  attentively,  it  made   me uncomfortable to observe that, every now and then, his sleepless eyes would come below the writing, like two red suns, and stealthily stare at me for I dare  say a whole minute  at a time,  during which his  pen went, or  pretended to go,  as cleverly as ever.   I made several  attempts to get  out of their  way - such as standing on a chair to look at a  map on the other side of the room,  and poring over the  columns of  a Kentish  newspaper -  but they  always attracted me back again; and  whenever I  looked towards  those two  red suns,  I was sure to find them, either just rising or just setting. At length,  much to  my relief,  my aunt  and Mr.  Wickfield came  back, after a pretty long absence.  They  were not so successful  as I could have  wished; for though the advantages of the school were undeniable, my aunt had not approved of any of the boarding-houses proposed for me. &#x27;It&#x27;s very unfortunate,&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what to do, Trot.&#x27; &#x27;It does happen unfortunately,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield.  &#x27;But I&#x27;ll tell you what you can do, Miss Trotwood.&#x27; &#x27;What&#x27;s that?&#x27; inquired my aunt. &#x27;Leave  your nephew  here, for  the present.   He&#x27;s a  quiet fellow.   He  won&#x27;t disturb me at all.   It&#x27;s a capital house  for study.  As quiet  as a monastery, and almost as roomy.  Leave him here.&#x27; My aunt evidently liked the offer, though she was delicate of accepting it.   So did I. &#x27;Come, Miss Trotwood,&#x27; said Mr.  Wickfield.  &#x27;This is the way out of  the difficulty.  It&#x27;s only a temporary arrangement, you know.  If it don&#x27;t act well, or don&#x27;t  quite accord  with our  mutual convenience,  he can  easily go  to the right-about.   There will  be time  to find  some better  place for  him in  the meanwhile.  You had better determine to leave him here for the present!&#x27; &#x27;I am very much obliged to you,&#x27; said my aunt; &#x27;and so is he, I see; but -&#x27; &#x27;Come! I know what you mean,&#x27; cried Mr. Wickfield.  &#x27;You shall not be  oppressed by the receipt of favours, Miss Trotwood.  You may pay for him, if you like.  We won&#x27;t be hard about terms, but you shall pay if you will.&#x27; &#x27;On  that understanding,&#x27;  said my  aunt, &#x27;though  it doesn&#x27;t  lessen the   real obligation, I shall be very glad to leave him.&#x27; &#x27;Then come and see my little housekeeper,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield. We accordingly went  up a wonderful  old staircase; with  a balustrade so  broad that we might have gone up that, almost as easily; and into a shady old  drawing room, lighted by  some three or  four of the  quaint windows I  had looked up at from the street: which had  old oak seats in them,  that seemed to have come  of the same trees as the shining oak floor, and the great beams in the ceiling.  It was a prettily furnished room, with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green, and  some flowers.   It seemed  to be  all old  nooks and corners; and in every  nook  and corner  there  was some  queer  little table,  or  cupboard, or bookcase, or seat, or something or other, that made me think there was not  such another good corner in the  room; until I looked at  the next one, and found  it equal to it, if not better.  On everything there was the same air of  retirement and cleanliness that marked the house outside. Mr. Wickfield tapped at a door in a  corner of the panelled wall, and a girl  of about  my  own  age came  quickly  out  and kissed  him.   On  her face,  I  saw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose picture had looked at me  downstairs.  It  seemed to  my imagination  as if  the portrait had grown womanly, and the original remained a child.  Although her face was quite  bright and happy, there  was a tranquillity  about it, and  about her -  a quiet, good, calm spirit - that I never have forgotten; that I shall never forget.  This  was his little housekeeper,  his daughter Agnes,  Mr. Wickfield said.   When I heard how he said it, and saw how he  held her hand, I guessed what the one  motive of his life was. She had a  little basket-trifle hanging  at her side,  with keys in  it; and she looked as staid and as discreet a housekeeper as the old house could have.   She listened to her father as he told  her about me, with a pleasant face;  and when he had  concluded, proposed  to my  aunt that  we should  go upstairs and see my room.  We all went together, she before us: and a glorious old room it was, with more oak beams, and diamond panes; and the broad balustrade going all the way up to it. I cannot call to mind where or when, in my childhood, I had seen a stained glass window in a church.  Nor do I recollect its subject. But I know that when I  saw her turn round, in the grave light of the old staircase, and wait for us, above, I thought of that window; and I associated something of its tranquil  brightness with Agnes Wickfield ever afterwards. My aunt was as happy as I was, in the arrangement made for me; and we went  down to the drawing-room again, well pleased and gratified. As she would not hear  of staying to dinner, lest she should by any chance fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before  dark; and as  I apprehend Mr.  Wickfield knew her  too well to argue any point with her; some lunch was provided for her there, and Agnes  went back to her governess, and Mr. Wickfield to his office.  So we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint. She told me that everything would be arranged for me by Mr. Wickfield, and  that I should want for nothing, and gave me the kindest words and the best advice. &#x27;Trot,&#x27; said my  aunt in conclusion,  &#x27;be a credit  to yourself, to  me, and Mr. Dick, and Heaven be with you!&#x27; I was greatly overcome, and could only  thank her, again and again, and send  my love to Mr. Dick. &#x27;Never,&#x27; said my  aunt, &#x27;be mean  in anything; never  be false; never  be cruel. Avoid those three vices, Trot, and I can always be hopeful of you.&#x27; I promised, as well as  I could, that I would  not abuse her kindness or  forget her admonition. &#x27;The pony&#x27;s at the door,&#x27;  said my aunt, &#x27;and I  am off! Stay here.&#x27; With  these words she embraced me hastily, and went out of the room, shutting the door after her.  At first I was startled by so abrupt a departure, and almost feared I  had displeased her; but when  I looked into the  street, and saw how  dejectedly she got into the chaise, and drove away without looking up, I understood her  better and did not do her that injustice. By five o&#x27;clock,  which was Mr.  Wickfield&#x27;s dinner-hour, I  had mustered up  my spirits again, and was ready for my knife and fork. The cloth was only laid  for us two; but Agnes was waiting in the drawing-room before dinner, went down  with her father, and sat opposite to him  at table.  I doubted whether he could  have dined without her. We did not  stay there, after  dinner, but came  upstairs into the  drawing-room again: in  one snug  corner of  which, Agnes  set glasses  for her father, and a decanter of port wine.  I thought he would have missed its usual flavour, if  it had been put there for him by any other hands. There he sat,  taking his wine,  and taking a  good deal of  it, for two  hours; while Agnes played on the piano, worked, and talked to him and me.  He was,  for the most part, gay and cheerful with  us; but sometimes his eyes rested on  her, and he fell  into a brooding  state, and was  silent.  She always  observed this quickly, I thought, and  always roused him with  a question or caress.   Then he came out of his meditation, and drank more wine. Agnes made the tea, and presided over it; and the time passed away after it,  as after dinner, until she went  to bed; when her father  took her in his arms  and kissed her, and, she being gone, ordered candles in his office.  Then I went  to bed too. But in the course of  the evening I had rambled  down to the door, and  a little way along the street, that I might have another peep at the old houses, and  the grey  Cathedral; and  might think  of my  coming through  that old  city on   my journey, and of my passing the very house I lived in, without knowing it.  As  I came back, I saw Uriah Heep shutting up the office; and feeling friendly towards everybody, went in and spoke to him, and at parting, gave him my hand.  But  oh, what a clammy hand his was! as ghostly  to the touch as to the sight!  I  rubbed mine afterwards, to warm it, AND TO RUB HIS OFF. It was such an uncomfortable  hand, that, when I went  to my room, it was  still cold and wet upon my memory.  Leaning  out of the window, and seeing one  of the faces on the beam-ends looking at me  sideways, I fancied it was Uriah Heep  got up there somehow, and shut him out in a hurry. CHAPTER 16 I AM A NEW BOY IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE Next  morning,  after  breakfast,  I entered  on  school  life  again.  I  went, accompanied  by Mr.  Wickfield, to  the scene  of my  future studies  - a  grave building in  a courtyard,  with a  learned air  about it  that seemed  very well suited to the stray rooks and  jackdaws who came down from the  Cathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the grass-plot - and was introduced to my  new master, Doctor Strong. Doctor Strong looked almost as rusty, to my thinking, as the tall iron rails and gates outside the house; and almost as  stiff and heavy as the great stone  urns that flanked them, and were set up, on the top of the red-brick wall, at regular distances all round the court, like sublimated skittles, for Time to play at. He was in his library (I mean Doctor Strong was), with his clothes not particularly well  brushed, and  his hair  not particularly  well combed;  his knee-   smalls unbraced; his  long black  gaiters unbuttoned;  and his  shoes yawning  like two caverns on the hearth-rug.  Turning upon  me a lustreless eye, that reminded  me of a long-forgotten blind old horse who once used to crop the grass, and  tumble over the graves, in Blunderstone churchyard, he said he was glad to see me:  and then he gave me his hand; which I didn&#x27;t know what to do with, as it did nothing for itself. But, sitting at work, not far from  Doctor Strong, was a very pretty young  lady whom he called Annie, and who was his  daughter, I supposed - who got me out  of my difficulty by kneeling down to  put Doctor Strong&#x27;s shoes on, and  button his gaiters, which  she did  with great  cheerfulness and  quickness.  When  she had finished, and we were going out to the schoolroom, I was much surprised to  hear Mr. Wickfield, in bidding her good morning, address her as &#x27;Mrs. Strong&#x27;; and  I was wondering  could she  be Doctor  Strong&#x27;s son&#x27;s  wife, or  could she be Mrs. Doctor Strong, when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously enlightened me. &#x27;By the  by, Wickfield,&#x27;  he said,  stopping in  a passage  with his  hand on my shoulder; &#x27;you have not found any suitable provision for my wife&#x27;s cousin yet?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield.  &#x27;No.  Not yet.&#x27; &#x27;I could wish it done as soon as it can be done, Wickfield,&#x27; said Doctor Strong, &#x27;for Jack Maldon is needy, and idle;  and of those two bad things, worse  things sometimes come.   What does  Doctor Watts  say,&#x27; he  added, looking  at me,  and moving his head to the time of his quotation, &#x27;&quot;Satan finds some mischief still, for idle hands to do.&quot;&#x27; &#x27;Egad, Doctor,&#x27; returned Mr. Wickfield, &#x27;if Doctor Watts knew mankind, he  might have written, with  as much truth,  &quot;Satan finds some  mischief still, for  busy hands to do.&quot; The busy people achieve their full share of mischief in the world, you may rely upon it. What have the people been about, who have been the busiest in getting money, and in getting power, this century or two?  No mischief?&#x27; &#x27;Jack Maldon will never be very  busy in getting either, I expect,&#x27;  said Doctor Strong, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. &#x27;Perhaps not,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield; &#x27;and you bring me back to the question,  with an apology  for digressing.   No, I  have not  been able  to dispose of Mr. Jack Maldon yet.  I believe,&#x27;  he said this with  some hesitation, &#x27;I penetrate  your motive, and it makes the thing more difficult.&#x27; &#x27;My motive,&#x27; returned Doctor Strong, &#x27;is  to make some suitable provision for  a cousin, and an old playfellow, of Annie&#x27;s.&#x27; &#x27;Yes, I know,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield; &#x27;at home or abroad.&#x27; &#x27;Aye!&#x27; replied the Doctor, apparently wondering why he emphasized those words so much.  &#x27;At home or abroad.&#x27; &#x27;Your own expression, you know,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield.  &#x27;Or abroad.&#x27; &#x27;Surely,&#x27; the Doctor answered.  &#x27;Surely.  One or other.&#x27; &#x27;One or other?  Have you no choice?&#x27; asked Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;No,&#x27; returned the Doctor. &#x27;No?&#x27; with astonishment. &#x27;Not the least.&#x27; &#x27;No motive,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield, &#x27;for meaning abroad, and not at home?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; returned the Doctor. &#x27;I am bound to believe you, and of course I do believe you,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;It might have simplified my office very much, if I had known it before.  But  I confess I entertained another impression.&#x27; Doctor  Strong regarded  him with  a puzzled  and doubting  look, which   almost immediately subsided into a smile that  gave me great encouragement; for it  was full of amiability and sweetness, and  there was a simplicity in it,  and indeed in his whole manner, when the studious, pondering frost upon it was got through, very attractive and  hopeful to a  young scholar like  me.  Repeating &#x27;no&#x27;,  and &#x27;not the least&#x27;, and other short  assurances to the same purport, Doctor  Strong jogged on before us,  at a queer, uneven  pace; and we followed:  Mr. Wickfield, looking grave, I observed, and shaking his head to himself, without knowing that I saw him. The schoolroom  was a  pretty large  hall, on  the quietest  side of  the house, confronted  by the  stately stare  of some  half-dozen of  the great  urns,  and commanding a peep of an old  secluded garden belonging to the Doctor,  where the peaches were ripening on the sunny  south wall.  There were two great  aloes, in tubs, on  the turf  outside the  windows; the  broad hard  leaves of which plant (looking as if they were made  of painted tin) have ever since,  by association, been symbolical to me of silence and retirement. About five-and-twenty boys were studiously engaged at  their books when  we went in,  but they rose  to give the Doctor good morning, and remained standing when they saw Mr. Wickfield and me. &#x27;A new boy, young gentlemen,&#x27; said the Doctor; &#x27;Trotwood Copperfield.&#x27; One Adams, who was the head-boy, then stepped out of his place and welcomed  me. He looked like a young clergyman, in  his white cravat, but he was very  affable and good-humoured; and he showed me  my place, and presented me to  the masters, in a gentlemanly way that would have put me at my ease, if anything could. It seemed to me so long, however, since I had been among such boys, or among any companions of my own age, except Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes, that I felt  as strange as ever  I have done  in my life.  I was so  conscious of having  passed through scenes of  which they could  have no knowledge,  and of having  acquired experiences foreign to my age, appearance, and condition as one of them, that  I half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy. I had become,  in the Murdstone  and Grinby time,  however short or  long it may have been, so unused to the sports and games of boys, that I knew I was  awkward and inexperienced  in the  commonest things  belonging to  them.  Whatever I had learnt, had so slipped away from me in  the sordid cares of my life from day  to night, that now, when I was examined about what I knew, I knew nothing, and  was put into the lowest form of the school.   But, troubled as I was, by my want  of boyish skill, and of book-learning too, I was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration, that, in what I did know, I was much farther removed  from my companions than in what I did  not.  My mind ran upon what they  would think, if they  knew of  my familiar  acquaintance with  the King&#x27;s  Bench Prison?  Was there anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with  the Micawber family - all  those pawnings, and sellings,  and suppers - in  spite of myself? Suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through Canterbury,  wayworn and ragged, and should find me out?   What would they say, who made so  light of money, if  they could  know how  I had  scraped my  halfpence together,  for the purchase of my daily  saveloy and beer, or  my slices of pudding?   How would it affect  them,  who were  so  innocent of  London  life, and  London  streets, to discover how knowing I was (and was ashamed to be) in some of the meanest phases of both?  All this ran in my head so much, on that first day at Doctor Strong&#x27;s, that I felt distrustful of my  slightest look and gesture; shrunk within  myself whensoever I was approached by one of my new schoolfellows; and hurried off  the minute  school was  over, afraid  of committing  myself in  my response  to  any friendly notice or advance. But  there was  such an  influence in  Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s  old house,  that when  I knocked  at it,  with my  new school-books  under my  arm, I  began to  feel  my uneasiness softening away.  As I went up  to my airy old room, the grave  shadow of the staircase seemed to fall upon  my doubts and fears, and to make  the past more indistinct.  I sat there, sturdily conning my books, until dinner-time  (we were out  of school  for good  at three);  and went  down, hopeful of becoming a passable sort of boy yet. Agnes was  in the  drawing-room, waiting  for her  father, who  was detained  by someone in his office.  She met me  with her pleasant smile, and asked me  how I liked the school.  I told her I should  like it very much, I hoped; but I  was a little strange to it at first. &#x27;You have never been to school,&#x27; I said, &#x27;have you?&#x27; &#x27;Oh yes!  Every day.&#x27; &#x27;Ah, but you mean here, at your own home?&#x27; &#x27;Papa couldn&#x27;t spare me to go anywhere else,&#x27; she answered, smiling and  shaking her head.  &#x27;His housekeeper must be in his house, you know.&#x27; &#x27;He is very fond of you, I am sure,&#x27; I said. She nodded &#x27;Yes,&#x27;  and went to  the door to  listen for his  coming up, that she might meet him on the stairs.  But, as he was not there, she came back again. &#x27;Mama has been dead ever since I was born,&#x27; she said, in her quiet way.  &#x27;I only know her picture, downstairs.  I saw you looking at it yesterday.  Did you think whose it was?&#x27; I told her yes, because it was so like herself. &#x27;Papa says so, too,&#x27; said Agnes, pleased.  &#x27;Hark!  That&#x27;s papa now!&#x27; Her bright calm face lighted  up with pleasure as she  went to meet him, and  as they came  in, hand  in hand.   He greeted  me cordially;  and told  me I should certainly be happy under Doctor Strong, who was one of the gentlest of men. &#x27;There may  be some,  perhaps -  I don&#x27;t  know that  there are  - who  abuse his kindness,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield.  &#x27;Never  be one of those, Trotwood,  in anything. He is the least  suspicious of mankind; and  whether that&#x27;s a merit,  or whether it&#x27;s a blemish, it deserves consideration in all dealings with the Doctor, great or small.&#x27; He spoke, I thought, as if he were weary, or dissatisfied with something; but  I did not pursue the question in my mind, for dinner was just then announced,  and we went down and took the same seats as before. We had scarcely done so, when Uriah Heep  put in his red head and his lank  hand at the door, and said: &#x27;Here&#x27;s Mr. Maldon begs the favour of a word, sir.&#x27; &#x27;I am but this moment quit of Mr. Maldon,&#x27; said his master. &#x27;Yes, sir,&#x27;  returned Uriah;  &#x27;but Mr.  Maldon has  come back,  and he  begs the favour of a word.&#x27; As he held the door open with his hand, Uriah looked at me, and looked at Agnes, and looked at the dishes, and looked  at the plates, and looked at every  object in  the room,  I thought,  - yet  seemed to  look at  nothing; he  made such  an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master. &#x27;I beg your pardon.  It&#x27;s only to say,  on reflection,&#x27; observed a voice behind  Uriah, as Uriah&#x27;s head was pushed away, and the speaker&#x27;s substituted - &#x27;pray excuse me for this intrusion - that as it seems I have no choice in the matter, the sooner I go abroad the better.  My cousin Annie did say, when we talked of it, that she liked to have her  friends within reach rather  than to have them  banished, and the old Doctor -&#x27; &#x27;Doctor Strong, was that?&#x27; Mr. Wickfield interposed, gravely. &#x27;Doctor Strong, of course,&#x27; returned the other; &#x27;I call him the old Doctor; it&#x27;s all the same, you know.&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; returned Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;Well, Doctor Strong,&#x27; said the other -  &#x27;Doctor Strong was of the same mind,  I believed.  But as it appears from the course you take with me he has changed his mind, why  there&#x27;s no  more to  be said,  except that  the sooner  I am off, the better.  Therefore, I thought  I&#x27;d come back and  say, that the sooner  I am off the  better.  When  a plunge  is to  be made  into the  water, it&#x27;s  of no   use lingering on the bank.&#x27; &#x27;There shall be as little lingering  as possible, in your case, Mr.  Maldon, you may depend upon it,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;Thank&#x27;ee,&#x27; said the other.  &#x27;Much obliged.   I don&#x27;t want to look a  gift-horse in the mouth,  which is not  a gracious thing  to do; otherwise,  I dare say, my cousin Annie could easily arrange it in her own way.  I suppose Annie would only have to say to the old Doctor -&#x27; &#x27;Meaning that Mrs. Strong would  only have to say to  her husband - do I  follow you?&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;Quite so,&#x27; returned the other, &#x27;- would only have to say, that she wanted  such and such a  thing to be  so and so;  and it would  be so and  so, as a matter of course.&#x27; &#x27;And why  as a  matter of  course, Mr.  Maldon?&#x27; asked  Mr. Wickfield,  sedately eating his dinner. &#x27;Why, because Annie&#x27;s a charming young girl, and the old Doctor - Doctor Strong, I mean - is not quite a charming young boy,&#x27; said Mr. Jack Maldon, laughing. &#x27;No offence to anybody, Mr. Wickfield. I only mean that I suppose some  compensation is fair and reasonable in that sort of marriage.&#x27; &#x27;Compensation to the lady, sir?&#x27; asked Mr. Wickfield gravely. &#x27;To the lady, sir,&#x27; Mr. Jack Maldon answered, laughing.  But appearing to remark that Mr. Wickfield went on with his dinner in the same sedate, immovable manner, and that there was no hope of making  him relax a muscle of his face, he  added: &#x27;However, I have  said what I  came to say,  and, with another  apology for this intrusion, I may take myself off.  Of course I shall observe your directions, in considering the matter as one to be arranged between you and me solely, and  not to be referred to, up at the Doctor&#x27;s.&#x27; &#x27;Have you dined?&#x27;  asked Mr. Wickfield,  with a motion  of his hand  towards the table. &#x27;Thank&#x27;ee.  I am going to dine,&#x27; said  Mr. Maldon, &#x27;with my cousin Annie.   Good bye!&#x27; Mr. Wickfield, without rising, looked after him thoughtfully as he went out.  He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman, I thought, with a handsome face, a rapid utterance, and a confident, bold air.   And this was the first I ever  saw of Mr. Jack Maldon;  whom I had not  expected to see so  soon, when I heard  the Doctor speak of him that morning. When we had dined, we went  upstairs again, where everything went on  exactly as on the previous day.   Agnes set the glasses  and decanters in the  same corner, and Mr. Wickfield sat  down to drink, and  drank a good deal.   Agnes played the piano to  him, sat  by him,  and worked  and talked,  and played  some games  at dominoes with me. In good time she made tea; and afterwards, when I brought down my books, looked into them,  and showed me what she  knew of them (which was  no slight matter, though she said it was),  and what was the best way to  learn and understand them.  I see her, with her modest, orderly, placid manner, and I hear her beautiful calm voice, as I  write these words.  The influence for  all good, which she came to  exercise over me at  a later time, begins  already to descend upon my breast.  I love little Em&#x27;ly, and I don&#x27;t love Agnes - no, not at all in that way - but I feel that there are goodness, peace, and truth, wherever  Agnes is; and that the soft light of the coloured window in the church, seen long ago, falls on her always, and on me when I am near her, and on everything around. The time having come for her withdrawal for the night, and she having left us, I gave Mr. Wickfield my hand, preparatory to going away myself.  But he checked me and said: &#x27;Should you like to stay with us, Trotwood, or to go elsewhere?&#x27; &#x27;To stay,&#x27; I answered, quickly. &#x27;You are sure?&#x27; &#x27;If you please.  If I may!&#x27; &#x27;Why, it&#x27;s but a dull life that we lead here, boy, I am afraid,&#x27; he said. &#x27;Not more dull for me than Agnes, sir.  Not dull at all!&#x27; &#x27;Than  Agnes,&#x27;  he repeated,  walking  slowly to  the  great chimney-piece,  and leaning against it.  &#x27;Than Agnes!&#x27; He had drank wine that evening (or I fancied it), until his eyes were bloodshot. Not that I could see them now, for they were cast down, and shaded by his  hand; but I had noticed them a little while before. &#x27;Now I wonder,&#x27; he muttered, &#x27;whether my Agnes tires of me.  When should I  ever tire of her!  But that&#x27;s different, that&#x27;s quite different.&#x27; He was musing, not speaking to me; so I remained quiet. &#x27;A dull old house,&#x27; he  said, &#x27;and a monotonous life;  but I must have her  near me.  I  must keep  her near  me.  If  the thought  that I  may die  and leave my darling, or  that my  darling may  die and  leave me,  comes like  a spectre, to distress my happiest hours, and is only to be drowned in -&#x27; He did not supply the word; but pacing slowly to the place where he had sat, and mechanically going through the action  of pouring wine from the  empty decanter, set it down and paced back again. &#x27;If it is miserable to bear, when she is here,&#x27; he said, &#x27;what would it be,  and she away?  No, no, no.  I cannot try that.&#x27; He leaned against the  chimney-piece, brooding so long  that I could not  decide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going, or to remain quietly where I was, until he should come out of his reverie.  At length he aroused himself, and looked about the room until his eyes encountered mine. &#x27;Stay with us,  Trotwood, eh?&#x27; he  said in his  usual manner, and  as if he were answering something I had just  said.  &#x27;I am glad of  it. You are company to  us both.  It is wholesome to have you here. Wholesome for me, wholesome for  Agnes, wholesome perhaps for all of us.&#x27; &#x27;I am sure it is for me, sir,&#x27; I said.  &#x27;I am so glad to be here.&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s a  fine fellow!&#x27;  said Mr.  Wickfield.  &#x27;As  long as  you are glad to be here, you shall stay here.&#x27;  He shook  hands with me upon it, and clapped  me on the back; and told me  that when I had anything  to do at night after  Agnes had left us, or when I wished to read  for my own pleasure, I was free to  come down to his room, if he were there and if I desired it for company&#x27;s sake, and to sit with  him.  I  thanked him  for his  consideration; and,  as he  went down  soon afterwards, and I was not tired, went down too, with a book in my hand, to avail myself, for half-an-hour, of his permission. But, seeing a light in the  little round office, and immediately feeling  myself attracted towards Uriah Heep,  who had a sort  of fascination for me,  I went in there instead.  I found Uriah reading a great fat book, with such  demonstrative attention, that his lank forefinger followed up every line as he read, and  made clammy tracks along the page (or so I fully believed) like a snail. &#x27;You are working late tonight, Uriah,&#x27; says I. &#x27;Yes, Master Copperfield,&#x27; says Uriah. As I  was getting  on the  stool opposite,  to talk  to him more conveniently, I observed that he had not  such a thing as a  smile about him, and that  he could only widen  his mouth  and make  two hard  creases down  his cheeks, one on each side, to stand for one. &#x27;I am not doing office-work, Master Copperfield,&#x27; said Uriah. &#x27;What work, then?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;I am  improving my  legal knowledge,  Master Copperfield,&#x27;  said Uriah.   &#x27;I am going  through  Tidd&#x27;s  Practice.   Oh,  what  a  writer  Mr.  Tidd  is,  Master Copperfield!&#x27; My stool  was such  a tower  of observation,  that as  I watched  him reading on again, after  this rapturous  exclamation, and  following up  the lines with his forefinger, I  observed that  his nostrils,  which were  thin and  pointed, with sharp dints in them, had a singular and most uncomfortable way of expanding  and contracting themselves - that they seemed to twinkle instead of his eyes,  which hardly ever twinkled at all. &#x27;I suppose you are quite a great lawyer?&#x27; I said, after looking at him for  some time. &#x27;Me, Master Copperfield?&#x27; said Uriah.  &#x27;Oh, no!  I&#x27;m a very umble person.&#x27; It was no fancy  of mine about his  hands, I observed; for  he frequently ground the palms against each other as if  to squeeze them dry and warm, besides  often wiping them, in a stealthy way, on his pocket-handkerchief. &#x27;I am well aware that I am the umblest person going,&#x27; said Uriah Heep, modestly; &#x27;let the other be where he may.  My mother is likewise a very umble person.   We live in a numble abode, Master Copperfield, but have much to be thankful for. My father&#x27;s former calling was umble.  He was a sexton.&#x27; &#x27;What is he now?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;He is a  partaker of glory  at present, Master  Copperfield,&#x27; said Uriah  Heep. &#x27;But we have much  to be thankful for.   How much have I  to be thankful for  in living with Mr. Wickfield!&#x27; I asked Uriah if he had been with Mr. Wickfield long? &#x27;I have  been with  him, going  on four  year, Master  Copperfield,&#x27; said Uriah; shutting up his book, after carefully  marking the place where he had  left off. &#x27;Since a year after my father&#x27;s death.   How much have I to be thankful  for, in that!  How much have I to be thankful for, in Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s kind intention  to give me my  articles, which would  otherwise not lay  within the umble  means of mother and self!&#x27; &#x27;Then, when your articled time is over, you&#x27;ll be a regular lawyer, I  suppose?&#x27; said I. &#x27;With the blessing of Providence, Master Copperfield,&#x27; returned Uriah. &#x27;Perhaps you&#x27;ll be a partner in Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s business, one of these days,&#x27;  I said, to make myself agreeable; &#x27;and it will be Wickfield and Heep, or Heep late Wickfield.&#x27; &#x27;Oh no, Master Copperfield,&#x27;  returned Uriah, shaking his  head, &#x27;I am much  too umble for that!&#x27; He certainly did  look uncommonly like  the carved face  on the beam  outside my window, as he sat, in his humility, eyeing me sideways, with his mouth  widened, and the creases in his cheeks. &#x27;Mr.  Wickfield is a most  excellent man, Master Copperfield,&#x27; said  Uriah.  &#x27;If you have known him long, you know it,  I am sure, much better than I can  inform you.&#x27; I replied that I was certain he was;  but that I had not known him long  myself, though he was a friend of my aunt&#x27;s. &#x27;Oh,  indeed, Master  Copperfield,&#x27; said  Uriah.  &#x27;Your  aunt is  a sweet  lady, Master Copperfield!&#x27; He had a way  of writhing when he  wanted to express enthusiasm,  which was very ugly;  and  which diverted  my  attention from  the  compliment he  had  paid my relation, to the snaky twistings of his throat and body. &#x27;A  sweet  lady,  Master  Copperfield!&#x27;  said  Uriah  Heep.   &#x27;She  has  a great admiration for Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield, I believe?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Yes,&#x27; boldly; not that I knew anything about it, Heaven forgive me! &#x27;I hope you have, too, Master Copperfield,&#x27; said Uriah.  &#x27;But I am sure you must have.&#x27; &#x27;Everybody must have,&#x27; I returned. &#x27;Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,&#x27; said  Uriah Heep, &#x27;for that remark!  It  is so  true!   Umble as  I  am, I  know  it is  so  true!  Oh,  thank  you,  Master Copperfield!&#x27; He writhed himself  quite off his stool  in the excitement of  his feelings, and, being off, began to make arrangements for going home. &#x27;Mother will be expecting me,&#x27; he said, referring to a pale,  inexpressive-faced watch in his pocket, &#x27;and getting  uneasy; for though we are very  umble, Master Copperfield, we are much attached to one another.  If you would come and see us, any afternoon, and take a cup of  tea at our lowly dwelling, mother would  be as proud of your company as I should be.&#x27; I said I should be glad to come. &#x27;Thank you, Master Copperfield,&#x27; returned Uriah, putting his book away upon  the shelf - &#x27;I suppose you stop here, some time, Master Copperfield?&#x27; I said I was going to be brought up there, I believed, as long as I remained  at school. &#x27;Oh, indeed!&#x27; exclaimed Uriah.  &#x27;I should think YOU would come into the business at last, Master Copperfield!&#x27; I protested  that I  had no  views of  that sort,  and that  no such  scheme was entertained in my behalf by anybody;  but Uriah insisted on blandly replying  to all  my assurances,  &#x27;Oh, yes,  Master Copperfield,  I should  think you  would, indeed!&#x27;  and,  &#x27;Oh,  indeed,  Master Copperfield,  I  should  think  you would, certainly!&#x27; over and over again.  Being, at last, ready to leave the office  for the night, he  asked me if  it would suit  my convenience to  have the light put out; and on my answering &#x27;Yes,&#x27; instantly extinguished it.  After shaking  hands with me - his hand felt like a fish,  in the dark - he opened the door into  the street a very  little, and crept  out, and shut  it, leaving me  to grope my way back into the house: which cost me some trouble and a fall over his stool.  This was the proximate cause, I suppose, of my dreaming about him, for what  appeared to me  to be  half the  night; and  dreaming, among  other things,  that he  had launched Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s house  on a piratical expedition,  with a black flag  at the masthead, bearing the inscription &#x27;Tidd&#x27;s Practice&#x27;, under which  diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little Em&#x27;ly to the Spanish Main, to be drowned. I got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school next day, and a good deal the better next day, and so shook it off by degrees, that in less than a fortnight  I was  quite at  home, and  happy, among  my new companions.  I was awkward enough in their games, and backward enough in their studies; but  custom would improve me  in the first  respect, I hoped,  and hard work  in the second. Accordingly, I went to work very hard,  both in play and in earnest, and  gained great commendation.  And, in a very little while, the Murdstone and Grinby  life became so strange to me that I hardly believed in it, while my present life grew so familiar, that I seemed to have been leading it a long time. Doctor Strong&#x27;s was an excellent school; as different from Mr. Creakle&#x27;s as good is  from evil.   It was  very gravely  and decorously  ordered, and  on a  sound system; with an appeal, in everything, to the honour and good faith of the boys, and an avowed intention  to rely on their  possession of those qualities  unless they proved themselves unworthy of it,  which worked wonders.  We all felt  that we had a part  in the management of  the place, and in  sustaining its character and dignity.  Hence, we soon became warmly attached to it - I am sure I did  for one, and I never knew,  in all my time, of  any other boy being otherwise  - and learnt with a good will,  desiring to do it credit.   We had noble games out  of hours, and plenty of liberty; but even then, as I remember, we were well  spoken of in the town, and rarely did any disgrace, by our appearance or manner, to the reputation of Doctor Strong and Doctor Strong&#x27;s boys. Some of the higher  scholars boarded in the  Doctor&#x27;s house, and through  them I learned, at second hand, some particulars  of the Doctor&#x27;s history - as,  how he had not yet been married twelve months to the beautiful young lady I had seen in the study, whom he had married for love;  for she had not a sixpence, and had  a world of poor relations (so our fellows  said) ready to swarm the Doctor out  of house and home.   Also, how the  Doctor&#x27;s cogitating manner  was attributable to his being always engaged in looking out for Greek roots; which, in my  innocence and  ignorance,  I  supposed to  be  a  botanical furor  on  the  Doctor&#x27;s part, especially as  he always  looked at  the ground  when he  walked about,  until I understood that they were roots of words, with a view to a new Dictionary  which he had in contemplation.  Adams, our  head-boy, who had a turn for  mathematics, had made a calculation, I was  informed, of the time this Dictionary  would take in completing,  on the  Doctor&#x27;s plan,  and at  the Doctor&#x27;s  rate of going.  He considered that  it might  be done  in one  thousand six  hundred and forty-nine years, counting from the Doctor&#x27;s last, or sixty-second, birthday. But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school: and it must have been a badly composed school if  he had been anything  else, for he was  the kindest of men; with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of  the very urns upon the wall.   As he walked up and  down that part of the  courtyard which was at the  side of the house,  with the stray rooks  and jackdaws looking after him with their heads cocked slyly,  as if they knew how much more  knowing they were in  worldly affairs than  he, if any  sort of vagabond  could only get near enough to his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of  a tale of  distress, that  vagabond was  made for  the next  two days.   It was so notorious in the house, that the  masters and head-boys took pains to  cut these marauders off at  angles, and to  get out of  windows, and turn  them out of the courtyard, before they could make the Doctor aware of their presence; which  was sometimes  happily effected  within a  few yards  of him,  without his   knowing anything of the matter,  as he jogged to  and fro.  Outside his  own domain, and unprotected, he  was a  very sheep  for the  shearers.  He  would have taken his gaiters off his legs, to give away.  In fact, there was a story current among us (I have no idea, and never had, on what authority, but I have believed it for so many years that  I feel quite  certain it is  true), that on  a frosty day,  one winter-time,  he  actually  did  bestow  his  gaiters  on  a  beggar-woman,  who occasioned some scandal  in the neighbourhood  by exhibiting a  fine infant from door to  door, wrapped  in those  garments, which  were universally  recognized, being as well known in the vicinity as the Cathedral.  The legend added that the only person who  did not identify  them was the  Doctor himself, who,  when they were shortly afterwards displayed at the door of a little second-hand shop of no very good repute,  where such things  were taken in  exchange for gin,  was more than  once observed  to handle  them approvingly,  as if  admiring some  curious novelty in the pattern, and considering them an improvement on his own. It was very  pleasant to see  the Doctor with  his pretty young  wife. He had  a fatherly, benignant way of showing his fondness for her, which seemed in  itself to express a good man.  I often saw them walking in the garden where the peaches were, and  I sometimes  had a  nearer observation  of them  in the  study or the parlour.  She appeared to me to take  great care of the Doctor, and to  like him very much, though I never thought her vitally interested in the Dictionary: some cumbrous fragments of which work the  Doctor always carried in his pockets,  and in the lining of his hat, and  generally seemed to be expounding to her  as they walked about. I saw a good deal of Mrs. Strong, both because she had taken a liking for me  on the morning of my introduction to the Doctor, and was always afterwards kind  to me, and interested in me; and because she was very fond of Agnes, and was  often backwards and forwards at our house.  There was a curious constraint between her and Mr. Wickfield, I thought (of whom she seemed to be afraid), that never  wore off.  When she came  there of an evening,  she always shrunk from  accepting his escort home, and ran  away with me instead.   And sometimes, as we  were running gaily across  the Cathedral  yard together,  expecting to  meet nobody, we would meet Mr. Jack Maldon, who was always surprised to see us. Mrs. Strong&#x27;s  mama was  a lady  I took  great delight  in.  Her  name was  Mrs. Markleham; but  our boys  used to  call her  the Old  Soldier, on account of her generalship, and the skill with  which she marshalled great forces  of relations against the Doctor.  She was a little, sharp-eyed woman, who used to wear,  when she was dressed, one unchangeable cap, ornamented with some artificial  flowers, and two artificial butterflies supposed to be hovering above the flowers.  There was a superstition among us that this  cap had come from France, and could  only originate in the workmanship of that ingenious nation: but all I certainly  know about it, is, that it always made its appearance of an evening, wheresoever Mrs. Markleham made HER appearance; that it was carried about to friendly meetings in a Hindoo basket; that the butterflies had the gift of trembling constantly;  and that they improved the shining hours at Doctor Strong&#x27;s expense, like busy bees. I observed the Old Soldier - not  to adopt the name disrespectfully - to  pretty good advantage, on  a night which  is made memorable  to me by  something else I shall relate.  It  was the night  of a little  party at the  Doctor&#x27;s, which was given on the occasion of Mr.  Jack Maldon&#x27;s departure for India, whither  he was going as  a cadet,  or something  of that  kind: Mr.  Wickfield having at length arranged the business.  It  happened to be the  Doctor&#x27;s birthday, too.  We  had had a holiday, had made presents to him in the morning, had made a speech to him through the head-boy, and had cheered him until we were hoarse, and until he had shed tears.  And now, in the evening, Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, and I, went to  have tea with him in his private capacity. Mr. Jack  Maldon was  there, before  us.  Mrs.  Strong, dressed  in white,  with cherry-coloured ribbons,  was playing  the piano,  when we  went in;  and he was leaning over her to turn the leaves.  The clear red and white of her  complexion was not so blooming and flower-like as usual, I thought, when she turned  round; but she looked very pretty, Wonderfully pretty. &#x27;I have forgotten, Doctor,&#x27;  said Mrs. Strong&#x27;s mama,  when we were seated,  &#x27;to pay you the compliments of the day  - though they are, as you may  suppose, very far from being  mere compliments in  my case.  Allow  me to wish  you many happy returns.&#x27; &#x27;I thank you, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; replied the Doctor. &#x27;Many, many, many, happy returns,&#x27; said the Old Soldier.  &#x27;Not only for your own sake, but for Annie&#x27;s, and John Maldon&#x27;s, and many other people&#x27;s.  It seems but yesterday to  me, John,  when you  were a  little creature,  a head shorter than Master Copperfield, making  baby love to  Annie behind the  gooseberry bushes in the back-garden.&#x27; &#x27;My dear mama,&#x27; said Mrs. Strong, &#x27;never mind that now.&#x27; &#x27;Annie, don&#x27;t be absurd,&#x27; returned her mother.  &#x27;If you are to blush to hear  of such things now you are an old married woman, when are you not to blush to  hear of them?&#x27; &#x27;Old?&#x27; exclaimed Mr. Jack Maldon.  &#x27;Annie?  Come!&#x27; &#x27;Yes, John,&#x27; returned the Soldier.  &#x27;Virtually, an old married woman.   Although not old by years - for when did you  ever hear me say, or who has ever heard  me say, that a girl of  twenty was old by years!  - your cousin is the  wife of the Doctor, and, as such, what I have described her.  It is well for you, John, that your cousin is the wife of the Doctor.  You have found in him an influential and kind friend, who will be kinder yet, I venture to predict, if you deserve it.  I have no false pride.   I never hesitate to  admit, frankly, that there  are some members of our  family who want  a friend.  You  were one yourself,  before your cousin&#x27;s influence raised up one for you.&#x27; The Doctor, in the goodness of his heart, waved his hand as if to make light  of it, and  save Mr.  Jack Maldon  from any  further reminder.   But Mrs. Markleham changed her chair for  one next the  Doctor&#x27;s, and putting  her fan on  his coat sleeve, said: &#x27;No, really, my  dear Doctor, you  must excuse me  if I appear  to dwell on this rather, because I feel  so very strongly.  I  call it quite my  monomania, it is such a subject of mine.  You are a  blessing to us.  You really are a Boon,  you know.&#x27; &#x27;Nonsense, nonsense,&#x27; said the Doctor. &#x27;No, no, I beg  your pardon,&#x27; retorted the  Old Soldier.  &#x27;With nobody  present, but our dear and confidential friend  Mr. Wickfield, I cannot consent to  be put down.  I shall begin to assert the  privileges of a mother-in-law, if you go  on like that,  and scold  you.  I  am perfectly  honest and  outspoken.  What  I am saying,  is what  I said  when you  first overpowered  me with  surprise -   you remember how  surprised I  was? -  by proposing  for Annie.   Not that there was anything so very  much out of  the way, in  the mere fact  of the proposal  - it would  be ridiculous  to say  that! -  but because,  you having  known her  poor father, and having known her from a baby six months old, I hadn&#x27;t thought of you in such a light at all, or indeed  as a marrying man in any way, -  simply that, you know.&#x27; &#x27;Aye, aye,&#x27; returned the Doctor, good-humouredly.  &#x27;Never mind.&#x27; &#x27;But I DO mind,&#x27; said  the Old Soldier, laying her  fan upon his lips.  &#x27;I  mind very much.   I recall  these things  that I  may be  contradicted if I am wrong. Well!  Then I  spoke to Annie,  and I told  her what had  happened.  I said, &quot;My dear, here&#x27;s Doctor  Strong has positively  been and made  you the subject  of a handsome declaration and an offer.&quot; Did I  press it in the least?  No.  I  said, &quot;Now, Annie, tell me  the truth this moment;  is your heart free?&quot;   &quot;Mama,&quot; she said crying, &quot;I am extremely young&quot; -  which was perfectly true - &quot;and I  hardly know if I have a heart at all.&quot; &quot;Then, my dear,&quot; I said, &quot;you may rely upon  it, it&#x27;s free.  At all  events, my love,&quot; said  I, &quot;Doctor Strong is  in an agitated state of mind, and must be answered.  He cannot be kept in his present state  of suspense.&quot;  &quot;Mama,&quot; said Annie, still  crying, &quot;would he be unhappy  without me? If he would, I honour and respect him so much, that I think I will have him.&quot; So it was settled.  And  then, and not till  then, I said to  Annie, &quot;Annie, Doctor Strong will not only be your husband, but he will represent your late father: he will represent the head of our family, he will represent the wisdom and station, and I may say the means, of our family; and will be, in short, a Boon to it.&quot;  I used the word at the time, and I have used it again, today.  If I have any merit it is consistency.&#x27; The daughter had sat  quite silent and still  during this speech, with  her eyes fixed on the  ground; her cousin  standing near her,  and looking on  the ground too.  She now said very softly, in a trembling voice: &#x27;Mama, I hope you have finished?&#x27; &#x27;No, my dear Annie,&#x27; returned the Old Soldier, &#x27;I have not quite finished.  Since you ask me, my love, I reply that I have not. I complain that you really are a little unnatural towards your own family;  and, as it is of no use complaining to you.  I mean to complain to your husband. Now, my dear Doctor, do look at that silly wife of yours.&#x27; As the Doctor turned his kind face, with its smile of simplicity and gentleness, towards her, she drooped her head more.  I noticed that Mr. Wickfield looked  at her steadily. &#x27;When I  happened to  say to  that naughty  thing, the  other day,&#x27;  pursued her mother, shaking her head and her fan at her, playfully, &#x27;that there was a family circumstance she might mention to you  - indeed,  I think, was bound  to mention she said, that  to mention it  was to ask  a favour; and  that, as you  were too generous, and as for her to ask was always to have, she wouldn&#x27;t.&#x27; &#x27;Annie,  my  dear,&#x27; said  the  Doctor.  &#x27;That  was  wrong.  It  robbed  me of  a pleasure.&#x27; &#x27;Almost the  very words  I said  to her!&#x27;  exclaimed her  mother.  &#x27;Now  really, another time,  when I  know what  she would  tell you  but for  this reason, and won&#x27;t, I have a great mind, my dear Doctor, to tell you myself.&#x27; &#x27;I shall be glad if you will,&#x27; returned the Doctor. &#x27;Shall I?&#x27; &#x27;Certainly.&#x27; &#x27;Well, then, I will!&#x27; said the  Old Soldier.  &#x27;That&#x27;s a bargain.&#x27; And  having, I suppose, carried her point, she tapped the Doctor&#x27;s hand several times with  her fan (which she kissed first), and returned triumphantly to her former station. Some more company coming in, among whom were the two masters and Adams, the talk became general; and it naturally turned on Mr. Jack Maldon, and his voyage,  and the country he  was going to,  and his various  plans and prospects.   He was to leave that night, after supper, in a post-chaise, for Gravesend; where the ship, in which he was  to make the voyage,  lay; and was to  be gone - unless  he came home on leave, or for his health - I don&#x27;t know how many years.  I recollect  it was settled by  general consent that  India was quite  a misrepresented country, and had nothing objectionable in  it, but a tiger or  two, and a little heat  in the warm part of  the day.  For my  own part, I looked  on Mr. Jack Maldon  as a modern Sindbad, and pictured him the bosom friend of all the Rajahs in the East, sitting under canopies, smoking curly golden pipes - a mile long, if they  could be straightened out. Mrs. Strong was a very pretty singer: as I knew, who often heard her singing  by herself.  But, whether she  was afraid of singing  before people, or was  out of voice that evening, it was certain that  she couldn&#x27;t sing at all.  She tried  a duet,  once,  with her  cousin  Maldon, but  could  not so  much  as begin;  and afterwards, when she tried to sing  by herself, although she began sweetly,  her voice  died away  on a  sudden, and  left her  quite distressed,  with her  head hanging down  over the  keys.  The  good Doctor  said she  was nervous,  and, to relieve her, proposed a round game at cards; of which he knew as much as of  the art of playing the trombone.  But I remarked that the Old Soldier took him  into custody directly, for her partner; and instructed him, as the first  preliminary of initiation, to give her all the silver he had in his pocket. We had a merry game, not made the less merry by the Doctor&#x27;s mistakes, of  which he  committed an  innumerable quantity,  in spite  of the  watchfulness of   the butterflies, and to their great aggravation.  Mrs. Strong had declined to  play, on  the ground  of not  feeling very  well; and  her cousin  Maldon had  excused himself because he  had some packing  to do.  When  he had done  it, however, he returned, and they sat  together, talking, on the  sofa.  From time to  time she came and looked over the Doctor&#x27;s hand, and told him what to play.  She was very pale, as she bent over him, and I thought her finger trembled as she pointed out the cards; but the Doctor was quite  happy in her attention, and took no  notice of this, if it were so. At supper, we were hardly so gay.   Everyone appeared to feel that a parting  of that sort  was an  awkward thing,  and that  the nearer  it approached, the more awkward it was.  Mr. Jack Maldon tried to be very talkative, but was not at  his ease, and made matters worse. And they were not improved, as it appeared to  me, by  the Old  Soldier: who  continually recalled  passages of  Mr. Jack  Maldon&#x27;s youth. The Doctor, however, who  felt, I am sure,  that he was making  everybody happy, was well pleased, and had no suspicion but that we were all at the utmost height of enjoyment. &#x27;Annie, my dear,&#x27; said he, looking at  his watch, and filling his glass, &#x27;it  is past your cousin jack&#x27;s time, and we  must  not detain him, since time and  tide both concerned in this case - wait for no man.  Mr. Jack Maldon, you have a long voyage, and a strange country, before you; but many men have had both, and  many men will have both, to the end of time.  The winds you are going to tempt,  have wafted thousands upon thousands to fortune, and brought thousands upon thousands happily back.&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s an  affecting thing,&#x27;  said Mrs.  Markleham -  &#x27;however it&#x27;s  viewed, it&#x27;s affecting, to see a fine young man  one has known from an infant, going  away to the other end of the world, leaving all he knows behind, and not knowing  what&#x27;s before him.  A young man  really well deserves constant support  and patronage,&#x27; looking at the Doctor, &#x27;who makes such sacrifices.&#x27; &#x27;Time will go  fast with you,  Mr. Jack Maldon,&#x27;  pursued the Doctor,  &#x27;and fast with all of us.  Some of us can hardly expect, perhaps, in the natural course of things, to greet you on your return.  The  next best thing is to hope to do  it, and that&#x27;s my case.  I shall not weary you with good advice.  You have long  had a good model before you, in your cousin Annie.  Imitate her virtues as nearly as you can.&#x27; Mrs. Markleham fanned herself, and shook her head. &#x27;Farewell, Mr. Jack,&#x27; said the Doctor, standing up; on which we all stood up. &#x27;A prosperous voyage out, a thriving career abroad, and a happy return home!&#x27; We all drank the toast, and all shook hands with Mr. Jack Maldon; after which he hastily took leave of the ladies who were there, and hurried to the door,  where he was  received, as  he got  into the  chaise, with  a tremendous  broadside of cheers discharged by our  boys, who had assembled  on the lawn for  the purpose. Running in among  them to swell  the ranks, I  was very near  the chaise when it rolled away; and  I had a  lively impression made  upon me, in  the midst of the noise and  dust, of  having seen  Mr. Jack  Maldon rattle  past with an agitated face, and something cherry-coloured in his hand. After another broadside for the Doctor,  and another for the Doctor&#x27;s wife,  the boys dispersed, and  I went back  into the house,  where I found  the guests all standing in a group  about the Doctor, discussing  how Mr. Jack Maldon  had gone away, and how he had borne it, and how  he had felt it, and all the rest of  it. In the midst of these remarks, Mrs. Markleham cried: &#x27;Where&#x27;s Annie?&#x27; No Annie  was there;  and when  they called  to her,  no Annie  replied. But all pressing out of the room, in a crowd,  to see what was the matter, we found  her lying on the  hall floor.  There  was great alarm  at first, until  it was found that she was in a swoon, and that  the swoon was yielding to the usual means  of recovery; when the Doctor, who had lifted her head upon his knee, put her  curls aside with his hand, and said, looking around: &#x27;Poor Annie!  She&#x27;s so faithful  and tender-hearted!  It&#x27;s the parting  from her old playfellow and friend - her favourite cousin - that has done this.  Ah! It&#x27;s a pity!  I am very sorry!&#x27; When she opened her eyes, and saw  where she was, and that we were  all standing about her, she arose with assistance: turning her head, as she did so, to lay it on the Doctor&#x27;s shoulder - or to hide it, I don&#x27;t know which.  We went into  the drawing-room, to  leave her  with the  Doctor and  her mother;  but she said, it seemed, that she was better than she had been since morning, and that she  would rather be brought among us; so they brought her in, looking very white and weak, I thought, and sat her on a sofa. &#x27;Annie, my dear,&#x27; said her mother, doing something to her dress. &#x27;See here!  You have lost a bow.   Will anybody be so  good as find a  ribbon; a cherry-coloured ribbon?&#x27; It was the one she had worn at her bosom.  We all looked for it; I myself looked everywhere, I am certain - but nobody could find it. &#x27;Do you recollect where you had it last, Annie?&#x27; said her mother. I wondered how I  could have thought she  looked white, or anything  but burning red,  when she  answered that  she had  had it  safe, a  little while  ago,  she thought, but it was not worth looking for. Nevertheless, it was looked for again, and still not found.  She entreated  that there might be no  more searching; but it  was still sought for,  in a desultory way, until she was quite well, and the company took their departure. We walked very slowly home, Mr. Wickfield,  Agnes, and I - Agnes and I  admiring the moonlight, and Mr. Wickfield scarcely raising his eyes from the ground. When we, at last, reached our own door, Agnes discovered that she had left her little reticule behind. Delighted to be of any service to her, I ran back to fetch it. I went into the supper-room where it had been left, which was deserted and dark. But a door of communication between that and the Doctor&#x27;s study, where there was a light,  being open,  I passed  on there,  to say  what I  wanted, and to get a candle. The Doctor was sitting in his easy-chair by the fireside, and his young wife was on a stool at his feet.  The Doctor, with a complacent smile, was reading  aloud some manuscript explanation  or statement of  a theory out  of that interminable Dictionary, and she was looking up at him.  But with such a face as I never saw. It was so beautiful  in its form, it  was so ashy pale,  it was so fixed  in its abstraction, it was so full of  a wild, sleep-walking, dreamy horror of  I don&#x27;t know  what.  The  eyes were  wide open,  and her  brown hair  fell in  two  rich clusters on her shoulders, and on her white dress, disordered by the want of the lost ribbon.  Distinctly as  I recollect her look,  I cannot say of  what it was expressive, I cannot even say of what  it is expressive to me now, rising  again before  my older  judgement.  Penitence,  humiliation, shame,  pride, love,  and trustfulness - I see  them all; and in  them all, I see  that horror of I  don&#x27;t know what. My entrance, and my saying what  I wanted, roused her.  It disturbed  the Doctor too, for when I went back to replace  the candle I had taken from the table,  he was patting her head, in his fatherly  way, and saying he was a merciless  drone to let her tempt him into reading on; and he would have her go to bed. But she asked him, in a rapid, urgent manner, to let her stay - to let her  feel assured (I heard her  murmur some broken words  to this effect) that  she was in his confidence that night.  And, as she turned again towards him, after glancing at me as I  left the room and  went out at the  door, I saw her  cross her hands upon his knee, and look up at  him with the same face, something quieted,  as he resumed his reading. It made a great impression on me, and I remembered it a long time afterwards; as I shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes. CHAPTER 17 SOMEBODY TURNS UP It has not occurred to me to mention Peggotty since I ran away; but, of  course, I wrote her a letter almost as soon as I was housed at Dover, and another, and a longer letter, containing  all particulars fully  related, when my  aunt took me formally under her protection.  On my  being settled at Doctor Strong&#x27;s I  wrote to her again, detailing  my happy condition and  prospects.  I never could  have derived anything like the  pleasure from spending the  money Mr. Dick had  given me, that I felt in sending a gold half-guinea to Peggotty, per post, enclosed in this last letter, to discharge the sum I had borrowed of her: in which  epistle, not before, I mentioned about the young man with the donkey-cart. To these communications Peggotty replied as promptly, if not as concisely, as  a merchant&#x27;s clerk.   Her utmost  powers of  expression (which  were certainly not great in  ink) were  exhausted in  the attempt  to write  what she  felt on  the subject of my journey.  Four  sides of incoherent and interjectional  beginnings of sentences, that had no end,  except blots, were inadequate to afford  her any relief.  But the blots were more expressive to me than the best composition; for they showed me that Peggotty had been crying all over the paper, and what  could I have desired more? I made out, without much difficulty, that she could not take quite kindly to  my aunt yet.  The notice was too short after so long a prepossession the other way. We never knew a person, she wrote; but to think that Miss Betsey should seem  to be so different from what  she had been thought to  be, was a Moral! -  that was her  word. She  was evidently  still afraid  of Miss  Betsey, for  she sent  her grateful duty to her but timidly; and  she was evidently afraid of me, too,  and entertained the probability of my running away again soon: if I might judge from the repeated hints she threw out, that the coach-fare to Yarmouth was always  to be had of her for the asking. She gave me one piece of intelligence which affected me very much, namely,  that there had been a sale  of the furniture at our  old home, and that Mr.  and Miss Murdstone were gone  away, and the  house was shut  up, to be  let or sold.  God knows I had no part in it while  they remained there, but it pained me to  think of the dear old place as altogether abandoned; of the weeds growing tall in  the garden, and the fallen leaves lying thick and wet upon the paths. I imagined how the winds of winter would howl round  it, how the cold rain would beat  upon the window-glass, how the moon  would make ghosts on  the walls of the  empty rooms, watching  their  solitude all  night.   I thought  afresh  of the  grave  in the churchyard, underneath the tree:  and it seemed as  if the house were  dead too, now, and all connected with my father and mother were faded away. There was  no other  news in  Peggotty&#x27;s letters.   Mr. Barkis  was an excellent husband, she said, though  still a little near;  but we all had  our faults, and she had plenty (though I am sure I  don&#x27;t know what they were); and he sent  his duty, and my little bedroom was always ready for me.  Mr. Peggotty was well, and Ham was well, and Mrs..  Gummidge was but poorly, and little Em&#x27;ly wouldn&#x27;t send her love, but said that Peggotty might send it, if she liked. All this intelligence I dutifully imparted to my aunt, only reserving to  myself the mention of  little Em&#x27;ly, to  whom I instinctively  felt that she  would not very tenderly incline.  While I was yet new at Doctor Strong&#x27;s, she made several excursions over to Canterbury to see me, and always at unseasonable hours:  with the view, I suppose, of taking  me by surprise.  But, finding me  well employed, and bearing a good character, and hearing  on all hands that I rose fast  in the school, she soon discontinued these visits. I saw her on a Saturday, every third or fourth week, when I went over to Dover for a treat; and I saw Mr. Dick  every alternate Wednesday, when he arrived by stage-coach at noon, to stay until  next morning. On these  occasions Mr.  Dick never  travelled without  a leathern writing-desk, containing  a  supply of  stationery  and the  Memorial;  in relation  to  which document he  had a  notion that  time was  beginning to  press now,  and that it really must be got out of hand. Mr.  Dick  was very  partial  to gingerbread.   To  render his  visits  the more agreeable, my aunt had instructed  me to open a credit  for him at a cake  shop, which was hampered with the stipulation  that he should not be served  with more than one shilling&#x27;s-worth in the course of any one day.  This, and the reference of all his  little bills at  the county inn  where he slept,  to my aunt, before they were paid,  induced me to  suspect that he  was only allowed  to rattle his money, and not to spend it.  I found on further investigation that this was  so, or at  least there  was an  agreement between  him and  my aunt  that he  should account to her for all his disbursements.   As he had no idea of deceiving  her, and always  desired to  please her,  he was  thus made  chary of  launching into expense.  On this point, as well as  on all other possible points, Mr. Dick  was convinced  that my  aunt was  the wisest  and most  wonderful of  women; as   he repeatedly told me with infinite secrecy, and always in a whisper. &#x27;Trotwood,&#x27;  said  Mr.  Dick,  with an  air  of  mystery,  after imparting  this confidence to me, one  Wednesday; &#x27;who&#x27;s the man  that hides near our  house and frightens her?&#x27; &#x27;Frightens my aunt, sir?&#x27; Mr. Dick nodded.  &#x27;I thought nothing  would have frightened her,&#x27; he said,  &#x27;for she&#x27;s -&#x27;  here he  whispered softly,  &#x27;don&#x27;t mention  it -  the wisest  and most wonderful of women.&#x27;   Having said which,  he drew back,  to observe the  effect which this description of her made upon me. &#x27;The first time he came,&#x27; said Mr.  Dick, &#x27;was- let me see- sixteen hundred  and forty-nine was the date  of King Charles&#x27;s execution.  I think you said  sixteen hundred and forty-nine?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t  know how  it can  be,&#x27; said  Mr. Dick,  sorely puzzled and shaking his head.  &#x27;I don&#x27;t think I am as old as that.&#x27; &#x27;Was it in that year that the man appeared, sir?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;Why, really&#x27; said  Mr. Dick, &#x27;I  don&#x27;t see how  it can have  been in that year, Trotwood.  Did you get that date out of history?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27; &#x27;I suppose history never lies, does it?&#x27; said Mr. Dick, with a gleam of hope. &#x27;Oh dear, no, sir!&#x27; I replied, most decisively.  I was ingenuous and young,  and I thought so. &#x27;I can&#x27;t  make it  out,&#x27; said  Mr. Dick,  shaking his  head.  &#x27;There&#x27;s something wrong, somewhere.   However, it  was very  soon after  the mistake  was made  of putting some of the  trouble out of King  Charles&#x27;s head into my  head, that the man first came.  I was walking out  with Miss Trotwood after tea, just at  dark, and there he was, close to our house.&#x27; &#x27;Walking about?&#x27; I inquired. &#x27;Walking about?&#x27; repeated Mr. Dick.  &#x27;Let me see, I must recollect a bit.  N-no, no; he was not walking about.&#x27; I asked, as the shortest way to get at it, what he WAS doing. &#x27;Well, he wasn&#x27;t there at all,&#x27; said Mr. Dick, &#x27;until he came up behind her, and whispered.  Then she turned round and  fainted, and I stood still and  looked at him, and he walked away; but that he should have been hiding ever since (in  the ground or somewhere), is the most extraordinary thing!&#x27; &#x27;HAS he been hiding ever since?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;To be sure he  has,&#x27; retorted Mr. Dick,  nodding his head gravely.  &#x27;Never came out, till last  night!  We were  walking last night,  and he came  up behind her again, and I knew him again.&#x27; &#x27;And did he frighten my aunt again?&#x27; &#x27;All of a shiver,&#x27; said Mr.  Dick, counterfeiting that affection and making  his teeth  chatter.   &#x27;Held by  the  palings.  Cried.   But,  Trotwood, come  here,&#x27; getting me close to  him, that he might  whisper very softly; &#x27;why  did she give him money, boy, in the moonlight?&#x27; &#x27;He was a beggar, perhaps.&#x27; Mr.  Dick shook  his head,  as utterly  renouncing the  suggestion; and   having replied a great many times, and with great confidence, &#x27;No beggar, no beggar, no beggar, sir!&#x27; went on to say, that  from his window he had afterwards, and  late at night, seen my  aunt give this person  money outside the garden  rails in the moonlight, who then slunk away -  into the ground again, as he  thought probable and was seen no  more: while my aunt  came hurriedly and secretly  back into the house, and had,  even that morning,  been quite different  from her usual  self; which preyed on Mr. Dick&#x27;s mind. I had not the least  belief, in the outset of  this story, that the unknown  was anything but a  delusion of Mr.  Dick&#x27;s, and one  of the line  of that ill-fated Prince who occasioned him so much difficulty; but after some reflection I  began to entertain the  question whether an  attempt, or threat  of an attempt,  might have  been  twice made  to  take poor  Mr.  Dick himself  from  under my  aunt&#x27;s protection, and whether my aunt, the strength of whose kind feeling towards  him I knew from herself, might  have been induced to pay  a price for his peace  and quiet.  As I was already much attached to Mr. Dick, and very solicitous for  his welfare, my fears favoured this supposition;  and for a long time his  Wednesday hardly ever came round, without my entertaining a misgiving that he would not be on the  coach-box as  usual.  There  he always  appeared, however,  grey-headed, laughing, and happy; and he never had anything more to tell of the man who could frighten my aunt. These Wednesdays were the happiest days  of Mr. Dick&#x27;s life; they were  far from being the least happy of mine.  He soon became known to every boy in the school; and though  he never  took an  active part  in any  game but kite-flying, was as deeply interested in all our sports as  anyone among us.  How often have I  seen him,  intent upon  a match  at marbles  or pegtop,  looking on  with a  face  of unutterable interest, and hardly breathing at the critical times!  How often, at hare and hounds, have I seen him  mounted on a little knoll, cheering the  whole field on to action,  and waving his hat  above his grey head,  oblivious of King Charles the Martyr&#x27;s head, and all belonging to it!  How many a summer hour have I known to be but blissful minutes to him in the cricket-field!  How many winter days have I seen him, standing blue-nosed, in the snow and east wind, looking at the boys going down the long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture! He  was  an  universal  favourite,  and  his  ingenuity  in  little  things  was transcendent.  He could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had an  idea of.  He could make a boat out of anything, from a skewer upwards.  He could turn cramp-bones into  chessmen; fashion  Roman chariots  from old  court cards; make spoked wheels  out of  cotton reels,  and bird-cages  of old  wire.  But  he was greatest of all,  perhaps, in the  articles of string  and straw; with  which we were all persuaded he could do anything that could be done by hands. Mr. Dick&#x27;s renown was not long  confined to us.  After a few  Wednesdays, Doctor Strong himself made some inquiries of me  about him, and I told him all  my aunt had told  me; which  interested the  Doctor so  much that  he requested,  on the occasion of his next visit, to be presented to him.  This ceremony I  performed; and the Doctor begging Mr. Dick, whensoever  he should not find me at the  coach office, to come on there, and rest himself until our morning&#x27;s work was over, it soon passed into a custom for Mr. Dick to come on as a matter of course, and, if we were  a little  late, as  often happened  on a  Wednesday, to  walk about the courtyard,  waiting for  me.  Here  he made  the acquaintance  of the   Doctor&#x27;s beautiful young wife (paler than formerly, all this time; more rarely seen by me or anyone, I think; and not so gay, but not less beautiful), and so became  more and more familiar by degrees, until, at last, he would come into the school  and wait.  He always sat  in a particular corner,  on a particular stool,  which was called &#x27;Dick&#x27;, after him;  here he would sit,  with his grey head  bent forward, attentively listening to whatever might be going on, with a profound  veneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire. This veneration Mr. Dick extended to the Doctor, whom he thought the most subtle and accomplished philosopher of any age.  It was long before Mr. Dick ever spoke to him otherwise than bareheaded; and even when he and the Doctor had struck  up quite a friendship,  and would walk  together by the  hour, on that  side of the courtyard which was known among us as The Doctor&#x27;s Walk, Mr. Dick would pull off his hat at intervals to show his respect for wisdom and knowledge.  How it  ever came about that the Doctor began to read out scraps of the famous Dictionary, in these walks, I never knew; perhaps he felt it all the same, at first, as reading to himself. However, it passed into a custom too; and Mr. Dick, listening with a face  shining with  pride and  pleasure, in  his heart  of hearts  believed  the Dictionary to be the most delightful book in the world. As I  think of  them going  up and  down before  those schoolroom  windows - the Doctor  reading  with  his  complacent  smile,  an  occasional  flourish  of the manuscript, or grave motion  of his head; and  Mr. Dick listening, enchained  by interest, with his poor wits calmly wandering God knows where, upon the wings of hard words - I  think of it as  one of the pleasantest  things, in a quiet  way, that I have ever seen.  I feel as if they might go walking to and fro for  ever, and the world might somehow  be the better for it  - as if a thousand  things it makes a noise about, were not one half so good for it, or me. Agnes was  one of  Mr. Dick&#x27;s  friends, very  soon; and  in often  coming to the house, he made acquaintance with  Uriah.  The friendship between himself  and me increased continually, and  it was maintained  on this odd  footing: that, while Mr. Dick came professedly to look  after me as my guardian, he  always consulted me in any little matter of doubt that arose, and invariably guided himself by my advice; not only having a high  respect for my native sagacity, but  considering that I inherited a good deal from my aunt. One Thursday morning, when I was about  to walk with Mr. Dick from the  hotel to the coach office before going back to school (for we had an hour&#x27;s school before breakfast), I met Uriah in the street, who reminded me of the promise I had made to take tea with  himself and his mother:  adding, with a writhe,  &#x27;But I didn&#x27;t expect you to keep it, Master Copperfield, we&#x27;re so very umble.&#x27; I really  had not  yet been  able to  make up  my mind  whether I liked Uriah or detested him; and I was very doubtful about it still, as I stood looking him  in the face in the street.   But I felt it quite  an affront to be supposed  proud, and said I only wanted to be asked. &#x27; Oh, if that&#x27;s all, Master  Copperfield,&#x27; said Uriah, &#x27;and it really  isn&#x27;t our umbleness that  prevents you,  will you  come this  evening?  But  if it  is our umbleness, I hope you  won&#x27;t mind owning to  it, Master Copperfield; for  we are well aware of our condition.&#x27; I said I  would mention it  to Mr. Wickfield,  and if he  approved, as I  had no doubt he would, I  would come with pleasure.   So, at six o&#x27;clock  that evening, which was  one of  the early  office evenings,  I announced  myself as ready, to Uriah. &#x27;Mother will be proud,  indeed,&#x27; he said, as  we walked away together.   &#x27;Or she would be proud, if it wasn&#x27;t sinful, Master Copperfield.&#x27; &#x27;Yet you didn&#x27;t mind supposing I was proud this morning,&#x27; I returned. &#x27;Oh dear, no, Master Copperfield!&#x27; returned Uriah.  &#x27;Oh, believe me, no!  Such a thought never came into my head!  I shouldn&#x27;t have deemed it at all proud if you had thought US too umble for you. Because we are so very umble.&#x27; &#x27;Have you been studying much law lately?&#x27; I asked, to change the subject. &#x27;Oh, Master Copperfield,&#x27; he  said, with an air  of self-denial, &#x27;my reading  is hardly  to be  called study.   I have  passed an  hour or  two in  the  evening, sometimes, with Mr. Tidd.&#x27; &#x27;Rather hard, I suppose?&#x27; said I. &#x27;He is hard to me sometimes,&#x27; returned  Uriah. &#x27;But I don&#x27;t know what he might be to a gifted person.&#x27; After  beating  a  little tune  on  his  chin as  he  walked  on, with  the  two forefingers of his skeleton right hand, he added: &#x27;There are expressions, you see, Master Copperfield - Latin words and terms - in Mr. Tidd, that are trying to a reader of my umble attainments.&#x27; &#x27;Would you like to be taught Latin?&#x27; I said briskly.  &#x27;I will teach it you  with pleasure, as I learn it.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,&#x27; he  answered, shaking his head. &#x27;I am  sure it&#x27;s very kind of you to make the offer, but I am much too umble to accept it.&#x27; &#x27;What nonsense, Uriah!&#x27; &#x27;Oh, indeed you must excuse me, Master Copperfield!  I am greatly obliged, and I should like it of all things, I assure  you; but I am far too umble.  There  are people enough to tread  upon me in my  lowly state, without my  doing outrage to their feelings by  possessing learning.  Learning  ain&#x27;t for me.   A person like myself had better not aspire.  If he is to get on in life, he must get on umbly, Master Copperfield!&#x27; I never saw his mouth so wide, or the creases in his cheeks so deep, as when  he delivered  himself of  these sentiments:  shaking his  head all  the time,   and writhing modestly. &#x27;I think you are  wrong, Uriah,&#x27; I said.   &#x27;I dare say there  are several things that I could teach you, if you would like to learn them.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, I don&#x27;t doubt  that, Master Copperfield,&#x27; he  answered; &#x27;not in the  least. But not being umble yourself, you don&#x27;t judge well, perhaps, for them that  are. I won&#x27;t provoke my betters with knowledge, thank you.  I&#x27;m much too umble.  Here is my umble dwelling, Master Copperfield!&#x27; We entered a low, old-fashioned room, walked straight into from the street,  and found  there Mrs.  Heep, who  was the  dead image  of Uriah,  only short.    She received me with the utmost humility, and apologized to me for giving her son  a kiss, observing  that, lowly  as they  were, they  had their natural affections, which they hoped  would give no  offence to anyone.   It was a  perfectly decent room, half parlour and half kitchen, but not at all a snug room.  The tea-things were set upon  the table, and  the kettle was  boiling on the  hob.  There was a chest of drawers  with an escritoire  top, for Uriah  to read or  write at of an evening; there was Uriah&#x27;s blue bag lying down and vomiting papers; there was  a company of Uriah&#x27;s books commanded by Mr. Tidd; there was a corner cupboard: and there  were  the  usual  articles  of  furniture.   I  don&#x27;t  remember  that any individual object had a  bare, pinched, spare look;  but I do remember  that the whole place had. It  was perhaps  a part  of Mrs.  Heep&#x27;s humility,  that she  still wore  weeds. Notwithstanding the lapse  of time that  had occurred since  Mr. Heep&#x27;s decease, she  still wore  weeds.  I  think there  was some  compromise in  the cap;   but otherwise she was as weedy as in the early days of her mourning. &#x27;This is a day to  be remembered, my Uriah, I  am sure,&#x27; said Mrs. Heep,  making the tea, &#x27;when Master Copperfield pays us a visit.&#x27; &#x27;I said you&#x27;d think so, mother,&#x27; said Uriah. &#x27;If I could  have wished father  to remain among  us for any  reason,&#x27; said Mrs. Heep, &#x27;it would have been, that he might have known his company this afternoon.&#x27; I felt  embarrassed by  these compliments;  but I  was sensible,  too, of  being entertained as an honoured guest, and I thought Mrs. Heep an agreeable woman. &#x27;My Uriah,&#x27; said Mrs. Heep, &#x27;has looked forward to this, sir, a long while.   He had his fears that our umbleness stood in the way, and I joined in them  myself. Umble we are, umble we have been, umble we shall ever be,&#x27; said Mrs. Heep. &#x27;I am sure you have no occasion to be so, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; I said, &#x27;unless you like.&#x27; &#x27;Thank you, sir,&#x27; retorted Mrs. Heep.  &#x27;We know our station and are thankful  in it.&#x27; I found that Mrs. Heep gradually got nearer to me, and that Uriah gradually  got opposite to me,  and that they  respectfully plied me  with the choicest  of the eatables on the table.  There was nothing particularly choice there, to be sure; but I  took the  will for  the deed,  and felt  that they  were very  attentive. Presently they began to talk about aunts,  and then I told them about mine;  and about fathers and mothers, and then I  told them about mine; and then Mrs.  Heep began to talk about  fathers-in-law, and then  I began to  tell her about   mine but  stopped, because  my aunt  had advised  me to  observe a  silence on   that subject.  A tender young cork, however, would have had no more chance against  a pair of corkscrews,  or a tender  young tooth against  a pair of  dentists, or a little shuttlecock against  two battledores, than  I had against  Uriah and Mrs. Heep.  They did just what they liked with me; and wormed things out of me that I had  no  desire to  tell,  with a  certainty  I blush  to  think of.   the  more especially, as in my juvenile frankness, I took some credit to myself for  being so  confidential and  felt that  I was  quite the  patron of  my two  respectful entertainers. They were very fond of one another:  that was certain.  I take it, that  had its effect upon me, as a touch of nature; but the skill with which the one  followed up whatever the  other said, was  a touch of  art which I  was still less  proof against.  When there was nothing more to  be got out of me about myself  (for on the Murdstone and Grinby life, and on my journey, I was dumb), they began  about Mr. Wickfield and Agnes.  Uriah threw the ball to Mrs. Heep, Mrs. Heep caught it and threw it back to Uriah, Uriah kept  it up a little while, then sent it  back to Mrs. Heep, and so they went on  tossing it about until I had no idea  who had got it, and was quite bewildered.  The ball itself was always changing too.  Now it was Mr.  Wickfield, now Agnes,  now the excellence  of Mr. Wickfield,  now my admiration of Agnes; now the  extent of Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s business  and resources, now our domestic life after dinner;  now, the wine that Mr. Wickfield  took, the reason why he took it, and the pity that it was he took so much; now one  thing, now another, then  everything at once;  and all the  time, without appearing  to speak very often, or to do  anything but sometimes encourage them a  little, for fear they should be overcome by their  humility and the honour of my company,  I found myself perpetually letting out something  or other that I had no  business to let  out and  seeing the  effect of  it in  the twinkling  of Uriah&#x27;s  dinted nostrils. I had begun  to be a  little uncomfortable, and  to wish myself  well out of the visit, when a figure coming down the  street passed the door - it stood  open to air the room, which  was warm, the   weather being close  for the time  of  year came back again, looked in, and walked in, exclaiming loudly, &#x27;Copperfield!   Is it possible?&#x27; It was Mr. Micawber!  It was Mr.  Micawber, with his eye-glass, and his  walking stick, and his shirt-collar, and his genteel air, and the condescending roll  in his voice, all complete! &#x27;My dear Copperfield,&#x27; said Mr. Micawber, putting out his hand, &#x27;this is  indeed a  meeting  which  is  calculated  to impress  the  mind  with  a  sense of  the instability and uncertainty of all human - in short, it is a most  extraordinary meeting.  Walking along the street, reflecting upon the probability of something turning up (of which I am at present rather sanguine), I find a young but valued friend turn up, who is connected with the most eventful period of my life; I may say, with the turning-point of my existence. Copperfield, my dear fellow, how do you do?&#x27; I cannot say - I really cannot say - that I was glad to see Mr. Micawber  there; but I was glad to see him too, and shook hands with him, heartily, inquiring how Mrs. Micawber was. &#x27;Thank you,&#x27; said Mr. Micawber, waving his hand as of old, and settling his chin in  his shirt-collar.   &#x27;She is  tolerably convalescent.   The twins  no  longer derive their sustenance from Nature&#x27;s founts - in short,&#x27; said Mr. Micawber,  in one of his  bursts of confidence,  &#x27;they are weaned  - and Mrs.  Micawber is, at present, my travelling companion.  She  will be rejoiced, Copperfield, to  renew her  acquaintance with  one who  has proved  himself in  all respects  a  worthy minister at the sacred altar of friendship.&#x27; I said I should be delighted to see her. &#x27;You are very good,&#x27; said Mr. Micawber. Mr. Micawber then smiled, settled his chin again, and looked about him. &#x27;I have  discovered my  friend Copperfield,&#x27;  said Mr.  Micawber genteelly,  and without  addressing  himself  particularly  to  anyone,  &#x27;not  in  solitude, but partaking  of a  social meal  in company   with a  widow lady,  and one  who  is apparently her  offspring -  in short,&#x27;  said Mr.  Micawber, in  another of  his bursts of confidence, &#x27;her son.  I shall esteem it an honour to be presented.&#x27; I could do no less, under  these circumstances, than make Mr. Micawber  known to Uriah Heep and his mother; which  I accordingly did.  As they abased  themselves before him, Mr.  Micawber took a  seat, and waved  his hand in  his most courtly manner. &#x27;Any friend  of my  friend Copperfield&#x27;s,&#x27;  said Mr.  Micawber, &#x27;has  a personal claim upon myself.&#x27; &#x27;We are too umble, sir,&#x27;  said Mrs. Heep, &#x27;my son  and me, to be the  friends of Master Copperfield.  He  has been so  good as take  his tea with  us, and we are thankful to him for his company, also to you, sir, for your notice.&#x27; &#x27;Ma&#x27;am,&#x27; returned Mr. Micawber, with a bow, &#x27;you are very obliging: and what are you doing, Copperfield?  Still in the wine trade?&#x27; I was excessively anxious to get Mr. Micawber away; and replied, with my hat  in my hand, and  a very red  face, I have  no doubt, that  I was a  pupil at Doctor Strong&#x27;s. &#x27;A pupil?&#x27; said Mr.  Micawber, raising his eyebrows.   &#x27;I am extremely happy  to hear it.  Although a mind like my friend Copperfield&#x27;s&#x27; - to Uriah and Mrs. Heep - &#x27;does not  require that cultivation  which, without his  knowledge of men  and things, it would require, still it is a rich soil teeming with latent vegetation - in short,&#x27; said Mr. Micawber, smiling, in another burst of confidence, &#x27;it  is an intellect capable of getting up the classics to any extent.&#x27; Uriah, with  his long  hands slowly  twining over  one another,  made a  ghastly writhe from the waist upwards, to express his concurrence in this estimation  of me. &#x27;Shall we go and see Mrs. Micawber, sir?&#x27; I said, to get Mr. Micawber away. &#x27;If you will do her that favour, Copperfield,&#x27; replied Mr. Micawber, rising.  &#x27;I have no scruple in saying, in the presence of our friends here, that I am a  man who  has,  for  some  years,   contended  against  the  pressure  of   pecuniary difficulties.&#x27;  I knew he was certain  to say something of this kind;  he always would be so boastful about  his difficulties.  &#x27;Sometimes I have  risen superior to my difficulties.  Sometimes my difficulties have - in short, have floored me. There have been times when I  have administered a succession of facers  to them; there have been times when they have been too many for me, and I have given  in, and said to Mrs.  Micawber, in the words  of Cato, &quot;Plato, thou  reasonest well. It&#x27;s all up now.  I  can show fight no more.&quot;  But at no time of  my life,&#x27; said Mr. Micawber, &#x27;have I enjoyed a higher degree of satisfaction than in pouring my griefs  (if I  may describe  difficulties, chiefly  arising out  of warrants  of attorney and promissory  notes at two  and four months,  by that word)  into the bosom of my friend Copperfield.&#x27; Mr. Micawber closed  this handsome tribute  by saying, &#x27;Mr.  Heep! Good evening. Mrs. Heep!  Your servant,&#x27; and then walking out with me in his most  fashionable manner, making a good deal of noise on the pavement with his shoes, and  humming a tune as we went. It was a little inn where Mr. Micawber put up, and he occupied a little room  in it,  partitioned  off from  the  commercial room,  and  strongly flavoured  with tobacco-smoke.  I think  it was over  the kitchen, because  a warm greasy  smell appeared to  come up  through the  chinks in  the floor,  and there was a flabby perspiration on the walls.  I know it was near the bar, on account of the  smell of spirits and jingling of glasses.  Here, recumbent on a small sofa, underneath a picture of a race-horse, with her head close to the fire, and her feet pushing the mustard off the dumb-waiter at the other end of the room, was Mrs. Micawber, to whom Mr. Micawber entered first,  saying, &#x27;My dear, allow me to  introduce to you a pupil of Doctor Strong&#x27;s.&#x27; I noticed, by the  by, that although Mr.  Micawber was just as  much confused as ever about my age and standing, he always remembered, as a genteel thing, that I was a pupil of Doctor Strong&#x27;s. Mrs. Micawber was amazed, but very glad to  see me.  I was very glad to see  her too, and, after an  affectionate greeting on both  sides, sat down on  the small sofa near her. &#x27;My dear,&#x27;  said Mr.  Micawber, &#x27;if  you will  mention to  Copperfield what  our present position is, which I have no doubt  he will like to know, I will go  and look  at the  paper the  while, and  see whether  anything turns  up among   the advertisements.&#x27; &#x27;I thought you  were at Plymouth,  ma&#x27;am,&#x27; I said  to Mrs. Micawber,  as he went out. &#x27;My dear Master Copperfield,&#x27; she replied, &#x27;we went to Plymouth.&#x27; &#x27;To be on the spot,&#x27; I hinted. &#x27;Just so,&#x27; said Mrs. Micawber.  &#x27;To be  on the spot.  But, the truth is,  talent is not wanted in the Custom House.   The local influence of my family was  quite unavailing  to  obtain any  employment  in that  department,  for a  man  of Mr. Micawber&#x27;s  abilities.  They  would rather  NOT have  a man  of Mr.   Micawber&#x27;s abilities.  He would only show the deficiency of the others.  Apart from which,&#x27; said Mrs. Micawber, &#x27;I will not  disguise from you, my dear Master  Copperfield, that when that branch  of my family which  is settled in Plymouth,  became aware that Mr.  Micawber was  accompanied by  myself, and  by little  Wilkins and  his sister, and by  the twins, they  did not receive  him with that  ardour which he might have  expected, being  so newly  released from  captivity.  In fact,&#x27; said Mrs. Micawber, lowering her voice, - &#x27;this is between ourselves - our  reception was cool.&#x27; &#x27;Dear me!&#x27; I said. &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said Mrs. Micawber.  &#x27;It is truly painful to contemplate mankind in  such an aspect, Master Copperfield, but our reception was, decidedly, cool.  There is no doubt  about it.   In fact,  that branch  of my  family which  is settled  in Plymouth became  quite personal  to Mr.  Micawber, before  we had  been there  a week.&#x27; I said, and thought, that they ought to be ashamed of themselves. &#x27;Still, so it  was,&#x27; continued Mrs.  Micawber.  &#x27;Under such  circumstances, what could a man of Mr. Micawber&#x27;s spirit  do?  But one obvious course was left.   To borrow, of  that branch  of my  family, the  money to  return to  London, and to return at any sacrifice.&#x27; &#x27;Then you all came back again, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; I said. &#x27;We all came back again,&#x27; replied Mrs. Micawber.  &#x27;Since then, I have  consulted other branches of  my family on  the course which  it is most  expedient for Mr. Micawber  to  take -  for  I maintain  that  he must  take  some course,  Master Copperfield,&#x27; said Mrs. Micawber, argumentatively.   &#x27;It is clear that a  family of six, not including a domestic, cannot live upon air.&#x27; &#x27;Certainly, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said I. &#x27;The opinion of those other branches of my family,&#x27; pursued Mrs. Micawber,  &#x27;is, that Mr. Micawber should immediately turn his attention to coals.&#x27; &#x27;To what, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; &#x27;To coals,&#x27; said Mrs. Micawber.  &#x27;To  the coal trade.  Mr. Micawber was  induced to think, on inquiry, that there might be an opening for a man of his talent  in the Medway Coal Trade.  Then, as Mr. Micawber very properly said, the first step to be taken clearly was, to come and see the Medway.  Which we came and saw.   I say  &quot;we&quot;,  Master Copperfield;  for  I never  will,&#x27;  said Mrs.  Micawber  with emotion, &#x27;I never will desert Mr. Micawber.&#x27; I murmured my admiration and approbation. &#x27;We came,&#x27; repeated Mrs. Micawber, &#x27;and saw the Medway.  My opinion of the  coal trade  on that  river is,  that it  may require  talent, but  that it  certainly requires capital.  Talent, Mr. Micawber has; capital, Mr. Micawber has not.   We saw,  I  think, the  greater  part of  the  Medway; and  that  is my  individual conclusion.  Being so near  here, Mr. Micawber was  of opinion that it  would be rash not to come on, and see the Cathedral.  Firstly, on account of its being so well worth seeing, and our never having seen it; and secondly, on account of the great probability of  something turning up  in a cathedral  town.  We have  been here,&#x27; said Mrs. Micawber, &#x27;three days.  Nothing has, as yet, turned up; and  it may  not  surprise you,  my  dear Master  Copperfield,  so much  as  it would  a stranger, to know that we are  at present waiting for a remittance  from London, to discharge our pecuniary obligations at this hotel.  Until the arrival of that remittance,&#x27; said Mrs. Micawber with much feeling, &#x27;I am cut off from my home (I allude to lodgings in Pentonville), from my boy and girl, and from my twins.&#x27; I felt the utmost sympathy for Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in this anxious  extremity, and said as much to Mr. Micawber, who now returned: adding that I only wished  I had money enough, to  lend them the amount  they needed.  Mr. Micawber&#x27;s  answer expressed  the  disturbance  of  his mind.   He  said,  shaking  hands with  me, &#x27;Copperfield, you are a true friend; but  when the worst comes to the worst,  no man  is  without a  friend  who is  possessed  of shaving  materials.&#x27;   At this dreadful  hint  Mrs. Micawber  threw  her arms  round  Mr. Micawber&#x27;s  neck  and entreated him to be calm.  He wept; but so far recovered, almost immediately, as to ring the bell for the waiter, and bespeak a hot kidney pudding and a plate of shrimps for breakfast in the morning. When I took  my leave of  them, they both  pressed me so  much to come  and dine before they went away, that I could not refuse.  But, as I knew I could not come next day, when I should have a good deal to prepare in the evening, Mr. Micawber arranged that  he would  call at  Doctor Strong&#x27;s  in the  course of the morning (having  a presentiment  that the  remittance would  arrive by  that post),  and propose the day after, if it would suit me better.  Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon, and found  Mr. Micawber in the parlour; who  had called to say that  the dinner would  take place as  proposed. When I  asked him if the remittance had come, he pressed my hand and departed. As I was looking out of window  that same evening, it surprised me, and  made me rather uneasy, to see Mr. Micawber and  Uriah Heep walk past, arm in arm:  Uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him, and Mr. Micawber taking a bland delight in extending his  patronage to Uriah.  But  I was still more  surprised, when I went to the little hotel next day at the appointed dinner-hour, which was four o&#x27;clock, to find, from what Mr.  Micawber said, that he had gone home  with Uriah, and had drunk brandy-and-water at Mrs. Heep&#x27;s. &#x27;And I&#x27;ll tell you what, my  dear Copperfield,&#x27; said Mr. Micawber, &#x27;your  friend Heep is a young fellow who might be attorney-general. If I had known that  young man, at the period when my difficulties came to a crisis, all I can say is, that I believe my  creditors would have  been a great  deal better managed  than they were.&#x27; I hardly understood how this could have been, seeing that Mr. Micawber had  paid them nothing at all as it was; but I did not like to ask.  Neither did I like to say, that I hoped he had not  been too communicative to Uriah; or to  inquire if they had talked much about me.  I was afraid of hurting Mr. Micawber&#x27;s feelings, or,  at  all  events, Mrs.  Micawber&#x27;s,  she  being very  sensitive;  but  I was uncomfortable about it, too, and often thought about it afterwards. We had a beautiful little dinner.  Quite an elegant dish of fish; the kidney-end of a  loin of  veal, roasted;  fried sausage-meat;  a partridge,  and a pudding. There was wine, and there was strong ale; and after dinner Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands. Mr. Micawber was uncommonly convivial.  I  never saw him such good company.   He made  his face  shine with  the punch,  so that  it looked  as if  it had   been varnished all over.  He got cheerfully sentimental about the town, and  proposed success to it; observing that Mrs. Micawber and himself had been made  extremely snug and comfortable there and that  he never should forget the agreeable  hours they had  passed in  Canterbury.  He  proposed me  afterwards; and  he, and Mrs. Micawber, and I, took a review of our past acquaintance, in the course of  which we sold  the property  all over  again.  Then  I proposed  Mrs. Micawber: or, at least, said, modestly, &#x27;If you&#x27;ll allow me, Mrs. Micawber, I shall now have  the pleasure of drinking  your health, ma&#x27;am.&#x27;   On which Mr.  Micawber delivered an eulogium on Mrs.  Micawber&#x27;s character, and  said she had  ever been his  guide, philosopher,  and friend,  and that  he would  recommend me,  when I  came to  a marrying time of life, to marry such another woman, if such another woman  could be found. As the punch disappeared, Mr. Micawber became still more friendly and convivial. Mrs. Micawber&#x27;s spirits becoming elevated, too, we sang &#x27;Auld Lang Syne&#x27;.   When we came  to &#x27;Here&#x27;s  a hand,  my trusty  frere&#x27;, we  all joined  hands round the table; and  when we  declared we  would &#x27;take  a right  gude Willie Waught&#x27;, and hadn&#x27;t the least idea what it meant, we were really affected. In a word, I never saw anybody so thoroughly jovial as Mr. Micawber was, down to the very last moment  of the evening, when  I took a hearty  farewell of himself and his amiable wife.  Consequently, I  was not prepared, at seven o&#x27;clock  next morning, to  receive the  following communication,  dated half  past nine in the evening; a quarter of an hour after I had left him: - &#x27;My DEAR YOUNG FRIEND, &#x27;The die is cast - all is over.   Hiding the ravages of care with a sickly  mask of mirth, I have not  informed you, this evening, that  there is no hope of  the remittance!  Under these circumstances, alike humiliating to endure, humiliating to  contemplate, and  humiliating to  relate, I  have discharged  the  pecuniary liability  contracted at  this establishment,  by giving  a note  of hand,  made payable fourteen days after date, at my residence, Pentonville, London.  When it becomes due, it will not be taken  up.  The result is destruction.  The bolt  is impending, and the tree must fall. &#x27;Let the wretched man who now addresses you, my dear Copperfield, be a beacon to you through life.  He writes with that intention, and in that hope.  If he could think himself of so much use, one gleam of day might, by possibility,  penetrate into the cheerless dungeon of his remaining existence - though his longevity is, at present (to say the least of it), extremely problematical. &#x27;This is the last communication, my dear Copperfield, you will ever receive &#x27;From &#x27;The &#x27;Beggared Outcast, &#x27;WILKINS MICAWBER.&#x27; I was so shocked  by the contents of  this heart-rending letter, that  I ran off directly towards the little hotel with the  intention of taking it on my way  to Doctor Strong&#x27;s, and trying to soothe Mr. Micawber with a word of comfort.  But, half-way there, I met the London coach with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber up behind; Mr. Micawber, the  very picture  of tranquil  enjoyment, smiling  at Mrs. Micawber&#x27;s conversation, eating walnuts out of a  paper bag, with a bottle sticking  out of his breast  pocket.  As  they did  not see  me, I  thought it  best, all  things considered, not  to see  them.  So,  with a  great weight  taken off  my mind, I turned into a by-street that was the  nearest way to school, and felt, upon  the whole,  relieved that  they were  gone; though  I still  liked them  very  much, nevertheless. CHAPTER 18 A RETROSPECT My school-days!   The silent  gliding on  of my  existence -  the unseen, unfelt progress of my life - from childhood up  to youth! Let me think, as I look  back upon that flowing water, now a dry channel overgrown with leaves, whether  there are any marks along its course, by which I can remember how it ran. A moment, and I  occupy my place in  the Cathedral, where we  all went together, every Sunday morning, assembling first  at school for that purpose.   The earthy smell,  the  sunless  air,  the  sensation of  the  world  being  shut  out, the resounding of the organ through the black and white arched galleries and aisles, are wings that take me back,  and hold me hovering above  those days, in a  half sleeping and half-waking dream. I am not the last boy in the school.  I have risen in a few months, over several heads.  But  the first  boy seems  to me  a mighty  creature, dwelling afar off, whose giddy height is unattainable. Agnes  says &#x27;No,&#x27; but I say &#x27;Yes,&#x27;  and tell her that she little  thinks what stores of  knowledge have been mastered  by the wonderful Being, at whose place she thinks I, even I, weak aspirant, may  arrive in time.  He is not my private friend and public patron, as Steerforth was,  but I hold him in  a reverential respect.  I  chiefly wonder what he&#x27;ll  be, when he leaves Doctor Strong&#x27;s, and what mankind  will do to maintain any place  against him. But who is this that breaks upon me?  This is Miss Shepherd, whom I love. Miss Shepherd is  a boarder at  the Misses Nettingalls&#x27;  establishment.  I adore Miss Shepherd.  She is a little girl, in a spencer, with a round face and  curly flaxen hair.  The Misses Nettingalls&#x27; young ladies come to the Cathedral too.  I cannot  look  upon my  book,  for I  must  look upon  Miss  Shepherd.  When  the choristers chaunt, I hear Miss Shepherd.  In the service I mentally insert  Miss Shepherd&#x27;s name - I put her in among the Royal Family. At home, in my own  room, I am sometimes moved to cry out, &#x27;Oh, Miss Shepherd!&#x27; in a transport of love. For some time, I am doubtful  of Miss Shepherd&#x27;s feelings, but, at  length, Fate being propitious, we meet  at the dancing-school.  I  have Miss Shepherd for  my partner.  I touch Miss Shepherd&#x27;s glove, and  feel a thrill go up the right  arm of my jacket, and come out at my  hair.  I say nothing to Miss Shepherd, but  we understand each other.  Miss Shepherd and myself live but to be united. Why do I secretly give Miss Shepherd twelve Brazil nuts for a present, I wonder? They are not expressive of affection,  they are difficult to pack into  a parcel of any regular shape, they are hard  to crack, even in room doors, and  they are oily when cracked; yet I feel that they are appropriate to Miss Shepherd.  Soft, seedy biscuits,  also, I  bestow upon  Miss Shepherd;  and oranges  innumerable. Once, I kiss Miss  Shepherd in the cloak-room.  Ecstasy!  What are my  agony and indignation next day,  when I hear  a flying rumour  that the Misses  Nettingall have stood Miss Shepherd in the stocks for turning in her toes! Miss Shepherd being the one pervading theme and vision of my life, how do I ever come to break  with her?  I  can&#x27;t conceive.  And  yet a coolness  grows between Miss Shepherd and myself.   Whispers reach me of  Miss Shepherd having said  she wished I wouldn&#x27;t stare  so, and  having  avowed a preference  for Master  Jones for Jones! a boy  of no merit whatever!   The gulf between me  and Miss Shepherd widens.  At last,  one day,  I meet  the Misses  Nettingalls&#x27; establishment  out walking.   Miss  Shepherd  makes a  face  as  she goes  by,  and  laughs to  her companion.  All is over.  The  devotion of a life -  it seems a life, it  is all the same - is at an end; Miss Shepherd comes out of the morning service, and the Royal Family know her no more. I am higher in the school, and no one breaks my peace.  I am not at all  polite, now, to the Misses Nettingalls&#x27; young ladies, and shouldn&#x27;t dote on any of them, if they were twice as many and twenty  times as beautiful.  I think the  dancing school a tiresome affair, and wonder why the girls can&#x27;t dance by themselves and leave us alone.  I am growing great in Latin verses, and neglect the laces of my boots.  Doctor Strong refers to me in public as a promising young scholar.   Mr. Dick is wild with joy, and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post. The shade  of a  young butcher  rises, like  the apparition  of an armed head in Macbeth.   Who  is  this young  butcher?   He  is the  terror  of  the youth  of Canterbury.  There is a  vague belief abroad, that  the beef suet with  which he anoints his hair gives him unnatural strength, and that he is a match for a man. He is a broad-faced, bull-necked, young butcher,  with rough red cheeks, an  ill conditioned mind, and an injurious tongue.  His main use of this tongue, is,  to disparage Doctor Strong&#x27;s young gentlemen.  He says, publicly, that if they want anything he&#x27;ll give it &#x27;em.  He names individuals among them (myself  included), whom he could undertake to settle with one hand, and the other tied behind  him. He  waylays  the  smaller  boys to  punch  their  unprotected  heads, and  calls challenges after me in the open streets.  For these sufficient reasons I resolve to fight the butcher. It is a summer evening, down in a green hollow, at the corner of a wall.  I meet the butcher by  appointment.  I am  attended by a  select body of  our boys; the butcher,  by  two  other  butchers,   a  young  publican,  and  a   sweep.   The preliminaries are adjusted, and the butcher and myself stand face to face.  In a moment the  butcher lights  ten thousand  candles out  of my  left eyebrow.   In another moment, I don&#x27;t know where the wall is, or where I am, or where  anybody is.  I hardly know which is myself and which the butcher, we are always in  such a tangle and tussle, knocking about upon the trodden grass.  Sometimes I see the butcher, bloody but confident;  sometimes I see nothing,  and sit gasping on  my second&#x27;s knee; sometimes I go in at the butcher madly, and cut my knuckles  open against his face, without appearing to discompose him at all.  At last I  awake, very queer about the  head, as from a  giddy sleep, and see  the butcher walking off, congratulated by  the two other  butchers and the  sweep and publican,  and putting on his coat as he goes; from which I augur, justly, that the victory  is his. I am taken home in a sad plight,  and I have beef-steaks put to my eyes,  and am rubbed with vinegar and brandy, and find a great puffy place bursting out on  my upper lip, which swells immoderately.  For three or four days I remain at  home, a very ill-looking  subject, with a  green shade over  my eyes; and  I should be very dull, but that Agnes is a sister to me, and condoles with me, and reads  to me, and makes  the time light  and happy.  Agnes  has my confidence  completely, always; I tell her all about the butcher, and the wrongs he has heaped upon  me; she thinks  I couldn&#x27;t  have done  otherwise than  fight the  butcher, while she shrinks and trembles at my having fought him. Time has stolen on  unobserved, for Adams is  not the head-boy in  the days that are come  now, nor  has he  been this  many and  many a  day. Adams has left the school so long, that when he comes back, on a visit to Doctor Strong, there  are not many there, besides  myself, who know him.   Adams is going to  be called to the bar almost  directly, and is  to be an  advocate, and to  wear a wig.   I am surprised to  find him  a meeker  man than  I had  thought, and less imposing in appearance.  He has not staggered the world yet, either; for it goes on (as well as I can make out) pretty much the same as if he had never joined it. A blank, through which  the warriors of poetry  and history march on  in stately hosts that seem to have no end - and what comes next! I am the head-boy, now!  I look down on the line of boys below me, with a condescending interest in such of them as bring to my  mind the boy I was  myself, when I first came  there.  That little fellow seems to be no part of me; I remember him as something left behind upon the road of  life - as something  I have passed, rather  than have actually been - and almost think of him as of someone else. And the little girl I  saw on that first day  at Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s, where is  she? Gone also.  In her stead, the perfect likeness of the picture, a child  likeness no more, moves about the house; and Agnes - my sweet sister, as I call her in my thoughts, my counsellor  and friend, the  better angel of  the lives of  all who come within her calm, good, self-denying influence - is quite a woman. What other  changes have  come upon  me, besides  the changes  in my  growth and looks, and in the knowledge I have garnered all this while?  I wear a gold watch and chain, a  ring upon my  little finger, and  a long-tailed coat;  and I use a great deal of bear&#x27;s grease -  which, taken in conjunction with the  ring, looks bad.  Am I in love again?  I am.  I worship the eldest Miss Larkins. The eldest Miss Larkins is not a little girl.  She is a tall, dark,  black-eyed, fine figure  of a  woman.  The  eldest Miss  Larkins is  not a  chicken; for the youngest Miss Larkins is  not that, and the  eldest must be three  or four years older.  Perhaps the eldest Miss Larkins may be about thirty.  My passion for her is beyond all bounds. The eldest Miss Larkins  knows officers.  It is  an awful thing to  bear.  I see them speaking to her in the street.  I see them cross the way to meet her,  when her bonnet (she has a bright taste in bonnets) is seen coming down the pavement, accompanied by her sister&#x27;s bonnet.  She laughs and talks, and seems to like it. I spend a good deal of my own spare time in walking up and down to meet her.  If I can bow to her once in the day (I know her to bow to, knowing Mr. Larkins),  I am happier.  I deserve a bow now  and then.  The raging agonies I suffer  on the night of the  Race Ball, where  I know the  eldest Miss Larkins  will be dancing with the  military, ought  to have  some compensation,  if there  be even-handed justice in the world. My passion takes away my appetite, and makes me wear my newest silk  neckerchief continually.  I have no relief but in putting on my best clothes, and having  my boots cleaned over and over again.  I  seem, then, to be worthier of the  eldest Miss Larkins.   Everything that  belongs to  her, or  is connected  with her, is precious to me. Mr. Larkins (a gruff  old gentleman with a double chin, and  one of his eyes immovable in his head) is fraught with interest to me. When I  can&#x27;t meet his daughter, I go  where I am likely to  meet him. To say &#x27;How  do you do, Mr. Larkins?   Are the  young ladies  and all  the family  quite well?&#x27; seems so pointed, that I blush. I think continually about my age.  Say I am seventeen, and say that seventeen is young for the eldest  Miss Larkins, what  of that? Besides,  I shall be  one-and twenty in no time almost.  I regularly take walks outside Mr. Larkins&#x27;s house in the evening, though it  cuts me to the  heart to see the  officers go in, or  to hear them up in the drawing-room, where the eldest Miss Larkins plays the  harp. I even walk, on  two or three occasions,  in a sickly, spoony  manner, round and round the house after the family are gone to bed, wondering which is the  eldest Miss Larkins&#x27;s chamber (and pitching, I dare say now, on Mr. Larkins&#x27;s instead); wishing  that a  fire would  burst out;  that the  assembled crowd  would  stand appalled; that I, dashing through them with a ladder, might rear it against  her window, save  her in  my arms,  go back  for something  she had left behind, and perish in the flames.  For I am generally disinterested in my love, and think  I could be content to make a figure before Miss Larkins, and expire. Generally, but not always.  Sometimes  brighter visions rise before me.   When I dress (the occupation  of two hours),  for a great  ball given at  the Larkins&#x27;s (the anticipation of three weeks), I  indulge my fancy with pleasing images.   I picture myself taking courage to make a declaration to Miss Larkins.  I  picture Miss  Larkins  sinking  her  head  upon  my  shoulder,  and  saying,  &#x27;Oh,   Mr. Copperfield, can I believe  my ears!&#x27; I picture  Mr. Larkins waiting on  me next morning, and saying, &#x27;My dear Copperfield, my daughter has told me all. Youth is no objection.  Here are  twenty thousand pounds.  Be  happy!&#x27; I picture my  aunt relenting, and blessing us; and Mr. Dick and Doctor Strong being present at  the marriage ceremony.  I am  a sensible fellow, I  believe - I believe,  on looking back, I mean  - and modest  I am sure;  but all this  goes on notwithstanding. I repair  to  the enchanted  house,  where there  are  lights, chattering,  music, flowers, officers (I am sorry to see),  and the eldest Miss Larkins, a blaze  of beauty.  She is dressed in blue, with blue flowers in her hair -  forget-me-nots - as if SHE had any need to  wear forget-me-nots.  It is the first really  grown up party that I have ever been invited to, and I am a little uncomfortable;  for I appear not to belong to anybody, and nobody appears to have anything to say to me, except Mr. Larkins, who asks  me how my schoolfellows are, which  he needn&#x27;t do, as I have not come there to be insulted. But after I have stood  in the doorway for some  time, and feasted my eyes  upon the goddess of my heart, she approaches me - she, the eldest Miss Larkins! - and asks me pleasantly, if I dance? I stammer, with a bow, &#x27;With you, Miss Larkins.&#x27; &#x27;With no one else?&#x27; inquires Miss Larkins. &#x27;I should have no pleasure in dancing with anyone else.&#x27; Miss Larkins laughs and blushes (or  I think she blushes), and says,  &#x27;Next time but one, I shall be very glad.&#x27; The time arrives.  &#x27;It is a  waltz, I think,&#x27; Miss Larkins doubtfully  observes, when I present myself.  &#x27;Do you waltz?  If not, Captain Bailey -&#x27; But I do waltz (pretty well, too, as it happens), and I take Miss Larkins out. I take her  sternly from  the side  of Captain  Bailey. He  is wretched, I have no doubt; but he is nothing  to me.  I have been  wretched, too.  I waltz with  the eldest Miss Larkins!  I don&#x27;t know where, among whom, or how long.  I only  know that I swim about in space, with a blue angel, in a state of blissful  delirium, until I find  myself alone with  her in a  little room, resting  on a sofa.  She admires a flower  (pink camellia  japonica, price  half-a-crown), in  my  button hole.  I give it her, and say: &#x27;I ask an inestimable price for it, Miss Larkins.&#x27; &#x27;Indeed!  What is that?&#x27; returns Miss Larkins. &#x27;A flower of yours, that I may treasure it as a miser does gold.&#x27; &#x27;You&#x27;re a bold boy,&#x27; says Miss Larkins.  &#x27;There.&#x27; She gives  it me,  not displeased;  and I  put it  to my  lips, and then into my breast.  Miss Larkins, laughing, draws her  hand through my arm, and says,  &#x27;Now take me back to Captain Bailey.&#x27; I am lost in the recollection  of this delicious interview, and the  waltz, when she comes to me again, with a plain elderly gentleman who has been playing whist all night, upon her arm, and says: &#x27;Oh! here is my bold friend!  Mr. Chestle wants to know you, Mr. Copperfield.&#x27; I feel at once that he is a friend of the family, and am much gratified. &#x27;I admire your taste,  sir,&#x27; says Mr. Chestle.   &#x27;It does you credit.  I suppose you don&#x27;t take much interest in hops; but I am a pretty large grower myself; and if you ever like to come  over to  our neighbourhood - neighbourhood  of Ashford and take a run about our place, -we shall be glad for you to stop as long as you like.&#x27; I thank Mr. Chestle warmly, and shake hands.  I think I am in a happy dream.   I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins once again.  She says I waltz so well!  I  go home in a state of unspeakable bliss, and waltz in imagination, all night  long, with my arm round the blue waist of my dear divinity.  For some days afterwards, I am lost  in rapturous reflections;  but I neither  see her in  the street, nor when I call.  I  am imperfectly consoled for  this disappointment by the  sacred pledge, the perished flower. &#x27;Trotwood,&#x27; says Agnes, one day after dinner.  &#x27;Who do you think is going to  be married tomorrow?  Someone you admire.&#x27; &#x27;Not you, I suppose, Agnes?&#x27; &#x27;Not me!&#x27; raising her cheerful face from the music she is copying. &#x27;Do you  hear him, Papa? - The eldest Miss Larkins.&#x27; &#x27;To - to Captain Bailey?&#x27; I have just enough power to ask. &#x27;No; to no Captain.  To Mr. Chestle, a hop-grower.&#x27; I am terribly dejected for about a week  or two.  I take off my ring, I  wear my worst clothes, I  use no bear&#x27;s  grease, and I  frequently lament over  the late Miss Larkins&#x27;s faded flower. Being, by  that time, rather tired of this  kind of life, and having received new provocation  from the butcher, I throw the  flower away, go out with the butcher, and gloriously defeat him. This,  and the  resumption of  my ring,   as well  as of  the bear&#x27;s  grease  in moderation, are the last marks I can discern, now, in my progress to seventeen. CHAPTER 19 I LOOK ABOUT ME, AND MAKE A DISCOVERY I am doubtful whether I was at heart glad or sorry, when my school-days drew  to an end, and the time came for my leaving Doctor Strong&#x27;s.  I had been very happy there,  I  had  a  great  attachment for  the  Doctor,  and  I  was eminent  and distinguished in that little  world.  For these reasons  I was sorry to  go; but for other reasons,  unsubstantial enough, I  was glad.  Misty  ideas of being  a young man at my own disposal, of the importance attaching to a young man at  his own disposal, of the  wonderful things to be  seen and done by  that magnificent animal, and the wonderful effects he could not fail to make upon society,  lured me away.   So powerful  were these  visionary considerations  in my boyish mind, that  I seem,  according to  my present  way of  thinking, to  have left  school without natural regret.  The separation has not made the impression on me,  that other separations have.  I try in vain  to recall how I felt about it,  and what its circumstances were; but it is  not momentous in my recollection.  I  suppose the opening prospect confused me.  I know that my juvenile experiences went  for little or nothing then; and that life was more like a great fairy story, which I was just about to begin to read, than anything else. MY aunt and I had held many grave deliberations on the calling to which I should be devoted.  For a year or more I had endeavoured to find a satisfactory  answer to  her often-repeated  question, &#x27;What  I would  like to  be?&#x27;  But  I had   no particular liking, that I  could discover, for anything.   If I could have  been inspired with a knowledge of the  science of navigation, taken the command  of a fast-sailing expedition,  and gone  round the  world on  a triumphant  voyage of discovery, I think  I might have  considered myself completely  suited.  But, in the absence of any such miraculous  provision, my desire was to apply  myself to some pursuit that would not lie too heavily upon her purse; and to do my duty in it, whatever it might be. Mr. Dick  had regularly  assisted at  our councils,  with a  meditative and sage demeanour.  He never made a suggestion  but once; and on that occasion  (I don&#x27;t know  what put  it in  his head),   he suddenly  proposed that  I should  be  &#x27;a Brazier&#x27;.  My aunt  received this proposal  so very ungraciously,  that he never ventured on a second; but ever afterwards confined himself to looking watchfully at her for her suggestions, and rattling his money. &#x27;Trot, I tell  you what, my  dear,&#x27; said my  aunt, one morning  in the Christmas season when I left school: &#x27;as this  knotty point is still unsettled, and as  we must not make a mistake in our decision if we can help it, I think we had better take a little breathing-time. In the meanwhile, you must try to look at it  from a new point of view, and not as a schoolboy.&#x27; &#x27;I will, aunt.&#x27; &#x27;It has occurred to me,&#x27; pursued my  aunt, &#x27;that a little change, and a  glimpse of life out of doors,  may be useful in helping  you to know your own  mind, and form a cooler judgement.  Suppose you were  to go down into the old part  of the country again, for instance, and see  that - that out-of-the-way woman with  the savagest  of  names,&#x27;  said my  aunt,  rubbing  her nose,  for  she  could never thoroughly forgive Peggotty for being so called. &#x27;Of all things in the world, aunt, I should like it best!&#x27; &#x27;Well,&#x27; said my aunt, &#x27;that&#x27;s lucky, for I should like it too.  But it&#x27;s natural and  rational that  you should  like it.   And I  am very  well persuaded   that whatever you do, Trot, will always be natural and rational.&#x27; &#x27;I hope so, aunt.&#x27; &#x27;Your sister, Betsey Trotwood,&#x27;  said my aunt, &#x27;would  have been as natural  and rational a girl as ever breathed.  You&#x27;ll be worthy of her, won&#x27;t you?&#x27; &#x27;I hope I shall be worthy of YOU, aunt.  That will be enough for me.&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s a mercy  that poor dear  baby of a  mother of yours  didn&#x27;t live,&#x27; said my aunt, looking at me approvingly, &#x27;or she&#x27;d have been so vain of her boy by  this time, that her soft little head would have been completely turned, if there  was anything of it left to turn.&#x27;  (My  aunt always excused any weakness of her  own in my  behalf, by  transferring it  in this  way to  my poor mother.) &#x27;Bless me, Trotwood, how you do remind me of her!&#x27; &#x27;Pleasantly, I hope, aunt?&#x27; said I. &#x27;He&#x27;s as like her, Dick,&#x27; said my aunt, emphatically, &#x27;he&#x27;s as like her, as  she was that afternoon before she began to fret - bless my heart, he&#x27;s as like  her, as he can look at me out of his two eyes!&#x27; &#x27;Is he indeed?&#x27; said Mr. Dick. &#x27;And he&#x27;s like David, too,&#x27; said my aunt, decisively. &#x27;He is very like David!&#x27; said Mr. Dick. &#x27;But what I want you to be, Trot,&#x27; resumed my aunt, &#x27;- I don&#x27;t mean  physically, but morally;  you are  very well  physically -  is, a  firm fellow.  A fine firm fellow, with a will  of your own.  With  resolution,&#x27; said my aunt,  shaking her cap at me, and clenching  her hand.  &#x27;With determination.  With  character, Trot with strength of character that is not to be influenced, except on good  reason, by anybody, or  by anything.  That&#x27;s  what I want  you to be.   That&#x27;s what your father and mother might  both have been, Heaven  knows, and been the  better for it.&#x27; I intimated that I hoped I should be what she described. &#x27;That you may begin, in  a small way, to have  a reliance upon yourself, and  to act for yourself,&#x27; said my aunt, &#x27;I shall send you upon your trip, alone.  I did think, once, of Mr. Dick&#x27;s going with you; but, on second thoughts, I shall keep him to take care of me.&#x27; Mr. Dick,  for a  moment, looked  a little  disappointed; until  the honour  and dignity  of having  to take  care of  the most  wonderful woman  in the   world, restored the sunshine to his face. &#x27;Besides,&#x27; said my aunt, &#x27;there&#x27;s the Memorial -&#x27; &#x27;Oh, certainly,&#x27; said  Mr. Dick, in  a hurry, &#x27;I  intend, Trotwood, to  get that done immediately - it really must be  done immediately! And then it will go  in, you know - and then -&#x27; said Mr. Dick, after checking himself, and pausing a long time, &#x27;there&#x27;ll be a pretty kettle of fish!&#x27; In pursuance of my aunt&#x27;s kind scheme, I was shortly afterwards fitted out  with a handsome purse  of money, and  a portmanteau, and  tenderly dismissed upon  my expedition.  At  parting, my  aunt gave  me some  good advice,  and a  good many kisses; and said that as her object was that I should look about me, and  should think a little, she would recommend me to stay a few days in London, if I  liked it, either on my way down into Suffolk, or in coming back.  In a word, I was  at liberty to do what I would, for three weeks or a month; and no other  conditions were imposed  upon my  freedom than  the before-mentioned  thinking and  looking about me, and a pledge to write three times a week and faithfully report myself. I went to Canterbury first, that I  might take leave of Agnes and Mr.  Wickfield (my old room in whose  house I had not yet  relinquished), and also of the  good Doctor.  Agnes was very glad to see me, and told me that the house had not  been like itself since I had left it. &#x27;I am sure I  am not like myself  when I am away,&#x27;  said I.  &#x27;I seem  to want my right hand, when I miss you.  Though that&#x27;s not saying much; for there&#x27;s no head in my right hand, and no heart.  Everyone who knows you, consults with you,  and is guided by you, Agnes.&#x27; &#x27;Everyone who knows me, spoils me, I believe,&#x27; she answered, smiling. &#x27;No.  it&#x27;s because you  are like no  one else.  You  are so good,  and so  sweet tempered.  You have such a gentle nature, and you are always right.&#x27; &#x27;You talk,&#x27; said Agnes, breaking into a pleasant laugh, as she sat at work,  &#x27;as if I were the late Miss Larkins.&#x27; &#x27;Come!  It&#x27;s  not fair  to abuse  my confidence,&#x27;  I answered,  reddening at the recollection of my blue enslaver.  &#x27;But  I shall confide in you, just  the same, Agnes.  I can never grow out of that.  Whenever I fall into trouble, or fall  in love, I shall always tell  you, if you&#x27;ll let me  - even when I come  to fall in love in earnest.&#x27; &#x27;Why, you have always been in earnest!&#x27; said Agnes, laughing again. &#x27;Oh! that was  as a child,  or a schoolboy,&#x27;  said I, laughing  in my turn,  not without being a little  shame-faced.  &#x27;Times are altering  now, and I suppose  I shall be in  a terrible state  of earnestness one  day or other.   My wonder is, that you are not in earnest yourself, by this time, Agnes.&#x27; Agnes laughed again, and shook her head. &#x27;Oh, I know you are not!&#x27; said I,  &#x27;because if you had been you would have  told me.  Or at least&#x27; - for I saw a faint blush in her face, &#x27;you would have let  me find it out for  myself.  But there is  no one that I  know of, who deserves  to love you, Agnes.  Someone of a nobler character, and more worthy altogether than anyone I have ever seen  here, must rise up, before  I give my consent.  In  the time to come, I shall have a wary  eye on all admirers; and shall exact a  great deal from the successful one, I assure you.&#x27; We had gone on, so far, in a mixture of confidential jest and earnest, that  had long grown naturally out of our familiar relations, begun as mere children.  But Agnes, now suddenly  lifting up her  eyes to mine,  and speaking in  a different manner, said: &#x27;Trotwood, there is something that  I want to ask you,  and that I may not  have another opportunity of asking for a long time, perhaps - something I would  ask, I think, of no one else.  Have you observed any gradual alteration in Papa?&#x27; I had  observed it,  and had  often wondered  whether she  had too.  I must have shown as much, now, in my face; for  her eyes were in a moment cast down,  and I saw tears in them. &#x27;Tell me what it is,&#x27; she said, in a low voice. &#x27;I think - shall I be quite plain, Agnes, liking him so much?&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; she said. &#x27;I think he does himself no good by the habit that has increased upon him  since I first came here.  He is often very nervous - or I fancy so.&#x27; &#x27;It is not fancy,&#x27; said Agnes, shaking her head. &#x27;His hand trembles,  his speech is  not plain, and  his eyes look  wild.  I have remarked that  at those  times, and  when he  is least  like himself, he is most certain to be wanted on some business.&#x27; &#x27;By Uriah,&#x27; said Agnes. &#x27;Yes; and the sense of being unfit for it, or of not having understood it, or of having shown his  condition in spite  of himself, seems  to make him  so uneasy, that next  day he  is worse,  and next  day worse,  and so  he becomes jaded and haggard.  Do not be alarmed by what I  say, Agnes, but in this state I saw  him, only the other evening, lay down his  head upon his desk, and shed tears  like a child.&#x27; Her hand passed softly before my lips while I was yet speaking, and in a  moment she had met her father at the door of the room, and was hanging on his shoulder. The expression of her face,  as they both looked towards  me, I felt to be  very touching.  There was such  deep fondness for him,  and gratitude to him  for all his love and care, in her beautiful look; and there was such a fervent appeal to me to deal  tenderly by him,  even in my  inmost thoughts, and  to let no  harsh construction find any place against him; she  was, at once, so proud of him  and devoted to him, yet so compassionate and sorry, and so reliant upon me to be so, too; that nothing she could have said would have expressed more to me, or  moved me more. We were to  drink tea at  the Doctor&#x27;s.  We  went there at  the usual hour;  and round the study fireside found the  Doctor, and his young wife, and  her mother. The Doctor,  who made  as much  of my  going away  as if  I were going to China, received me as an honoured guest; and called  for a log of wood to be thrown  on the fire, that he might see the face of his old pupil reddening in the blaze. &#x27;I shall not see many more  new faces in Trotwood&#x27;s stead, Wickfield,&#x27;  said the Doctor,  warming  his  hands;  &#x27;I  am getting  lazy,  and  want  ease.   I shall relinquish all my young people in another six months, and lead a quieter life.&#x27; &#x27;You have said so, any time these ten years, Doctor,&#x27; Mr. Wickfield answered. &#x27;But now I mean to do it,&#x27;  returned the Doctor.  &#x27;My first master will  succeed me - I am in earnest at last - so you&#x27;ll soon have to arrange our contracts, and to bind us firmly to them, like a couple of knaves.&#x27; &#x27;And to take care,&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield, &#x27;that you&#x27;re not imposed on, eh?  As you certainly would be, in any contract  you should make for yourself.  Well!   I am ready.  There are worse tasks than that, in my calling.&#x27; &#x27;I shall have nothing to think of then,&#x27; said the Doctor, with a smile, &#x27;but  my Dictionary; and this other contract-bargain - Annie.&#x27; As Mr. Wickfield  glanced towards her,  sitting at the  tea table by  Agnes, she seemed to me to avoid his look with such unwonted hesitation and timidity,  that his attention  became fixed  upon her,  as if  something were  suggested to  his thoughts. &#x27;There is a post come in from India, I observe,&#x27; he said, after a short silence. &#x27;By the by! and letters from Mr. Jack Maldon!&#x27; said the Doctor. &#x27;Indeed!&#x27; &#x27;Poor dear Jack!&#x27; said Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head.  &#x27;That trying climate! - like  living, they  tell me,  on a  sand-heap, underneath  a  burning glass!  He looked strong, but he wasn&#x27;t.  My dear Doctor, it was his spirit, not his constitution, that he ventured on so boldly.  Annie, my dear, I am sure  you must perfectly recollect  that your cousin  never was strong  - not what  can be called ROBUST, you know,&#x27; said Mrs. Markleham, with emphasis, and looking  round upon us generally, &#x27;- from the  time when my daughter and himself  were children together, and walking about, arm-in-arm, the livelong day.&#x27; Annie, thus addressed, made no reply. &#x27;Do I  gather from  what you  say, ma&#x27;am,  that Mr.  Maldon is  ill?&#x27; asked  Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;Ill!&#x27; replied the Old Soldier.  &#x27;My dear sir, he&#x27;s all sorts of things.&#x27; &#x27;Except well?&#x27; said Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;Except well, indeed!&#x27; said  the Old Soldier.  &#x27;He  has had dreadful strokes  of the sun, no doubt, and jungle fevers and agues, and every kind of thing you  can mention.  As to his liver,&#x27; said  the Old Soldier resignedly, &#x27;that, of  course, he gave up altogether, when he first went out!&#x27; &#x27;Does he say all this?&#x27; asked Mr. Wickfield. &#x27;Say?  My dear sir,&#x27; returned Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head and her fan, &#x27;you little know my poor Jack Maldon when you ask that question.  Say?  Not he.   You might drag him at the heels of four wild horses first.&#x27; &#x27;Mama!&#x27; said Mrs. Strong. &#x27;Annie, my dear,&#x27; returned her mother, &#x27;once for all, I must really beg that you will not interfere  with me, unless  it is to  confirm what I  say.  You know as well as I do that your cousin Maldon would be dragged at the heels of any number of wild horses - why should I confine myself to four!  I WON&#x27;T confine myself to four - eight,  sixteen, two-and-thirty, rather  than say anything  calculated to overturn the Doctor&#x27;s plans.&#x27; &#x27;Wickfield&#x27;s plans,&#x27; said the Doctor, stroking his face, and looking  penitently at his  adviser.  &#x27;That  is to  say, our  joint plans  for him.   I said myself, abroad or at home.&#x27; &#x27;And I said&#x27; added Mr. Wickfield  gravely, &#x27;abroad.  I was the means  of sending him abroad.  It&#x27;s my responsibility.&#x27; &#x27;Oh!  Responsibility!&#x27; said the Old Soldier.  &#x27;Everything was done for the best, my dear Mr. Wickfield;  everything was done for  the kindest and best,  we know. But if the dear fellow can&#x27;t live  there, he can&#x27;t live there.  And if  he can&#x27;t live there, he&#x27;ll die there, sooner  than he&#x27;ll overturn the Doctor&#x27;s plans.   I know him,&#x27; said the  Old Soldier, fanning herself,  in a sort of  calm prophetic agony, &#x27;and  I know  he&#x27;ll die  there, sooner  than he&#x27;ll  overturn the Doctor&#x27;s plans.&#x27; &#x27;Well, well, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said the Doctor cheerfully, &#x27;I am not bigoted to my  plans, and I can overturn them myself.  I can substitute some other plans.  If Mr. Jack Maldon comes home on account of ill  health, he must not be allowed to  go back, and we must endeavour to make some more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country.&#x27; Mrs. Markleham was so overcome by this generous speech - which, I need not  say, she had not at all expected or led  up to - that she could only tell  the Doctor it was like himself, and go several times through that operation of kissing  the sticks of her fan,  and then tapping his  hand with it.  After  which she gently chid her daughter Annie, for  not being more demonstrative when  such kindnesses were showered, for her sake, on her old playfellow; and entertained us with some particulars  concerning  other deserving  members  of her  family,  whom it  was desirable to set on their deserving legs. All this time, her daughter Annie never once spoke, or lifted up her eyes.   All this  time,  Mr. Wickfield  had  his glance  upon  her as  she  sat by  his  own daughter&#x27;s side.  It appeared to me  that he never thought of being  observed by anyone; but was so intent upon her, and upon his own thoughts in connexion  with her, as to be  quite absorbed.  He now  asked what Mr. Jack  Maldon had actually written in reference to himself, and to whom he had written? &#x27;Why, here,&#x27; said Mrs. Markleham,  taking a letter from the  chimney-piece above the Doctor&#x27;s head, &#x27;the  dear fellow says to  the Doctor himself -  where is it? Oh! - &quot;I am sorry to inform you that my health is suffering severely, and that I fear I may be reduced to the necessity of returning home for a time, as the only hope  of restoration.&quot;  That&#x27;s pretty  plain, poor  fellow!  His  only hope   of restoration!  But Annie&#x27;s letter is  plainer still.  Annie, show me  that letter again.&#x27; &#x27;Not now, mama,&#x27; she pleaded in a low tone. &#x27;My dear,  you absolutely  are, on  some subjects,  one of  the most  ridiculous persons in the world,&#x27; returned her  mother, &#x27;and perhaps the most unnatural  to the claims of your own family.  We never should have heard of the letter at all, I believe, unless I  had asked for it  myself.  Do you call  that confidence, my love, towards Doctor Strong?  I am surprised.  You ought to know better.&#x27; The letter was reluctantly produced; and as  I handed it to the old lady,  I saw how the unwilling hand from which I took it, trembled. &#x27;Now let us see,&#x27; said Mrs. Markleham, putting her glass to her eye, &#x27;where  the passage is.  &quot;The remembrance of  old times, my dearest  Annie&quot; - and so   forth it&#x27;s not  there.  &quot;The  amiable old  Proctor&quot; -  who&#x27;s he?   Dear me, Annie, how illegibly your cousin Maldon writes, and how stupid I am!  &quot;Doctor,&quot; of  course. Ah! amiable indeed!&#x27; Here she left off,  to kiss her fan again, and shake  it at the Doctor, who  was looking at  us in a  state of placid  satisfaction.  &#x27;Now I have found it.   &quot;You may not  be surprised to  hear, Annie,&quot; -  no, to be sure, knowing that he never was really strong; what did I say just now? - &quot;that I have undergone so much in this distant place,  as to have decided to leave it  at all hazards; on sick  leave, if I  can; on total  resignation, if that  is not to be obtained.  What I have endured, and  do endure here, is insupportable.&quot; And  but for  the  promptitude  of  that   best  of  creatures,&#x27;  said  Mrs.   Markleham, telegraphing  the Doctor  as before,  and refolding  the letter,  &#x27;it would   be insupportable to me to think of.&#x27; Mr. Wickfield said not one word, though the old lady looked to him as if for his commentary on this intelligence; but sat severely silent, with his eyes fixed on the ground.  Long after the subject was dismissed, and other topics occupied us, he remained so; seldom raising his eyes, unless to rest them for a moment,  with a thoughtful frown, upon the Doctor, or his wife, or both. The  Doctor  was  very fond  of  music.   Agnes sang  with  great  sweetness and expression,  and so  did Mrs.  Strong.  They  sang together,  and played   duets together, and we had quite a little concert.  But I remarked two things:  first, that though Annie soon recovered her composure, and was quite herself, there was a blank  between her  and Mr.  Wickfield which  separated them  wholly from each other; secondly, that Mr. Wickfield  seemed to dislike the intimacy  between her and  Agnes, and  to watch  it with  uneasiness.  And  now, I  must confess,  the recollection of what I had seen on  that night when Mr. Maldon went away,  first began to return upon me with a meaning it had never had, and to trouble me.  The innocent  beauty of  her face  was not  as innocent  to me  as it  had been;   I mistrusted the natural grace and charm of her manner; and when I looked at Agnes by her side, and thought how good and true Agnes was, suspicions arose within me that it was an ill-assorted friendship. She was so happy in  it herself, however, and the  other was so happy too,  that they made  the evening  fly away  as if  it were  but an  hour. It  closed in an incident which I well remember.  They were taking leave of each other, and Agnes was going to embrace her and kiss her, when Mr. Wickfield stepped between  them, as if by accident, and drew Agnes  quickly away.  Then I saw, as though  all the intervening time had been cancelled, and I were still standing in the doorway on the night of  the departure, the  expression of that  night in the  face of Mrs. Strong, as it confronted his. I cannot say what an impression this made upon me, or how impossible I found it, when I thought of her afterwards,  to separate her from this look,  and remember her face in its  innocent loveliness again.  It  haunted me when I  got home.  I seemed to have  left the Doctor&#x27;s  roof with a  dark cloud lowering  on it.  The reverence that I had for his  grey head, was mingled with commiseration  for his faith in those who  were treacherous to him,  and with resentment against  those who  injured him.   The impending  shadow of  a great  affliction, and  a  great disgrace that had no distinct form in  it yet, fell like a stain upon  the quiet place where I had worked and played as a boy, and did it a cruel wrong. I had no pleasure in thinking, any more, of the grave old broad-leaved aloe-trees,  which remained shut up in themselves a hundred years together, and of the trim  smooth grass-plot, and the stone urns, and  the Doctor&#x27;s walk, and the congenial  sound of  the Cathedral  bell hovering  above them  all.  It  was as  if the  tranquil sanctuary of my boyhood had been sacked before my face, and its peace and honour given to the winds. But morning  brought with  it my  parting from  the old  house, which  Agnes had filled with her influence; and that occupied my mind sufficiently.  I should  be there again soon,  no doubt; I  might sleep again  - perhaps often  - in my  old room; but the days of my inhabiting there were gone, and the old time was  past. I was heavier at heart  when I packed up such  of my books and clothes  as still remained there to be sent to Dover, than I cared to show to Uriah Heep; who  was so officious to help me, that I uncharitably thought him mighty glad that I  was going. I got away from Agnes and her father, somehow, with an indifferent show of being very  manly, and  took my  seat upon  the box  of the  London coach.   I was  so softened and forgiving, going through the town, that I had half a mind to nod to my old enemy the butcher, and throw him five shillings to drink.  But he  looked such a very obdurate butcher as he  stood scraping the great block in the  shop, and moreover, his appearance was so little improved by the loss of a front tooth which I had knocked out, that I thought it best to make no advances. The main object on my mind, I remember,  when we got fairly on the road, was  to appear as old as  possible to the coachman,  and to speak extremely  gruff.  The latter point  I achieved  at great  personal inconvenience;  but I  stuck to it, because I felt it was a grown-up sort of thing. &#x27;You are going through, sir?&#x27; said the coachman. &#x27;Yes, William,&#x27; I said, condescendingly (I knew him); &#x27;I am going to London.   I shall go down into Suffolk afterwards.&#x27; &#x27;Shooting, sir?&#x27; said the coachman. He knew as well as I did that it was just as likely, at that time of year, I was going down there whaling; but I felt complimented, too. &#x27;I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; I said, pretending to be undecided, &#x27;whether I shall take a shot or not.&#x27; &#x27;Birds is got wery shy, I&#x27;m told,&#x27; said William. &#x27;So I understand,&#x27; said I. &#x27;Is Suffolk your county, sir?&#x27; asked William. &#x27;Yes,&#x27; I said, with some importance.  &#x27;Suffolk&#x27;s my county.&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;m told the dumplings is uncommon fine down there,&#x27; said William. I was not aware of it myself, but I felt it necessary to uphold the institutions of my county, and to evince a familiarity with them; so I shook my head, as much as to say, &#x27;I believe you!&#x27; &#x27;And the Punches,&#x27; said William.  &#x27;There&#x27;s cattle!  A Suffolk Punch, when he&#x27;s a good un, is worth  his weight in gold.   Did you ever breed  any Suffolk Punches yourself, sir?&#x27; &#x27;N-no,&#x27; I said, &#x27;not exactly.&#x27; &#x27;Here&#x27;s a gen&#x27;lm&#x27;n behind me, I&#x27;ll pound it,&#x27; said William, &#x27;as has bred &#x27;em  by wholesale.&#x27; The gentleman spoken of  was a gentleman with  a very unpromising squint,  and a prominent chin, who had a tall white  hat on with a narrow flat brim,  and whose close-fitting drab trousers  seemed to button  all the way  up outside his  legs from his boots to his hips. His chin was cocked over the coachman&#x27;s shoulder, so near to me, that his breath quite tickled  the back of my head; and as I  looked at him, he leered at the leaders with the eye with which he didn&#x27;t squint, in  a very knowing manner. &#x27;Ain&#x27;t you?&#x27; asked William. &#x27;Ain&#x27;t I what?&#x27; said the gentleman behind. &#x27;Bred them Suffolk Punches by wholesale?&#x27; &#x27;I should think so,&#x27;  said the gentleman.  &#x27;There  ain&#x27;t no sort of  orse that I ain&#x27;t bred, and no sort of dorg.  Orses and dorgs is some men&#x27;s fancy.   They&#x27;re wittles and drink to  me - lodging, wife,  and children - reading,  writing, and Arithmetic - snuff, tobacker, and sleep.&#x27; &#x27;That ain&#x27;t a sort of man to see sitting behind a coach-box, is it though?&#x27; said William in my ear, as he handled the reins. I construed  this remark  into an  indication of  a wish  that he should have my place, so I blushingly offered to resign it. &#x27;Well,  if  you don&#x27;t  mind,  sir,&#x27; said  William,  &#x27;I think  it  would be  more correct.&#x27; I have always considered this as the first fall I had in life. When I booked  my place at the coach  office I had had  &#x27;Box Seat&#x27; written against  the entry, and had given the book-keeper  half-a-crown.  I was got  up in a special  great-coat and shawl, expressly to do honour to that distinguished eminence; had  glorified myself upon it a good deal; and had felt that I was a credit to the coach.   And here, in the very first stage, I  was supplanted by a shabby man with  a squint, who had no other  merit than smelling like  a livery-stables, and being  able to walk across me, more like a fly than  a human being, while the horses were at  a canter! A distrust of myself, which has often beset me in life on small occasions,  when it would have been better away, was assuredly not stopped in its growth by  this little incident outside the Canterbury coach.  It was in vain to take refuge  in gruffness of speech.   I spoke from  the pit of  my stomach for  the rest of the journey, but I felt completely extinguished, and dreadfully young. It was curious and interesting, nevertheless, to be sitting up there behind four horses: well educated, well dressed, and with plenty of money in my pocket;  and to  look out  for the  places where  I had  slept on  my weary  journey.  I  had abundant occupation for my thoughts, in every conspicuous landmark on the  road. When I looked down at the trampers whom we passed, and saw that  well-remembered style of face turned up,  I felt as if the  tinker&#x27;s blackened hand were in  the bosom  of  my shirt  again.   When we  clattered  through the  narrow  street of Chatham, and I caught a glimpse, in  passing, of the lane where the old  monster lived who  had bought  my jacket,  I stretched  my neck  eagerly to look for the place where I had sat, in the sun and in the shade, waiting for my money.   When we came, at last, within a stage of London, and passed the veritable Salem House where Mr. Creakle had laid about him with a heavy hand, I would have given all I had, for lawful permission to get down and thrash him, and let all the boys  out like so many caged sparrows. We  went  to  the  Golden  Cross  at  Charing  Cross,  then  a  mouldy  sort  of establishment in a  close neighbourhood.   A waiter  showed me  into the  coffee room; and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber, which smelt like a hackney-coach, and  was shut  up like  a family  vault.  I  was still  painfully conscious of my youth, for nobody stood in any awe of me at all: the chambermaid being utterly indifferent to  my opinions on any  subject, and the waiter  being familiar with me, and offering advice to my inexperience. &#x27;Well now,&#x27; said the waiter, in a  tone of confidence, &#x27;what would you like  for dinner?  Young gentlemen likes poultry in general: have a fowl!&#x27; I told him, as majestically as I could, that I wasn&#x27;t in the humour for a fowl. &#x27;Ain&#x27;t you?&#x27; said the waiter.  &#x27;Young  gentlemen is generally tired of beef  and mutton: have a weal cutlet!&#x27; I assented to this proposal, in default of being able to suggest anything else. &#x27;Do you care for  taters?&#x27; said the waiter,  with an insinuating smile,  and his head on one side.  &#x27;Young gentlemen generally has been overdosed with taters.&#x27; I commanded him, in my deepest voice,  to order a veal cutlet and potatoes,  and all things  fitting; and  to inquire  at the  bar if  there were any letters for Trotwood Copperfield, Esquire -  which I knew there  were not, and couldn&#x27;t  be, but thought it manly to appear to expect. He soon came back to  say that there were none  (at which I was much  surprised) and began to lay the cloth for my dinner in a box by the fire.  While he was  so engaged, he asked me what I would take with it; and on my replying &#x27;Half a  pint of sherry,&#x27;thought  it a  favourable opportunity,  I am  afraid, to extract that measure  of  wine  from the  stale  leavings  at the  bottoms  of  several small decanters.  I am of this opinion, because, while I was reading the newspaper,  I observed him  behind a  low wooden  partition, which  was his private apartment, very busy pouring out of a number of those vessels into one, like a chemist  and druggist making up a prescription.  When the wine came, too, I thought it  flat; and it certainly had more  English crumbs in it, than  were to be expected in  a foreign wine in anything  like a pure state,  but I was bashful  enough to drink it, and say nothing. Being then in a pleasant frame of mind (from which I infer that poisoning is not always disagreeable  in some  stages of  the process),  I resolved  to go to the play.  It was Covent Garden Theatre that I chose; and there, from the back of  a centre box, I saw Julius Caesar and the new Pantomime.  To have all those  noble Romans alive before me, and walking in and out for my entertainment, instead  of being  the stern  taskmasters they  had been  at school,  was a  most novel  and delightful effect.  But the mingled reality  and mystery of the whole show,  the influence upon me of the poetry, the lights, the music, the company, the  smooth stupendous changes of  glittering and brilliant  scenery, were so  dazzling, and opened up such  illimitable regions of  delight, that when  I came out  into the rainy street,  at twelve  o&#x27;clock at  night, I  felt as  if I  had come from the clouds,  where I  had been  leading a  romantic life  for ages,  to a   bawling, splashing, link-lighted,  umbrella-struggling,  hackney-coach-jostling,   patten clinking, muddy, miserable world. I had emerged by another door, and stood in the street for a little while, as if I really were a stranger upon earth: but the unceremonious pushing and  hustling that I received, soon recalled me to myself, and put me in the road back to  the hotel; whither I  went, revolving the  glorious vision all  the way; and  where, after some porter and  oysters, I sat revolving  it still, at past  one o&#x27;clock, with my eyes on the coffee-room fire. I was so filled with the play, and with the past - for it was, in a manner, like a shining transparency, through which I saw my earlier life moving along -  that I don&#x27;t know when the figure of a handsome well-formed young man dressed with  a tasteful easy negligence  which I have  reason to remember  very well, became  a real presence to  me.  But I  recollect being conscious  of his company  without having noticed his coming  in - and  my still sitting,  musing, over the  coffee room fire. At last I rose to  go to bed, much to  the relief of the sleepy  waiter, who had got  the fidgets  in his  legs, and  was twisting  them, and  hitting them,  and putting them through  all kinds of  contortions in his  small pantry.  In  going towards the door, I passed the person  who had come in, and saw him  plainly.  I turned directly, came back,  and looked again.  He  did not know me,  but I knew him in a moment. At another time I might have wanted  the confidence or the decision to speak  to him, and might have put it off until next day, and might have lost him.  But, in the then condition of my mind, where the play was still running high, his former protection of me appeared so deserving of my gratitude, and my old love for  him overflowed my  breast so  freshly and  spontaneously, that  I went  up to him at once, with a fast-beating heart, and said: &#x27;Steerforth! won&#x27;t you speak to me?&#x27; He looked at me - just as he  used to look, sometimes -but I saw no  recognition in his face. &#x27;You don&#x27;t remember me, I am afraid,&#x27; said I. &#x27;My God!&#x27; he suddenly exclaimed.  &#x27;It&#x27;s little Copperfield!&#x27; I grasped him by both hands, and could not let them go.  But for very shame, and the fear that it might displease him,  I could have held him round the  neck and cried. &#x27;I never, never, never  was so glad!  My  dear Steerforth, I am  so overjoyed to see you!&#x27; &#x27;And I am rejoiced to see you, too!&#x27; he said, shaking my hands heartily.   &#x27;Why, Copperfield,  old  boy, don&#x27;t  be  overpowered!&#x27; And  yet  he was  glad,  too, I thought, to see how the delight I had in meeting him affected me. I brushed away  the tears that  my utmost resolution  had not been  able to keep back, and I made a clumsy laugh of it, and we sat down together, side by side. &#x27;Why, how do you come to be here?&#x27; said Steerforth, clapping me on the shoulder. &#x27;I came here  by the Canterbury  coach, today.  I  have been adopted  by an aunt down in that part of the country, and have just finished my education there. How do YOU come to be here, Steerforth?&#x27; &#x27;Well, I am what they call an Oxford  man,&#x27; he returned; &#x27;that is to say, I  get bored to death down there, periodically - and I am on my way now to my mother&#x27;s. You&#x27;re a devilish  amiable-looking fellow, Copperfield.   just what you  used to be, now I look at you!  Not altered in the least!&#x27; &#x27;I knew you immediately,&#x27; I said; &#x27;but you are more easily remembered.&#x27; He laughed as he ran his hand through the clustering curls of his hair, and said gaily: &#x27;Yes, I am on an expedition of duty.  My mother lives a little way out of  town; and the  roads being  in a  beastly condition,  and our  house tedious enough, I remained here tonight instead of going on. I have not been in town  half-a-dozen hours, and those I have been dozing and grumbling away at the play.&#x27; &#x27;I have been at the play, too,&#x27;  said I.  &#x27;At Covent Garden.  What a  delightful and magnificent entertainment, Steerforth!&#x27; Steerforth laughed heartily. &#x27;My dear young  Davy,&#x27; he said,  clapping me on  the shoulder again,  &#x27;you are a very Daisy.  The daisy of the field, at sunrise, is not fresher than you are.  I have been at Covent Garden, too, and there never was a more miserable  business. Holloa, you sir!&#x27; This  was  addressed  to  the  waiter,  who  had  been  very  attentive  to  our recognition, at a distance, and now came forward deferentially. &#x27;Where have you put my friend, Mr. Copperfield?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Beg your pardon, sir?&#x27; &#x27;Where  does  he  sleep?   What&#x27;s  his number?   You  know  what  I  mean,&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Well, sir,&#x27; said the  waiter, with an apologetic  air.  &#x27;Mr. Copperfield is  at present in forty-four, sir.&#x27; &#x27;And  what  the  devil  do  you  mean,&#x27;  retorted  Steerforth,  &#x27;by  putting Mr. Copperfield into a little loft over a stable?&#x27; &#x27;Why, you see we wasn&#x27;t aware, sir,&#x27; returned the waiter, still  apologetically, &#x27;as  Mr.  Copperfield  was  anyways particular.   We  can  give  Mr. Copperfield seventy-two, sir, if it would be preferred. Next you, sir.&#x27; &#x27;Of course it would  be preferred,&#x27; said Steerforth.   &#x27;And do it at  once.&#x27; The waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange.  Steerforth, very much  amused at my  having been  put into  forty-four, laughed  again, and  clapped me on the shoulder again, and invited me to breakfast with him next morning at ten o&#x27;clock - an invitation I was only too  proud and happy to accept.  It being  now pretty late, we  took our  candles and  went upstairs,  where we  parted with  friendly heartiness at his door, and where I found my new room a great improvement on  my old one, it not being at all musty, and having an immense four-post bedstead  in it, which was quite a little landed estate.  Here, among pillows enough for six, I  soon  fell asleep  in  a blissful  condition,  and dreamed  of  ancient Rome, Steerforth, and friendship, until the early morning coaches, rumbling out of the archway underneath, made me dream of thunder and the gods. CHAPTER 20 STEERFORTH&#x27;S HOME When the chambermaid tapped at my door at eight o&#x27;clock, and informed me that my shaving-water was outside, I  felt severely the having  no occasion for it,  and blushed in my bed.  The suspicion that she laughed too, when she said it, preyed upon my  mind all  the time  I was  dressing; and  gave me,  I was  conscious, a sneaking and guilty air when I passed her on the staircase, as I was going  down to breakfast.  I was so sensitively aware, indeed, of being younger than I could have wished, that for some time I could not make up my mind to pass her at  all, under the  ignoble circumstances  of the  case; but,  hearing her  there with  a broom, stood peeping out of window at King Charles on horseback, surrounded by a maze of hackney-coaches, and looking anything but regal in a drizzling rain  and a dark-brown fog, until  I was admonished by  the waiter that the  gentleman was waiting for me. It was not  in the coffee-room  that I found  Steerforth expecting me,  but in a snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, where the fire  burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was  set forth on a table covered with  a clean cloth;  and  a  cheerful  miniature  of  the  room,  the  fire,  the  breakfast, Steerforth, and all, was shining in the little round mirror over the  sideboard. I was rather bashful at first, Steerforth being so self-possessed, and  elegant, and superior to me in all  respects (age included); but his easy  patronage soon put that to rights, and  made me quite at home.   I could not enough admire  the change he had wrought in the Golden  Cross; or compare the dull forlorn state  I had   held  yesterday,   with  this   morning&#x27;s  comfort   and  this   morning&#x27;s entertainment.  As to  the waiter&#x27;s familiarity,  it was quenched  as if it  had never been.  He attended on us, as I may say, in sackcloth and ashes. &#x27;Now, Copperfield,&#x27; said Steerforth, when we were alone, &#x27;I should like to  hear what you are doing, and  where you are going, and  all about you.  I feel  as if you were  my property.&#x27;  Glowing with  pleasure to  find that  he had still this interest in me, I told him how my aunt had proposed the little expedition that I had before me, and whither it tended. &#x27;As you are in no hurry, then,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;come home with me to Highgate, and stay a day  or two.  You will  be pleased with my  mother - she is  a little vain and prosy about me, but that you can forgive her - and she will be  pleased with you.&#x27; &#x27;I should like to be as sure of that, as you are kind enough to say you are,&#x27;  I answered, smiling. &#x27;Oh!&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;everyone who likes me,  has a claim on her that is  sure to be acknowledged.&#x27; &#x27;Then I think I shall be a favourite,&#x27; said I. &#x27;Good!&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;Come and prove it.  We will go and see the lions  for an hour or two - it&#x27;s something to have a fresh fellow like you to show them to, Copperfield - and then we&#x27;ll journey out to Highgate by the coach.&#x27; I  could hardly  believe but  that I  was in  a dream,  and that  I should  wake presently in number forty-four, to the  solitary box in the coffee-room and  the familiar waiter  again.  After  I had  written to  my aunt  and told  her of  my fortunate meeting  with my  admired old  schoolfellow, and  my acceptance of his invitation, we went out in a hackney-chariot, and saw a Panorama and some  other sights, and took a walk through the Museum, where I could not help observing how much Steerforth  knew, on  an infinite  variety of  subjects, and  of how little account he seemed to make his knowledge. &#x27;You&#x27;ll take a  high degree at  college, Steerforth,&#x27; said  I, &#x27;if you  have not done so already; and they will have good reason to be proud of you.&#x27; &#x27;I take a degree!&#x27; cried Steerforth.  &#x27;Not  I! my dear Daisy - will you  mind my calling you Daisy?&#x27; &#x27;Not at all!&#x27; said I. &#x27;That&#x27;s a good fellow!  My dear  Daisy,&#x27; said Steerforth, laughing. &#x27;I have  not the least desire or  intention to distinguish myself  in that way.  I  have done quite sufficient  for my  purpose.  I  find that  I am  heavy company enough for myself as I am.&#x27; &#x27;But the fame -&#x27; I was beginning. &#x27;You romantic Daisy!&#x27; said Steerforth, laughing still more heartily: &#x27;why should I trouble myself,  that a parcel  of heavy-headed fellows  may gape and  hold up their hands?  Let them do it at some other man.  There&#x27;s fame for him, and  he&#x27;s welcome to it.&#x27; I was abashed  at having made  so great a  mistake, and was  glad to change  the subject.  Fortunately it  was not difficult  to do, for  Steerforth could always pass from one subject to another with a carelessness and lightness that were his own. Lunch succeeded to our sight-seeing, and the short winter day wore away so fast, that it was dusk when the stage-coach  stopped with us at an old brick  house at Highgate  on the  summit of  the hill.   An elderly  lady, though  not very  far advanced in years, with a proud carriage and a handsome face, was in the doorway as we alighted; and greeting Steerforth as &#x27;My dearest James,&#x27; folded him in her arms.  To this  lady he presented  me as his  mother, and she  gave me a stately welcome. It was a genteel old-fashioned house, very quiet and orderly.  From the  windows of my room I saw all London lying in the distance like a great vapour, with here and there some lights  twinkling through it.  I  had only time, in  dressing, to glance at the solid furniture, the  framed pieces of work (done, I  supposed, by Steerforth&#x27;s mother when she was a girl), and some pictures in crayons of ladies with powdered hair  and bodices,  coming and  going on  the walls,  as the newly kindled fire crackled and sputtered, when I was called to dinner. There was a second lady in the dining-room, of a slight short figure, dark,  and not  agreeable to  look at,  but with  some appearance  of good  looks too,  who attracted my attention: perhaps because I  had not expected to see her;  perhaps because I  found myself  sitting opposite  to her;  perhaps because of something really remarkable  in her.   She had  black hair  and eager  black eyes, and was thin, and had a scar upon her lip.  It was an old scar - I should rather call it seam, for it was not discoloured, and had healed years ago - which had once  cut through her mouth, downward towards the chin, but was now barely visible  across the table, except above and on her upper lip, the shape of which it had altered. I concluded in my own mind that she was about thirty years of age, and that  she wished to be married.  She was a little dilapidated - like a house - with having been so long to let; yet had, as I have said, an appearance of good looks.   Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her, which found  a vent in her gaunt eyes. She was introduced as Miss Dartle, and both Steerforth and his mother called her Rosa.   I  found that  she  lived there,  and  had been  for  a long  time  Mrs. Steerforth&#x27;s companion.   It appeared  to me  that she  never said  anything she wanted to say, outright; but hinted it, and made a great deal more of it by this practice.   For  example,  when  Mrs. Steerforth  observed,  more  in  jest than earnest, that she feared her son led but a wild life at college, Miss Dartle put in thus: &#x27;Oh, really?  You know how ignorant I  am, and that I only ask for  information, but isn&#x27;t it always so?  I thought that kind of life was on all hands understood to be -  eh?&#x27; &#x27;It is  education for a  very grave profession,  if you mean that, Rosa,&#x27; Mrs. Steerforth answered with some coldness. &#x27;Oh!  Yes!  That&#x27;s very true,&#x27; returned Miss Dartle.  &#x27;But isn&#x27;t it, though? - I want to be put right, if I am wrong - isn&#x27;t it, really?&#x27; &#x27;Really what?&#x27; said Mrs. Steerforth. &#x27;Oh!  You mean it&#x27;s  not!&#x27; returned Miss Dartle.   &#x27;Well, I&#x27;m very glad  to hear it!  Now, I  know what to  do!  That&#x27;s the  advantage of asking.   I shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy, and so  forth, in connexion with that life, any more.&#x27; &#x27;And  you  will  be  right,&#x27;  said  Mrs.  Steerforth.   &#x27;My  son&#x27;s  tutor  is  a conscientious gentleman; and if I had not implicit reliance on my son, I  should have reliance on him.&#x27; &#x27;Should  you?&#x27;  said  Miss  Dartle.  &#x27;Dear  me!   Conscientious,  is  he? Really conscientious, now?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, I am convinced of it,&#x27; said Mrs. Steerforth. &#x27;How very nice!&#x27; exclaimed Miss Dartle.  &#x27;What a comfort!  Really conscientious? Then he&#x27;s not - but of course he can&#x27;t be, if he&#x27;s really conscientious.   Well, I shall be quite happy  in my opinion of him,  from this time.  You can&#x27;t  think how  it  elevates him  in  my opinion,  to  know for  certain  that he&#x27;s  really conscientious!&#x27; Her own views of every question, and her correction of everything that was  said to which she was opposed, Miss  Dartle insinuated in the same way:  sometimes, I could not conceal from myself, with great power, though in contradiction even of Steerforth.   An  instance happened  before  dinner was  done.   Mrs. Steerforth speaking to me about my intention of  going down into Suffolk, I said at  hazard how glad I should be, if Steerforth would only go there with me; and  explaining to him  that I  was going  to see  my old  nurse, and  Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s  family, I reminded him of the boatman whom he had seen at school. &#x27;Oh!  That bluff fellow!&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;He had a son with him, hadn&#x27;t he?&#x27; &#x27;No.  That was his nephew,&#x27; I replied;  &#x27;whom he adopted, though, as a son.   He has a very pretty  little niece too, whom  he adopted as a  daughter.  In short, his house - or rather his  boat, for he lives in one,  on dry land - is full  of people who are objects of his  generosity and kindness.  You would be  delighted to see that household.&#x27; &#x27;Should I?&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;Well, I think  I should.  I must see what can  be done.  It would  be worth a  journey (not to  mention the pleasure  of a journey with you, Daisy), to see that sort of people together, and to make one of &#x27;em.&#x27; My heart leaped  with a new  hope of pleasure.   But it was  in reference to the tone in which he  had spoken of &#x27;that  sort of people&#x27;, that  Miss Dartle, whose sparkling eyes had been watchful of us, now broke in again. &#x27;Oh, but, really?  Do tell me.  Are they, though?&#x27; she said. &#x27;Are they what?  And are who what?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;That  sort of  people.  -  Are they  really animals  and clods,  and beings  of another order?  I want to know SO much.&#x27; &#x27;Why, there&#x27;s a  pretty wide separation  between them and  us,&#x27; said Steerforth, with indifference.  &#x27;They are not to be  expected to be as sensitive as we  are. Their delicacy  is not  to be  shocked, or  hurt easily.   They are  wonderfully virtuous, I dare say - some people contend  for that, at least; and I am sure  I don&#x27;t want to contradict  them - but they  have not very fine  natures, and they may  be  thankful that,  like  their coarse  rough  skins, they  are  not easily wounded.&#x27; &#x27;Really!&#x27; said Miss Dartle.  &#x27;Well, I  don&#x27;t know, now, when I have  been better pleased than  to hear  that.  It&#x27;s  so consoling!   It&#x27;s such  a delight to know that, when they suffer, they don&#x27;t feel! Sometimes I have been quite uneasy  for that sort of people; but now I shall just dismiss the idea of them,  altogether. Live and  learn. I  had my  doubts, I  confess, but  now they&#x27;re  cleared up.  I didn&#x27;t know, and now I do know,  and that shows the advantage of asking  - don&#x27;t it?&#x27; I believed that Steerforth had said what he had, in jest, or to draw Miss Dartle out; and  I expected  him to  say as  much when  she was  gone, and  we two were sitting before the fire.  But he merely asked me what I thought of her. &#x27;She is very clever, is she not?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;Clever!  She brings everything to a grindstone,&#x27; said Steerforth, and  sharpens it, as she has sharpened her own face and figure these years past.  She has worn herself away by constant sharpening.  She is all edge.&#x27; &#x27;What a remarkable scar that is upon her lip!&#x27; I said. Steerforth&#x27;s face fell, and he paused a moment. &#x27;Why, the fact is,&#x27; he returned, &#x27;I did that.&#x27; &#x27;By an unfortunate accident!&#x27; &#x27;No.  I was a young boy, and she exasperated me, and I threw a hammer at her.  A promising young angel I must have been!&#x27;  I was deeply sorry to have touched  on such a painful theme, but that was useless now. &#x27;She has borne the  mark ever since, as  you see,&#x27; said Steerforth;  &#x27;and she&#x27;ll bear it to her grave, if she ever rests in one - though I can hardly believe she will ever rest anywhere.  She was the motherless child of a sort of cousin of my father&#x27;s.  He died one day.  My mother,  who was then a widow, brought her  here to be company to her.  She has a couple of thousand pounds of her own, and saves the interest of it every year, to  add to the principal. There&#x27;s the history  of Miss Rosa Dartle for you.&#x27; &#x27;And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother?&#x27; said I. &#x27;Humph!&#x27; retorted Steerforth, looking at the fire.  &#x27;Some brothers are not loved over much;  and some  love -  but help  yourself, Copperfield!   We&#x27;ll drink the daisies of the field,  in compliment to you;  and the lilies of  the valley that toil not, neither do they spin, in compliment to me - the more shame for me!&#x27;  A moody  smile  that had  overspread  his features  cleared  off as  he  said this merrily, and he was his own frank, winning self again. I could not help glancing at the scar with a painful interest when we went in to tea.  It was not long before I observed that it was the most susceptible part of her face, and that, when she turned pale, that mark altered first, and became  a dull, lead-coloured streak, lengthening out to  its full extent, like a mark  in invisible ink brought to the fire.   There was a little altercation between  her and Steerforth about a cast of the dice at back gammon - when I thought her, for one moment,  in a  storm of  rage; and  then I  saw it  start forth like the old writing on the wall. It was no matter of wonder to me to find Mrs. Steerforth devoted to her son. She seemed to  be able  to speak  or think  about nothing  else.  She  showed me his picture as an infant, in a locket, with some of his baby-hair in it; she  showed me his picture as he had been when I first knew him; and she wore at her  breast his picture as he was now.  All the letters he had ever written to her, she kept in a cabinet near her own chair by the fire; and she would have read me some  of them,  and  I should  have  been very  glad  to hear  them  too, if  he  had not interposed, and coaxed her out of the design. &#x27;It was at Mr.  Creakle&#x27;s, my son tells  me, that you first  became acquainted,&#x27; said Mrs. Steerforth, as she and I were talking at one table, while they  played backgammon at another.  &#x27;Indeed,  I recollect his speaking,  at that time, of  a pupil younger than himself who had taken his fancy there; but your name, as  you may suppose, has not lived in my memory.&#x27; &#x27;He was very generous and noble to me in those days, I assure you, ma&#x27;am,&#x27;  said I, &#x27;and I  stood in need  of such a  friend.  I should  have been quite  crushed without him.&#x27; &#x27;He is always generous and noble,&#x27; said Mrs. Steerforth, proudly. I subscribed to  this with all  my heart, God  knows.  She knew  I did; for  the stateliness of her manner  already abated towards me,  except when she spoke  in praise of him, and then her air was always lofty. &#x27;It was not  a fit school  generally for my  son,&#x27; said she;  &#x27;far from it;  but there  were particular  circumstances to  be considered  at the  time, of   more importance even  than that  selection.  My  son&#x27;s high  spirit made it desirable that he should be  placed with some man  who felt its superiority,  and would be content to bow himself before it; and we found such a man there.&#x27; I knew that, knowing the fellow.  And yet I did not despise him the more for it, but thought it a redeeming quality in  him if he could be allowed any  grace for not resisting one so irresistible as Steerforth. &#x27;My  son&#x27;s great  capacity was  tempted on,  there, by  a feeling  of  voluntary emulation and conscious pride,&#x27;  the fond lady went  on to say.  &#x27;He  would have risen against all constraint; but he found himself the monarch of the place, and he haughtily determined to be worthy of his station.  It was like himself.&#x27; I echoed, with all my heart and soul, that it was like himself. &#x27;So my son took, of his own will,  and on no compulsion, to the course in  which he can always, when it is his pleasure, outstrip every competitor,&#x27; she pursued. &#x27;My son informs  me, Mr. Copperfield,  that you were  quite devoted to  him, and that when you met yesterday you made yourself known to him with tears of joy.  I should be  an affected  woman if  I made  any pretence  of being surprised by my son&#x27;s inspiring such emotions; but I  cannot be indifferent to anyone who  is so sensible of his merit, and  I am very glad to  see you here, and can  assure you that he  feels an  unusual friendship  for you,  and that  you may  rely on  his protection.&#x27; Miss Dartle played backgammon as eagerly  as she did everything else.  If  I had seen her, first,  at the board,  I should have  fancied that her  figure had got thin, and her eyes had got large, over that pursuit, and no other in the  world. But I am very much mistaken if she missed a word of this, or lost a look of mine as I received  it with the  utmost pleasure, and  honoured by Mrs.  Steerforth&#x27;s confidence, felt older than I had done since I left Canterbury. When the evening was pretty far spent, and a tray of glasses and decanters  came in, Steerforth promised, over the fire,  that he would seriously think of  going down into the country with me. There  was no hurry, he said; a week  hence would do; and his  mother hospitably said  the same.  While  we were talking,  he more than once called me Daisy; which brought Miss Dartle out again. &#x27;But really, Mr. Copperfield,&#x27;  she asked, &#x27;is it  a nickname?  And why  does he give it you?  Is it - eh? -  because he thinks you young and innocent?  I  am so stupid in these things.&#x27; I coloured in replying that I believed it was. &#x27;Oh!&#x27; said Miss Dartle.   &#x27;Now I am glad  to know that!  I  ask for information, and I am glad to know it.  He thinks you young and innocent; and so you are  his friend.  Well, that&#x27;s quite delightful!&#x27; She went to bed soon after this, and Mrs. Steerforth retired too. Steerforth and I, after lingering  for half-an-hour over  the fire, talking  about Traddles and all the rest of them at  old Salem House, went upstairs together.   Steerforth&#x27;s room was  next to  mine, and  I went  in to  look at  it.  It  was a  picture of comfort, full of  easy-chairs, cushions and  footstools, worked by  his mother&#x27;s hand, and with no sort of thing  omitted that could help to render it  complete. Finally, her handsome features looked down on her darling from a portrait on the wall, as if  it were even  something to her  that her likeness  should watch him while he slept. I found the fire burning clear enough in my room by this time, and the  curtains drawn before the windows and round the bed, giving it a very snug appearance.  I sat down in a great chair upon  the hearth to meditate on my happiness;  and had enjoyed the contemplation of it for some  time, when I found a likeness of  Miss Dartle looking eagerly at me from above the chimney-piece. It was a startling likeness, and  necessarily had a startling look. The  painter hadn&#x27;t made the  scar, but I  made it; and  there it was,  coming and going; now confined to the upper lip as I had seen it at dinner, and now showing the  whole extent of  the wound  inflicted by  the hammer,  as I  had seen  it when she was passionate. I  wondered  peevishly  why  they couldn&#x27;t  put  her  anywhere  else instead  of quartering her on me.  To get  rid of her, I undressed quickly,  extinguished my light, and went to bed.  But, as I fell asleep, I could not forget that she  was still there looking, &#x27;Is it really, though?   I want to know&#x27;; and when I  awoke in the  night, I  found that  I was  uneasily asking  all sorts  of people in my dreams whether it really was or not - without knowing what I meant. CHAPTER 21 LITTLE EM&#x27;LY There was a  servant in that  house, a man  who, I understood,  was usually with Steerforth,  and  had  come into  his  service  at the  University,  who  was in appearance a pattern  of respectability.  I  believe there never  existed in his station  a more  respectable-looking man.   He was  taciturn, soft-footed,  very quiet in  his manner,  deferential, observant,  always at  hand when wanted, and never  near  when not  wanted;  but his  great  claim to  consideration  was his respectability.  He had not a pliant face, he had rather a stiff neck, rather  a tight smooth head  with short hair  clinging to it  at the sides,  a soft way of speaking, with a peculiar habit of  whispering the letter S so distinctly,  that he seemed to use  it oftener than any  other man; but every  peculiarity that he had he made respectable.  If his  nose had been upside-down, he would  have made that respectable.  He surrounded  himself with an atmosphere  of respectability, and walked secure in it.  It would  have been next to impossible to suspect  him of anything wrong, he was so thoroughly respectable.  Nobody could have  thought of putting him in a livery, he  was so highly respectable.  To have imposed  any derogatory work  upon him,  would have  been to  inflict a  wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable man.  And of this, I noticed- the  women-servants in the household were so intuitively  conscious, that they always did such  work themselves, and generally while he read the paper by the pantry fire. Such a self-contained man I never saw.   But in that quality, as in every  other he possessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable.  Even the fact that  no one  knew his  Christian name,  seemed to  form a  part of  his  respectability. Nothing could be objected against his surname, Littimer, by which he was  known. Peter might  have been  hanged, or  Tom transported;  but Littimer was perfectly respectable. It was occasioned, I  suppose, by the reverend  nature of respectability in  the abstract, but I felt particularly young in this man&#x27;s presence.  How old he  was himself, I  could not  guess -  and that  again went  to his  credit on the same score; for in the calmness of respectability he might have numbered fifty  years as well as thirty. Littimer  was in  my room  in the  morning before  I was  up, to  bring me  that reproachful  shaving-water,  and to  put  out my  clothes.   When I  undrew  the curtains  and  looked out  of  bed, I  saw  him, in  an  equable temperature  of respectability, unaffected by the east  wind of January, and not  even breathing frostily, standing my boots  right and left in  the first dancing position,  and blowing specks of dust off my coat as he laid it down like a baby. I gave him good morning, and asked him what o&#x27;clock it was.  He took out of  his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw, and preventing the  spring with his thumb from opening far, looked in at the face as if he were  consulting an oracular oyster, shut it up again,  and said, if I pleased, it was  half past eight. &#x27;Mr. Steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested, sir.&#x27; &#x27;Thank you,&#x27; said I, &#x27;very well indeed.  Is Mr. Steerforth quite well?&#x27; &#x27;Thank  you,  sir,   Mr.  Steerforth  is   tolerably  well.&#x27;   Another   of  his characteristics - no use of superlatives.  A cool calm medium always. &#x27;Is there  anything more  I can  have the  honour of  doing for  you, sir?   The warning-bell will ring at nine; the family take breakfast at half past nine.&#x27; &#x27;Nothing, I thank you.&#x27; &#x27;I thank YOU, sir, if you please&#x27;; and with that, and with a little  inclination of his head  when he passed  the bed-side, as  an apology for  correcting me, he went out, shutting the door as delicately  as if I had just fallen into  a sweet sleep on which my life depended. Every morning we held exactly this  conversation: never any more, and never  any less: and yet, invariably,  however far I might  have been lifted out  of myself over-night, and advanced towards  maturer years, by Steerforth&#x27;s  companionship, or Mrs. Steerforth&#x27;s confidence, or Miss Dartle&#x27;s conversation, in the  presence of this most respectable man I became, as our smaller poets sing, &#x27;a boy again&#x27;. He got horses for  us; and Steerforth, who  knew everything, gave me  lessons in riding.  He provided foils for  us,  and Steerforth gave  me lessons in  fencing gloves, and I began, of  the same master, to improve  in boxing.  It gave me  no manner of concern that Steerforth should find me a novice in these sciences, but I never could bear to show my want of skill before the respectable Littimer.   I had no reason to  believe that Littimer understood  such arts himself; he  never led me to suppose anything  of the kind, by so  much as the vibration of  one of his respectable eyelashes; yet whenever he  was by, while we were practising,  I felt myself the greenest and most inexperienced of mortals. I am particular  about this man,  because he made  a particular effect  on me at that time, and because of what took place thereafter. The week passed away in a most delightful manner.  It passed rapidly, as may  be supposed, to one entranced as  I was; and yet it  gave me so many occasions  for knowing Steerforth better, and admiring him more in a thousand respects, that at its close I seemed to have been with him for a much longer time.  A dashing  way he had  of treating  me like  a plaything,  was more  agreeable to  me than  any behaviour he could  have adopted.  It  reminded me of  our old acquaintance;  it seemed the natural sequel of it; it showed me that he was unchanged; it relieved me of any  uneasiness I might  have felt, in  comparing my merits  with his, and measuring my claims upon his friendship by any equal standard; above all, it was a familiar,  unrestrained, affectionate  demeanour that  he used  towards no one else.  As he had treated me at school differently from all the rest, I  joyfully believed that he treated me in life unlike any other friend he had.  I  believed that I was nearer to  his heart than any other  friend, and my own heart  warmed with attachment to him. He made up his mind to go with me into the country,  and the day arrived  for our departure.   He had been  doubtful at first  whether to take  Littimer  or not,  but  decided to  leave  him at  home.   The respectable creature, satisfied with his lot  whatever it was, arranged our  portmanteaux on the little carriage that was to take us into London, as if they were intended to defy  the shocks  of ages,  and received  my modestly  proffered donation   with perfect tranquillity. We bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and  Miss Dartle, with many thanks on my  part, and much kindness on the devoted mother&#x27;s.  The last thing I saw was  Littimer&#x27;s unruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, with the silent conviction that I was very young indeed. What I felt, in  returning so auspiciously to  the old familiar places,  I shall not endeavour to  describe.  We went  down by the  Mail.  I was  so concerned, I recollect, even for  the honour of  Yarmouth, that when  Steerforth said, as  we drove through its dark streets to the  inn, that, as well as he could  make out, it was a  good, queer, out-of-the-way  kind of hole,  I was highly  pleased.  We went to bed  on our arrival  (I observed a  pair of dirty  shoes and gaiters  in connexion  with  my  old  friend  the  Dolphin  as  we  passed  that  door), and breakfasted late in the morning.  Steerforth, who was in great spirits, had been strolling about the beach before I  was up, and had made acquaintance,  he said, with half the  boatmen in the  place.  Moreover, he  had seen, in  the distance, what he was sure must be the identical house of Mr. Peggotty, with smoke  coming out of the chimney; and had had a  great mind, he told me, to walk in  and swear he was myself grown out of knowledge. &#x27;When do  you propose  to introduce  me there,  Daisy?&#x27; he  said.  &#x27;I am at your disposal.  Make your own arrangements.&#x27; &#x27;Why, I was thinking  that this evening would  be a good time,  Steerforth, when they are all  sitting round the  fire.  I should  like you to  see it when  it&#x27;s snug, it&#x27;s such a curious place.&#x27; &#x27;So be it!&#x27; returned Steerforth.  &#x27;This evening.&#x27; &#x27;I  shall  not give  them  any notice  that  we are  here,  you know,&#x27;  said  I, delighted.  &#x27;We must take them by surprise.&#x27; &#x27;Oh,  of  course!   It&#x27;s no  fun,&#x27;  said  Steerforth, &#x27;unless  we  take  them by surprise.  Let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition.&#x27; &#x27;Though they ARE that sort of people that you mentioned,&#x27; I returned. &#x27;Aha!  What! you recollect my skirmishes with Rosa, do you?&#x27; he exclaimed with a quick look.  &#x27;Confound the girl, I am  half afraid of her.  She&#x27;s like a  goblin to me.  But never mind her.  Now what are you going to do?  You are going to see your nurse, I suppose?&#x27; &#x27;Why, yes,&#x27; I said, &#x27;I must see Peggotty first of all.&#x27; &#x27;Well,&#x27; replied Steerforth, looking at his watch.  &#x27;Suppose I deliver you up  to be cried over for a couple of hours.  Is that long enough?&#x27; I answered, laughing, that I thought we  might get through it in that time,  but that he must come also; for he would find that his renown had preceded him,  and that he was almost as great a personage as I was. &#x27;I&#x27;ll come anywhere you like,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;or do anything you like.   Tell me where  to come  to; and  in two  hours I&#x27;ll  produce myself  in any state you please, sentimental or comical.&#x27; I gave him minute directions for finding the residence of Mr. Barkis, carrier to Blunderstone and elsewhere; and, on  this understanding, went out alone.   There was a sharp bracing air;  the ground was dry; the  sea was crisp and clear;  the sun was diffusing  abundance of light,  if not much  warmth; and everything  was fresh and lively.  I  was so fresh and  lively myself, in the  pleasure of being there, that I could have stopped the people in the streets and shaken hands with them. The streets  looked small,  of course.   The streets  that we  have only seen as children always  do, I  believe, when  we go  back to  them. But I had forgotten nothing in them,  and found nothing  changed, until I  came to Mr.  Omer&#x27;s shop. OMER AND Joram was now written up,  where OMER used to be; but the  inscription, DRAPER, TAILOR, HABERDASHER, FUNERAL FURNISHER, &amp;c., remained as it was. My footsteps  seemed to  tend so  naturally to  the shop  door, after I had read these words from over the way, that I went across the road and looked in.  There was a pretty woman at the back of the shop, dancing a little child in her  arms, while  another  little  fellow clung  to  her  apron.  I  had  no  difficulty in recognizing either Minnie or Minnie&#x27;s  children.  The glass door of  the parlour was not open; but in the workshop  across the yard I could faintly hear  the old tune playing, as if it had never left off. &#x27;Is Mr.  Omer at  home?&#x27; said  I, entering.   &#x27;I should  like to  see him, for a moment, if he is.&#x27; &#x27;Oh yes, sir, he  is at home,&#x27; said  Minnie; &#x27;the weather don&#x27;t  suit his asthma out of doors.  Joe, call your grandfather!&#x27; The little fellow, who was holding her apron, gave such a lusty shout, that  the sound of it made him bashful, and he buried his face in her skirts, to her great admiration.  I heard a heavy puffing and blowing coming towards us, and soon Mr. Omer, shorter-winded than of yore, but not much older-looking, stood before me. &#x27;Servant, sir,&#x27; said  Mr. Omer.  &#x27;What  can I do  for you, sir?&#x27;  &#x27;You can shake hands with me, Mr. Omer, if you please,&#x27; said I, putting out my own.  &#x27;You  were very good-natured to me once, when I am afraid I didn&#x27;t show that I thought so.&#x27; &#x27;Was  I though?&#x27;  returned the  old man.   &#x27;I&#x27;m glad  to hear  it, but  I  don&#x27;t remember when.  Are you sure it was me?&#x27; &#x27;Quite.&#x27; &#x27;I think my memory has got as short as my breath,&#x27; said Mr. Omer, looking at  me and shaking his head; &#x27;for I don&#x27;t remember you.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t you remember your coming to the coach to meet me, and my having breakfast here, and our riding out to  Blunderstone together: you, and I, and  Mrs. Joram, and Mr. Joram too - who wasn&#x27;t her husband then?&#x27; &#x27;Why,  Lord  bless my  soul!&#x27;  exclaimed Mr.  Omer,  after being  thrown  by his surprise  into a  fit of  coughing, &#x27;you  don&#x27;t say  so!  Minnie,  my dear,  you recollect?  Dear me, yes; the party was a lady, I think?&#x27; &#x27;My mother,&#x27; I rejoined. &#x27;To - be - sure,&#x27; said Mr. Omer, touching my waistcoat with his forefinger, &#x27;and there was a little child too!  There was two parties.  The little party was laid along with the other  party. Over at Blunderstone  it was, of course.   Dear me! And how have you been since?&#x27; Very well, I thanked him, as I hoped he had been too. &#x27;Oh! nothing to grumble  at, you know,&#x27; said  Mr. Omer.  &#x27;I find  my breath gets short, but it seldom gets longer as a man gets older. I take it as it comes, and make the most of it.  That&#x27;s the best way, ain&#x27;t it?&#x27; Mr. Omer coughed again, in consequence of laughing, and was assisted out of  his fit by his daughter, who now  stood close beside us, dancing her  smallest child on the counter. &#x27;Dear me!&#x27; said Mr.  Omer.  &#x27;Yes, to be  sure.  Two parties!  Why,  in that very ride, if you&#x27;ll believe me, the day was named for my Minnie to marry Joram.  &quot;Do name it, sir,&quot; says Joram.  &quot;Yes,  do, father,&quot; says Minnie.  And now  he&#x27;s come into the business.  And look here!  The youngest!&#x27; Minnie laughed, and stroked her banded hair upon her temples, as her father  put one  of his  fat fingers  into the  hand of  the child  she was  dancing on  the counter. &#x27;Two parties, of course!&#x27; said Mr. Omer, nodding his head retrospectively.   &#x27;Ex actly so!  And Joram&#x27;s at work, at this minute, on a grey one with silver nails, not this measurement&#x27; - the measurement  of  the dancing child upon the  counter &#x27;by a good two inches.  - Will you take something?&#x27; I thanked him, but declined. &#x27;Let me  see,&#x27; said  Mr. Omer.   &#x27;Barkis&#x27;s the  carrier&#x27;s wife  - Peggotty&#x27;s the boatman&#x27;s sister - she had something to do with your family?  She was in service there, sure?&#x27; My answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction. &#x27;I believe my breath will get long  next, my memory&#x27;s getting so much so,&#x27;  said Mr. Omer.  &#x27;Well, sir, we&#x27;ve got  a young relation of hers here,  under articles to us, that has as elegant a taste in the dress-making business - I assure you I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a Duchess in England can touch her.&#x27; &#x27;Not little Em&#x27;ly?&#x27; said I, involuntarily. &#x27;Em&#x27;ly&#x27;s her name,&#x27; said Mr. Omer, &#x27;and she&#x27;s little too.  But if you&#x27;ll believe me, she has  such a face  of her own  that half the  women in this  town are mad against her.&#x27; &#x27;Nonsense, father!&#x27; cried Minnie. &#x27;My dear,&#x27; said Mr. Omer, &#x27;I don&#x27;t  say it&#x27;s the case with you,&#x27; winking  at me, &#x27;but I say that half  the women in Yarmouth -  ah! and in five mile  round - are mad against that girl.&#x27; &#x27;Then she should  have kept to  her own station  in life, father,&#x27;  said Minnie, &#x27;and not have given them any hold to talk about her, and then they couldn&#x27;t have done it.&#x27; &#x27;Couldn&#x27;t have done it, my dear!&#x27; retorted Mr. Omer.  &#x27;Couldn&#x27;t have done it! Is that YOUR knowledge of life?  What is there that any woman couldn&#x27;t do, that she shouldn&#x27;t do - especially on the subject of another woman&#x27;s good looks?&#x27; I really  thought it  was all  over with  Mr. Omer,  after he  had uttered  this libellous pleasantry.  He coughed to that extent, and his breath eluded all  his attempts to recover  it with that  obstinacy, that I  fully expected to  see his head go down behind the counter,  and his little black breeches, with  the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees, come quivering up in a last  ineffectual struggle.  At length, however, he got  better, though he still panted hard,  and was so exhausted that he was obliged to sit on the stool of the shop-desk. &#x27;You see,&#x27; he said, wiping his head, and breathing with difficulty, &#x27;she  hasn&#x27;t taken much to  any companions here;  she hasn&#x27;t taken  kindly to any  particular acquaintances and friends, not to mention  sweethearts.  In consequence, an  ill natured story got  about, that Em&#x27;ly  wanted to be  a lady.  Now  my opinion is, that it came into circulation principally on account of her sometimes saying, at the school, that if she was a lady she would like to do so-and-so for her  uncle - don&#x27;t you see? - and buy him such-and-such fine things.&#x27; &#x27;I assure you, Mr. Omer,  she has said so to  me,&#x27; I returned eagerly, &#x27;when  we were both children.&#x27; Mr. Omer nodded  his head and  rubbed his chin.   &#x27;Just so.  Then  out of a very little, she could dress herself, you see, better than most others could out of a deal, and that made  things unpleasant. Moreover, she  was rather what might  be called wayward - I&#x27;ll go  so far as to say  what I should call wayward  myself,&#x27; said Mr.  Omer; &#x27;-  didn&#x27;t know  her own  mind quite  - a  little spoiled  - and couldn&#x27;t, at first, exactly bind herself down.  No more than that was ever  said against her, Minnie?&#x27; &#x27;No, father,&#x27; said Mrs. Joram.  &#x27;That&#x27;s the worst, I believe.&#x27; &#x27;So when  she got  a situation,&#x27;  said Mr.  Omer, &#x27;to  keep a fractious old lady company, they  didn&#x27;t very  well agree,  and she  didn&#x27;t stop.  At last she came here, apprenticed for three years.  Nearly two of &#x27;em are over, and she has been as good a girl as ever was.  Worth any six!  Minnie, is she worth any six, now?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, father,&#x27; replied Minnie.  &#x27;Never say I detracted from her!&#x27; &#x27;Very good,&#x27; said Mr. Omer.  &#x27;That&#x27;s right.  And so, young gentleman,&#x27; he added, after a few moments&#x27; further rubbing of his chin, &#x27;that you may not consider  me long-winded as well as short-breathed, I believe that&#x27;s all about it.&#x27; As they had spoken in  a subdued tone, while speaking  of Em&#x27;ly, I had no  doubt that she was near.  On my asking now, if that were not so, Mr. Omer nodded  yes, and nodded towards the door of the parlour.  My hurried inquiry if I might  peep in, was answered with a free  permission; and, looking through the glass,  I saw her sitting at her work.  I saw her, a most beautiful little creature, with  the cloudless blue eyes, that had  looked into my childish heart,  turned laughingly upon  another  child  of Minnie&#x27;s  who  was  playing near  her;  with  enough of wilfulness in her bright face to justify what I had heard; with much of the  old capricious coyness lurking  in it; but  with nothing in  her pretty looks,  I am sure, but what was meant for goodness and for happiness, and what was on a  good and happy course. The tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left off - alas! it  was the tune that never DOES leave off - was beating, softly, all the while. &#x27;Wouldn&#x27;t you like to step  in,&#x27; said Mr. Omer, &#x27;and  speak to her? Walk in  and speak to her, sir!  Make yourself at home!&#x27; I was too bashful to do  so then - I was afraid  of confusing her, and I was  no less afraid of confusing myself.- but I informed myself of the hour at which she left of  an evening,  in order  that our  visit might  be timed accordingly; and taking leave of Mr. Omer, and his pretty daughter, and her little children, went away to my dear old Peggotty&#x27;s. Here she was, in the tiled kitchen, cooking dinner!  The moment I knocked at the door she opened it, and asked me what I pleased to want.  I looked at her with a smile, but she gave me no smile in return.  I had never ceased to write to  her, but it must have been seven years since we had met. &#x27;Is Mr. Barkis at home, ma&#x27;am?&#x27; I said, feigning to speak roughly to her. &#x27;He&#x27;s at home, sir,&#x27; returned Peggotty, &#x27;but he&#x27;s bad abed with the rheumatics.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t he go over to Blunderstone now?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;When he&#x27;s well he do,&#x27; she answered. &#x27;Do YOU ever go there, Mrs. Barkis?&#x27; She looked at me more attentively, and  I noticed a quick movement of her  hands towards each other. &#x27;Because I want to ask a question about a house there, that they call the - what is it? - the Rookery,&#x27; said I. She took a step backward, and put out her hands in an undecided frightened  way, as if to keep me off. &#x27;Peggotty!&#x27; I cried to her. She cried, &#x27;My darling  boy!&#x27; and we both  burst into tears, and  were locked in one another&#x27;s arms. What extravagances she committed; what  laughing and crying over me;  what pride she showed,  what joy,  what sorrow  that she  whose pride  and joy I might have been, could never hold me  in a fond embrace; I  have not the heart to  tell.  I was  troubled with  no misgiving  that it  was young  in me  to respond  to  her emotions.  I had never laughed and cried in  all my life, I dare say - not  even to her - more freely than I did that morning. &#x27;Barkis will be so glad,&#x27; said  Peggotty, wiping her eyes with her  apron, &#x27;that it&#x27;ll do him more good  than pints of liniment.  May  I go and tell him  you are here?  Will you come up and see him, my dear?&#x27; Of course I would.  But Peggotty could not get out of the room as easily as  she meant to, for as often as she got  to the door and looked round at me,  she came back again to have another laugh and another cry upon my shoulder.  At last,  to make the matter easier, I went upstairs with her; and having waited outside  for a minute, while she said a  word of preparation to Mr. Barkis,  presented myself before that invalid. He received  me with  absolute enthusiasm.   He was  too rheumatic  to be shaken hands with, but  he begged me  to shake the  tassel on the  top of his nightcap, which I did most  cordially.  When I sat  down by the side  of the bed, he  said that  it did  him a  world of  good to  feel as  if he  was driving  me on   the Blunderstone road again.  As  he lay in bed,  face upward, and so  covered, with that exception, that he  seemed to be nothing  but a face -  like a conventional cherubim - he looked the queerest object I ever beheld. &#x27;What name was it, as I wrote up in the cart, sir?&#x27; said Mr. Barkis, with a slow rheumatic smile. &#x27;Ah! Mr. Barkis, we had some grave talks about that matter, hadn&#x27;t we?&#x27; &#x27;I was willin&#x27; a long time, sir?&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. &#x27;A long time,&#x27; said I. &#x27;And I don&#x27;t  regret it,&#x27; said  Mr. Barkis.  &#x27;Do  you remember what  you told me once, about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, very well,&#x27; I returned. &#x27;It was as true,&#x27; said  Mr. Barkis, &#x27;as turnips is.   It was as true,&#x27; said  Mr. Barkis, nodding his nightcap,  which was his only  means of emphasis, &#x27;as  taxes is.  And nothing&#x27;s truer than them.&#x27; Mr. Barkis turned his eyes  upon me, as if for  my assent to this result  of his reflections in bed; and I gave it. &#x27;Nothing&#x27;s truer than them,&#x27; repeated Mr. Barkis; &#x27;a man as poor as I am,  finds that out in his mind when he&#x27;s laid up.  I&#x27;m a very poor man, sir!&#x27; &#x27;I am sorry to hear it, Mr. Barkis.&#x27; &#x27;A very poor man, indeed I am,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. Here his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes, and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of  a stick which was loosely tied  to the side of the bed.  After some poking about with this instrument, in the course of which his face assumed a variety of distracted expressions, Mr. Barkis poked  it against a box, an  end of which had  been visible to me  all the time. Then  his face became composed. &#x27;Old clothes,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. &#x27;Oh!&#x27; said I. &#x27;I wish it was Money, sir,&#x27; said Mr. Barkis. &#x27;I wish it was, indeed,&#x27; said I. &#x27;But it AIN&#x27;T,&#x27; said  Mr. Barkis, opening both  his eyes as wide  as he possibly could. I expressed myself  quite sure of  that, and Mr.  Barkis, turning his  eyes more gently to his wife, said: &#x27;She&#x27;s the usefullest  and best of  women, C. P.   Barkis.  All the  praise that anyone can give to C. P.  Barkis, she deserves, and more! My dear, you&#x27;ll get  a dinner today, for company; something good to eat and drink, will you?&#x27; I should have protested against this unnecessary demonstration in my honour, but that I saw Peggotty, on the opposite side of the bed, extremely anxious I should not.  So I held my peace. &#x27;I have got  a trifle of  money somewhere about  me, my dear,&#x27;  said Mr. Barkis, &#x27;but I&#x27;m a little tired.   If you and Mr. David  will leave me for a  short nap, I&#x27;ll try and find it when I wake.&#x27; We left  the room,  in compliance  with this  request.  When  we got outside the door, Peggotty informed me that Mr. Barkis, being now &#x27;a little nearer&#x27; than  he used to be, always resorted to  this same device before producing a  single coin from his store; and  that he endured unheard-of  agonies in crawling out  of bed alone, and taking it from that  unlucky box.  In effect, we presently  heard him uttering suppressed groans of the most dismal nature, as this magpie  proceeding racked him in every joint; but while Peggotty&#x27;s eyes were full of compassion for him, she said his generous impulse would  do him good, and it was better  not to check it.  So he groaned on, until he had got into bed again, suffering, I  have no doubt, a martyrdom;  and then called us  in, pretending to have  just woke up from a refreshing  sleep, and to  produce a guinea  from under his  pillow.  His satisfaction  in which  happy imposition  on us,  and in  having preserved   the impenetrable secret of the box, appeared to be a sufficient compensation to  him for all his tortures. I prepared Peggotty for Steerforth&#x27;s arrival and it was not long before he came. I  am  persuaded she  knew  no difference  between  his having  been  a personal benefactor of hers, and  a kind friend to  me, and that she  would have received him with the utmost gratitude and devotion in any case.  But his easy,  spirited good humour; his genial manner, his handsome looks, his natural gift of adapting himself to whomsoever he pleased, and making direct, when he cared to do it,  to the main point of interest in anybody&#x27;s  heart; bound her to him wholly in  five minutes.  His manner to me, alone,  would have won her.  But, through  all these causes combined, I sincerely believe she had a kind of adoration for him  before he left the house that night. He stayed there with  me to dinner -  if I were to  say willingly, I should  not half express how readily and gaily.   He went into Mr. Barkis&#x27;s room  like light and air, brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy weather.  There was no noise, no effort, no consciousness, in anything he did; but in everything  an indescribable  lightness, a  seeming impossibility  of doing  anything else,  or doing anything better, which was so graceful, so natural, and agreeable, that it overcomes me, even now, in the remembrance. We made merry in the little parlour, where the Book of Martyrs, unthumbed  since my time, was laid out upon the desk  as of old, and where I now turned  over its terrific pictures,  remembering the  old sensations  they had  awakened, but not feeling them.  When Peggotty spoke of what she called my room, and of its  being ready for me at night,  and of her hoping I  would occupy it, before I  could so much as look at Steerforth, hesitating, he was possessed of the whole case. &#x27;Of course,&#x27; he said.  &#x27;You&#x27;ll sleep here,  while we stay, and I shall sleep  at the hotel.&#x27; &#x27;But  to  bring  you  so  far,&#x27;   I  returned,  &#x27;and  to  separate,  seems   bad companionship, Steerforth.&#x27; &#x27;Why, in the name of Heaven, where do you naturally belong?&#x27; he said.  &#x27;What  is &quot;seems&quot;, compared to that?&#x27;  It was settled at once. He maintained all his delightful qualities to the last, until we started  forth, at eight  o&#x27;clock, for  Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s  boat.  Indeed,  they were  more and more brightly exhibited as the hours went on; for I thought even then, and I have  no doubt now,  that the  consciousness of  success in  his determination to please, inspired him with a new delicacy of  perception, and made it, subtle as it  was, more easy to him.  If  anyone had told me, then,  that all this was a  brilliant game,  played for  the excitement  of the  moment, for  the employment  of  high spirits, in  the thoughtless  love of  superiority, in  a mere wasteful careless course of winning  what was worthless  to him, and  next minute thrown  away - I say, if anyone had  told me such a  lie that night, I  wonder in what manner  of receiving  it my  indignation would  have found  a vent!   Probably only  in  an increase,  had that  been possible,  of the  romantic feelings  of fidelity  and friendship with which I  walked beside him, over  the dark wintry sands  towards the old  boat; the  wind sighing  around us  even more  mournfully, than  it had sighed and moaned upon the night when I first darkened Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s door. &#x27;This is a wild kind of place, Steerforth, is it not?&#x27; &#x27;Dismal enough in the dark,&#x27;  he said: &#x27;and the sea  roars as if it were  hungry for us.  Is that the boat, where I see a light yonder?&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s the boat,&#x27;  said I. &#x27;And it&#x27;s the same I saw this morning,&#x27; he returned.  &#x27;I came straight to it, by instinct, I suppose.&#x27; We said no  more as we  approached the light,  but made softly  for the door.  I laid my hand upon the latch; and whispering Steerforth to keep close to me, went in. A murmur of voices had  been audible on the outside,  and, at the moment of  our entrance, a  clapping of  hands: which  latter noise,  I was  surprised to  see, proceeded from the generally disconsolate Mrs. Gummidge.  But Mrs. Gummidge  was not the only  person there who  was unusually excited.   Mr. Peggotty, his  face lighted up with uncommon satisfaction, and laughing with all his might, held his rough arms wide open, as if for little Em&#x27;ly to run into them; Ham, with a mixed expression  in his  face of  admiration, exultation,  and a  lumbering sort   of bashfulness that sat upon him very well, held little Em&#x27;ly by the hand, as if he were presenting her to Mr. Peggotty; little Em&#x27;ly herself, blushing and shy, but delighted with Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s delight, as her joyous eyes expressed, was stopped by our entrance (for she saw us first) in the very act of springing from Ham  to nestle in Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s embrace.  In the first glimpse we had of them all,  and at the moment of our passing from the dark cold night into the warm light  room, this  was  the  way in  which  they  were all  employed:  Mrs.  Gummidge in  the background, clapping her hands like a madwoman. The little picture was  so instantaneously dissolved by  our going in, that  one might  have doubted  whether it  had ever   been.  I  was in  the midst  of  the astonished family, face to  face with Mr. Peggotty,  and holding out my  hand to him, when Ham shouted: &#x27;Mas&#x27;r Davy!  It&#x27;s Mas&#x27;r Davy!&#x27; In a moment we were all shaking  hands with one another, and asking one  another how we did, and telling one another how glad we were to meet, and all talking at once.  Mr. Peggotty was so proud and  overjoyed to see us, that he did  not know what to say or do, but kept over and over again shaking hands with me, and  then with Steerforth, and then  with me, and then  ruffling his shaggy hair  all over his head, and laughing with  such glee and triumph, that  it was a treat to  see him. &#x27;Why, that you two gent&#x27;lmen - gent&#x27;lmen growed - should come to this here  roof tonight, of all nights in my life,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty, &#x27;is such a thing as never happened afore, I do rightly believe!  Em&#x27;ly, my darling, come here!  Come here, my little witch!  There&#x27;s Mas&#x27;r  Davy&#x27;s friend, my dear!  There&#x27;s  the gent&#x27;lman as you&#x27;ve heerd on, Em&#x27;ly.  He comes  to see you, along with Mas&#x27;r Davy,  on the brightest night of your  uncle&#x27;s life as ever  was or will be,  Gorm the t&#x27;other one, and horroar for it!&#x27; After delivering this speech all  in a breath, and with  extraordinary animation and pleasure, Mr. Peggotty put one  of his large hands rapturously on  each side of his niece&#x27;s face, and kissing it  a dozen times, laid it with a  gentle pride and love upon his broad chest, and patted  it as if his hand had been a  lady&#x27;s. Then he  let her  go; and  as she  ran into  the little  chamber where I used to sleep, looked  round upon  us, quite  hot and  out of  breath with  his uncommon satisfaction. &#x27;If you two  gent&#x27;lmen - gent&#x27;lmen  growed now, and  such gent&#x27;lmen -&#x27;  said Mr. Peggotty. &#x27;So th&#x27; are, so th&#x27; are!&#x27; cried  Ham.  &#x27;Well said!  So th&#x27; are. Mas&#x27;r  Davy bor&#x27; gent&#x27;lmen growed - so th&#x27; are!&#x27; &#x27;If you two gent&#x27;lmen, gent&#x27;lmen  growed,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty, &#x27;don&#x27;t  ex-cuse me for  being in  a state  of mind,  when you  understand matters,  I&#x27;ll arks  your pardon.  Em&#x27;ly,  my dear!  - She  knows I&#x27;m  a going  to tell,&#x27; here his delight broke out again,  &#x27;and has made  off.  Would you  be so good  as look arter her, Mawther, for a minute?&#x27; Mrs. Gummidge nodded and disappeared. &#x27;If this  ain&#x27;t,&#x27; said  Mr. Peggotty,  sitting down  among us  by the fire, &#x27;the brightest night o&#x27; my life, I&#x27;m a shellfish - biled too - and more I can&#x27;t  say. This here little Em&#x27;ly, sir,&#x27; in a low voice to Steerforth, &#x27;- her as you see  a blushing here just now -&#x27; Steerforth only nodded; but with such  a pleased expression of interest, and  of participation in Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s feelings, that the latter answered him as if  he had spoken. &#x27;To be sure,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty.  &#x27;That&#x27;s her, and so she is. Thankee, sir.&#x27; Ham nodded to me several times, as if he would have said so too. &#x27;This here little Em&#x27;ly  of ours,&#x27; said Mr.  Peggotty, &#x27;has been, in  our house, what I suppose (I&#x27;m a  ignorant man, but that&#x27;s my  belief) no one but a  little bright-eyed creetur can be in a house. She ain&#x27;t my child; I never had one;  but I couldn&#x27;t love her more. You understand!  I couldn&#x27;t do it!&#x27; &#x27;I quite understand,&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;I know you do, sir,&#x27; returned Mr. Peggotty, &#x27;and thankee again. Mas&#x27;r Davy,  he can remember what  she was; you  may judge for  your own self  what she is;  but neither of you can&#x27;t fully know what she has been, is, and will be, to my loving art.  I am rough, sir,&#x27;  said Mr. Peggotty, &#x27;I am  as rough as a Sea  Porkypine; but no one, unless, mayhap,  it is a woman, can  know, I think, what our  little Em&#x27;ly is  to me.   And betwixt  ourselves,&#x27; sinking  his voice  lower yet, &#x27;that woman&#x27;s name ain&#x27;t Missis Gummidge neither,  though she has a world of  merits.&#x27; Mr. Peggotty ruffled his hair again,  with both hands, as a further  preparation for what he was going to say, and went on, with a hand upon each of his knees: &#x27;There was  a certain  person as  had know&#x27;d  our Em&#x27;ly,  from the time when her father was drownded; as had seen her  constant; when a babby, when a young  gal, when a woman.  Not much of a  person to look at, he warn&#x27;t,&#x27; said  Mr. Peggotty, &#x27;something o&#x27; my own  build - rough   - a good  deal o&#x27; the  sou&#x27;-wester  in him wery salt -  but, on the  whole, a honest  sort of a  chap, with his  art in the right place.&#x27; I thought I had never seen Ham grin to anything like the extent to which he  sat grinning at us now. &#x27;What does this here blessed tarpaulin  go and do,&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty,  with his face one high  noon of enjoyment,  &#x27;but he loses  that there art  of his to  our little Em&#x27;ly.  He follers her about, he makes hisself a sort o&#x27; servant to  her, he loses in a great measure his  relish for his wittles, and in the  long-run he makes it clear to me  wot&#x27;s amiss.  Now I could  wish myself, you see, that  our little Em&#x27;ly was in a  fair way of being married.   I could wish to see  her, at all ewents, under  articles to a  honest man as  had a right  to defend her.   I don&#x27;t know how long I may live, or how soon I may die; but I know that if I  was capsized, any night, in a  gale of wind in Yarmouth  Roads here, and was to  see the town-lights shining for the last time over the rollers as I couldn&#x27;t make no head against, I could go down quieter for thinking &quot;There&#x27;s a man ashore  there, iron-true to my  little Em&#x27;ly, God  bless her, and  no wrong can  touch my Em&#x27;ly while so be as that man lives.&quot;&#x27; Mr. Peggotty, in simple earnestness, waved  his right arm, as if he  were waving it at the town-lights  for the last time,  and then, exchanging a  nod with Ham, whose eye he caught, proceeded as before. &#x27;Well! I counsels him to speak  to Em&#x27;ly.  He&#x27;s big enough, but  he&#x27;s bashfuller than a little un, and he don&#x27;t like.  So I speak. &quot;What!  Him!&quot; says Em&#x27;ly. &quot;Him that I&#x27;ve  know&#x27;d so  intimate so  many years,  and like  so much.  Oh, Uncle! I never can have him. He&#x27;s such a good fellow!&quot; I gives her a kiss, and I says  no more to  her than,  &quot;My dear,  you&#x27;re right  to speak  out, you&#x27;re to choose for yourself, you&#x27;re as free as a little bird.&quot; Then I aways to him, and I says,  &quot;I wish it could have been so, but it  can&#x27;t.  But you can both be as you  was, and wot I say to  you is, Be  as you was  with her, like  a man.&quot; He  says to me,  a shaking of my hand, &quot;I will!&quot; he says.  And he was - honourable and manful - for two year going on, and we was just the same at home here as afore.&#x27; Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s face, which had varied in its expression with the various  stages of his narrative, now  resumed all its former  triumphant delight, as he  laid a hand upon my knee  and a hand upon  Steerforth&#x27;s (previously wetting them  both, for  the greater  emphasis of  the action),  and divided  the following   speech between us: &#x27;All of a sudden, one evening - as it might be tonight - comes little Em&#x27;ly from her work,  and him  with her!   There ain&#x27;t  so much  in that,  you&#x27;ll say.  No, because he takes care on her, like a brother, arter dark, and indeed afore dark, and at all times.  But  this tarpaulin chap, he takes  hold of her hand, and  he cries out to  me, joyful, &quot;Look  here!  This is  to be my  little wife!&quot; And she says, half  bold and  half shy,  and half  a laughing  and half  a crying, &quot;Yes, Uncle!  If you please.&quot; - If I please!&#x27; cried Mr. Peggotty, rolling his head  in an ecstasy  at the  idea; &#x27;Lord,  as if  I should  do anythink  else! -  &quot;If you please, I am steadier now, and I have thought better of it, and I&#x27;ll be as  good a little  wife as  I can  to him,  for he&#x27;s  a dear,  good fellow!&quot;  Then Missis Gummidge, she claps her hands like a play, and you come in.  Theer! the murder&#x27;s out!&#x27; said Mr. Peggotty - &#x27;You come  in!  It took place this here present  hour; and here&#x27;s the man that&#x27;ll marry her, the minute she&#x27;s out of her time.&#x27; Ham staggered, as well  he might, under the  blow Mr. Peggotty dealt  him in his unbounded joy, as a mark of  confidence and friendship; but feeling called  upon to say something to us, he said, with much faltering and great difficulty: &#x27;She warn&#x27;t no higher than  you was, Mas&#x27;r Davy -  when you first come -  when I thought what  she&#x27;d grow  up to  be.  I  see her  grown up  - gent&#x27;lmen - like a flower.  I&#x27;d  lay down  my life  for her  - Mas&#x27;r  Davy -  Oh! most  content and cheerful!  She&#x27;s more to me - gent&#x27;lmen - than - she&#x27;s all to me that ever I can want, and more than ever I - than ever I could say.  I - I love her true.  There ain&#x27;t a gent&#x27;lman in all the land - nor yet sailing upon all the sea - that  can love his lady more than I love her, though there&#x27;s many a common man - would say better - what he meant.&#x27; I thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as Ham was now, trembling  in the strength  of what  he felt  for the  pretty little  creature who had won his heart.  I thought  the simple confidence  reposed in us  by Mr. Peggotty  and by himself, was, in itself, affecting.  I was affected by the story altogether. How far my emotions were  influenced by the recollections  of my childhood, I  don&#x27;t know.  Whether I  had come there  with any lingering  fancy that I  was still to love little Em&#x27;ly, I don&#x27;t know.  I know that I was filled with pleasure by  all this;  but, at  first, with  an indescribably  sensitive pleasure,  that a  very little would have changed to pain. Therefore, if it had depended upon  me to touch the prevailing chord  among them with any  skill, I  should have  made a  poor hand  of it.  But it depended upon Steerforth; and he did it with such  address, that in a few minutes we  were all as easy and as happy as it was possible to be. &#x27;Mr. Peggotty,&#x27; he said, &#x27;you are a thoroughly good fellow, and deserve to be as happy as you are tonight.   My hand upon it!  Ham,  I give you joy, my  boy.  My hand upon that,  too!  Daisy, stir  the fire, and  make it a  brisk one! and Mr. Peggotty, unless  you can  induce your  gentle niece  to come  back (for  whom I vacate this seat in the corner), I shall go.  Any gap at your fireside on such a night -  such a  gap least  of all  - I  wouldn&#x27;t make,  for the  wealth of  the Indies!&#x27; So Mr. Peggotty went  into my old room  to fetch little Em&#x27;ly.   At first little Em&#x27;ly didn&#x27;t like to come, and then Ham went. Presently they brought her to  the fireside, very much confused, and very  shy, - but she soon became  more assured when  she  found  how  gently and  respectfully  Steerforth  spoke  to her;  how skilfully he avoided  anything that would  embarrass her; how  he talked to  Mr. Peggotty of boats, and ships, and tides,  and fish; how he referred to me  about the time when he had seen Mr. Peggotty at Salem House; how delighted he was with the boat and all belonging to it; how lightly and easily he carried on, until he brought us,  by degrees,  into a  charmed circle,  and we  were all talking away without any reserve. Em&#x27;ly, indeed, said little  all the evening; but  she looked, and listened,  and her face got animated, and she was charming. Steerforth told a story of a dismal shipwreck (which arose out of his talk  with Mr. Peggotty), as if he saw  it all before him - and little  Em&#x27;ly&#x27;s eyes were fastened on  him all the time, as  if she saw it too.  He told us a  merry adventure of his own, as a relief  to that, with as much gaiety as if the  narrative  were as fresh to him  as it was  to us and little Em&#x27;ly laughed until the boat rang with the musical sounds, and we all laughed (Steerforth too), in irresistible sympathy with what was so pleasant and light-hearted. He got Mr. Peggotty to sing, or rather to roar, &#x27;When the  stormy winds do  blow, do  blow, do  blow&#x27;; and  he sang  a sailor&#x27;s  song himself,  so pathetically and  beautifully, that  I could  have almost  fancied that the real wind  creeping  sorrowfully  round  the house,  and  murmuring  low  through our unbroken silence, was there to listen. As to Mrs. Gummidge, he roused  that victim of despondency with a  success never attained by anyone else (so Mr. Peggotty informed me), since the decease of  the old one.  He left her so little leisure for being miserable, that she said  next day she thought she must have been bewitched. But he set up no monopoly  of the general attention, or the  conversation.  When little Em&#x27;ly grew more courageous,  and talked (but still bashfully)  across the fire to me, of our old wanderings upon the beach, to pick up shells and pebbles; and when I asked  her if she recollected  how I used to  be devoted to her;  and when we both laughed and reddened, casting these looks back on the pleasant  old times, so unreal to  look at now; he  was silent and attentive,  and observed us thoughtfully.  She sat, at this time, and all the evening, on the old locker  in her old little  corner by the  fire - Ham  beside her, where  I used to  sit.  I could not satisfy myself whether it was in her own little tormenting way, or  in a maidenly reserve before  us, that she kept  quite close to the  wall, and away from him; but I observed that she did so, all the evening. As I remember, it was almost midnight  when we took our leave.  We had  had some biscuit and dried fish for supper, and Steerforth had produced from his pocket a full flask of Hollands, which  we men (I may say  we men, now, without a  blush) had emptied.  We parted merrily; and as they all stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our road, I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em&#x27;ly peeping after us, from behind Ham, and heard her soft voice calling to  us to be careful how we went. &#x27;A most engaging little Beauty!&#x27; said Steerforth, taking my arm. &#x27;Well!  It&#x27;s  a quaint place, and they are quaint company, and it&#x27;s quite a new sensation to mix with them.&#x27; &#x27;How fortunate  we are,  too,&#x27; I  returned, &#x27;to  have arrived  to witness  their happiness  in  that  intended  marriage!  I  never  saw  people  so happy.   How delightful to see it, and to be made the sharers in their honest joy, as we have been!&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s rather a chuckle-headed fellow for the girl; isn&#x27;t he?&#x27; said Steerforth. He had been so hearty with him, and  with them all, that I felt a shock  in this unexpected and cold reply.  But turning quickly upon him, and seeing a laugh  in his eyes, I answered, much relieved: &#x27;Ah, Steerforth!  It&#x27;s well  for you to joke  about the poor!  You  may skirmish with Miss Dartle,  or try to  hide your sympathies  in jest from  me, but I know better.  When I see how perfectly  you understand them, how exquisitely you  can enter into happiness like this plain  fisherman&#x27;s, or humour a love like  my old nurse&#x27;s, I  know that  there is  not a  joy or  sorrow, not  an emotion, of such people, that  can be  indifferent to  you.  And  I admire  and love  you for it, Steerforth, twenty times the more!&#x27; He stopped, and, looking in my face, said, &#x27;Daisy, I believe you are in earnest, and  are good.   I wish  we all  were!&#x27; Next  moment he  was gaily  singing  Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s song, as we walked at a round pace back to Yarmouth. CHAPTER 22 SOME OLD SCENES, AND SOME NEW PEOPLE Steerforth and I stayed for more than  a fortnight in that part of the  country. We were very much together, I need not say; but occasionally we were asunder for some hours at a time.  He was a  good sailor, and I was but an indifferent  one; and when he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty, which was a favourite  amusement of his, I generally remained ashore.  My occupation of Peggotty&#x27;s spare-room put a constraint upon me, from which  he was free: for, knowing how  assiduously she attended on Mr.  Barkis all day,  I did not  like to remain  out late at  night; whereas Steerforth, lying at the Inn, had nothing to consult but his own humour. Thus it came about, that I heard  of his making little treats for the  fishermen at Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s house of call, &#x27;The Willing Mind&#x27;, after I was in bed, and  of his being afloat,  wrapped in fishermen&#x27;s  clothes, whole moonlight  nights, and coming back when the morning tide was  at flood.  By this time, however, I  knew that his restless nature and bold spirits delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard  weather, as  in any  other means  of excitement  that presented itself freshly to him; so none of his proceedings surprised me. Another  cause  of our  being  sometimes apart,  was,  that I  had  naturally an interest in going over to  Blunderstone, and revisiting the old  familiar scenes of my  childhood; while  Steerforth, after  being there  once, had  naturally no great interest in going there again.  Hence, on three or four days that I can at once recall, we went our several ways after an early breakfast, and met again at a late dinner.  I had no idea how he employed his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one. For my own part,  my occupation in my  solitary pilgrimages was to  recall every yard of the old road as I went along it, and to haunt the old spots, of which  I never tired.  I haunted  them, as my memory  had often done, and  lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I was far away.  The grave beneath the tree, where both my parents lay - on which I had looked out, when it was  my father&#x27;s only,  with such  curious feelings  of compassion,  and by  which I had stood, so desolate, when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her  baby - the grave  which Peggotty&#x27;s own  faithful care had  ever since kept  neat, and made  a  garden of,  I  walked near,  by  the hour.   It  lay a  little  off the churchyard path,  in a  quiet corner,  not so  far removed  but I could read the names upon  the stone  as I  walked to  and fro,  startled by  the sound  of the church-bell when it struck the hour, for it was like a departed voice to me.  My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure I was to  make in life, and the distinguished things I was to do.  My echoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were  as constant to that as  if I had come home  to build my castles in the air at a living mother&#x27;s side. There were great changes in my old home.  The ragged nests, so long deserted  by the  rooks,  were gone;  and  the trees  were  lopped and  topped  out of  their remembered shapes.  The garden had run  wild, and half the windows of  the house were shut up.  It  was occupied, but only  by a poor lunatic  gentleman, and the people who took care of him.  He was always sitting at my little window, looking out into the churchyard; and I wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever  went upon any of the fancies  that used to occupy mine,  on the rosy mornings when  I peeped out of  that same little  window in my  night-clothes, and saw  the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun. Our old neighbours, Mr.  and Mrs. Grayper, were  gone to South America,  and the rain had made  its way through  the roof of  their empty house,  and stained the outer walls.   Mr. Chillip  was married  again to  a tall, raw-boned, high-nosed wife; and they had a weazen little baby, with a heavy head that it couldn&#x27;t hold up, and two weak staring eyes, with  which it seemed to be always wondering  why it had ever been born. It was  with a  singular jumble  of sadness  and pleasure  that I used to linger about my native place, until the reddening winter sun admonished me that it  was time to start on  my returning walk.  But,  when the place was  left behind, and especially  when Steerforth  and I  were happily  seated over  our dinner  by  a blazing fire, it was delicious to think of having been there.  So it was, though in a softened degree, when  I went to my neat  room at night; and, turning  over the leaves of the crocodile-book (which was always there, upon a little  table), remembered with  a grateful  heart how  blest I  was in  having such a friend as Steerforth, such a friend as Peggotty, and such a substitute for what I had lost as my excellent and generous aunt. MY nearest  way to  Yarmouth, in  coming back  from these  long walks,  was by a ferry.  It landed  me on the  flat between the  town and the  sea, which I could make straight  across, and  so save  myself a  considerable circuit  by the high road.  Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s house being on  that waste-place, and not a hundred  yards out of my track, I always looked in as I went by.  Steerforth was pretty sure to be  there expecting  me, and  we went  on together  through the  frosty air  and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town. One dark evening, when I was later than usual - for I had, that day, been making my parting visit to Blunderstone, as we were now about to return home - I  found him alone in Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s house, sitting thoughtfully before the fire.  He was so intent upon his own reflections that he was quite unconscious of my approach. This,  indeed, he  might easily  have been  if he  had been  less absorbed,  for footsteps fell  noiselessly on  the sandy  ground outside;  but even my entrance failed to rouse him.   I was standing close  to him, looking at  him; and still, with a heavy brow, he was lost in his meditations. He gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder, that he made me start too. &#x27;You come upon me,&#x27; he said, almost angrily, &#x27;like a reproachful ghost!&#x27; &#x27;I was obliged to announce myself, somehow,&#x27; I replied.  &#x27;Have I called you down from the stars?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; he answered.  &#x27;No.&#x27; &#x27;Up from anywhere, then?&#x27; said I, taking my seat near him. &#x27;I was looking at the pictures in the fire,&#x27; he returned. &#x27;But you are  spoiling them for  me,&#x27; said I,  as he stirred  it quickly with  a piece of burning wood,  striking out of it  a train of red-hot  sparks that went careering up the little chimney, and roaring out into the air. &#x27;You would  not have  seen them,&#x27;  he returned.   &#x27;I detest  this mongrel  time, neither day nor night.  How late you are!  Where have you been?&#x27; &#x27;I have been taking leave of my usual walk,&#x27; said I. &#x27;And  I have  been sitting  here,&#x27; said  Steerforth, glancing  round the   room, &#x27;thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of our coming  down, might - to  judge from the  present wasted air  of the place  - be dispersed, or dead, or  come to  I don&#x27;t  know what  harm.  David,  I wish  to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years!&#x27; &#x27;My dear Steerforth, what is the matter?&#x27; &#x27;I wish with all my soul I  had been better guided!&#x27; he exclaimed. &#x27;I  wish with all my soul I could guide myself better!&#x27; There was a  passionate dejection in  his manner that  quite amazed me.   He was more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible. &#x27;It would be better to be this poor Peggotty, or his lout of a nephew,&#x27; he said, getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney-piece, with his face  towards the fire, &#x27;than to be myself, twenty times richer and twenty times wiser, and be the torment to myself that I have  been, in this Devil&#x27;s bark of a  boat, within the last half-hour!&#x27; I was so confounded by the alteration in him, that at first I could only observe him in silence, as he stood leaning his head upon his hand, and looking gloomily down at the fire.  At length I  begged him, with all the earnestness I  felt, to tell me what had  occurred to cross him  so unusually, and to  let me sympathize with him, if I could  not hope to advise him.   Before I had well concluded,  he began to laugh - fretfully at first, but soon with returning gaiety. &#x27;Tut, it&#x27;s  nothing, Daisy!  nothing!&#x27; he  replied.  &#x27;I  told you  at the inn in London, I am heavy  company for myself, sometimes.   I have been a  nightmare to myself, just now - must have had one, I think.  At odd dull times, nursery tales come up into the memory, unrecognized for what they are.  I believe I have  been confounding myself with the bad boy who &quot;didn&#x27;t care&quot;, and became food for lions - a  grander kind  of going  to the  dogs, I  suppose.  What  old women call the horrors, have been creeping  over me from head  to foot.  I have  been afraid of myself.&#x27; &#x27;You are afraid of nothing else, I think,&#x27; said I. &#x27;Perhaps not, and yet may have enough to be afraid of too,&#x27; he answered.  &#x27;Well! So it goes by!   I am not about  to be hipped again,  David; but I tell  you, my good fellow, once more, that it would  have been well for me (and for  more than me) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father!&#x27; His face was always full of expression,  but I never saw it express such  a dark kind of earnestness  as when he  said these words,  with his glance  bent on the fire. &#x27;So much for  that!&#x27; he said,  making as if  he tossed something  light into the air, with his hand.   &quot;&#x27;Why, being gone, I  am a man again,&quot;  like Macbeth.  And now for  dinner!  If  I have  not (Macbeth-like)  broken up  the feast with most admired disorder, Daisy.&#x27; &#x27;But where are they all, I wonder!&#x27; said I. &#x27;God knows,&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;After strolling to the ferry looking for you,  I strolled in here  and found the  place deserted. That  set me thinking,  and you found me thinking.&#x27; The advent of Mrs. Gummidge with a basket, explained how the house had  happened to be empty.  She had hurried out to buy something that was needed, against  Mr. Peggotty&#x27;s return with the  tide; and had left  the door open in  the meanwhile, lest Ham and  little Em&#x27;ly, with  whom it was  an early night,  should come home while  she was  gone.  Steerforth,  after very  much improving  Mrs.  Gummidge&#x27;s spirits by a cheerful salutation and a jocose embrace, took my arm, and  hurried me away. He had improved  his own spirits,  no less than  Mrs. Gummidge&#x27;s, for  they were again at their usual flow, and he was full of vivacious conversation as we  went along. &#x27;And so,&#x27; he said, gaily, &#x27;we abandon this buccaneer life tomorrow, do we?&#x27; &#x27;So we agreed,&#x27; I returned.  &#x27;And our places by the coach are taken, you know.&#x27; &#x27;Ay!  there&#x27;s no  help for  it, I  suppose,&#x27; said  Steerforth.  &#x27;I  have  almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here.  I wish there was not.&#x27; &#x27;As long as the novelty should last,&#x27; said I, laughing. &#x27;Like  enough,&#x27;  he  returned;  &#x27;though  there&#x27;s  a  sarcastic  meaning  in that observation for an  amiable piece of  innocence like my  young friend.  Well!  I dare say I am a  capricious fellow, David.  I know  I am; but while the  iron is hot, I can strike it vigorously too. I could pass a reasonably good  examination already, as a pilot in these waters, I think.&#x27; &#x27;Mr. Peggotty says you are a wonder,&#x27; I returned. &#x27;A nautical phenomenon, eh?&#x27; laughed Steerforth. &#x27;Indeed he  does, and  you know  how truly;  I know  how ardent  you are  in any pursuit you follow, and how easily you  can master it.  And that amazes me  most in you, Steerforth- that you should  be contented with such fitful uses  of your powers.&#x27; &#x27;Contented?&#x27; he  answered, merrily.   &#x27;I am  never contented,  except with  your freshness, my gentle Daisy.   As to fitfulness, I  have never learnt the  art of binding myself  to any  of the  wheels on  which the  Ixions of  these days  are turning round and round.  I missed  it somehow in a bad apprenticeship,  and now don&#x27;t care about it.  - You know I have bought a boat down here?&#x27; &#x27;What an extraordinary fellow you are, Steerforth!&#x27; I exclaimed, stopping -  for this was the first I had heard of it.  &#x27;When you may never care to come near the place again!&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know that,&#x27; he returned.  &#x27;I  have taken a fancy to the place.   At all events,&#x27; walking me  briskly on, &#x27;I  have bought a  boat that was  for sale -  a clipper, Mr. Peggotty says; and so she  is - and Mr. Peggotty will be  master of her in my absence.&#x27; &#x27;Now I understand  you, Steerforth!&#x27; said  I, exultingly.  &#x27;You  pretend to have bought it for yourself, but you have really done so to confer a benefit on  him. I might have known as much at first, knowing you.  My dear kind Steerforth,  how can I tell you what I think of your generosity?&#x27; &#x27;Tush!&#x27; he answered, turning red.  &#x27;The less said, the better.&#x27; &#x27;Didn&#x27;t I know?&#x27; cried I, &#x27;didn&#x27;t I say that there was not a joy, or sorrow,  or any emotion of such honest hearts that was indifferent to you?&#x27; &#x27;Aye, aye,&#x27; he answered, &#x27;you told me all that.  There let it rest. We have said enough!&#x27; Afraid of offending him by pursuing the  subject when he made so light of  it, I only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker pace than before. &#x27;She must be newly rigged,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;and I shall leave Littimer  behind to see it done, that I may know she is quite complete.  Did I tell you  Littimer had come down?&#x27; &#x27; No.&#x27; &#x27;Oh yes! came down this morning, with a letter from my mother.&#x27; As our looks met, I observed that he was pale even to his lips, though he looked very steadily at me.  I feared  that some difference between him and  his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which I had found him at the solitary fireside.  I hinted so. &#x27;Oh no!&#x27; he said, shaking his head,  and giving a slight laugh. &#x27;Nothing of  the sort!  Yes.  He is come down, that man of mine.&#x27; &#x27;The same as ever?&#x27; said I. &#x27;The same as ever,&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;Distant and quiet as the North Pole.   He shall see to the boat being  fresh named.  She&#x27;s the &quot;Stormy Petrel&quot;  now.  What does Mr. Peggotty care for Stormy Petrels!  I&#x27;ll have her christened again.&#x27; &#x27;By what name?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;The &quot;Little Em&#x27;ly&quot;.&#x27; As he had  continued to look  steadily at me,  I took it  as a reminder  that he objected to being extolled for his  consideration.  I could not help showing  in my face how  much it pleased  me, but I  said little, and  he resumed his  usual smile, and seemed relieved. &#x27;But see here,&#x27;  he said, looking  before us, &#x27;where  the original little  Em&#x27;ly comes!  And that  fellow with her,  eh?  Upon my  soul, he&#x27;s a  true knight.  He never leaves her!&#x27; Ham was a  boat-builder in these  days, having improved  a natural ingenuity  in that handicraft, until he had become a  skilled workman.  He was in his  working dress, and looked rugged enough, but manly withal, and a very fit protector  for the blooming little creature at his side.  Indeed, there was a frankness in  his face, an honesty, and an undisguised show of his pride in her, and his love  for her, which were, to me, the best of good looks.  I thought, as they came towards us, that they were well matched even in that particular. She withdrew her hand timidly from his  arm as we stopped to speak to  them, and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth  and to me.  When they passed on,  after we had exchanged a  few words, she  did not like  to replace that  hand, but, still appearing timid  and constrained,  walked by  herself.  I  thought all this very pretty and engaging, and Steerforth seemed  to think so too, as we  looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon. Suddenly  there passed  us -  evidently following  them -  a young  woman  whose approach we had not observed, but whose face I saw as she went by, and thought I had a faint remembrance of.  She was lightly dressed; looked bold, and  haggard, and flaunting, and poor; but seemed, for the time, to have given all that to the wind which was blowing, and to have nothing in her mind but going after them. As the dark  distant level,  absorbing their  figures into  itself, left but itself visible  between us  and the  sea and  clouds, her  figure disappeared  in  like manner, still no nearer to them than before. &#x27;That is a  black shadow to  be following the  girl,&#x27; said Steerforth,  standing still; &#x27;what does it mean?&#x27; He spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to Me. &#x27;She must have it in her mind to beg of them, I think,&#x27; said I. &#x27;A beggar would be no novelty,&#x27; said Steerforth; &#x27;but it is a strange thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight.&#x27; &#x27;Why?&#x27; I asked. &#x27;For no better  reason, truly, than  because I was  thinking,&#x27; he said,  after a pause, &#x27;of  something like  it, when  it came  by.  Where  the Devil did it come from, I wonder!&#x27; &#x27;From the shadow of this  wall, I think,&#x27; said I,  as we emerged upon a  road on which a wall abutted. &#x27;It&#x27;s gone!&#x27; he returned, looking over  his shoulder.  &#x27;And all ill go  with it. Now for our dinner!&#x27; But he looked again over his shoulder towards the sea-line glimmering afar  off, and yet again.  And  he wondered about it,  in some broken expressions,  several times, in the short remainder of our walk; and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us, seated warm and merry, at table. Littimer was there, and had his usual effect upon me.  When I said to him that I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss  Dartle were well, he answered  respectfully (and of course respectably), that  they were tolerably well,  he thanked me, and  had sent their compliments. This was all, and yet he seemed to me to say as  plainly as a man could say: &#x27;You are very young, sir; you are exceedingly young.&#x27; We had almost finished dinner, when taking a step or two towards the table, from the corner where he kept watch upon us, or rather upon me, as I felt, he said to his master: &#x27;I beg your pardon, sir.  Miss Mowcher is down here.&#x27; &#x27;Who?&#x27; cried Steerforth, much astonished. &#x27;Miss Mowcher, sir.&#x27; &#x27;Why, what on earth does she do here?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;It appears to be her native part of the country, sir.  She informs me that  she makes one of her  professional visits here, every  year, sir.  I met  her in the street this afternoon, and  she wished to know  if she might have  the honour of waiting on you after dinner, sir.&#x27; &#x27;Do you know the Giantess in question, Daisy?&#x27; inquired Steerforth. I was obliged to  confess - I felt  ashamed, even of being  at this disadvantage before Littimer - that Miss Mowcher and I were wholly unacquainted. &#x27;Then you shall know her,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;for she is one of the seven wonders of the world.  When Miss Mowcher comes, show her in.&#x27; I felt some curiosity and  excitement about this lady, especially  as Steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when  I referred to her, and positively refused  to answer any question of which I made her the subject.  I remained, therefore,  in a state of considerable expectation until  the cloth had been removed some  half an hour, and we were sitting over our decanter of wine before the fire, when the door  opened,  and  Littimer,  with  his  habitual  serenity  quite undisturbed, announced: &#x27;Miss Mowcher!&#x27; I looked at the  doorway and saw nothing.   I was still looking  at the doorway, thinking that Miss Mowcher was a  long while making her appearance, when,  to my infinite astonishment, there came waddling  round a sofa which stood  between me and it, a pursy dwarf, of about forty or forty-five, with a very large head  and face, a  pair of  roguish grey  eyes, and  such extremely  little arms, that, to enable  herself to  lay a  finger archly  against her  snub nose,  as she  ogled Steerforth,  she was  obliged to  meet the  finger half-way,  and lay  her  nose against it.  Her chin, which was what  is called a double chin, was so  fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet, bow and all.  Throat she had none; waist she had  none; legs she had  none, worth mentioning; for  though she was more than full-sized down to where her waist would have been, if she had had any, and though she terminated, as human beings generally do, in a pair of feet, she was so short that she stood at a common-sized chair as at a table, resting a bag she carried on  the seat.  This lady  - dressed in an  off-hand, easy style; bringing  her nose  and her  forefinger together,  with the  difficulty I   have described; standing with her head necessarily on one side, and, with one of  her sharp eyes shut up, making an uncommonly knowing face - after ogling  Steerforth for a few moments, broke into a torrent of words. &#x27;What!  My flower!&#x27; she pleasantly began, shaking her large head at him. &#x27;You&#x27;re there, are you!  Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you do so far  away from  home?   Up  to  mischief,  I&#x27;ll be  bound.   Oh,  you&#x27;re  a  downy fellow, Steerforth, so  you are,  and I&#x27;m  another, ain&#x27;t  I?  Ha,  ha, ha!   You&#x27;d have betted  a hundred  pound to  five, now,  that you  wouldn&#x27;t have  seen me  here, wouldn&#x27;t you? Bless  you, man alive,  I&#x27;m everywhere.  I&#x27;m  here and there,  and where not, like the conjurer&#x27;s half-crown in the lady&#x27;s handkercher.  Talking of handkerchers - and talking  of ladies - what  a comfort you are  to your blessed mother, ain&#x27;t  you, my  dear boy,  over one  of my  shoulders, and  I don&#x27;t  say which!&#x27; Miss Mowcher untied her bonnet, at this passage of her discourse, threw back the strings, and sat down, panting, on a  footstool in front of the fire -  making a kind of arbour of the dining table, which spread its mahogany shelter above  her head. &#x27;Oh my stars and  what&#x27;s-their-names!&#x27; she went on,  clapping a hand on  each of her little knees, and glancing shrewdly at me, &#x27;I&#x27;m of too full a habit,  that&#x27;s the fact, Steerforth.  After a flight of stairs, it gives me as much trouble  to draw every breath I want, as if it was a bucket of water.  If you saw me looking out of an upper window, you&#x27;d think I was a fine woman, wouldn&#x27;t you?&#x27; &#x27;I should think that, wherever I saw you,&#x27; replied Steerforth. &#x27;Go along, you dog, do!&#x27; cried the  little creature, making a whisk at him  with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face, &#x27;and don&#x27;t be impudent! But I give you  my word and  honour I was  at Lady Mithers&#x27;s  last week -  THERE&#x27;S a woman!  How  SHE wears!  - and  Mithers himself  came into  the room where I was waiting for her - THERE&#x27;S a man!  How HE wears! and his wig too, for he&#x27;s had it these ten years - and he went on at that rate in the complimentary line, that  I began  to think  I should  be obliged  to ring  the bell.  Ha! ha!  ha!  He&#x27;s  a pleasant wretch, but he wants principle.&#x27; &#x27;What were you doing for Lady Mithers?&#x27; asked Steerforth. &#x27;That&#x27;s tellings,  my blessed  infant,&#x27; she  retorted, tapping  her nose  again, screwing  up  her face,  and  twinkling her  eyes  like an  imp  of supernatural intelligence.  &#x27;Never YOU mind!  You&#x27;d like to know whether I stop her hair from falling off, or  dye it, or  touch up her  complexion, or improve  her eyebrows, wouldn&#x27;t you?  And so you shall, my darling - when I tell you!  Do you know what my great grandfather&#x27;s name was?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;It was Walker, my sweet pet,&#x27; replied Miss Mowcher, &#x27;and he came of a long line of Walkers, that I inherit all the Hookey estates from.&#x27; I never beheld anything approaching to Miss Mowcher&#x27;s wink except Miss Mowcher&#x27;s self-possession.  She had a wonderful way  too, when listening to what was  said to her, or when waiting for an  answer to what she had said herself,  of pausing with her  head cunningly  on one  side, and  one eye  turned up like a magpie&#x27;s. Altogether I was lost in amazement,  and sat staring at her, quite  oblivious, I am afraid, of the laws of politeness. She had by  this time drawn  the chair to  her side, and  was busily engaged  in producing from  the bag  (plunging in  her short  arm to  the shoulder, at every dive)  a number  of small  bottles, sponges,  combs, brushes,  bits of  flannel, little pairs  of curling-irons,  and other  instruments, which  she tumbled in a heap upon the chair.   From this employment she  suddenly desisted, and said  to Steerforth, much to my confusion: &#x27;Who&#x27;s your friend?&#x27; &#x27;Mr. Copperfield,&#x27; said Steerforth; &#x27;he wants to know you.&#x27; &#x27;Well,  then, he  shall!  I  thought he  looked as  if he  did!&#x27; returned   Miss Mowcher, waddling up to me, bag in hand, and laughing on me as she came.   &#x27;Face like a peach!&#x27; standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as I sat.  &#x27;Quite  tempting! I&#x27;m very fond of peaches.  Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Copperfield, I&#x27;m sure.&#x27; I said that I congratulated myself on  having the honour to make hers, and  that the happiness was mutual. &#x27;Oh,  my  goodness,  how  polite  we  are!&#x27;  exclaimed  Miss  Mowcher,  making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand.  &#x27;What a world of gammon and spinnage it is, though, ain&#x27;t it!&#x27; This was addressed confidentially  to both of us,  as the morsel of  a hand came away from the face, and buried itself, arm and all, in the bag again. &#x27;What do you mean, Miss Mowcher?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Ha! ha! ha!  What a refreshing set of humbugs we are, to be sure, ain&#x27;t we,  my sweet child?&#x27; replied that morsel of a  woman, feeling in the bag with her  head on one side and her eye in the air.  &#x27;Look here!&#x27; taking something out.  &#x27;Scraps of the Russian Prince&#x27;s nails.  Prince Alphabet turned topsy-turvy, I call  him, for his name&#x27;s got all the letters in it, higgledy-piggledy.&#x27; &#x27;The Russian Prince is a client of yours, is he?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;I believe you, my pet,&#x27; replied Miss  Mowcher.  &#x27;I keep his nails in order  for him.  Twice a week!  Fingers and toes.&#x27; &#x27;He pays well, I hope?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Pays, as he speaks,  my dear child -  through the nose,&#x27; replied  Miss Mowcher. &#x27;None of  your close  shavers the  Prince ain&#x27;t.   You&#x27;d say  so, if you saw his moustachios.  Red by nature, black by art.&#x27; &#x27;By your art, of course,&#x27; said Steerforth. Miss Mowcher winked  assent.  &#x27;Forced to  send for me.   Couldn&#x27;t help it.   The climate affected his dye; it did very well in Russia, but it was no go here. You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born days as he was.  Like old  iron!&#x27; &#x27;Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?&#x27; inquired Steerforth. &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;re a  broth of a  boy, ain&#x27;t you?&#x27;  returned Miss Mowcher,  shaking her head violently.  &#x27;I said, what a set of humbugs we were in general, and I showed you the scraps of  the Prince&#x27;s nails to  prove it.  The Prince&#x27;s  nails do more for  me  in private  families  of the  genteel  sort, than  all  my talents  put together.  I always  carry &#x27;em about.   They&#x27;re the best  introduction.  If Miss Mowcher cuts the Prince&#x27;s nails, she must be all right.  I give &#x27;em away to  the young ladies.  They put  &#x27;em in albums, I  believe.  Ha!  ha! ha!  Upon my life, &quot;the  whole social  system&quot; (as  the men  call it  when they  make speeches   in Parliament) is a system of Prince&#x27;s nails!&#x27; said this least of women, trying  to fold her short arms, and nodding her large head. Steerforth laughed heartily, and I laughed too.  Miss Mowcher continuing all the time to shake her head (which was very  much on one side), and to look into  the air with one eye, and to wink with the other. &#x27;Well,  well!&#x27; she  said, smiting  her small  knees, and  rising, &#x27;this  is  not business.  Come, Steerforth, let&#x27;s explore the polar regions, and have it over.&#x27; She then selected two or three  of the little instruments, and a  little bottle, and asked (to my surprise) if the table would bear. On Steerforth&#x27;s replying  in the affirmative, she pushed a chair against it, and begging the assistance of my hand, mounted up, pretty nimbly, to the top, as if it were a stage. &#x27;If either of you saw my ankles,&#x27;  she said, when she was safely elevated,  &#x27;say so, and I&#x27;ll go home and destroy myself!&#x27; &#x27;I did not,&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;I did not,&#x27; said I. &#x27;Well then,&#x27;  cried Miss  Mowcher,&#x27; I&#x27;ll  consent to  live.  Now,  ducky, ducky, ducky, come to Mrs. Bond and be killed.&#x27; This was  an invocation  to Steerforth  to place  himself under  her hands; who, accordingly, sat himself down, with his back to the table, and his laughing face towards me, and  submitted his head  to her inspection,  evidently for no  other purpose than our entertainment.  To see Miss Mowcher standing over him,  looking at his  rich profusion  of brown  hair through  a large  round magnifying glass, which she took out of her pocket, was a most amazing spectacle. &#x27;You&#x27;re a pretty fellow!&#x27; said  Miss Mowcher, after a brief  inspection.  &#x27;You&#x27;d be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months, but for me. just half a minute, my young friend, and  we&#x27;ll give you a polishing that shall  keep your curls on for the next ten years!&#x27; With this, she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one of the little  bits  of flannel,  and,  again imparting  some  of the  virtues  of that preparation to one of the little  brushes, began rubbing and scraping away  with both on the crown of Steerforth&#x27;s  head in the busiest manner I  ever witnessed, talking all the time. &#x27;There&#x27;s  Charley Pyegrave,  the duke&#x27;s  son,&#x27; she  said.  &#x27;You  know  Charley?&#x27; peeping round into his face. &#x27;A little,&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;What a man HE is!  THERE&#x27;S a whisker!  As to Charley&#x27;s legs, if they were  only a pair (which they ain&#x27;t), they&#x27;d  defy competition. Would you believe he  tried to do without me - in the Life-Guards, too?&#x27; &#x27;Mad!&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;It looks  like it.   However, mad  or sane,  he tried,&#x27;  returned Miss Mowcher. &#x27;What does he do, but,  lo and behold you, he  goes into a perfumer&#x27;s shop,  and wants to buy a bottle of the Madagascar Liquid.&#x27; &#x27;Charley does?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Charley does.  But they haven&#x27;t got any of the Madagascar Liquid.&#x27; &#x27;What is it?  Something to drink?&#x27; asked Steerforth. &#x27;To drink?&#x27; returned Miss Mowcher, stopping  to slap his cheek.  &#x27;To doctor  his own moustachios with, you know.  There was a woman in the shop - elderly  female - quite a Griffin -  who had never even heard  of it by name.  &quot;Begging  pardon, sir,&quot; said the Griffin to Charley, &quot;it&#x27;s not - not - not ROUGE, is it?&quot; &quot;Rouge,&quot; said Charley to  the Griffin.  &quot;What  the unmentionable to  ears polite, do  you think I  want with  rouge?&quot;  &quot;No  offence, sir,&quot;  said the  Griffin; &quot;we have it asked  for by  so many  names, I  thought it  might be.&quot;  Now that,  my  child,&#x27; continued Miss  Mowcher, rubbing  all the  time as  busily as  ever, &#x27;is another instance of the refreshing humbug I was speaking of.  I do something in that way myself - perhaps a good deal - perhaps a little - sharp&#x27;s the word, my dear  boy - never mind!&#x27; &#x27;In what way do you mean?  In the rouge way?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Put  this and  that together,  my tender  pupil,&#x27; returned  the wary   Mowcher, touching her  nose, &#x27;work  it by  the rule  of Secrets  in all  trades, and  the product will  give you  the desired  result.  I  say I  do a  little in that way myself.  One  Dowager, SHE  calls it  lip-salve.  Another,  SHE calls it gloves. Another, SHE calls it  tucker-edging.  Another, SHE calls  it a fan.  I  call it whatever THEY call it.  I supply it for &#x27;em, but we keep up the trick so, to one another, and make believe with such a face, that they&#x27;d as soon think of  laying it on,  before a  whole drawing-room,  as before  me. And  when I wait upon &#x27;em, they&#x27;ll say to me  sometimes - WITH IT  ON - thick, and  no mistake - &quot;How  am I looking, Mowcher?  Am I pale?&quot; Ha! ha! ha! ha!  Isn&#x27;t THAT refreshing, my  young friend!&#x27; I never did in my days behold anything like Mowcher as she stood upon the dining table, intensely enjoying this refreshment, rubbing busily at Steerforth&#x27;s head, and winking at me over it. &#x27;Ah!&#x27; she said.  &#x27;Such  things are not much  in demand hereabouts. That  sets me off again!  I haven&#x27;t seen a pretty woman since I&#x27;ve been here, jemmy.&#x27; &#x27;No?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Not the ghost of one,&#x27; replied Miss Mowcher. &#x27;We could show her the substance  of one, I think?&#x27; said Steerforth,  addressing his eyes to mine.  &#x27;Eh, Daisy?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, indeed,&#x27; said I. &#x27;Aha?&#x27; cried the little creature, glancing sharply at my face, and then  peeping round at Steerforth&#x27;s.  &#x27;Umph?&#x27; The first exclamation sounded like a question put to both of us, and the  second like a question put to Steerforth only.   She seemed to have found no answer  to either, but continued to rub, with her  head on one side and her eye  turned up, as if  she were  looking for  an answer  in the  air and  were confident  of its appearing presently. &#x27;A  sister of  yours, Mr.  Copperfield?&#x27; she  cried, after  a pause,  and  still keeping the same look-out.  &#x27;Aye, aye?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; said  Steerforth, before  I could  reply.  &#x27;Nothing  of the  sort. On  the contrary,  Mr. Copperfield  used -  or I  am much  mistaken -  to have  a  great admiration for her.&#x27; &#x27;Why, hasn&#x27;t he now?&#x27; returned Miss Mowcher.  &#x27;Is he fickle?  Oh, for shame! Did he sip every flower, and change  every  hour, until Polly his passion  requited? Is her name Polly?&#x27; The Elfin suddenness with  which she pounced upon  me with this question,  and a searching look, quite disconcerted me for a moment. &#x27;No, Miss Mowcher,&#x27; I replied.  &#x27;Her name is Emily.&#x27; &#x27;Aha?&#x27;  she  cried  exactly  as  before.   &#x27;Umph?   What  a  rattle  I  am!  Mr. Copperfield, ain&#x27;t I volatile?&#x27; Her tone and look  implied something that was  not agreeable to me  in connexion with the subject.  So I said, in a graver manner than any of us had yet assumed: &#x27;She is as virtuous as  she is pretty.  She is  engaged to be married to  a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life.  I esteem her for her  good sense, as much as I admire her for her good looks.&#x27; &#x27;Well  said!&#x27;  cried  Steerforth.   &#x27;Hear,  hear,  hear!   Now  I&#x27;ll  quench the curiosity of this little Fatima, my dear Daisy, by leaving her nothing to  guess at.  She is at  present apprenticed, Miss Mowcher,  or articled, or whatever  it may be, to Omer and Joram, Haberdashers, Milliners, and so forth, in this  town. Do you observe?  Omer and Joram.  The promise of which my friend has spoken,  is made and entered into with  her cousin; Christian name, Ham;  surname, Peggotty; occupation,  boat-builder;  also  of  this town.   She  lives  with  a relative; Christian name, unknown; surname, Peggotty; occupation, seafaring; also of  this town.  She  is the  prettiest and  most engaging  little fairy  in the world.  I admire her  - as  my friend  does -  exceedingly.  If  it were  not that I might appear to disparage her Intended, which I know my friend would not like, I would add, that to me she seems to be throwing herself away; that I am sure she  might do better; and that I swear she was born to be a lady.&#x27; Miss Mowcher  listened to  these words,  which were  very slowly  and distinctly spoken, with her head on one side, and  her eye in the air as if she  were still looking for that answer.  When he  ceased she became brisk again in  an instant, and rattled away with surprising volubility. &#x27;Oh!  And that&#x27;s all about it, is it?&#x27; she exclaimed, trimming his whiskers with a little restless  pair of scissors,  that went glancing  round his head  in all directions.  &#x27;Very well: very well! Quite a long story.  Ought to end &quot;and  they lived happy ever afterwards&quot;; oughtn&#x27;t it?  Ah!  What&#x27;s that game at forfeits? I love my love with an  E, because she&#x27;s enticing; I  hate her with an E,  because she&#x27;s engaged.  I took her to the sign of the exquisite, and treated her with an elopement,  her name&#x27;s  Emily, and  she lives  in the  east?  Ha!  ha! ha!   Mr. Copperfield, ain&#x27;t I volatile?&#x27; Merely looking at me  with extravagant slyness, and  not waiting for any  reply, she continued, without drawing breath: &#x27;There!  If ever any  scapegrace was trimmed and  touched up to perfection,  you are, Steerforth.  If I understand any  noddle in the world, I understand  yours. Do you hear me when I tell  you that, my darling?  I understand yours,&#x27;  peeping down into his face.  &#x27;Now you may mizzle, jemmy (as we say at Court), and if Mr. Copperfield will take the chair I&#x27;ll operate on him.&#x27; &#x27;What do you say, Daisy?&#x27; inquired Steerforth, laughing, and resigning his seat. &#x27;Will you be improved?&#x27; &#x27;Thank you, Miss Mowcher, not this evening.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t say no,&#x27; returned  the little woman, looking  at me with the  aspect of a connoisseur; &#x27;a little bit more eyebrow?&#x27; &#x27;Thank you,&#x27; I returned, &#x27;some other time.&#x27; &#x27;Have  it carried  half a  quarter of  an inch  towards the  temple,&#x27; said  Miss Mowcher.  &#x27;We can do it in a fortnight.&#x27; &#x27;No, I thank you.  Not at present.&#x27; &#x27;Go in for a tip,&#x27; she urged.   &#x27;No?  Let&#x27;s get the scaffolding up, then,  for a pair of whiskers.  Come!&#x27; I could not help blushing  as I declined, for I  felt we were on my  weak point, now.  But  Miss Mowcher,  finding that  I was  not at  present disposed  for any decoration within  the range  of her  art, and  that I  was, for the time being, proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which she held up before one eye to enforce her persuasions, said we would make a beginning on an early  day, and requested  the aid  of my  hand to  descend from  her elevated station. Thus assisted, she skipped down with much  agility, and began to tie her  double chin into her bonnet. &#x27;The fee,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;is -&#x27; &#x27;Five bob,&#x27; replied Miss Mowcher, &#x27;and dirt cheap, my chicken. Ain&#x27;t I volatile, Mr. Copperfield?&#x27; I replied politely:  &#x27;Not at all.&#x27;   But I thought  she was rather  so, when she tossed up his two half-crowns like a goblin pieman, caught them, dropped them in her pocket, and gave it a loud slap. &#x27;That&#x27;s  the Till!&#x27;  observed Miss  Mowcher, standing  at the  chair again,  and replacing  in the  bag a  miscellaneous collection  of little  objects she   had emptied out of it.  &#x27;Have I got all  my traps?  It seems so.  It won&#x27;t do  to be like long Ned Beadwood, when they took him to church &quot;to marry him to somebody&quot;, as he says, and left the bride  behind.  Ha! ha! ha!  A wicked rascal,  Ned, but droll!  Now, I  know I&#x27;m going  to break your  hearts, but I  am forced to leave you.  You must call  up all your fortitude,  and try to bear  it.  Good-bye, Mr. Copperfield!   Take  care of  yourself,  jockey of  Norfolk!   How I  have  been rattling on!   It&#x27;s all  the fault  of you  two wretches.   I forgive you!  &quot;Bob swore!&quot; - as the Englishman said for &quot;Good night&quot;, when he first learnt  French, and thought it so like English.  &quot;Bob swore,&quot; my ducks!&#x27; With the bag slung over her arm,  and rattling as she waddled away, she  waddled to the door, where she stopped to inquire  if she should leave us a lock of  her hair.  &#x27;Ain&#x27;t I volatile?&#x27; she added,  as a commentary on this offer,  and, with her finger on her nose, departed. Steerforth  laughed  to that  degree,  that it  was  impossible for  me  to help laughing  too;  though I  am  not sure  I  should have  done  so, but  for  this inducement.  When we had had our laugh quite out, which was after some time,  he told me that  Miss Mowcher had  quite an extensive  connexion, and made  herself useful to a variety  of people in a  variety of ways.  Some  people trifled with her as a mere oddity, he said; but she was as shrewdly and sharply observant  as anyone he knew, and as long-headed as she was short-armed.  He told me that what she had said of being here, and there, and everywhere, was true enough; for  she made  little  darts  into  the  provinces,  and  seemed  to  pick  up  customers everywhere,  and to  know everybody.   I asked  him what  her disposition   was: whether it was at all mischievous,  and if her sympathies were generally  on the right side of things: but, not  succeeding in attracting his attention to  these questions after two or three attempts,  I forbore or forgot to repeat  them.  He told  me instead,  with much  rapidity, a  good deal  about her  skill, and  her profits; and about her being a scientific cupper, if I should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity. She was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening: and when  we parted for the night Steerforth called after me over the banisters, &#x27;Bob swore!&#x27; as I went downstairs. I was surprised, when I came to  Mr. Barkis&#x27;s house, to find Ham walking  up and down in  front of  it, and  still more  surprised to  learn from him that little Em&#x27;ly was inside.   I naturally inquired  why he was  not there too,  instead of pacing the streets by himself? &#x27;Why, you see, Mas&#x27;r Davy,&#x27; he  rejoined, in a hesitating manner, &#x27;Em&#x27;ly,  she&#x27;s talking to some &#x27;un in here.&#x27; &#x27;I should have thought,&#x27; said I, smiling, &#x27;that that was a reason for your being in here too, Ham.&#x27; &#x27;Well, Mas&#x27;r Davy, in a general way, so &#x27;t would be,&#x27; he returned; &#x27;but  look&#x27;ee here, Mas&#x27;r Davy,&#x27; lowering his voice, and speaking very gravely.  &#x27;It&#x27;s a young woman, sir - a young woman, that Em&#x27;ly knowed once, and doen&#x27;t ought to know  no more.&#x27; When I  heard these  words, a  light began  to fall  upon the  figure I had seen following them, some hours ago. &#x27;It&#x27;s a poor  wurem, Mas&#x27;r Davy,&#x27;  said Ham, &#x27;as  is trod under  foot by all the town.  Up street and  down street.  The mowld  o&#x27; the churchyard don&#x27;t  hold any that the folk shrink away from, more.&#x27; &#x27;Did I see her tonight, Ham, on the sand, after we met you?&#x27; &#x27;Keeping us in  sight?&#x27; said Ham.   &#x27;It&#x27;s like you  did, Mas&#x27;r Davy.  Not that I know&#x27;d then, she was theer, sir, but along of her creeping soon arterwards under Em&#x27;ly&#x27;s  little winder,  when she  see the  light come,  and whispering  &quot;Em&#x27;ly, Em&#x27;ly, for  Christ&#x27;s sake,  have a  woman&#x27;s heart  towards me.   I was once like you!&quot; Those was solemn words, Mas&#x27;r Davy, fur to hear!&#x27; &#x27;They were indeed, Ham.   What did Em&#x27;ly do?&#x27;  &#x27;Says Em&#x27;ly, &quot;Martha, is  it you? Oh, Martha, can it be you?&quot; - for they had sat at work together, many a day,  at Mr. Omer&#x27;s.&#x27; &#x27;I recollect her now!&#x27; cried I, recalling one of the two girls I had seen when I first went there.  &#x27;I recollect her quite well!&#x27; &#x27;Martha Endell,&#x27; said Ham.  &#x27;Two or three year older than Em&#x27;ly, but was at  the school with her.&#x27; &#x27;I never heard her name,&#x27; said I.  &#x27;I didn&#x27;t mean to interrupt you.&#x27; &#x27;For the matter o&#x27;  that, Mas&#x27;r Davy,&#x27; replied  Ham, &#x27;all&#x27;s told a&#x27;most  in them words, &quot;Em&#x27;ly, Em&#x27;ly, for Christ&#x27;s sake, have a woman&#x27;s heart towards me.  I was once like  you!&quot; She  wanted to  speak to  Em&#x27;ly.  Em&#x27;ly  couldn&#x27;t speak  to her theer, for her loving  uncle was come home,  and he wouldn&#x27;t -  no, Mas&#x27;r Davy,&#x27; said Ham, with great earnestness, &#x27;he couldn&#x27;t, kind-natur&#x27;d, tender-hearted  as he is, see them two together, side by side, for all the treasures that&#x27;s wrecked in the sea.&#x27; I felt how true this was.  I knew it, on the instant, quite as well as Ham. &#x27;So Em&#x27;ly writes in pencil on a bit of paper,&#x27; he pursued, &#x27;and gives it to  her out o&#x27; winder to bring here.  &quot;Show  that,&quot; she says, &quot;to my aunt, Mrs.  Barkis, and she&#x27;ll set you down by her fire, for the love of me, till uncle is gone out, and I can come.&quot; By and by she tells me what I tell you, Mas&#x27;r Davy, and asks me to bring her.  What can  I do?  She doen&#x27;t ought  to know any such, but  I can&#x27;t deny her, when the tears is on her face.&#x27; He put his hand into  the breast of his shaggy  jacket, and took out with  great care a pretty little purse. &#x27;And if I could deny her when the tears was on her face, Mas&#x27;r Davy,&#x27; said  Ham, tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand, &#x27;how could I deny her  when she give me this to carry for her - knowing what she brought it for?  Such a toy as it is!&#x27; said Ham, thoughtfully looking  on it.  &#x27;With such a little money  in it, Em&#x27;ly my dear.&#x27; I shook him warmly by the hand when he had put it away again - for that was more satisfactory to  me than  saying anything  - and  we walked  up and  down, for a minute  or  two, in  silence.   The door  opened  then, and  Peggotty  appeared, beckoning to Ham  to come in.  I would have  kept away, but  she came after  me, entreating me to come  in too.  Even then,  I would have avoided  the room where they all were, but  for its being the  neat-tiled kitchen I have  mentioned more than once.   The door  opening immediately  into it,  I found  myself among them before I considered whither I was going. The girl  - the  same I  had seen  upon the  sands -  was near the fire. She was sitting on the ground, with her head  and one arm lying on a chair.   I fancied, from the  disposition of  her figure,  that Em&#x27;ly  had but  newly risen from the chair, and that the  forlorn head might perhaps  have been lying on  her lap.  I saw but little of the girl&#x27;s face, over which her hair fell loose and scattered, as if she had  been disordering it with  her own hands; but  I saw that she  was young, and  of a  fair complexion.   Peggotty had  been crying.   So had  little Em&#x27;ly.  Not a word was spoken when we first went in; and the Dutch clock by  the dresser seemed, in  the silence, to  tick twice as  loud as usual.   Em&#x27;ly spoke first. &#x27;Martha wants,&#x27; she said to Ham, &#x27;to go to London.&#x27; &#x27;Why to London?&#x27; returned Ham. He  stood  between  them,  looking  on the  prostrate  girl  with  a  mixture of compassion for her, and  of jealousy of her  holding any companionship with  her whom he loved  so well, which  I have always  remembered distinctly.  They  both spoke as if  she were ill;  in a soft,  suppressed tone that  was plainly heard, although it hardly rose above a whisper. &#x27;Better there than here,&#x27;  said a third voice  aloud - Martha&#x27;s, though  she did not move.  &#x27;No one knows me there.  Everybody knows me here.&#x27; &#x27;What will she do there?&#x27; inquired Ham. She lifted up her head, and looked  darkly round at him for a moment;  then laid it down again, and curved her right arm  about her neck, as a woman in a  fever, or in an agony of pain from a shot, might twist herself. &#x27;She will try to do well,&#x27; said little Em&#x27;ly.  &#x27;You don&#x27;t know what she has said to us.  Does he - do they - aunt?&#x27; Peggotty shook her head compassionately. &#x27;I&#x27;ll try,&#x27; said Martha, &#x27;if you&#x27;ll help  me away.  I never can do worse  than I have done here.  I may do better.  Oh!&#x27; with a dreadful shiver, &#x27;take me out  of these streets, where the whole town knows me from a child!&#x27; As Em&#x27;ly held out her hand to Ham, I saw him put in it a little canvas bag.  She took it, as if she  thought it were her purse,  and made a step or  two forward; but finding her mistake, came back to  where he had retired near me, and  showed it to him. &#x27;It&#x27;s all  yourn, Em&#x27;ly,&#x27;  I could  hear him  say.  &#x27;I  haven&#x27;t nowt  in all the wureld that  ain&#x27;t yourn,  my dear.   It ain&#x27;t  of no  delight to me, except for you!&#x27; The tears rose freshly in her eyes, but she turned away and went to Martha. What she gave her, I don&#x27;t know.  I  saw her stooping over her, and putting  money in her bosom.  She whispered something, as  she asked was that enough?  &#x27;More  than enough,&#x27; the other said, and took her hand and kissed it. Then Martha arose, and gathering her shawl about her, covering her face with it, and weeping aloud, went slowly to  the door.  She stopped a moment  before going out, as if she would have uttered  something or turned back; but no word  passed her lips.  Making the same low, dreary, wretched moaning in her shawl, she  went away. As the door closed, little Em&#x27;ly looked at us three in a hurried manner and then hid her face in her hands, and fell to sobbing. &#x27;Doen&#x27;t, Em&#x27;ly!&#x27; said Ham, tapping her gently on the shoulder. &#x27;Doen&#x27;t, my dear! You doen&#x27;t ought to cry so, pretty!&#x27; &#x27;Oh, Ham!&#x27; she exclaimed, still weeping pitifully, &#x27;I am not so good a girl as I ought to be!  I know I have not the thankful heart, sometimes, I ought to have!&#x27; &#x27;Yes, yes, you have, I&#x27;m sure,&#x27; said Ham. &#x27;No! no! no!&#x27; cried  little Em&#x27;ly, sobbing, and  shaking her head. &#x27;I  am not as good a girl as I ought to be.   Not near! not near!&#x27; And still she cried,  as if her heart would break. &#x27;I try your love too much.  I know I do!&#x27; she sobbed.  &#x27;I&#x27;m often cross to  you, and changeable with you, when I ought to be far different.  You are never so  to me.  Why  am I  ever so  to you,  when I  should think  of nothing but how to be grateful, and to make you happy!&#x27; &#x27;You always make me so,&#x27; said Ham, &#x27;my dear!  I am happy in the sight of you.  I am happy, all day long, in the thoughts of you.&#x27; &#x27;Ah! that&#x27;s not enough!&#x27; she cried.  &#x27;That is because you are good; not  because I am!  Oh, my dear, it might have been a better fortune for you, if you had been fond of someone else  - of someone steadier  and much worthier than  me, who was all bound up in you, and never vain and changeable like me!&#x27; &#x27;Poor little tender-heart,&#x27; said Ham, in a low voice.  &#x27;Martha has overset  her, altogether.&#x27; &#x27;Please, aunt,&#x27; sobbed Em&#x27;ly, &#x27;come here, and let me lay my head upon you.   Oh, I am very miserable tonight,  aunt!  Oh, I am not  as good a girl as  I ought to be.  I am not, I know!&#x27; Peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire.  Em&#x27;ly, with her arms around her neck, kneeled by her, looking up most earnestly into her face. &#x27;Oh, pray, aunt, try to help me!  Ham, dear, try to help me!  Mr. David, for the sake of old times, do, please, try to help me!  I want to be a better girl  than I am.  I want to feel a hundred  times more thankful than I do.  I want  to feel more, what a blessed  thing it is to  be the wife of  a good man, and  to lead a peaceful life. Oh me, oh me!  Oh my heart, my heart!&#x27; She dropped her face on my  old nurse&#x27;s breast, and, ceasing this  supplication, which in its  agony and grief  was half a  woman&#x27;s, half a  child&#x27;s, as all  her manner was (being, in that, more natural, and better suited to her beauty, as  I thought, than any  other manner could  have been), wept  silently, while my  old nurse hushed her like an infant. She got calmer by degrees, and  then we soothed her; now talking  encouragingly, and now jesting a little with her,  until she began to raise her head  and speak to us.  So we got on, until she  was able to smile, and then to laugh,  and then to sit up, half ashamed; while  Peggotty recalled her stray ringlets, dried  her eyes, and made her neat again, lest her uncle should wonder, when she got  home, why his darling had been crying. I saw  her do,  that night,  what I  had never  seen her  do before.   I saw her innocently kiss her chosen  husband on the cheek,  and creep close to  his bluff form as  if it  were her  best support.   When they  went away  together, in the waning moonlight, and I looked after them, comparing their departure in my  mind with Martha&#x27;s, I saw that she held  his arm with both her hands, and  still kept close to him. CHAPTER 23 I CORROBORATE Mr. DICK, AND CHOOSE A PROFESSION When I awoke in the morning I thought very much of little Em&#x27;ly, and her emotion last night, after Martha had left.  I  felt as if I had come into  the knowledge of those domestic weaknesses and  tendernesses in a sacred confidence,  and that to disclose them, even to Steerforth, would be wrong.  I had no gentler  feeling towards anyone than towards  the pretty creature who  had been my playmate,  and whom I have always  been persuaded, and shall  always be persuaded, to  my dying day, I then devotedly loved.  The repetition to any ears - even to  Steerforth&#x27;s - of what she  had been unable to  repress when her heart  lay open to me  by an accident, I  felt would  be a  rough deed,  unworthy of  myself, unworthy of the light of our pure childhood, which I  always saw encircling her head.  I made  a resolution, therefore, to keep it in my own breast; and there it gave her  image a new grace. While we were at breakfast,  a letter was delivered to  me from my aunt.  As  it contained  matter on  which I  thought Steerforth  could advise  me as  well  as anyone, and on which I knew I should be delighted to consult him, I resolved  to make it a  subject of discussion  on our journey  home.  For the  present we had enough to do, in taking leave of all our friends.  Mr. Barkis was far from being the last among them,  in his regret at  our departure; and I  believe would even have opened the box again, and sacrificed another guinea, if it would have  kept us eight-and-forty hours in Yarmouth.  Peggotty and all her family were full  of grief at our  going.  The whole  house of Omer  and Joram turned  out to bid  us good-bye;  and  there  were  so  many  seafaring  volunteers  in  attendance  on Steerforth, when  our portmanteaux  went to  the coach,  that if  we had had the baggage of a regiment with us, we should hardly have wanted porters to carry it. In a word, we departed to the regret and admiration of all concerned, and left a great many people very sorry behind US. Do you stay long here, Littimer?&#x27; said  I, as he stood waiting to see  the coach start. &#x27;No, sir,&#x27; he replied; &#x27;probably not very long, sir.&#x27; &#x27;He can hardly say, just  now,&#x27; observed Steerforth, carelessly. &#x27;He  knows what he has to do, and he&#x27;ll do it.&#x27; &#x27;That I am sure he will,&#x27; said I. Littimer touched his hat in acknowledgement of my good opinion, and I felt about eight years old.   He touched it  once more, wishing  us a good  journey; and we left him standing on  the pavement, as respectable  a mystery as any  pyramid in Egypt. For some little time we held no conversation, Steerforth being unusually silent, and I being sufficiently engaged in wondering, within myself, when I should  see the old places  again, and what  new changes might  happen to me  or them in the meanwhile.  At length Steerforth, becoming gay and talkative in a moment, as  he could become anything he liked at any moment, pulled me by the arm: &#x27;Find  a  voice,  David.   What  about  that  letter  you  were  speaking  of at breakfast?&#x27; &#x27;Oh!&#x27; said I, taking it out of my pocket.  &#x27;It&#x27;s from my aunt.&#x27; &#x27;And what does she say, requiring consideration?&#x27; &#x27;Why, she reminds me, Steerforth,&#x27; said  I, &#x27;that I came out on  this expedition to look about me, and to think a little.&#x27; &#x27;Which, of course, you have done?&#x27; &#x27;Indeed I can&#x27;t say I have, particularly.  To tell you the truth, I am afraid  I have forgotten it.&#x27; &#x27;Well! look about you  now, and make up  for your negligence,&#x27; said  Steerforth. &#x27;Look to the right, and you&#x27;ll see a flat country, with a good deal of marsh  in it; look to the left,  and you&#x27;ll see the same.   Look to the front, and  you&#x27;ll find no difference;  look to the  rear, and there  it is still.&#x27;  I laughed, and replied that  I saw  no suitable  profession in  the whole  prospect; which  was perhaps to be attributed to its flatness. &#x27;What says our aunt on the subject?&#x27; inquired Steerforth, glancing at the letter in my hand.  &#x27;Does she suggest anything?&#x27; &#x27;Why, yes,&#x27;  said I.   &#x27;She asks  me, here,  if I  think I  should like  to be a proctor?  What do you think of it?&#x27; &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; replied Steerforth,  coolly.  &#x27;You may as well do  that as anything else, I suppose?&#x27; I could not help laughing again,  at his balancing all callings and  professions so equally; and I told him so. &#x27;What is a proctor, Steerforth?&#x27; said I. &#x27;Why, he is a  sort of monkish attorney,&#x27;  replied Steerforth.  &#x27;He is,  to some faded  courts held  in Doctors&#x27;  Commons, -  a lazy  old nook  near St.   Paul&#x27;s Churchyard -  what solicitors  are to  the courts  of law  and equity.   He is a functionary  whose  existence,  in  the natural  course  of  things,  would have terminated about  two hundred  years ago.   I can  tell you  best what he is, by telling you what Doctors&#x27; Commons is.  It&#x27;s a little out-of-the-way place, where they administer what is called ecclesiastical law, and play all kinds of  tricks with obsolete  old monsters  of acts  of Parliament,  which three-fourths of the world know nothing about, and the other fourth supposes to have been dug up,  in a fossil state, in the  days of the Edwards.  It&#x27;s  a place that has an  ancient monopoly in  suits about  people&#x27;s wills  and people&#x27;s  marriages, and  disputes among ships and boats.&#x27; &#x27;Nonsense, Steerforth!&#x27; I exclaimed.  &#x27;You don&#x27;t  mean to say that there is  any affinity between nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters?&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t, indeed, my dear  boy,&#x27; he returned; &#x27;but I  mean to say that they  are managed  and decided  by the  same set  of people,  down in  that same  Doctors&#x27; Commons.  You shall go there one day, and find them blundering through half  the nautical terms in Young&#x27;s Dictionary, apropos of the &quot;Nancy&quot; having run down the &quot;Sarah Jane&quot;, or Mr. Peggotty and the Yarmouth boatmen having put off in a  gale of wind with an anchor and cable  to the &quot;Nelson&quot; Indiaman in distress; and  you shall go there  another day, and  find them deep  in the evidence,  pro and con, respecting a clergyman who has misbehaved himself; and you shall find the  judge in the  nautical case,  the advocate  in the  clergyman&#x27;s case, or contrariwise. They are like actors: now a man&#x27;s a  judge, and now he is not a judge;  now he&#x27;s one thing, now he&#x27;s another; now  he&#x27;s something else, change and change  about; but  it&#x27;s  always  a  very   pleasant,  profitable  little  affair  of   private theatricals, presented to an uncommonly select audience.&#x27; &#x27;But advocates and proctors are not one and the same?&#x27; said I, a little puzzled. &#x27;Are they?&#x27; &#x27;No,&#x27; returned Steerforth, &#x27;the advocates are  civilians - men who have taken  a doctor&#x27;s degree at college  - which is the  first reason of my  knowing anything about it.  The proctors employ  the advocates.  Both get very  comfortable fees, and altogether  they make  a mighty  snug little  party.  On  the whole, I would recommend you  to take  to  Doctors&#x27;  Commons kindly,  David.  They   plume them selves on their gentility there, I can tell you, if that&#x27;s any satisfaction.&#x27; I  made allowance  for Steerforth&#x27;s  light way  of treating  the subject,   and, considering it with reference to the staid air of gravity and antiquity which  I associated with that &#x27;lazy  old nook near St.  Paul&#x27;s Churchyard&#x27;, did not  feel indisposed towards  my aunt&#x27;s  suggestion; which  she left  to my free decision, making no  scruple of  telling me  that it  had occurred  to her,  on her lately visiting her own  proctor in Doctors&#x27;  Commons for the  purpose of settling  her will in my favour. &#x27;That&#x27;s a  laudable proceeding  on the  part of  our aunt,  at all events,&#x27; said Steerforth, when I mentioned it; &#x27;and one deserving of all encouragement. Daisy, my advice is that you take kindly to Doctors&#x27; Commons.&#x27; I quite made up my  mind to do so.  I  then told Steerforth that my  aunt was in town awaiting me (as I found from  her letter), and that she had taken  lodgings for a week at a kind of private hotel at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, where there was a stone  staircase,  and a  convenient  door in  the  roof; my  aunt  being firmly persuaded that every house in London was going to be burnt down every night. We achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring to  Doctors&#x27; Commons, and anticipating  the distant days  when I should  be a proctor  there, which Steerforth pictured  in a variety  of humorous and  whimsical lights, that made us both merry.  When we came  to our journey&#x27;s end, he went home,  engaging to call upon me next day but one;  and I drove to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, where  I found my aunt up, and waiting supper. If I had been round the world since we parted, we could hardly have been  better pleased to meet  again.  My aunt  cried outright as  she embraced me;  and said, pretending to laugh, that  if my poor mother  had been alive, that  silly little creature would have shed tears, she had no doubt. &#x27;So you have left Mr.  Dick behind, aunt?&#x27; said I.   &#x27;I am sorry for that.   Ah, Janet, how do you do?&#x27; As Janet curtsied, hoping I was well, I observed my aunt&#x27;s visage lengthen  very much. &#x27;I am sorry for it, too,&#x27; said my aunt, rubbing her nose.  &#x27;I have had no  peace of mind, Trot, since I have been here.&#x27; Before I could ask why, she told me. &#x27;I am convinced,&#x27; said my aunt, laying her hand with melancholy firmness on  the table, &#x27;that Dick&#x27;s character is not a character to keep the donkeys off.  I  am confident he  wants strength  of purpose.  I ought  to have  left Janet at home, instead, and then my mind might perhaps have been at ease.  If ever there was  a donkey trespassing on  my green,&#x27; said  my aunt, with  emphasis, &#x27;there was  one this afternoon at four o&#x27;clock.  A cold feeling came over me from head to  foot, and I know it was a donkey!&#x27; I tried to comfort her on this point, but she rejected consolation. &#x27;It was a donkey,&#x27; said my aunt; &#x27;and it was the one with the stumpy tail  which that Murdering sister  of a woman  rode, when she  came to my  house.&#x27;  This had been, ever since, the only name my  aunt knew for Miss Murdstone.  &#x27;If there  is any Donkey in Dover, whose audacity it  is harder to me to bear than  another&#x27;s, that,&#x27; said my aunt, striking the table, &#x27;is the animal!&#x27; Janet  ventured   to  suggest   that  my   aunt  might   be  disturbing  herself unnecessarily, and that she believed the donkey in question was then engaged  in the sand-and-gravel  line of  business, and  was not  available for  purposes of trespass.  But my aunt wouldn&#x27;t hear of it. Supper was comfortably served and hot, though my aunt&#x27;s rooms were very high  up - whether  that she  might have  more stone  stairs for  her money,  or might be nearer to the door in the roof, I don&#x27;t know - and consisted of a roast fowl,  a steak, and some vegetables, to all of which I did ample justice, and which  were all excellent. But my  aunt had her own  ideas concerning London provision,  and ate but little. &#x27;I suppose this unfortunate fowl was born  and brought up in a cellar,&#x27; said  my aunt, &#x27;and never took the air except on a hackney coach-stand.  I hope the steak may be  beef, but  I don&#x27;t  believe it.  Nothing&#x27;s genuine  in the  place, in my opinion, but the dirt.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t you think the fowl may have come out of the country, aunt?&#x27; I hinted. &#x27;Certainly  not,&#x27;  returned my  aunt.   &#x27;It would  be  no pleasure  to  a London tradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended it was.&#x27; I did not venture to controvert this opinion, but I made a good supper, which it greatly satisfied her to see me do.  When the table was cleared, Janet  assisted her  to arrange  her hair,  to put   on her  nightcap, which  was of  a  smarter construction than usual (&#x27;in case of fire&#x27;, my aunt said), and to fold her  gown back over  her knees,  these being  her usual  preparations for  warming herself before  going  to  bed.   I then  made  her,  according  to certain  established regulations from which no deviation, however slight, could ever be permitted,  a glass of hot  wine and water,  and a slice  of toast cut  into long thin strips. With these  accompaniments we  were left  alone to  finish the  evening, my aunt sitting opposite to me drinking her wine and water; soaking her strips of  toast in it, one by one, before eating them; and looking benignantly on me, from among the borders of her nightcap. &#x27;Well, Trot,&#x27; she began, &#x27;what do you think of the proctor plan? Or have you not begun to think about it yet?&#x27; &#x27;I have thought a  good deal about it,  my dear aunt, and  I have talked a  good deal  about  it  with Steerforth.   I  like  it very  much  indeed.   I like  it exceedingly.&#x27; &#x27;Come!&#x27; said my aunt.  &#x27;That&#x27;s cheering!&#x27; &#x27;I have only one difficulty, aunt.&#x27; &#x27;Say what it is, Trot,&#x27; she returned. &#x27;Why, I  want to  ask, aunt,  as this  seems, from  what I  understand, to  be a limited profession, whether my entrance into it would not be very expensive?&#x27; &#x27;It will cost,&#x27; returned my aunt, &#x27;to article you, just a thousand pounds.&#x27; &#x27;Now, my dear aunt,&#x27; said  I, drawing my chair nearer,  &#x27;I am uneasy in my  mind about that.  It&#x27;s a large  sum of money.  You have  expended a great deal on  my education,  and have  always been  as liberal  to me  in all  things as  it  was possible to be.  You  have been the soul  of generosity.  Surely there  are some ways in which I might  begin life with hardly any  outlay, and yet begin with  a good hope of getting on by resolution and exertion.  Are you sure that it  would not be better to try that course?   Are you certain that you can afford  to part with so much money, and that it is right that it should be so expended?  I  only ask you, my second mother, to consider.  Are you certain?&#x27; My  aunt finished  eating the  piece of  toast on  which she  was then  engaged, looking me full  in the face  all the while;  and then setting  her glass on the chimney-piece, and folding her hands upon her folded skirts, replied as follows: &#x27;Trot, my child, if I have any object in life, it is to provide for your being a good, a sensible, and a  happy man.  I am bent  upon it - so is  Dick.  I should like some people that  I know to hear  Dick&#x27;s conversation on the  subject.  Its sagacity is wonderful.  But no one knows the resources of that man&#x27;s  intellect, except myself!&#x27; She stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers, and went on: &#x27;It&#x27;s in vain, Trot, to recall the past, unless it works some influence upon the present.   Perhaps I  might have  been better  friends with  your poor   father. Perhaps I might have been better friends with that poor child your mother,  even after your  sister Betsey  Trotwood disappointed  me.  When  you came  to me,  a little runaway boy,  all dusty and  way-worn, perhaps I  thought so.  From  that time until  now, Trot,  you have  ever been  a credit  to me  and a  pride and a pleasure.  I have no other claim upon my means; at least&#x27; - here to my  surprise she hesitated, and was confused - &#x27;no, I have no other claim upon my means - and you are my adopted child. Only be a loving child to me in my age, and bear  with my whims and fancies; and you will do more for an old woman whose prime of  life was not so happy or conciliating as it might have been, than ever that old woman did for you.&#x27; It was the first time I had heard my aunt refer to her past history.  There  was a magnanimity in her  quiet way of doing  so, and of dismissing  it, which would have exalted her in my respect and affection, if anything could. &#x27;All is agreed and understood between us, now, Trot,&#x27; said my aunt, &#x27;and we need talk  of this  no more.   Give me  a kiss,  and we&#x27;ll  go to  the Commons  after breakfast tomorrow.&#x27; We had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed.  I slept in a room on  the same floor with my aunt&#x27;s, and was a little disturbed in the course of the night by her knocking at my  door as often as she  was agitated by a distant  sound of hackney-coaches or market-carts, and inquiring,  &#x27;if I heard the engines?&#x27;   But towards morning she slept better, and suffered me to do so too. At about mid-day, we  set out for the  office of Messrs Spenlow  and Jorkins, in Doctors&#x27; Commons.  My aunt, who had  this other general opinion in reference  to London, that every man she saw was a pickpocket, gave me her purse to carry  for her, which had ten guineas in it and some silver. We made a  pause at the  toy shop in  Fleet Street, to  see the giants  of Saint Dunstan&#x27;s strike upon the bells - we had timed our going, so as to catch them at it, at twelve o&#x27;clock  - and then went  on towards Ludgate Hill,  and St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard.  We were  crossing to the  former place, when  I found that  my aunt greatly accelerated her speed, and  looked frightened.  I observed, at  the same time,  that a  lowering ill-dressed  man who  had stopped  and stared  at us  in passing, a little before, was coming so close after us as to brush against her. &#x27;Trot!  My dear Trot!&#x27;  cried my aunt, in  a terrified whisper, and  pressing my arm.  &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what I am to do.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t be alarmed,&#x27; said I.  &#x27;There&#x27;s nothing to be afraid of. Step into a shop, and I&#x27;ll soon get rid of this fellow.&#x27; &#x27;No, no, child!&#x27; she returned.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t speak to him for the world. I entreat,  I order you!&#x27; &#x27;Good Heaven, aunt!&#x27; said I.  &#x27;He is nothing but a sturdy beggar.&#x27; &#x27;You don&#x27;t know what he is!&#x27; replied  my aunt.  &#x27;You don&#x27;t know who he  is!  You don&#x27;t know what you say!&#x27; We had stopped in an empty door-way, while this was passing, and he had  stopped too. &#x27;Don&#x27;t look at him!&#x27; said my aunt, as I turned my head indignantly, &#x27;but get  me a coach, my dear, and wait for me in St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard.&#x27; &#x27;Wait for you?&#x27; I replied. &#x27;Yes,&#x27; rejoined my aunt.  &#x27;I must go alone.  I must go with him.&#x27; &#x27;With him, aunt?  This man?&#x27; &#x27;I am in my senses,&#x27; she replied, &#x27;and I tell you I must.  Get mea coach!&#x27; However much astonished I might be, I was sensible that I had no right to refuse compliance with  such a  peremptory command.   I hurried  away a  few paces, and called a  hackney-chariot which  was passing  empty.  Almost  before I could let down the steps, my aunt sprang in, I don&#x27;t know how, and the man followed.   She waved her hand to me to go away, so earnestly, that, all confounded as I was,  I turned from them at once.  In doing so, I heard her say to the coachman,  &#x27;Drive anywhere!  Drive straight on!&#x27; and presently the chariot passed me, going up the hill. What Mr. Dick had told me, and what I had supposed to be a delusion of his,  now came into my mind.  I could not doubt that this person was the person of whom he had made such  mysterious mention, though  what the nature  of his hold  upon my aunt could possibly  be, I was  quite unable to  imagine.  After half  an hour&#x27;s cooling in the churchyard,  I saw the chariot  coming back.  The driver  stopped beside me, and my aunt was sitting in it alone. She had not yet sufficiently recovered  from her agitation to be quite  prepared for the visit we had  to make.  She desired me  to get into the chariot,  and to tell the coachman to drive slowly up and down a little while.  She said no more, except, &#x27;My dear child, never ask me what it was, and don&#x27;t refer to it,&#x27;  until she had perfectly regained her composure, when she told me she was quite herself now, and we  might get out.   On her giving  me her purse  to pay the  driver, I found that all the guineas were gone, and only the loose silver remained. Doctors&#x27; Commons was approached  by a little low  archway.  Before we had  taken many paces down the street beyond it,  the noise of the city seemed to  melt, as if  by magic,  into a  softened distance.   A few  dull courts  and narrow  ways brought us to the sky-lighted offices  of Spenlow and Jorkins; in the  vestibule of which temple, accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking,  three or four  clerks were  at work  as copyists.   One of  these, a  little dry  man, sitting by himself, who wore a stiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread, rose to receive my aunt, and show us into Mr. Spenlow&#x27;s room. &#x27;Mr. Spenlow&#x27;s in Court, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said the dry man; &#x27;it&#x27;s an Arches day; but it&#x27;s close by, and I&#x27;ll send for him directly.&#x27; As we were left to look about us while Mr. Spenlow was fetched, I availed myself of the opportunity.  The furniture of the room was old-fashioned and dusty;  and the green baize on the top of the writing-table had lost all its colour, and was as withered  and pale  as an  old pauper.   There were  a great  many bundles of papers on it, some endorsed as Allegations, and some (to my surprise) as Libels, and some as  being in the  Consistory Court, and  some in the  Arches Court, and some in the Prerogative Court, and some in the Admiralty Court, and some in  the Delegates&#x27; Court; giving me occasion to wonder much, how many Courts there might be in the  gross, and how  long it would  take to understand  them all.  Besides these,  there  were  sundry  immense  manuscript  Books  of  Evidence  taken  on affidavit, strongly  bound, and  tied together  in massive  sets, a  set to each cause, as  if every  cause were  a history  in ten  or twenty volumes.  All this looked tolerably  expensive, I  thought, and  gave me  an agreeable  notion of a proctor&#x27;s business.   I was  casting my  eyes with  increasing complacency  over these and  many similar  objects, when  hasty footsteps  were heard  in the room outside, and Mr. Spenlow, in a black gown trimmed with white fur, came  hurrying in, taking off his hat as he came. He was a little light-haired gentleman, with undeniable boots, and the  stiffest of white cravats and shirt-collars.  He was buttoned up, mighty trim and  tight, and  must  have taken  a  great deal  of  pains with  his  whiskers, which  were accurately  curled.  His  gold watch-chain  was so  massive, that  a fancy  came across me, that he ought to have a sinewy golden arm, to draw it out with,  like those which are  put up over  the goldbeaters&#x27; shops.   He was got  up with such care, and was so stiff, that  he could hardly bend himself; being  obliged, when he glanced at some papers on his desk, after sitting down in his chair, to  move his whole body, from the bottom of his spine, like Punch. I had previously been presented by  my aunt, and had been courteously  received. He now said: &#x27;And so, Mr. Copperfield, you think of entering into our profession?  I casually mentioned to Miss Trotwood, when I had the pleasure of an interview with her the other day,&#x27; - with another inclination of  his body - Punch again - &#x27;that  there was a vacancy  here.  Miss Trotwood  was good enough  to mention that  she had a nephew  who was  her peculiar  care, and  for whom  she was  seeking to  provide genteelly in life.  That nephew, I believe, I have now the pleasure of&#x27; -  Punch again. I bowed my acknowledgements, and  said, my aunt had mentioned to  me that there was that opening, and that I believed I should like it very much.  That  I was strongly inclined  to like it,  and had taken  immediately to the  proposal. That I could  not absolutely pledge  myself to like  it, until I  knew something more about  it.  That  although it  was little  else than  a matter  of form,  I presumed I should have an opportunity of  trying how I liked it, before I  bound myself to it irrevocably. &#x27;Oh surely! surely!&#x27;  said Mr. Spenlow.   &#x27;We always, in  this house, propose  a month - an initiatory month.  I  should be happy, myself, to propose  two months three - an indefinite period, in fact - but I have a partner.  Mr. Jorkins.&#x27; &#x27;And the premium, sir,&#x27; I returned, &#x27;is a thousand pounds?&#x27; &#x27;And the premium, Stamp included, is a thousand pounds,&#x27; said Mr. Spenlow.   &#x27;As I have mentioned to Miss Trotwood, I am actuated by no mercenary considerations; few men  are less  so, I  believe; but  Mr. Jorkins  has his  opinions on  these subjects, and I am bound to respect Mr. Jorkins&#x27;s opinions.  Mr. Jorkins  thinks a thousand pounds too little, in short.&#x27; &#x27;I suppose, sir,&#x27; said I, still desiring  to spare my aunt, &#x27;that it is  not the custom here, if an articled clerk  were particularly useful, and made himself  a perfect master of his  profession&#x27; - I could  not help blushing, this  looked so like praising myself - &#x27;I  suppose it is not the  custom, in the later years  of his time, to allow him any -&#x27; Mr. Spenlow,  by a  great effort,  just lifted  his head  far enough  out of his cravat to shake it, and answered, anticipating the word &#x27;salary&#x27;: &#x27;No.  I will not say what consideration  I might give to that point myself,  Mr. Copperfield, if I were unfettered.  Mr. Jorkins is immovable.&#x27; I was  quite dismayed  by the  idea of  this terrible  Jorkins.  But I found out afterwards that he  was a mild  man of a  heavy temperament, whose  place in the business was to keep himself in  the background, and be constantly exhibited  by name as the  most obdurate and  ruthless of men.   If a clerk  wanted his salary raised, Mr. Jorkins  wouldn&#x27;t listen to  such a proposition.   If a client  were slow to settle his bill of costs, Mr. Jorkins was resolved to have it paid;  and however painful these things might be  (and always were) to the feelings  of Mr. Spenlow, Mr. Jorkins would have his bond.  The heart and hand of the good  angel Spenlow would have been always open, but for the restraining demon Jorkins.   As I have grown  older, I think  I have had  experience of some  other houses doing business on the principle of Spenlow and Jorkins! It was settled that  I should begin my  month&#x27;s probation as soon  as I pleased, and that my aunt  need neither remain in  town nor return at  its expiration, as the articles of  agreement, of which  I was to  be the subject,  could easily be sent to her  at home for  her signature.  When  we had got  so far, Mr.  Spenlow offered to take me into Court then and there, and show me what sort of place  it was. As I was willing enough to  know, we went out with this object,  leaving my aunt behind; who  would trust herself,  she said, in  no such place,  and who, I think, regarded all Courts of Law as  a sort of powder-mills that might blow  up at any time. Mr. Spenlow conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of grave brick houses, which I inferred,  from the Doctors&#x27;  names upon the  doors, to be  the official abiding-places of the learned advocates of whom Steerforth had told me; and into a large dull room, not  unlike a chapel to my  thinking, on the left hand.   The upper part of  this room was  fenced off from  the rest; and  there, on the  two sides of a raised platform of the horse-shoe form, sitting on easy old-fashioned dining-room chairs, were  sundry gentlemen in  red gowns and  grey wigs, whom  I found to be the  Doctors aforesaid. Blinking  over a little  desk like a  pulpit desk, in the curve of the horse-shoe, was an old gentleman, whom, if I had  seen him in an aviary, I should certainly have taken for an owl, but who, I  learned, was the presiding judge.  In the space within the horse-shoe, lower than  these, that is to say, on about the level of the floor, were sundry other gentlemen, of Mr. Spenlow&#x27;s  rank, and  dressed like  him in  black gowns  with white fur upon them, sitting at  a long green  table.  Their cravats  were in general  stiff, I thought, and their looks haughty; but in this last respect I presently conceived I had done  them an injustice,  for when two  or three of  them had to  rise and answer  a  question  of  the presiding  dignitary,  I  never  saw anything  more sheepish.  The public,  represented by  a boy  with a  comforter, and  a  shabby genteel man secretly eating crumbs out  of his coat pockets, was warming  itself at a stove in the centre of  the Court.  The languid stillness of the  place was only broken by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the Doctors, who was wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence, and stopping  to put up, from time to time, at  little roadside inns of argument on the  journey. Altogether, I have never, on any occasion, made one at such a cosey, dosey,  old fashioned, time-forgotten, sleepy-headed little family-party in all my life; and I felt it would be  quite a  soothing opiate  to belong to it  in  any character except perhaps as a suitor. Very well  satisfied with  the dreamy  nature of  this retreat,  I informed  Mr. Spenlow that  I had  seen enough  for that  time, and  we rejoined  my aunt;  in company with whom I presently departed from the Commons, feeling very young when I went out of Spenlow and Jorkins&#x27;s, on account of the clerks poking one another with their pens to point me out. We  arrived  at  Lincoln&#x27;s  Inn  Fields  without  any  new  adventures,   except encountering an unlucky donkey in  a costermonger&#x27;s cart, who suggested  painful associations to my aunt.  We had another long talk about my plans, when we  were safely housed; and  as I knew  she was anxious  to get home,  and, between fire, food, and pickpockets, could never be considered at her ease for half-an-hour in London, I urged her not  to be uncomfortable on my  account, but to leave me  to take care of myself. &#x27;I have not been here a  week tomorrow, without considering that too,  my dear,&#x27; she returned.  &#x27;There  is a furnished  little set of  chambers to be  let in the Adelphi, Trot, which ought to suit you to a marvel.&#x27; With this  brief introduction,  she produced  from her  pocket an advertisement, carefully cut out of a newspaper, setting forth that in Buckingham Street in the Adelphi there was to  be let furnished, with  a view of the  river, a singularly desirable, and compact set of chambers, forming a genteel residence for a  young gentleman, a member of  one of the Inns  of Court, or otherwise,  with immediate possession.  Terms moderate, and could be taken for a month only, if required. &#x27;Why, this is the very thing,  aunt!&#x27; said I, flushed with the  possible dignity of living in chambers. &#x27;Then come,&#x27; replied my aunt, immediately  resuming the bonnet she had a  minute before laid aside.  &#x27;We&#x27;ll go and look at &#x27;em.&#x27; Away we  went.  The  advertisement directed  us to  apply to  Mrs. Crupp  on the premises, and we rung the area bell, which we supposed to communicate with  Mrs. Crupp.  It was not until we had  rung three or four times that we  could prevail on Mrs. Crupp to  communicate with us, but  at last she appeared,  being a stout lady with a flounce of flannel petticoat below a nankeen gown. &#x27;Let us see these chambers of yours, if you please, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;For this gentleman?&#x27; said Mrs. Crupp, feeling in her pocket for her keys. &#x27;Yes, for my nephew,&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;And a sweet set they is for sich!&#x27; said Mrs. Crupp. So we went upstairs. They were on the top of the house  - a great point with my aunt, being  near the fire-escape - and  consisted of a  little half-blind entry  where you could  see hardly anything, a little stone-blind pantry where you could see nothing at all, a sitting-room, and a bedroom.  The  furniture was rather faded, but quite  good enough for me; and, sure enough, the river was outside the windows. As I  was delighted  with the  place, my  aunt and  Mrs. Crupp withdrew into the pantry to discuss the terms, while  I remained on the sitting-room sofa,  hardly daring to think  it possible that  I could be  destined to live  in such a noble residence.  After a single combat of some duration they returned, and I saw,  to my joy, both  in Mrs. Crupp&#x27;s  countenance and in  my aunt&#x27;s, that  the deed was done. &#x27;Is it the last occupant&#x27;s furniture?&#x27; inquired my aunt. &#x27;Yes, it is, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said Mrs. Crupp. &#x27;What&#x27;s become of him?&#x27; asked my aunt. Mrs.  Crupp was  taken with  a troublesome  cough, in  the midst  of which   she articulated with much difficulty.  &#x27;He was took ill here, ma&#x27;am, and - ugh! ugh! ugh! dear me! - and he died!&#x27; &#x27;Hey!  What did he die of?&#x27; asked my aunt. &#x27;Well, ma&#x27;am, he died of drink,&#x27; said Mrs. Crupp, in confidence. &#x27;And smoke.&#x27; &#x27;Smoke?  You don&#x27;t mean chimneys?&#x27; said my aunt. &#x27;No, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; returned Mrs. Crupp.  &#x27;Cigars and pipes.&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s not catching, Trot, at any rate,&#x27; remarked my aunt, turning to me. &#x27;No, indeed,&#x27; said I. In short, my aunt, seeing how enraptured I was with the premises, took them  for a month, with leave  to remain for twelve  months when that time  was out.  Mrs. Crupp  was  to  find linen,  and  to  cook; every  other  necessary  was already provided;  and  Mrs. Crupp  expressly  intimated that  she  should always  yearn towards me as a son.  I was to take possession the day after tomorrow, and  Mrs. Crupp said, thank Heaven she had now found summun she could care for! On our way back, my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted that the life I was now to lead would make me firm and self-reliant, which was all I wanted. She repeated this several times next day, in the intervals of our arranging for  the transmission of my  clothes and books  from Mr. Wickfield&#x27;s;  relative to which, and to all my  late holiday, I wrote  a long letter to  Agnes, of which my  aunt took charge, as she was to leave  on the succeeding day.  Not to lengthen  these particulars, I  need only  add, that  she made  a handsome  provision for all my possible  wants  during  my  month  of  trial;  that  Steerforth,  to  my  great disappointment and hers too, did not  make his appearance before she went  away; that  I  saw her  safely  seated in  the  Dover coach,  exulting  in the  coming discomfiture of the vagrant donkeys, with  Janet at her side; and that  when the coach was gone, I turned my face to the Adelphi, pondering on the old days  when I used to roam about its subterranean arches, and on the happy changes which had brought me to the surface. CHAPTER 24 MY FIRST DISSIPATION It was  a wonderfully  fine thing  to have  that lofty  castle to myself, and to feel, when I shut my outer door, like Robinson Crusoe, when he had got into  his fortification, and pulled his  ladder up after him.   It was a wonderfully  fine thing to walk about town with the key of my house in my pocket, and to know that I  could  ask  any fellow  to  come  home, and  make  quite  sure of  its  being inconvenient to  nobody, if  it were  not so  to me.   It was a wonderfully fine thing to let myself in and out, and to come and go without a word to anyone, and to ring Mrs. Crupp up, gasping, from the depths of the earth, when I wanted  her - and when she was disposed to come.  All this, I say, was wonderfully fine; but I must say, too, that there were times when it was very dreary. It was fine in the morning, particularly in the fine mornings.  It looked a very fresh, free life, by daylight: still  fresher, and more free, by sunlight.   But as the day declined, the life seemed to  go down too.  I don&#x27;t know how it  was; it seldom looked well by candle-light.   I wanted somebody to talk to,  then.  I missed  Agnes.  I  found  a  tremendous blank,  in  the  place  of  that smiling repository of  my confidence.   Mrs. Crupp  appeared to  be a  long way  off.  I thought about my predecessor, who had died of drink and smoke; and I could  have wished he had been so good as to live, and not bother me with his decease. After two days and nights, I felt as if I had lived there for a year, and yet  I was not an hour older, but was quite as much tormented by my own youthfulness as ever. Steerforth not yet appearing, which induced me to apprehend that he must be ill, I left the  Commons early on  the third day,  and walked out  to Highgate.  Mrs. Steerforth was very glad to see me, and  said that he had gone away with one  of his  Oxford friends  to see  another who  lived near  St. Albans,  but that  she expected him  to return  tomorrow.  I  was so  fond of  him, that  I felt  quite jealous of his Oxford friends. As she pressed me to stay to  dinner, I remained, and I believe we  talked about nothing but him all day.  I told her how much the people liked him at  Yarmouth, and what a delightful companion he had been.  Miss Dartle was full of hints  and mysterious questions, but  took a great  interest in all  our proceedings there, and  said,  &#x27;Was  it really  though?&#x27;  and  so forth,  so  often,  that she  got everything out of me she wanted to know.  Her appearance was exactly what I have described it, when  I first saw  her; but the  society of the  two ladies was so agreeable, and came  so natural to  me, that I  felt myself falling  a little in love with her.  I  could not help thinking,  several times in the  course of the evening, and particularly when I  walked home at night, what  delightful company she would be in Buckingham Street. I was taking my  coffee and roll  in the morning,  before going to  the  Commons and I may observe in this place that it is surprising how much coffee Mrs. Crupp used, and how weak it was,  considering - when Steerforth himself walked  in, to my unbounded joy. &#x27;My dear Steerforth,&#x27; cried I, &#x27;I began to think I should never see you again!&#x27; &#x27;I was carried off, by force  of arms,&#x27; said Steerforth, &#x27;the very  next morning after I got home.  Why, Daisy, what a rare old bachelor you are here!&#x27; I showed him  over the establishment,  not omitting the  pantry, with no  little pride, and he  commended it highly.   &#x27;I tell you  what, old boy,&#x27;  he added, &#x27;I shall make quite a town-house of this place, unless you give me notice to quit.&#x27; This was a delightful hearing.  I told him if he waited for that, he would  have to wait till doomsday. &#x27;But you shall have some breakfast!&#x27; said I, with my hand on the bell-rope, &#x27;and Mrs. Crupp shall make you some fresh coffee, and I&#x27;ll toast you some bacon in  a bachelor&#x27;s Dutch-oven, that I have got here.&#x27; &#x27;No, no!&#x27; said Steerforth.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t ring!  I can&#x27;t!  I am going to breakfast with one of these fellows who is at the Piazza Hotel, in Covent Garden.&#x27; &#x27;But you&#x27;ll come back to dinner?&#x27; said I. &#x27;I can&#x27;t, upon my life.  There&#x27;s nothing I should like better, but I must remain with these two fellows.  We are all three off together tomorrow morning.&#x27; &#x27;Then bring them here to dinner,&#x27; I returned.  &#x27;Do you think they would come?&#x27; &#x27;Oh! they would come fast enough,&#x27; said Steerforth; &#x27;but we should inconvenience you.  You had better come and dine with us somewhere.&#x27; I would not by any  means consent to this, for  it occurred to me that  I really ought to have  a little house-warming,  and that there  never could be  a better opportunity.  I  had a  new pride  in my  rooms after  his approval of them, and burned with a desire  to develop their utmost  resources.  I therefore made  him promise positively in the names of his two friends, and we appointed six o&#x27;clock as the dinner-hour. When he was gone,  I rang for Mrs.  Crupp, and acquainted her  with my desperate design.  Mrs. Crupp said,  in the first place,  of course it was  well known she couldn&#x27;t be expected to  wait, but she knew  a handy young man,  who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it,  and whose terms would be five shillings,  and what I pleased.  I said, certainly we  would have him.  Next Mrs. Crupp said  it was clear she couldn&#x27;t be in two places at once (which I felt to be reasonable), and that  &#x27;a young  gal&#x27; stationed  in the  pantry with  a bedroom candle, there never to desist from washing plates, would be indispensable.  I said, what would be  the  expense  of  this  young  female?  and  Mrs.  Crupp  said  she supposed eighteenpence would neither make  me nor break me.   I said I supposed  not; and THAT was settled.  Then Mrs. Crupp said, Now about the dinner. It  was  a  remarkable instance  of  want  of forethought  on  the  part of  the ironmonger who had made Mrs. Crupp&#x27;s  kitchen fireplace, that it was capable  of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes.  As to a fish-kittle, Mrs.  Crupp said, well! would I  only come and look  at the range?  She  couldn&#x27;t say fairer than that.  Would I  come and look at  it?  As I should  not have been much  the wiser if I HAD looked at it, I declined, and said, &#x27;Never mind fish.&#x27;  But  Mrs. Crupp said, Don&#x27;t say that; oysters was in, why not them?  So THAT was  settled. Mrs. Crupp  then said  what she  would recommend  would be  this.  A pair of hot roast fowls - from the  pastry-cook&#x27;s;  a dish of  stewed beef, with  vegetables from the pastry-cook&#x27;s; two little corner things, as a raised pie and a dish  of kidneys - from the  pastrycook&#x27;s; a tart,   and (if I  liked) a shape  of  jelly from the pastrycook&#x27;s.  This, Mrs. Crupp  said, would leave her at full  liberty to concentrate her mind on the potatoes,  and to serve up the cheese and  celery as she could wish to see it done. I acted on Mrs. Crupp&#x27;s opinion, and gave the order at the pastry-cook&#x27;s myself. Walking along the Strand, afterwards, and observing a hard mottled substance  in the window  of a  ham and  beef shop,  which resembled  marble, but was labelled &#x27;Mock Turtle&#x27;, I went in and bought a slab of it, which I have since seen reason to  believe would  have sufficed  for fifteen  people.  This  preparation,  Mrs. Crupp, after some difficulty, consented to warm  up; and it shrunk so much in  a liquid state, that we found it  what Steerforth called &#x27;rather a tight  fit&#x27; for four. These preparations happily completed, I bought a little dessert in Covent Garden Market, and gave a  rather extensive order at  a retail wine-merchant&#x27;s in  that vicinity.  When I came home in the afternoon, and saw the bottles drawn up in  a square on  the pantry  floor, they  looked so  numerous (though  there were  two missing,  which  made Mrs.  Crupp  very uncomfortable),  that  I was  absolutely frightened at them. One of  Steerforth&#x27;s friends  was named  Grainger, and  the other Markham.  They were  both  very  gay  and  lively  fellows;  Grainger,  something  older   than Steerforth; Markham, youthful-looking, and I should say not more than twenty.  I observed that the latter always spoke  of himself indefinitely, as &#x27;a man&#x27;,  and seldom or never in the first person singular. &#x27;A man might  get on very  well here, Mr.  Copperfield,&#x27; said Markham  - meaning himself. &#x27;It&#x27;s not a bad situation,&#x27; said I, &#x27;and the rooms are really commodious.&#x27; &#x27;I hope you have both brought appetites with you?&#x27; said Steerforth. &#x27;Upon my honour,&#x27; returned Markham, &#x27;town seems to sharpen a man&#x27;s appetite.   A man is hungry all day long.  A man is perpetually eating.&#x27; Being a little embarrassed  at first, and feeling  much too young to  preside, I made Steerforth take the head of the table when dinner was announced, and seated myself opposite to him.   Everything was very good;  we did not spare  the wine; and he  exerted himself  so brilliantly  to make  the thing  pass off well, that there was no pause in our festivity.   I was not quite such good company  during dinner as I could have wished to be, for my chair was opposite the door, and  my attention was distracted by observing that  the handy young man went out  of the room  very  often, and  that  his shadow  always  presented itself,  immediately afterwards, on the wall  of the entry, with  a bottle at its  mouth.  The &#x27;young gal&#x27; likewise occasioned me some uneasiness:  not so much by neglecting to  wash the plates, as by breaking them.   For being of an inquisitive disposition,  and unable to confine herself (as her positive instructions were) to the pantry, she was constantly peering in at  us, and constantly imagining herself  detected; in which belief,  she several  times retired  upon the  plates (with  which she had carefully paved the floor), and did a great deal of destruction. These, however, were  small drawbacks, and  easily forgotten when  the cloth was cleared, and the dessert put on the table; at which period of the  entertainment the  handy  young man  was  discovered to  be  speechless.  Giving  him  private directions to seek the society of Mrs.  Crupp, and to remove the &#x27;young gal&#x27;  to the basement also, I abandoned myself to enjoyment. I began,  by being  singularly cheerful  and light-hearted;  all sorts  of  half forgotten things  to talk  about, came  rushing into  my mind,  and made me hold forth  in a  most unwonted  manner.  I  laughed heartily  at my  own jokes,  and everybody else&#x27;s;  called Steerforth  to order  for not  passing the  wine; made several engagements to go  to Oxford; announced  that I meant  to have a  dinner party exactly like that,  once a week, until  further notice; and madly  took so much snuff out of Grainger&#x27;s box, that I was obliged to go into the pantry,  and have a private fit of sneezing ten minutes long. I went on, by passing the  wine faster and faster yet, and  continually starting up with a corkscrew to open more  wine, long before any was needed.  I  proposed Steerforth&#x27;s health.   I said  he was  my dearest  friend, the  protector of  my boyhood, and the companion of my prime.   I said I was delighted to propose  his health.  I said I  owed him more obligations  than I could ever  repay, and held him in a  higher admiration than  I could ever  express.  I finished  by saying, &#x27;I&#x27;ll give you  Steerforth!  God bless  him!  Hurrah!&#x27; We  gave him three  times three, and another, and a  good one to finish with.   I broke my glass in  going round the table to shake hands with  him, and I said (in two words)  &#x27;Steerforth you&#x27;retheguidingstarofmyexistence.&#x27; I went  on, by  finding suddenly  that somebody  was in  the middle  of a  song. Markham was the singer, and he sang  &#x27;When the heart of a man is  depressed with care&#x27;.  He said, when he had sung it, he would give us &#x27;Woman!&#x27; I took objection to  that, and  I couldn&#x27;t  allow it.   I said  it was  not a  respectful way  of proposing the toast, and I would never permit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise than as &#x27;The Ladies!&#x27; I was very high with him, mainly I think because I saw Steerforth and Grainger laughing at me - or at him - or at both of us.  He said a man was not to be dictated to.  I said a man was.  He said a man  was not to be insulted, then.  I  said he was right there  - never under my roof,  where the Lares were sacred, and the laws of hospitality paramount.  He said it was no derogation from a man&#x27;s dignity to confess that I was a devilish good fellow.  I instantly proposed his health. Somebody  was smoking.   We were  all smoking.   I was  smoking, and  trying  to suppress a rising tendency to shudder.   Steerforth had made a speech about  me, in the course of which I had been affected almost to tears.  I returned  thanks, and hoped the present company  would dine with me  tomorrow, and the day   after each day at five o&#x27;clock, that we might enjoy the pleasures of conversation  and society through a long evening.  I felt called upon to propose an individual.  I would give them my aunt.  Miss Betsey Trotwood, the best of her sex! Somebody was leaning out of  my bedroom window, refreshing his  forehead against the cool  stone of  the parapet,  and feeling  the air  upon his  face.  It  was myself.  I was addressing myself as &#x27;Copperfield&#x27;, and saying, &#x27;Why did you  try to  smoke?   You  might have  known  you  couldn&#x27;t do  it.&#x27;   Now,  somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in  the looking-glass.  That was I  too. I was very pale in the looking-glass; my eyes had a vacant appearance; and my hair - only my hair, nothing else - looked drunk. Somebody said  to me,  &#x27;Let us  go to  the theatre,  Copperfield!&#x27; There  was no bedroom before me, but again the jingling table covered with glasses; the  lamp; Grainger on my  right hand, Markham  on my left,  and Steerforth opposite  - all sitting in a  mist, and a  long way off.   The theatre?  To  be sure.  The  very thing.  Come along!  But they must excuse  me if I saw everybody out first,  and turned the lamp off - in case of fire. Owing to some confusion in the dark, the door was gone.  I was feeling for it in the window-curtains, when Steerforth,  laughing, took me by  the arm and led  me out.  We went downstairs, one  behind another.  Near the bottom,  somebody fell, and rolled down.  Somebody else said  it was Copperfield.   I was angry  at that false report, until, finding myself on my back in the passage, I began to  think there might be some foundation for it. A very foggy night, with great rings round the lamps in the streets!  There  was an indistinct talk of its being wet.  I considered it frosty.  Steerforth dusted me under a lamp-post,  and put my hat  into shape, which somebody  produced from somewhere  in  a most  extraordinary  manner, for  I  hadn&#x27;t had  it  on before. Steerforth then said, &#x27;You are all right, Copperfield, are you not?&#x27; and I  told him, &#x27;Neverberrer.&#x27; A man, sitting  in a pigeon-hole-place,  looked out of  the fog, and  took money from somebody, inquiring if I was  one of the gentlemen paid for,  and appearing rather doubtful (as I remember in the glimpse I had of him) whether to take  the money for me  or not. Shortly  afterwards, we were  very high up  in a very  hot theatre, looking down into a large pit,  that seemed to me to smoke; the  people with whom  it was  crammed were  so indistinct.   There was  a great stage, too, looking very clean and smooth after the streets; and there were people upon  it, talking about something  or other, but  not at all  intelligibly.  There was  an abundance of bright lights, and there  was music, and there were ladies  down in the boxes, and I don&#x27;t know what more.  The whole building looked to me as if it were learning to swim; it conducted itself in such an unaccountable manner, when I tried to steady it. On somebody&#x27;s motion, we resolved to go downstairs to the dress-boxes, where the ladies were.  A gentleman lounging, full dressed, on a sofa, with an opera-glass in his hand, passed before my view, and  also my own figure at full length in  a glass.  Then  I was  being ushered  into one  of these  boxes, and  found myself saying  something  as I  sat  down, and  people  about me  crying  &#x27;Silence!&#x27; to somebody, and ladies casting indignant glances at me, and - what! yes! -  Agnes, sitting on the seat before me, in the same box, with a lady and gentleman beside her, whom I didn&#x27;t  know.  I see her  face now, better than  I did then, I  dare say, with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me. &#x27;Agnes!&#x27; I said, thickly, &#x27;Lorblessmer!  Agnes!&#x27; &#x27;Hush!   Pray!&#x27;  she answered,  I  could not  conceive  why.  &#x27;You  disturb  the company.  Look at the stage!&#x27; I tried, on her injunction, to fix  it, and to hear something of what  was going on there,  but quite  in vain.   I looked  at her  again by  and by, and saw her shrink into her corner, and put her gloved hand to her forehead. &#x27;Agnes!&#x27; I said.  &#x27;I&#x27;mafraidyou&#x27;renorwell.&#x27; &#x27;Yes, yes.  Do not  mind me, Trotwood,&#x27; she  returned.  &#x27;Listen!  Are you  going away soon?&#x27; &#x27;Amigoarawaysoo?&#x27; I repeated. &#x27;Yes.&#x27; I had  a stupid  intention of  replying that  I was  going to  wait, to hand her downstairs.  I suppose I expressed it,  somehow; for after she had looked  at me attentively for a little while, she appeared to understand, and replied in a low tone: &#x27;I know you will  do as I ask  you, if I tell  you I am very  earnest in it.  Go away now, Trotwood, for my sake, and ask your friends to take you home.&#x27; She had so far improved  me, for the time, that  though I was angry with  her, I felt ashamed, and with a short &#x27;Goori!&#x27; (which I intended for &#x27;Good night!&#x27;) got up and went away.  They followed, and I stepped at once out of the box-door into my bedroom, where only Steerforth was with me, helping me to undress, and  where I was by turns telling him that  Agnes was my sister, and adjuring him  to bring the corkscrew, that I might open another bottle of wine. How somebody,  lying in  my bed,  lay saying  and doing  all this over again, at cross purposes, in a feverish dream all  night - the bed a rocking sea  that was never still!  How, as that somebody slowly settled down into myself, did I begin to parch, and feel as if my outer covering of skin were a hard board; my  tongue the bottom of an empty kettle, furred  with long service, and burning up over  a slow fire; the palms of my hands, hot plates of metal which no ice could cool! But the agony  of mind, the  remorse, and shame  I felt when  I became conscious next day!  My horror  of having committed a  thousand offences I had  forgotten, and which nothing could  ever expiate - my  recollection of that indelible  look which Agnes  had given  me -  the torturing  impossibility of communicating with her, not knowing, Beast that I was, how  she came to be in London, or where  she stayed - my disgust of the very sight of the room where the revel had been  held - my racking head - the smell of smoke, the sight of glasses, the  impossibility of going out, or even getting up!  Oh, what a day it was! Oh, what an  evening, when I  sat down by  my fire to  a basin of  mutton broth, dimpled all over with  fat, and thought I  was going the way  of my predecessor, and should succeed to his dismal story as well as to his chambers, and had  half a mind  to rush  express to  Dover and  reveal all!   What an evening, when Mrs. Crupp, coming in to take away the  broth-basin, produced one kidney on a  cheese plate as the entire remains of  yesterday&#x27;s feast, and I was really  inclined to fall upon her nankeen breast and  say, in heartfelt penitence, &#x27;Oh, Mrs.  Crupp, Mrs. Crupp, never mind  the broken meats!  I  am very miserable!&#x27; -  only that I doubted, even  at that  pass, if  Mrs. Crupp  were quite  the sort  of woman  to confide in! CHAPTER 25 GOOD AND BAD ANGELS I was going out at my door on the morning after that deplorable day of headache, sickness, and repentance, with an odd confusion in my mind relative to the  date of my  dinner-party, as  if a  body of  Titans had  taken an  enormous lever and pushed the day  before yesterday some  months back, when  I saw a  ticket-porter coming upstairs, with a  letter in his hand.   He was taking his  time about his errand, then; but  when he saw  me on the  top of the  staircase, looking at him over the banisters, he swung into a trot,  and came up panting as if he had  run himself into a state of exhaustion. &#x27;T. Copperfield,  Esquire,&#x27; said  the ticket-porter,  touching his  hat with his little cane. I could scarcely  lay claim to  the name: I  was so disturbed  by the conviction that the  letter came  from Agnes.   However, I  told him  I was T. Copperfield, Esquire, and he believed it, and gave  me the letter, which he said required  an answer.  I shut him out on the landing to wait for the answer, and went into  my chambers again, in such a nervous state  that I was fain to lay the  letter down on my breakfast table, and familiarize  myself with the outside of it  a little, before I could resolve to break the seal. I  found, when  I did  open it,  that it  was a  very kind  note, containing  no reference to my condition at the theatre.  All it said was, &#x27;My dear Trotwood. I am staying at the house of papa&#x27;s agent, Mr. Waterbrook, in Ely Place,  Holborn. Will you come  and see me  today, at any  time you like  to appoint?  Ever yours affectionately, AGNES.  &#x27; It took me such a long time to write an answer at all to my satisfaction, that I don&#x27;t know  what the  ticket-porter can  have thought,  unless he  thought I was learning to write.  I must have written half-a-dozen answers at least.  I  began one, &#x27;How can I  ever hope, my dear  Agnes, to efface from  your remembrance the disgusting impression&#x27; - there I didn&#x27;t like it, and then I tore it up.  I began another, &#x27;Shakespeare has observed, my dear Agnes, how strange it is that a  man should put an enemy into his mouth&#x27; - that reminded me of Markham, and it got no farther.  I even tried poetry.  I  began one note, in a six-syllable  line, &#x27;Oh, do not remember&#x27; -  but that associated itself  with the fifth of  November, and became an absurdity.  After many attempts, I wrote, &#x27;My dear Agnes.  Your letter is like you, and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that? I will come  at four  o&#x27;clock. Affectionately  and sorrowfully,  T.C.&#x27;  With  this missive (which I was in twenty minds at once about recalling, as soon as it  was out of my hands), the ticket-porter at last departed. If  the day  were half  as tremendous  to any  other professional  gentleman  in Doctors&#x27; Commons as it was to me, I sincerely believe he made some expiation for his share in that rotten old ecclesiastical cheese.  Although I left the  office at half past three, and was prowling about the place of appointment within a few minutes afterwards,  the appointed  time was  exceeded by  a full  quarter of an hour, according to the clock of St. Andrew&#x27;s, Holborn, before I could muster  up sufficient desperation to  pull the private  bell-handle let into  the left-hand door-post of Mr. Waterbrook&#x27;s house.</div></div></div><div class="loadMoreContainer_uDYA"><button class="loadMoreButton_bS8g">See more</button></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container
