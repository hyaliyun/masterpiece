in the evening the body of the house at the Theatres des Varietes was still all but empty.  A few individuals, it is true, were sitting quietly waiting in the balcony and stalls, but these were lost, as it were, among the ranges of seats whose coverings of cardinal velvet loomed in the subdued light of the dimly burning luster.  A shadow enveloped the great red splash of the curtain, and not a sound came from the stage, the unlit footlights, the scattered desks of the orchestra.  It was only high overhead in the third gallery, round the domed ceiling where nude females and children flew in heavens which had turned green in the gaslight, that calls and laughter were audible above a continuous hubbub of voices, and heads in women&#x27;s and workmen&#x27;s caps were ranged, row above row, under the wide-vaulted bays with their gilt- surrounding adornments.  Every few seconds an attendant would make her appearance, bustling along with tickets in her hand and piloting in front of her a gentleman and a lady, who took their seats, he in his evening dress, she sitting slim and undulant beside him while her eyes wandered slowly round the house. Two young men appeared in the stalls; they kept standing and looked about them. &quot;Didn&#x27;t I say so, Hector?&quot; cried the elder of the two, a tall fellow with little black mustaches.  &quot;We&#x27;re too early!  You might quite well have allowed me to finish my cigar.&quot; An attendant was passing. &quot;Oh, Monsieur Fauchery,&quot; she said familiarly, &quot;it won&#x27;t begin for half an hour yet!&quot; &quot;Then why do they advertise for nine o&#x27;clock?&quot; muttered Hector, whose long thin face assumed an expression of vexation.  &quot;Only this morning Clarisse, who&#x27;s in the piece, swore that they&#x27;d begin at nine o&#x27;clock punctually.&quot; For a moment they remained silent and, looking upward, scanned the shadowy boxes.  But the green paper with which these were hung rendered them more shadowy still.  Down below, under the dress circle, the lower boxes were buried in utter night.  In those on the second tier there was only one stout lady, who was stranded, as it were, on the velvet-covered balustrade in front of her.  On the right hand and on the left, between lofty pilasters, the stage boxes, bedraped with long-fringed scalloped hangings, remained untenanted.  The house with its white and gold, relieved by soft green tones, lay only half disclosed to view, as though full of a fine dust shed from the little jets of flame in the great glass luster. &quot;Did you get your stage box for Lucy?&quot; asked Hector. &quot;Yes,&quot; replied his companion, &quot;but I had some trouble to get it. Oh, there&#x27;s no danger of Lucy coming too early!&quot; He stifled a slight yawn; then after a pause: &quot;You&#x27;re in luck&#x27;s way, you are, since you haven&#x27;t been at a first night before.  The Blonde Venus will be the event of the year. People have been talking about it for six months.  Oh, such music, my dear boy!  Such a sly dog, Bordenave!  He knows his business and has kept this for the exhibition season.&quot;  Hector was religiously attentive.  He asked a question. &quot;And Nana, the new star who&#x27;s going to play Venus, d&#x27;you know her?&quot; &quot;There you are; you&#x27;re beginning again!&quot; cried Fauchery, casting up his arms.  &quot;Ever since this morning people have been dreeing me with Nana.  I&#x27;ve met more than twenty people, and it&#x27;s Nana here and Nana there!  What do I know?  Am I acquainted with all the light ladies in Paris?  Nana is an invention of Bordenave&#x27;s!  It must be a fine one!&quot; He calmed himself, but the emptiness of the house, the dim light of the luster, the churchlike sense of self-absorption which the place inspired, full as it was of whispering voices and the sound of doors banging--all these got on his nerves. &quot;No, by Jove,&quot; he said all of a sudden, &quot;one&#x27;s hair turns gray here. I--I&#x27;m going out.  Perhaps we shall find Bordenave downstairs. He&#x27;ll give us information about things.&quot; Downstairs in the great marble-paved entrance hall, where the box office was, the public were beginning to show themselves.  Through the three open gates might have been observed, passing in, the ardent life of the boulevards, which were all astir and aflare under the fine April night.  The sound of carriage wheels kept stopping suddenly; carriage doors were noisily shut again, and people began entering in small groups, taking their stand before the ticket bureau and climbing the double flight of stairs at the end of the hall, up which the women loitered with swaying hips.  Under the crude gaslight, round the pale, naked walls of the entrance hall, which with its scanty First Empire decorations suggested the peristyle of a toy temple, there was a flaring display of lofty yellow posters bearing the name of &quot;Nana&quot; in great black letters. Gentlemen, who seemed to be glued to the entry, were reading them; others, standing about, were engaged in talk, barring the doors of the house in so doing, while hard by the box office a thickset man with an extensive, close-shaven visage was giving rough answers to such as pressed to engage seats. &quot;There&#x27;s Bordenave,&quot; said Fauchery as he came down the stairs.  But the manager had already seen him. &quot;Ah, ah!  You&#x27;re a nice fellow!&quot; he shouted at him from a distance. &quot;That&#x27;s the way you give me a notice, is it?  Why, I opened my Figaro this morning--never a word!&quot; &quot;Wait a bit,&quot; replied Fauchery.  &quot;I certainly must make the acquaintance of your Nana before talking about her.  Besides, I&#x27;ve made no promises.&quot; Then to put an end to the discussion, he introduced his cousin, M. Hector de la Faloise, a young man who had come to finish his education in Paris.  The manager took the young man&#x27;s measure at a glance.  But Hector returned his scrutiny with deep interest.  This, then, was that Bordenave, that showman of the sex who treated women like a convict overseer, that clever fellow who was always at full steam over some advertising dodge, that shouting, spitting, thigh- slapping fellow, that cynic with the soul of a policeman!  Hector was under the impression that he ought to discover some amiable observation for the occasion. &quot;Your theater--&quot; he began in dulcet tones. Bordenave interrupted him with a savage phrase, as becomes a man who dotes on frank situations. &quot;Call it my brothel!&quot; At this Fauchery laughed approvingly, while La Faloise stopped with his pretty speech strangled in his throat, feeling very much shocked and striving to appear as though he enjoyed the phrase.  The manager had dashed off to shake hands with a dramatic critic whose column had considerable influence.  When he returned La Faloise was recovering.  He was afraid of being treated as a provincial if he showed himself too much nonplused. &quot;I have been told,&quot; he began again, longing positively to find something to say, &quot;that Nana has a delicious voice.&quot; &quot;Nana?&quot; cried the manager, shrugging his shoulders.  &quot;The voice of a squirt!&quot; The young man made haste to add: &quot;Besides being a first-rate comedian!&quot; &quot;She?  Why she&#x27;s a lump!  She has no notion what to do with her hands and feet.&quot; La Faloise blushed a little.  He had lost his bearings.  He stammered: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have missed this first representation tonight for the world.  I was aware that your theater--&quot; &quot;Call it my brothel,&quot; Bordenave again interpolated with the frigid obstinacy of a man convinced. Meanwhile Fauchery, with extreme calmness, was looking at the women as they came in.  He went to his cousin&#x27;s rescue when he saw him all at sea and doubtful whether to laugh or to be angry. &quot;Do be pleasant to Bordenave--call his theater what he wishes you to, since it amuses him.  And you, my dear fellow, don&#x27;t keep us waiting about for nothing.  If your Nana neither sings nor acts you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ve made a blunder, that&#x27;s all.  It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m afraid of, if the truth be told.&quot; &quot;A blunder!  A blunder!&quot; shouted the manager, and his face grew purple.  &quot;Must a woman know how to act and sing?  Oh, my chicken, you&#x27;re too STOOPID.  Nana has other good points, by heaven!-- something which is as good as all the other things put together. I&#x27;ve smelled it out; it&#x27;s deuced pronounced with her, or I&#x27;ve got the scent of an idiot.  You&#x27;ll see, you&#x27;ll see!  She&#x27;s only got to come on, and all the house will be gaping at her.&quot; He had held up his big hands which were trembling under the influence of his eager enthusiasm, and now, having relieved his feelings, he lowered his voice and grumbled to himself: &quot;Yes, she&#x27;ll go far!  Oh yes, s&#x27;elp me, she&#x27;ll go far!  A skin--oh, what a skin she&#x27;s got!&quot; Then as Fauchery began questioning him he consented to enter into a detailed explanation, couched in phraseology so crude that Hector de la Faloise felt slightly disgusted.  He had been thick with Nana, and he was anxious to start her on the stage.  Well, just about that time he was in search of a Venus.  He--he never let a woman encumber him for any length of time; he preferred to let the public enjoy the benefit of her forthwith.  But there was a deuce of a row going on in his shop, which had been turned topsy-turvy by that big damsel&#x27;s advent.  Rose Mignon, his star, a comic actress of much subtlety and an adorable singer, was daily threatening to leave him in the lurch, for she was furious and guessed the presence of a rival.  And as for the bill, good God!  What a noise there had been about it all!  It had ended by his deciding to print the names of the two actresses in the same-sized type.  But it wouldn&#x27;t do to bother him.  Whenever any of his little women, as he called them--Simonne or Clarisse, for instance--wouldn&#x27;t go the way he wanted her to he just up with his foot and caught her one in the rear.  Otherwise life was impossible. Oh yes, he sold &#x27;em; HE knew what they fetched, the wenches! &quot;Tut!&quot; he cried, breaking off short.  &quot;Mignon and Steiner.  Always together.  You know, Steiner&#x27;s getting sick of Rose; that&#x27;s why the husband dogs his steps now for fear of his slipping away.&quot; On the pavement outside, the row of gas jets flaring on the cornice of the theater cast a patch of brilliant light.  Two small trees, violently green, stood sharply out against it, and a column gleamed in such vivid illumination that one could read the notices thereon at a distance, as though in broad daylight, while the dense night of the boulevard beyond was dotted with lights above the vague outline of an ever-moving crowd.  Many men did not enter the theater at once but stayed outside to talk while finishing their cigars under the rays of the line of gas jets, which shed a sallow pallor on their faces and silhouetted their short black shadows on the asphalt. Mignon, a very tall, very broad fellow, with the square-shaped head of a strong man at a fair, was forcing a passage through the midst of the groups and dragging on his arm the banker Steiner, an exceedingly small man with a corporation already in evidence and a round face framed in a setting of beard which was already growing gray. &quot;Well,&quot; said Bordenave to the banker, &quot;you met her yesterday in my office.&quot; &quot;Ah!  It was she, was it?&quot; ejaculated Steiner.  &quot;I suspected as much.  Only I was coming out as she was going in, and I scarcely caught a glimpse of her.&quot; Mignon was listening with half-closed eyelids and nervously twisting a great diamond ring round his finger.  He had quite understood that Nana was in question.  Then as Bordenave was drawing a portrait of his new star, which lit a flame in the eyes of the banker, he ended by joining in the conversation. &quot;Oh, let her alone, my dear fellow; she&#x27;s a low lot!  The public will show her the door in quick time.  Steiner, my laddie, you know that my wife is waiting for you in her box.&quot; He wanted to take possession of him again.  But Steiner would not quit Bordenave.  In front of them a stream of people was crowding and crushing against the ticket office, and there was a din of voices, in the midst of which the name of Nana sounded with all the melodious vivacity of its two syllables.  The men who stood planted in front of the notices kept spelling it out loudly; others, in an interrogative tone, uttered it as they passed; while the women, at once restless and smiling, repeated it softly with an air of surprise.  Nobody knew Nana.  Whence had Nana fallen?  And stories and jokes, whispered from ear to ear, went the round of the crowd. The name was a caress in itself; it was a pet name, the very familiarity of which suited every lip.  Merely through enunciating it thus, the throng worked itself into a state of gaiety and became highly good natured.  A fever of curiosity urged it forward, that kind of Parisian curiosity which is as violent as an access of positive unreason.  Everybody wanted to see Nana.  A lady had the flounce of her dress torn off; a man lost his hat. &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re asking me too many questions about it!&quot; cried Bordenave, whom a score of men were besieging with their queries.  &quot;You&#x27;re going to see her, and I&#x27;m off; they want me.&quot; He disappeared, enchanted at having fired his public.  Mignon shrugged his shoulders, reminding Steiner that Rose was awaiting him in order to show him the costume she was about to wear in the first act. &quot;By Jove!  There&#x27;s Lucy out there, getting down from her carriage,&quot; said La Faloise to Fauchery. It was, in fact, Lucy Stewart, a plain little woman, some forty years old, with a disproportionately long neck, a thin, drawn face, a heavy mouth, but withal of such brightness, such graciousness of manner, that she was really very charming.  She was bringing with her Caroline Hequet and her mother--Caroline a woman of a cold type of beauty, the mother a person of a most worthy demeanor, who looked as if she were stuffed with straw. &quot;You&#x27;re coming with us?  I&#x27;ve kept a place for you,&quot; she said to Fauchery.  &quot;Oh, decidedly not!  To see nothing!&quot; he made answer. &quot;I&#x27;ve a stall; I prefer being in the stalls.&quot; Lucy grew nettled.  Did he not dare show himself in her company? Then, suddenly restraining herself and skipping to another topic: &quot;Why haven&#x27;t you told me that you knew Nana?&quot; &quot;Nana!  I&#x27;ve never set eyes on her.&quot; &quot;Honor bright?  I&#x27;ve been told that you&#x27;ve been to bed with her.&quot; But Mignon, coming in front of them, his finger to his lips, made them a sign to be silent.  And when Lucy questioned him he pointed out a young man who was passing and murmured: &quot;Nana&#x27;s fancy man.&quot; Everybody looked at him.  He was a pretty fellow.  Fauchery recognized him; it was Daguenet, a young man who had run through three hundred thousand francs in the pursuit of women and who now was dabbling in stocks, in order from time to time to treat them to bouquets and dinners.  Lucy made the discovery that he had fine eyes. &quot;Ah, there&#x27;s Blanche!&quot; she cried.  &quot;It&#x27;s she who told me that you had been to bed with Nana.&quot; Blanche de Sivry, a great fair girl, whose good-looking face showed signs of growing fat, made her appearance in the company of a spare, sedulously well-groomed and extremely distinguished man. &quot;The Count Xavier de Vandeuvres,&quot; Fauchery whispered in his companion&#x27;s ear. The count and the journalist shook hands, while Blanche and Lucy entered into a brisk, mutual explanation.  One of them in blue, the other in rose-pink, they stood blocking the way with their deeply flounced skirts, and Nana&#x27;s name kept repeating itself so shrilly in their conversation that people began to listen to them.  The Count de Vandeuvres carried Blanche off.  But by this time Nana&#x27;s name was echoing more loudly than ever round the four walls of the entrance hall amid yearnings sharpened by delay.  Why didn&#x27;t the play begin? The men pulled out their watches; late-comers sprang from their conveyances before these had fairly drawn up; the groups left the sidewalk, where the passers-by were crossing the now-vacant space of gaslit pavement, craning their necks, as they did so, in order to get a peep into the theater.  A street boy came up whistling and planted himself before a notice at the door, then cried out, &quot;Woa, Nana!&quot; in the voice of a tipsy man and hied on his way with a rolling gait and a shuffling of his old boots.  A laugh had arisen at this.  Gentlemen of unimpeachable appearance repeated: &quot;Nana, woa, Nana!&quot;  People were crushing; a dispute arose at the ticket office, and there was a growing clamor caused by the hum of voices calling on Nana, demanding Nana in one of those accesses of silly facetiousness and sheer animalism which pass over mobs. But above all the din the bell that precedes the rise of the curtain became audible.  &quot;They&#x27;ve rung; they&#x27;ve rung!&quot;  The rumor reached the boulevard, and thereupon followed a stampede, everyone wanting to pass in, while the servants of the theater increased their forces.  Mignon, with an anxious air, at last got hold of Steiner again, the latter not having been to see Rose&#x27;s costume.  At the very first tinkle of the bell La Faloise had cloven a way through the crowd, pulling Fauchery with him, so as not to miss the opening scene.  But all this eagerness on the part of the public irritated Lucy Stewart.  What brutes were these people to be pushing women like that!  She stayed in the rear of them all with Caroline Hequet and her mother.  The entrance hall was now empty, while beyond it was still heard the long-drawn rumble of the boulevard. &quot;As though they were always funny, those pieces of theirs!&quot; Lucy kept repeating as she climbed the stair. In the house Fauchery and La Faloise, in front of their stalls, were gazing about them anew.  By this time the house was resplendent. High jets of gas illumined the great glass chandelier with a rustling of yellow and rosy flames, which rained down a stream of brilliant light from dome to floor.  The cardinal velvets of the seats were shot with hues of lake, while all the gilding shonc again, the soft green decorations chastening its effect beneath the too-decided paintings of the ceiling.  The footlights were turned up and with a vivid flood of brilliance lit up the curtain, the heavy purple drapery of which had all the richness befitting a palace in a fairy tale and contrasted with the meanness of the proscenium, where cracks showed the plaster under the gilding.  The place was already warm.  At their music stands the orchestra were tuning their instruments amid a delicate trilling of flutes, a stifled tooting of horns, a singing of violin notes, which floated forth amid the increasing uproar of voices.  All the spectators were talking, jostling, settling themselves in a general assault upon seats; and the hustling rush in the side passages was now so violent that every door into the house was laboriously admitting the inexhaustible flood of people.  There were signals, rustlings of fabrics, a continual march past of skirts and head dresses, accentuated by the black hue of a dress coat or a surtout.  Notwithstanding this, the rows of seats were little by little getting filled up, while here and there a light toilet stood out from its surroundings, a head with a delicate profile bent forward under its chignon, where flashed the lightning of a jewel.  In one of the boxes the tip of a bare shoulder glimmered like snowy silk.  Other ladies, sitting at ease, languidly fanned themselves, following with their gaze the pushing movements of the crowd, while young gentlemen, standing up in the stalls, their waistcoats cut very low, gardenias in their buttonholes, pointed their opera glasses with gloved finger tips. It was now that the two cousins began searching for the faces of those they knew.  Mignon and Steiner were together in a lower box, sitting side by side with their arms leaning for support on the velvet balustrade.  Blanche de Sivry seemed to be in sole possession of a stage box on the level of the stalls.  But La Faloise examined Daguenet before anyone else, he being in occupation of a stall two rows in front of his own.  Close to him, a very young man, seventeen years old at the outside, some truant from college, it may be, was straining wide a pair of fine eyes such as a cherub might have owned.  Fauchery smiled when he looked at him. &quot;Who is that lady in the balcony?&quot; La Faloise asked suddenly.  &quot;The lady with a young girl in blue beside her.&quot; He pointed out a large woman who was excessively tight-laced, a woman who had been a blonde and had now become white and yellow of tint, her broad face, reddened with paint, looking puffy under a rain of little childish curls. &quot;It&#x27;s Gaga,&quot; was Fauchery&#x27;s simple reply, and as this name seemed to astound his cousin, he added: &quot;You don&#x27;t know Gaga?  She was the delight of the early years of Louis Philippe.  Nowadays she drags her daughter about with her wherever she goes.&quot; La Faloise never once glanced at the young girl.  The sight of Gaga moved him; his eyes did not leave her again.  He still found her very good looking but he dared not say so. Meanwhile the conductor lifted his violin bow and the orchestra attacked the overture.  People still kept coming in; the stir and noise were on the increase.  Among that public, peculiar to first nights and never subject to change, there were little subsections composed of intimate friends, who smilingly forgathered again.  Old first-nighters, hat on head, seemed familiar and quite at ease and kept exchanging salutations.  All Paris was there, the Paris of literature, of finance and of pleasure.  There were many journalists, several authors, a number of stock-exchange people and more courtesans than honest women.  It was a singularly mixed world, composed, as it was, of all the talents and tarnished by all the vices, a world where the same fatigue and the same fever played over every face.  Fauchery, whom his cousin was questioning, showed him the boxes devoted to the newspapers and to the clubs and then named the dramatic critics--a lean, dried-up individual with thin, spiteful lips and, chief of all, a big fellow with a good-natured expression, lolling on the shoulder of his neighbor, a young miss over whom he brooded with tender and paternal eyes. But he interrupted himself on seeing La Faloise in the act of bowing to some persons who occupied the box opposite.  He appeared surprised. &quot;What?&quot; he queried.  &quot;You know the Count Muffat de Beuville?&quot; &quot;Oh, for a long time back,&quot; replied Hector.  &quot;The Muffats had a property near us.  I often go to their house.  The count&#x27;s with his wife and his father-in-law, the Marquis de Chouard.&quot; And with some vanity--for he was happy in his cousin&#x27;s astonishment-- he entered into particulars.  The marquis was a councilor of state; the count had recently been appointed chamberlain to the empress. Fauchery, who had caught up his opera glass, looked at the countess, a plump brunette with a white skin and fine dark eyes. &quot;You shall present me to them between the acts,&quot; he ended by saying. &quot;I have already met the count, but I should like to go to them on their Tuesdays.&quot; Energetic cries of &quot;Hush&quot; came from the upper galleries.  The overture had begun, but people were still coming in.  Late arrivals were obliging whole rows of spectators to rise; the doors of boxes were banging; loud voices were heard disputing in the passages.  And there was no cessation of the sound of many conversations, a sound similar to the loud twittering of talkative sparrows at close of day.  All was in confusion; the house was a medley of heads and arms which moved to and fro, their owners seating themselves or trying to make themselves comfortable or, on the other hand, excitedly endeavoring to remain standing so as to take a final look round. The cry of &quot;Sit down, sit down!&quot; came fiercely from the obscure depths of the pit.  A shiver of expectation traversed the house: at last people were going to make the acquaintance of this famous Nana with whom Paris had been occupying itself for a whole week! Little by little, however, the buzz of talk dwindled softly down among occasional fresh outbursts of rough speech.  And amid this swooning murmur, these perishing sighs of sound, the orchestra struck up the small, lively notes of a waltz with a vagabond rhythm bubbling with roguish laughter.  The public were titillated; they were already on the grin.  But the gang of clappers in the foremost rows of the pit applauded furiously.  The curtain rose. &quot;By George!&quot; exclaimed La Faloise, still talking away.  &quot;There&#x27;s a man with Lucy.&quot; He was looking at the stage box on the second tier to his right, the front of which Caroline and Lucy were occupying.  At the back of this box were observable the worthy countenance of Caroline&#x27;s mother and the side face of a tall young man with a noble head of light hair and an irreproachable getup. &quot;Do look!&quot; La Faloise again insisted.  &quot;There&#x27;s a man there.&quot; Fauchery decided to level his opera glass at the stage box.  But he turned round again directly. &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s Labordette,&quot; he muttered in a careless voice, as though that gentle man&#x27;s presence ought to strike all the world as though both natural and immaterial. Behind the cousins people shouted &quot;Silence!&quot;  They had to cease talking.  A motionless fit now seized the house, and great stretches of heads, all erect and attentive, sloped away from stalls to topmost gallery.  The first act of the Blonde Venus took place in Olympus, a pasteboard Olympus, with clouds in the wings and the throne of Jupiter on the right of the stage.  First of all Iris and Ganymede, aided by a troupe of celestial attendants, sang a chorus while they arranged the seats of the gods for the council.  Once again the prearranged applause of the clappers alone burst forth; the public, a little out of their depth, sat waiting.  Nevertheless, La Faloise had clapped Clarisse Besnus, one of Bordenave&#x27;s little women, who played Iris in a soft blue dress with a great scarf of the seven colors of the rainbow looped round her waist. &quot;You know, she draws up her chemise to put that on,&quot; he said to Fauchery, loud enough to be heard by those around him.  &quot;We tried the trick this morning.  It was all up under her arms and round the small of her back.&quot; But a slight rustling movement ran through the house; Rose Mignon had just come on the stage as Diana.  Now though she had neither the face nor the figure for the part, being thin and dark and of the adorable type of ugliness peculiar to a Parisian street child, she nonetheless appeared charming and as though she were a satire on the personage she represented.  Her song at her entrance on the stage was full of lines quaint enough to make you cry with laughter and of complaints about Mars, who was getting ready to desert her for the companionship of Venus.  She sang it with a chaste reserve so full of sprightly suggestiveness that the public warmed amain.  The husband and Steiner, sitting side by side, were laughing complaisantly, and the whole house broke out in a roar when Prulliere, that great favorite, appeared as a general, a masquerade Mars, decked with an enormous plume and dragging along a sword, the hilt of which reached to his shoulder.  As for him, he had had enough of Diana; she had been a great deal too coy with him, he averred.  Thereupon Diana promised to keep a sharp eye on him and to be revenged.  The duet ended with a comic yodel which Prulliere delivered very amusingly with the yell of an angry tomcat.  He had about him all the entertaining fatuity of a young leading gentleman whose love affairs prosper, and he rolled around the most swaggering glances, which excited shrill feminine laughter in the boxes. Then the public cooled again, for the ensuing scenes were found tiresome.  Old Bosc, an imbecile Jupiter with head crushed beneath the weight of an immense crown, only just succeeded in raising a smile among his audience when he had a domestic altercation with Juno on the subject of the cook&#x27;s accounts.  The march past of the gods, Neptune, Pluto, Minerva and the rest, was well-nigh spoiling everything.  People grew impatient; there was a restless, slowly growing murmur; the audience ceased to take an interest in the performance and looked round at the house.  Lucy began laughing with Labordette; the Count de Vandeuvres was craning his neck in conversation behind Blanche&#x27;s sturdy shoulders, while Fauchery, out of the corners of his eyes, took stock of the Muffats, of whom the count appeared very serious, as though he had not understood the allusions, and the countess smiled vaguely, her eyes lost in reverie.  But on a sudden, in this uncomfortable state of things, the applause of the clapping contingent rattled out with the regularity of platoon firing.  People turned toward the stage.  Was it Nana at last?  This Nana made one wait with a vengeance. It was a deputation of mortals whom Ganymede and Iris had introduced, respectable middle-class persons, deceived husbands, all of them, and they came before the master of the gods to proffer a complaint against Venus, who was assuredly inflaming their good ladies with an excess of ardor.  The chorus, in quaint, dolorous tones, broken by silences full of pantomimic admissions, caused great amusement.  A neat phrase went the round of the house: &quot;The cuckolds&#x27; chorus, the cuckolds&#x27; chorus,&quot; and it &quot;caught on,&quot; for there was an encore. The singers&#x27; heads were droll; their faces were discovered to be in keeping with the phrase, especially that of a fat man which was as round as the moon.  Meanwhile Vulcan arrived in a towering rage, demanding back his wife who had slipped away three days ago.  The chorus resumed their plaint, calling on Vulcan, the god of the cuckolds.  Vulcan&#x27;s part was played by Fontan, a comic actor of talent, at once vulgar and original, and he had a role of the wildest whimsicality and was got up as a village blacksmith, fiery red wig, bare arms tattooed with arrow-pierced hearts and all the rest of it.  A woman&#x27;s voice cried in a very high key, &quot;Oh, isn&#x27;t he ugly?&quot; and all the ladies laughed and applauded. Then followed a scene which seemed interminable.  Jupiter in the course of it seemed never to be going to finish assembling the Council of Gods in order to submit thereto the deceived husband&#x27;s requests.  And still no Nana!  Was the management keeping Nana for the fall of the curtain then?  So long a period of expectancy had ended by annoying the public.  Their murmurings began again. &quot;It&#x27;s going badly,&quot; said Mignon radiantly to Steiner.  &quot;She&#x27;ll get a pretty reception; you&#x27;ll see!&quot; At that very moment the clouds at the back of the stage were cloven apart and Venus appeared.  Exceedingly tall, exceedingly strong, for her eighteen years, Nana, in her goddess&#x27;s white tunic and with her light hair simply flowing unfastened over her shoulders, came down to the footlights with a quiet certainty of movement and a laugh of greeting for the public and struck up her grand ditty: &quot;When Venus roams at eventide.&quot; From the second verse onward people looked at each other all over the house.  Was this some jest, some wager on Bordenave&#x27;s part? Never had a more tuneless voice been heard or one managed with less art.  Her manager judged of her excellently; she certainly sang like a squirt.  Nay, more, she didn&#x27;t even know how to deport herself on the stage: she thrust her arms in front of her while she swayed her whole body to and fro in a manner which struck the audience as unbecoming and disagreeable.  Cries of &quot;Oh, oh!&quot; were already rising in the pit and the cheap places.  There was a sound of whistling, too, when a voice in the stalls, suggestive of a molting cockerel, cried out with great conviction: &quot;That&#x27;s very smart!&quot; All the house looked round.  It was the cherub, the truant from the boardingschool, who sat with his fine eyes very wide open and his fair face glowing very hotly at sight of Nana.  When he saw everybody turning toward him be grew extremely red at the thought of having thus unconsciously spoken aloud.  Daguenet, his neighbor, smilingly examined him; the public laughed, as though disarmed and no longer anxious to hiss; while the young gentlemen in white gloves, fascinated in their turn by Nana&#x27;s gracious contours, lolled back in their seats and applauded. &quot;That&#x27;s it!  Well done!  Bravo!&quot; Nana, in the meantime, seeing the house laughing, began to laugh herself.  The gaiety of all redoubled itself.  She was an amusing creature, all the same, was that fine girl!  Her laughter made a love of a little dimple appear in her chin.  She stood there waiting, not bored in the least, familiar with her audience, falling into step with them at once, as though she herself were admitting with a wink that she had not two farthings&#x27; worth of talent but that it did not matter at all, that, in fact, she had other good points. And then after having made a sign to the conductor which plainly signified, &quot;Go ahead, old boy!&quot; she began her second verse: &quot;&#x27;Tis Venus who at midnight passes--&quot; Still the same acidulated voice, only that now it tickled the public in the right quarter so deftly that momentarily it caused them to give a little shiver of pleasure.  Nana still smiled her smile: it lit up her little red mouth and shone in her great eyes, which were of the clearest blue.  When she came to certain rather lively verses a delicate sense of enjoyment made her tilt her nose, the rosy nostrils of which lifted and fell, while a bright flush suffused her cheeks.  She still swung herself up and down, for she only knew how to do that.  And the trick was no longer voted ugly; on the contrary, the men raised their opera glasses.  When she came to the end of a verse her voice completely failed her, and she was well aware that she never would get through with it.  Thereupon, rather than fret herself, she kicked up her leg, which forthwith was roundly outlined under her diaphanous tunic, bent sharply backward, so that her bosom was thrown upward and forward, and stretched her arms out.  Applause burst forth on all sides.  In the twinkling of an eye she had turned on her heel and was going up the stage, presenting the nape of her neck to the spectators&#x27; gaze, a neck where the red-gold hair showed like some animal&#x27;s fell.  Then the plaudits became frantic. The close of the act was not so exciting.  Vulcan wanted to slap Venus.  The gods held a consultation and decided to go and hold an inquiry on earth before granting the deceived husband satisfaction. It was then that Diana surprised a tender conversation between Venus and Mars and vowed that she would not take her eyes off them during the whole of the voyage.  There was also a scene where Love, played by a little twelve-year-old chit, answered every question put to her with &quot;Yes, Mamma!  No, Mamma!&quot; in a winy-piny tone, her fingers in her nose.  At last Jupiter, with the severity of a master who is growing cross, shut Love up in a dark closet, bidding her conjugate the verb &quot;I love&quot; twenty times.  The finale was more appreciated: it was a chorus which both troupe and orchestra performed with great brilliancy.  But the curtain once down, the clappers tried in vain to obtain a call, while the whole house was already up and making for the doors. The crowd trampled and jostled, jammed, as it were, between the rows of seats, and in so doing exchanged expressions.  One phrase only went round: &quot;It&#x27;s idiotic.&quot;  A critic was saying that it would be one&#x27;s duty to do a pretty bit of slashing.  The piece, however, mattered very little, for people were talking about Nana before everything else. Fauchery and La Faloise, being among the earliest to emerge, met Steiner and Mignon in the passage outside the stalls.  In this gaslit gut of a place, which was as narrow and circumscribed as a gallery in a mine, one was well-nigh suffocated.  They stopped a moment at the foot of the stairs on the right of the house, protected by the final curve of the balusters.  The audience from the cheap places were coming down the steps with a continuous tramp of heavy boots; a stream of black dress coats was passing, while an attendant was making every possible effort to protect a chair, on which she had piled up coats and cloaks, from the onward pushing of the crowd. &quot;Surely I know her,&quot; cried Steiner, the moment he perceived Fauchery.  &quot;I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ve seen her somewhere--at the casino, I imagine, and she got herself taken up there--she was so drunk.&quot; &quot;As for me,&quot; said the journalist, &quot;I don&#x27;t quite know where it was. I am like you; I certainly have come across her.&quot; He lowered his voice and asked, laughing: &quot;At the Tricons&#x27;, perhaps.&quot; &quot;Egad, it was in a dirty place,&quot; Mignon declared.  He seemed exasperated.  &quot;It&#x27;s disgusting that the public give such a reception to the first trollop that comes by.  There&#x27;ll soon be no more decent women on the stage.  Yes, I shall end by forbidding Rose to play.&quot; Fauchery could not restrain a smile.  Meanwhile the downward shuffle of the heavy shoes on the steps did not cease, and a little man in a workman&#x27;s cap was heard crying in a drawling voice: &quot;Oh my, she ain&#x27;t no wopper!  There&#x27;s some pickings there!&quot; In the passage two young men, delicately curled and formally resplendent in turndown collars and the rest, were disputing together.  One of them was repeating the words, &quot;Beastly, beastly!&quot; without stating any reasons; the other was replying with the words, &quot;Stunning, stunning!&quot; as though he, too, disdained all argument. La Faloise declared her to be quite the thing; only he ventured to opine that she would be better still if she were to cultivate her voice.  Steiner, who was no longer listening, seemed to awake with a start.  Whatever happens, one must wait, he thought.  Perhaps everything will be spoiled in the following acts.  The public had shown complaisance, but it was certainly not yet taken by storm. Mignon swore that the piece would never finish, and when Fauchery and La Faloise left them in order to go up to the foyer he took Steiner&#x27;s arm and, leaning hard against his shoulder, whispered in his ear: &quot;You&#x27;re going to see my wife&#x27;s costume for the second act, old fellow.  It IS just blackguardly.&quot; Upstairs in the foyer three glass chandeliers burned with a brilliant light.  The two cousins hesitated an instant before entering, for the widely opened glazed doors afforded a view right through the gallery--a view of a surging sea of heads, which two currents, as it were, kept in a continuous eddying movement.  But they entered after all.  Five or six groups of men, talking very loudly and gesticulating, were obstinately discussing the play amid these violent interruptions; others were filing round, their heels, as they turned, sounding sharply on the waxed floor.  To right and left, between columns of variegated imitation marble, women were sitting on benches covered with red velvet and viewing the passing movement of the crowd with an air of fatigue as though the heat had rendered them languid.  In the lofty mirrors behind them one saw the reflection of their chignons.  At the end of the room, in front of the bar, a man with a huge corporation was drinking a glass of fruit syrup. But Fauchery, in order to breathe more freely, had gone to the balcony.  La Faloise, who was studying the photographs of actresses hung in frames alternating with the mirrors between the columns, ended by following him.  They had extinguished the line of gas jets on the facade of the theater, and it was dark and very cool on the balcony, which seemed to them unoccupied.  Solitary and enveloped in shadow, a young man was standing, leaning his arms on the stone balustrade, in the recess to the right.  He was smoking a cigarette, of which the burning end shone redly.  Fauchery recognized Daguenet. They shook hands warmly. &quot;What are you after there, my dear fellow?&quot; asked the journalist. &quot;You&#x27;re hiding yourself in holes and crannies--you, a man who never leaves the stalls on a first night!&quot; &quot;But I&#x27;m smoking, you see,&quot; replied Daguenet. Then Fauchery, to put him out of countenance: &quot;Well, well!  What&#x27;s your opinion of the new actress?  She&#x27;s being roughly handled enough in the passages.&quot; &quot;Bah!&quot; muttered Daguenet.  &quot;They&#x27;re people whom she&#x27;ll have had nothing to do with!&quot; That was the sum of his criticism of Nana&#x27;s talent.  La Faloise leaned forward and looked down at the boulevard.  Over against them the windows of a hotel and of a club were brightly lit up, while on the pavement below a dark mass of customers occupied the tables of the Cafe de Madrid.  Despite the lateness of the hour the crowd were still crushing and being crushed; people were advancing with shortened step; a throng was constantly emerging from the Passage Jouffroy; individuals stood waiting five or six minutes before they could cross the roadway, to such a distance did the string of carriages extend. &quot;What a moving mass!  And what a noise!&quot; La Faloise kept reiterating, for Paris still astonished him. The bell rang for some time; the foyer emptied.  There was a hurrying of people in the passages.  The curtain was already up when whole bands of spectators re-entered the house amid the irritated expressions of those who were once more in their places.  Everyone took his seat again with an animated look and renewed attention.  La Faloise directed his first glance in Gaga&#x27;s direction, but he was dumfounded at seeing by her side the tall fair man who but recently had been in Lucy&#x27;s stage box. &quot;What IS that man&#x27;s name?&quot; he asked. Fauchery failed to observe him. &quot;Ah yes, it&#x27;s Labordette,&quot; he said at last with the same careless movement.  The scenery of the second act came as a surprise.  It represented a suburban Shrove Tuesday dance at the Boule Noire. Masqueraders were trolling a catch, the chorus of which was accompanied with a tapping of their heels.  This &#x27;Arryish departure, which nobody had in the least expected, caused so much amusement that the house encored the catch.  And it was to this entertainment that the divine band, let astray by Iris, who falsely bragged that he knew the Earth well, were now come in order to proceed with their inquiry.  They had put on disguises so as to preserve their incognito.  Jupiter came on the stage as King Dagobert, with his breeches inside out and a huge tin crown on his head.  Phoebus appeared as the Postillion of Lonjumeau and Minerva as a Norman nursemaid.  Loud bursts of merriment greeted Mars, who wore an outrageous uniform, suggestive of an Alpine admiral.  But the shouts of laughter became uproarious when Neptune came in view, clad in a blouse, a high, bulging workman&#x27;s cap on his head, lovelocks glued to his temples.  Shuffling along in slippers, he cried in a thick brogue. &quot;Well, I&#x27;m blessed!  When ye&#x27;re a masher it&#x27;ll never do not to let &#x27;em love yer!&quot; There were some shouts of &quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; while the ladies held their fans one degree higher.  Lucy in her stage box laughed so obstreperously that Caroline Hequet silenced her with a tap of her fan. From that moment forth the piece was saved--nay, more, promised a great success.  This carnival of the gods, this dragging in the mud of their Olympus, this mock at a whole religion, a whole world of poetry, appeared in the light of a royal entertainment.  The fever of irreverence gained the literary first-night world: legend was trampled underfoot; ancient images were shattered.  Jupiter&#x27;s make- up was capital.  Mars was a success.  Royalty became a farce and the army a thing of folly.  When Jupiter, grown suddenly amorous of a little laundress, began to knock off a mad cancan, Simonne, who was playing the part of the laundress, launched a kick at the master of the immortals&#x27; nose and addressed him so drolly as &quot;My big daddy!&quot; that an immoderate fit of laughter shook the whole house.  While they were dancing Phoebus treated Minerva to salad bowls of negus, and Neptune sat in state among seven or eight women who regaled him with cakes.  Allusions were eagerly caught; indecent meanings were attached to them; harmless phrases were diverted from their proper significations in the light of exclamations issuing from the stalls. For a long time past the theatrical public had not wallowed in folly more irreverent.  It rested them. Nevertheless, the action of the piece advanced amid these fooleries. Vulcan, as an elegant young man clad, down to his gloves, entirely in yellow and with an eyeglass stuck in his eye, was forever running after Venus, who at last made her appearance as a fishwife, a kerchief on her head and her bosom, covered with big gold trinkets, in great evidence.  Nana was so white and plump and looked so natural in a part demanding wide hips and a voluptuous mouth that she straightway won the whole house.  On her account Rose Mignon was forgotten, though she was made up as a delicious baby, with a wicker-work burlet on her head and a short muslin frock and had just sighed forth Diana&#x27;s plaints in a sweetly pretty voice.  The other one, the big wench who slapped her thighs and clucked like a hen, shed round her an odor of life, a sovereign feminine charm, with which the public grew intoxicated.  From the second act onward everything was permitted her.  She might hold herself awkwardly; she might fail to sing some note in tune; she might forget her words--it mattered not: she had only to turn and laugh to raise shouts of applause.  When she gave her famous kick from the hip the stalls were fired, and a glow of passion rose upward, upward, from gallery to gallery, till it reached the gods.  It was a triumph, too, when she led the dance.  She was at home in that: hand on hip, she enthroned Venus in the gutter by the pavement side.  And the music seemed made for her plebeian voice--shrill, piping music, with reminiscences of Saint-Cloud Fair, wheezings of clarinets and playful trills on the part of the little flutes. Two numbers were again encored.  The opening waltz, that waltz with the naughty rhythmic beat, had returned and swept the gods with it. Juno, as a peasant woman, caught Jupiter and his little laundress cleverly and boxed his ears.  Diana, surprising Venus in the act of making an assignation with Mars, made haste to indicate hour and place to Vulcan, who cried, &quot;I&#x27;ve hit on a plan!&quot;  The rest of the act did not seem very clear.  The inquiry ended in a final galop after which Jupiter, breathless, streaming with perspiration and minus his crown, declared that the little women of Earth were delicious and that the men were all to blame. The curtain was falling, when certain voices, rising above the storm of bravos, cried uproariously: &quot;All!  All!&quot; Thereupon the curtain rose again; the artistes reappeared hand in hand.  In the middle of the line Nana and Rose Mignon stood side by side, bowing and curtsying.  The audience applauded; the clappers shouted acclamations.  Then little by little the house emptied. &quot;I must go and pay my respects to the Countess Muffat,&quot; said La Faloise.  &quot;Exactly so; you&#x27;ll present me,&quot; replied Fauchery; &quot;we&#x27;ll go down afterward.&quot; But it was not easy to get to the first-tier boxes.  In the passage at the top of the stairs there was a crush.  In order to get forward at all among the various groups you had to make yourself small and to slide along, using your elbows in so doing.  Leaning under a copper lamp, where a jet of gas was burning, the bulky critic was sitting in judgment on the piece in presence of an attentive circle. People in passing mentioned his name to each other in muttered tones.  He had laughed the whole act through--that was the rumor going the round of the passages--nevertheless, he was now very severe and spoke of taste and morals.  Farther off the thin-lipped critic was brimming over with a benevolence which had an unpleasant aftertaste, as of milk turned sour. Fauchery glanced along, scrutinizing the boxes through the round openings in each door.  But the Count de Vandeuvres stopped him with a question, and when he was informed that the two cousins were going to pay their respects to the Muffats, he pointed out to them box seven, from which he had just emerged.  Then bending down and whispering in the journalist&#x27;s ear: &quot;Tell me, my dear fellow,&quot; he said, &quot;this Nana--surely she&#x27;s the girl we saw one evening at the corner of the Rue de Provence?&quot; &quot;By Jove, you&#x27;re right!&quot; cried Fauchery.  &quot;I was saying that I had come across her!&quot; La Faloise presented his cousin to Count Muffat de Beuville, who appeared very frigid.  But on hearing the name Fauchery the countess raised her head and with a certain reserve complimented the paragraphist on his articles in the Figaro.  Leaning on the velvet- covered support in front of her, she turned half round with a pretty movement of the shoulders.  They talked for a short time, and the Universal Exhibition was mentioned. &quot;It will be very fine,&quot; said the count, whose square-cut, regular- featured face retained a certain gravity. &quot;I visited the Champ de Mars today and returned thence truly astonished.&quot; &quot;They say that things won&#x27;t be ready in time,&quot; La Faloise ventured to remark.  &quot;There&#x27;s infinite confusion there--&quot; But the count interrupted him in his severe voice: &quot;Things will be ready.  The emperor desires it.&quot; Fauchery gaily recounted how one day, when he had gone down thither in search of a subject for an article, he had come near spending all his time in the aquarium, which was then in course of construction. The countess smiled.  Now and again she glanced down at the body of the house, raising an arm which a white glove covered to the elbow and fanning herself with languid hand.  The house dozed, almost deserted.  Some gentlemen in the stalls had opened out newspapers, and ladies received visits quite comfortably, as though they were at their own homes.  Only a well-bred whispering was audible under the great chandelier, the light of which was softened in the fine cloud of dust raised by the confused movements of the interval.  At the different entrances men were crowding in order to talk to ladies who remained seated.  They stood there motionless for a few seconds, craning forward somewhat and displaying the great white bosoms of their shirt fronts. &quot;We count on you next Tuesday,&quot; said the countess to La Faloise, and she invited Fauchery, who bowed. Not a word was said of the play; Nana&#x27;s name was not once mentioned. The count was so glacially dignified that he might have been supposed to be taking part at a sitting of the legislature.  In order to explain their presence that evening he remarked simply that his father-in-law was fond of the theater.  The door of the box must have remained open, for the Marquis de Chouard, who had gone out in order to leave his seat to the visitors, was back again.  He was straightening up his tall, old figure.  His face looked soft and white under a broad-brimmed hat, and with his restless eyes he followed the movements of the women who passed. The moment the countess had given her invitation Fauchery took his leave, feeling that to talk about the play would not be quite the thing.  La Faloise was the last to quit the box.  He had just noticed the fair-haired Labordette, comfortably installed in the Count de Vandeuvres&#x27;s stage box and chatting at very close quarters with Blanche de Sivry. &quot;Gad,&quot; he said after rejoining his cousin, &quot;that Labordette knows all the girls then!  He&#x27;s with Blanche now.&quot; &quot;Doubtless he knows them all,&quot; replied Fauchery quietly.  &quot;What d&#x27;you want to be taken for, my friend?&quot; The passage was somewhat cleared of people, and Fauchery was just about to go downstairs when Lucy Stewart called him.  She was quite at the other end of the corridor, at the door of her stage box. They were getting cooked in there, she said, and she took up the whole corridor in company with Caroline Hequet and her mother, all three nibbling burnt almonds.  A box opener was chatting maternally with them.  Lucy fell out with the journalist.  He was a pretty fellow; to be sure!  He went up to see other women and didn&#x27;t even come and ask if they were thirsty!  Then, changing the subject: &quot;You know, dear boy, I think Nana very nice.&quot; She wanted him to stay in the stage box for the last act, but he made his escape, promising to catch them at the door afterward. Downstairs in front of the theater Fauchery and La Faloise lit cigarettes.  A great gathering blocked the sidewalk, a stream of men who had come down from the theater steps and were inhaling the fresh night air in the boulevards, where the roar and battle had diminished. Meanwhile Mignon had drawn Steiner away to the Cafe des Varietes. Seeing Nana&#x27;s success, he had set to work to talk enthusiastically about her, all the while observing the banker out of the corners of his eyes.  He knew him well; twice he had helped him to deceive Rose and then, the caprice being over, had brought him back to her, faithful and repentant.  In the cafe the too numerous crowd of customers were squeezing themselves round the marble-topped tables. Several were standing up, drinking in a great hurry.  The tall mirrors reflected this thronging world of heads to infinity and magnified the narrow room beyond measure with its three chandeliers, its moleskin-covered seats and its winding staircase draped with red.  Steiner went and seated himself at a table in the first saloon, which opened full on the boulevard, its doors having been removed rather early for the time of year.  As Fauchery and La Faloise were passing the banker stopped them. &quot;Come and take a bock with us, eh?&quot; they said. But he was too preoccupied by an idea; he wanted to have a bouquet thrown to Nana.  At last he called a waiter belonging to the cafe, whom he familiarly addressed as Auguste.  Mignon, who was listening, looked at him so sharply that he lost countenance and stammered out: &quot;Two bouquets, Auguste, and deliver them to the attendant.  A bouquet for each of these ladies!  Happy thought, eh?&quot; At the other end of the saloon, her shoulders resting against the frame of a mirror, a girl, some eighteen years of age at the outside, was leaning motionless in front of her empty glass as though she had been benumbed by long and fruitless waiting.  Under the natural curls of her beautiful gray-gold hair a virginal face looked out at you with velvety eyes, which were at once soft and candid. She wore a dress of faded green silk and a round hat which blows had dinted.  The cool air of the night made her look very pale. &quot;Egad, there&#x27;s Satin,&quot; murmured Fauchery when his eye lit upon her. La Faloise questioned him.  Oh dear, yes, she was a streetwalker-- she didn&#x27;t count.  But she was such a scandalous sort that people amused themselves by making her talk.  And the journalist, raising his voice: &quot;What are you doing there, Satin?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m bogging,&quot; replied Satin quietly without changing position. The four men were charmed and fell a-laughing.  Mignon assured them that there was no need to hurry; it would take twenty minutes to set up the scenery for the third act.  But the two cousins, having drunk their beer, wanted to go up into the theater again; the cold was making itself felt.  Then Mignon remained alone with Steiner, put his elbows on the table and spoke to him at close quarters. &quot;It&#x27;s an understood thing, eh?  We are to go to her house, and I&#x27;m to introduce you.  You know the thing&#x27;s quite between ourselves--my wife needn&#x27;t know.&quot; Once more in their places, Fauchery and La Faloise noticed a pretty, quietly dressed woman in the second tier of boxes.  She was with a serious-looking gentleman, a chief clerk at the office of the Ministry of the Interior, whom La Faloise knew, having met him at the Muffats&#x27;.  As to Fauchery, he was under the impression that her name was Madame Robert, a lady of honorable repute who had a lover, only one, and that always a person of respectability. But they had to turn round, for Daguenet was smiling at them.  Now that Nana had had a success he no longer hid himself: indeed, he had just been scoring triumphs in the passages.  By his side was the young truant schoolboy, who had not quitted his seat, so stupefying was the state of admiration into which Nana had plunged him.  That was it, he thought; that was the woman!  And he blushed as he thought so and dragged his gloves on and off mechanically.  Then since his neighbor had spoken of Nana, he ventured to question him. &quot;Will you pardon me for asking you, sir, but that lady who is acting--do you know her?&quot; &quot;Yes, I do a little,&quot; murmured Daguenet with some surprise and hesitation. &quot;Then you know her address?&quot; The question, addressed as it was to him, came so abruptly that he felt inclined to respond with a box on the ear. &quot;No,&quot; he said in a dry tone of voice. And with that he turned his back.  The fair lad knew that he had just been guilty of some breach of good manners.  He blushed more hotly than ever and looked scared. The traditional three knocks were given, and among the returning throng, attendants, laden with pelisses and overcoats, bustled about at a great rate in order to put away people&#x27;s things.  The clappers applauded the scenery, which represented a grotto on Mount Etna, hollowed out in a silver mine and with sides glittering like new money.  In the background Vulcan&#x27;s forge glowed like a setting star. Diana, since the second act, had come to a good understanding with the god, who was to pretend that he was on a journey, so as to leave the way clear for Venus and Mars.  Then scarcely was Diana alone than Venus made her appearance.  A shiver of delight ran round the house.  Nana was nude.  With quiet audacity she appeared in her nakedness, certain of the sovereign power of her flesh.  Some gauze enveloped her, but her rounded shoulders, her Amazonian bosom, her wide hips, which swayed to and fro voluptuously, her whole body, in fact, could be divined, nay discerned, in all its foamlike whiteness of tint beneath the slight fabric she wore.  It was Venus rising from the waves with no veil save her tresses.  And when Nana lifted her arms the golden hairs in her armpits were observable in the glare of the footlights.  There was no applause.  Nobody laughed any more.  The men strained forward with serious faces, sharp features, mouths irritated and parched.  A wind seemed to have passed, a soft, soft wind, laden with a secret menace.  Suddenly in the bouncing child the woman stood discovered, a woman full of restless suggestion, who brought with her the delirium of sex and opened the gates of the unknown world of desire.  Nana was smiling still, but her smile was now bitter, as of a devourer of men. &quot;By God,&quot; said Fauchery quite simply to La Faloise. Mars in the meantime, with his plume of feathers, came hurrying to the trysting place and found himself between the two goddesses. Then ensued a passage which Prulliere played with great delicacy. Petted by Diana, who wanted to make a final attack upon his feelings before delivering him up to Vulcan, wheedled by Venus, whom the presence of her rival excited, he gave himself up to these tender delights with the beatified expression of a man in clover.  Finally a grand trio brought the scene to a close, and it was then that an attendant appeared in Lucy Stewart&#x27;s box and threw on the stage two immense bouquets of white lilacs.  There was applause; Nana and Rose Mignon bowed, while Prulliere picked up the bouquets.  Many of the occupants of the stalls turned smilingly toward the ground-floor occupied by Steiner and Mignon.  The banker, his face blood-red, was suffering from little convulsive twitchings of the chin, as though he had a stoppage in his throat. What followed took the house by storm completely.  Diana had gone off in a rage, and directly afterward, Venus, sitting on a moss-clad seat, called Mars to her.  Never yet had a more glowing scene of seduction been ventured on.  Nana, her arms round Prulliere&#x27;s neck, was drawing him toward her when Fontan, with comically furious mimicry and an exaggerated imitation of the face of an outraged husband who surprises his wife in FLAGRANTE DELICTO, appeared at the back of the grotto.  He was holding the famous net with iron meshes. For an instant he poised and swung it, as a fisherman does when he is going to make a cast, and by an ingenious twist Venus and Mars were caught in the snare; the net wrapped itself round them and held them motionless in the attitude of happy lovers. A murmur of applause swelled and swelled like a growing sigh.  There was some hand clapping, and every opera glass was fixed on Venus. Little by little Nana had taken possession of the public, and now every man was her slave. A wave of lust had flowed from her as from an excited animal, and its influence had spread and spread and spread till the whole house was possessed by it.  At that moment her slightest movement blew the flame of desire: with her little finger she ruled men&#x27;s flesh. Backs were arched and quivered as though unseen violin bows had been drawn across their muscles; upon men&#x27;s shoulders appeared fugitive hairs, which flew in air, blown by warm and wandering breaths, breathed one knew not from what feminine mouth.  In front of him Fauchery saw the truant schoolboy half lifted from his seat by passion.  Curiosity led him to look at the Count de Vandeuvres--he was extremely pale, and his lips looked pinched--at fat Steiner, whose face was purple to the verge of apoplexy; at Labordette, ogling away with the highly astonished air of a horse dealer admiring a perfectly shaped mare; at Daguenet, whose ears were blood-red and twitching with enjoyment.  Then a sudden idea made him glance behind, and he marveled at what he saw in the Muffats&#x27; box. Behind the countess, who was white and serious as usual, the count was sitting straight upright, with mouth agape and face mottled with red, while close by him, in the shadow, the restless eyes of the Marquis de Chouard had become catlike phosphorescent, full of golden sparkles.  The house was suffocating; people&#x27;s very hair grew heavy on their perspiring heads.  For three hours back the breath of the multitude had filled and heated the atmosphere with a scent of crowded humanity.  Under the swaying glare of the gas the dust clouds in mid-air had grown constantly denser as they hung motionless beneath the chandelier.  The whole house seemed to be oscillating, to be lapsing toward dizziness in its fatigue and excitement, full, as it was, of those drowsy midnight desires which flutter in the recesses of the bed of passion.  And Nana, in front of this languorous public, these fifteen hundred human beings thronged and smothered in the exhaustion and nervous exasperation which belong to the close of a spectacle, Nana still triumphed by right of her marble flesh and that sexual nature of hers, which was strong enough to destroy the whole crowd of her adorers and yet sustain no injury. The piece drew to a close.  In answer to Vulcan&#x27;s triumphant summons all the Olympians defiled before the lovers with ohs and ahs of stupefaction and gaiety.  Jupiter said, &quot;I think it is light conduct on your part, my son, to summon us to see such a sight as this.&quot; Then a reaction took place in favor of Venus.  The chorus of cuckolds was again ushered in by Iris and besought the master of the gods not to give effect to its petition, for since women had lived at home, domestic life was becoming impossible for the men: the latter preferred being deceived and happy.  That was the moral of the play.  Then Venus was set at liberty, and Vulcan obtained a partial divorce from her.  Mars was reconciled with Diana, and Jove, for the sake of domestic peace, packed his little laundress off into a constellation.  And finally they extricated Love from his black hole, where instead of conjugating the verb AMO he had been busy in the manufacture of &quot;dollies.&quot;  The curtain fell on an apotheosis, wherein the cuckolds&#x27; chorus knelt and sang a hymn of gratitude to Venus, who stood there with smiling lips, her stature enhanced by her sovereign nudity. The audience, already on their feet, were making for the exits.  The authors were mentioned, and amid a thunder of applause there were two calls before the curtain.  The shout of &quot;Nana! Nana!&quot; rang wildly forth.  Then no sooner was the house empty than it grew dark: the footlights went out; the chandelier was turned down; long strips of gray canvas slipped from the stage boxes and swathed the gilt ornamentation of the galleries, and the house, lately so full of heat and noise, lapsed suddenly into a heavy sleep, while a musty, dusty odor began to pervade it.  In the front of her box stood the Countess Muffat.  Very erect and closely wrapped up in her furs, she stared at the gathering shadows and waited for the crowd to pass away. In the passages the people were jostling the attendants, who hardly knew what to do among the tumbled heaps of outdoor raiment. Fauchery and La Faloise had hurried in order to see the crowd pass out.  All along the entrance hall men formed a living hedge, while down the double staircase came slowly and in regular, complete formation two interminable throngs of human beings.  Steiner, in tow of Mignon, had left the house among the foremost.  The Count de Vandeuvres took his departure with Blanche de Sivry on his arm.  For a moment or two Gaga and her daughter seemed doubtful how to proceed, but Labordette made haste to go and fetch them a conveyance, the door whereof he gallantly shut after them.  Nobody saw Daguenet go by.  As the truant schoolboy, registering a mental vow to wait at the stage door, was running with burning cheeks toward the Passage des Panoramas, of which he found the gate closed, Satin, standing on the edge of the pavement, moved forward and brushed him with her skirts, but he in his despair gave her a savage refusal and vanished amid the crowd, tears of impotent desire in his eyes.  Members of the audience were lighting their cigars and walking off, humming: When Venus roams at eventide. Satin had gone back in front of the Cafe des Varietes, where Auguste let her eat the sugar that remained over from the customers&#x27; orders. A stout man, who came out in a very heated condition, finally carried her off in the shadow of the boulevard, which was now gradually going to sleep. Still people kept coming downstairs.  La Faloise was waiting for Clarisse; Fauchery had promised to catch up Lucy Stewart with Caroline Hequet and her mother.  They came; they took up a whole corner of the entrance hall and were laughing very loudly when the Muffats passed by them with an icy expression.  Bordenave had just then opened a little door and, peeping out, had obtained from Fauchery the formal promise of an article.  He was dripping with perspiration, his face blazed, as though he were drunk with success. &quot;You&#x27;re good for two hundred nights,&quot; La Faloise said to him with civility.  &quot;The whole of Paris will visit your theater.&quot; But Bordenave grew annoyed and, indicating with a jerk of his chin the public who filled the entrance hall--a herd of men with parched lips and ardent eyes, still burning with the enjoyment of Nana--he cried out violently: &quot;Say &#x27;my brothel,&#x27; you obstinate devil!&quot; CHAPTER II At ten o&#x27;clock the next morning Nana was still asleep.  She occupied the second floor of a large new house in the Boulevard Haussmann, the landlord of which let flats to single ladies in order by their means to dry the paint.  A rich merchant from Moscow, who had come to pass a winter in Paris, had installed her there after paying six months&#x27; rent in advance.  The rooms were too big for her and had never been completely furnished.  The vulgar sumptuosity of gilded consoles and gilded chairs formed a crude contrast therein to the bric-a-brac of a secondhand furniture shop--to mahogany round tables, that is to say, and zinc candelabras, which sought to imitate Florentine bronze.  All of which smacked of the courtesan too early deserted by her first serious protector and fallen back on shabby lovers, of a precarious first appearance of a bad start, handicapped by refusals of credit and threats of eviction. Nana was sleeping on her face, hugging in her bare arms a pillow in which she was burying cheeks grown pale in sleep.  The bedroom and the dressing room were the only two apartments which had been properly furnished by a neighboring upholsterer.  A ray of light, gliding in under a curtain, rendered visible rosewood furniture and hangings and chairbacks of figured damask with a pattern of big blue flowers on a gray ground.  But in the soft atmosphere of that slumbering chamber Nana suddenly awoke with a start, as though surprised to find an empty place at her side.  She looked at the other pillow lying next to hers; there was the dint of a human head among its flounces: it was still warm.  And groping with one hand, she pressed the knob of an electric bell by her bed&#x27;s head. &quot;He&#x27;s gone then?&quot; she asked the maid who presented herself. &quot;Yes, madame, Monsieur Paul went away not ten minutes back.  As Madame was tired, he did not wish to wake her.  But he ordered me to tell Madame that he would come tomorrow.&quot; As she spoke Zoe, the lady&#x27;s maid, opened the outer shutter.  A flood of daylight entered.  Zoe, a dark brunette with hair in little plaits, had a long canine face, at once livid and full of seams, a snub nose, thick lips and two black eyes in continual movement. &quot;Tomorrow, tomorrow,&quot; repeated Nana, who was not yet wide awake, &quot;is tomorrow the day?&quot; &quot;Yes, madame, Monsieur Paul has always come on the Wednesday.&quot; &quot;No, now I remember,&quot; said the young woman, sitting up.  &quot;It&#x27;s all changed.  I wanted to tell him so this morning.  He would run against the nigger!  We should have a nice to-do!&quot; &quot;Madame did not warn me; I couldn&#x27;t be aware of it,&quot; murmured Zoe. &quot;When Madame changes her days she will do well to tell me so that I may know.  Then the old miser is no longer due on the Tuesday?&quot; Between themselves they were wont thus gravely to nickname as &quot;old miser&quot; and &quot;nigger&quot; their two paying visitors, one of whom was a tradesman of economical tendencies from the Faubourg Saint-Denis, while the other was a Walachian, a mock count, whose money, paid always at the most irregular intervals, never looked as though it had been honestly come by.  Daguenet had made Nana give him the days subsequent to the old miser&#x27;s visits, and as the trader had to be at home by eight o&#x27;clock in the morning, the young man would watch for his departure from Zoes kitchen and would take his place, which was still quite warm, till ten o&#x27;clock.  Then he, too, would go about his business.  Nana and he were wont to think it a very comfortable arrangement. &quot;So much the worse,&quot; said Nana; &quot;I&#x27;ll write to him this afternoon. And if he doesn&#x27;t receive my letter, then tomorrow you will stop him coming in.&quot; In the meantime Zoe was walking softly about the room.  She spoke of yesterday&#x27;s great hit.  Madame had shown such talent; she sang so well!  Ah! Madame need not fret at all now! Nana, her elbow dug into her pillow, only tossed her head in reply. Her nightdress had slipped down on her shoulders, and her hair, unfastened and entangled, flowed over them in masses. &quot;Without doubt,&quot; she murmured, becoming thoughtful; &quot;but what&#x27;s to be done to gain time?  I&#x27;m going to have all sorts of bothers today. Now let&#x27;s see, has the porter come upstairs yet this morning?&quot; Then both the women talked together seriously.  Nana owed three quarters&#x27; rent; the landlord was talking of seizing the furniture. Then, too, there was a perfect downpour of creditors; there was a livery-stable man, a needlewoman, a ladies&#x27; tailor, a charcoal dealer and others besides, who came every day and settled themselves on a bench in the little hall.  The charcoal dealer especially was a dreadful fellow--he shouted on the staircase.  But Nana&#x27;s greatest cause of distress was her little Louis, a child she had given birth to when she was sixteen and now left in charge of a nurse in a village in the neighborhood of Rambouillet.  This woman was clamoring for the sum of three hundred francs before she would consent to give the little Louis back to her.  Nana, since her last visit to the child, had been seized with a fit of maternal love and was desperate at the thought that she could not realize a project, which had now become a hobby with her.  This was to pay off the nurse and to place the little man with his aunt, Mme Lerat, at the Batignolles, whither she could go and see him as often as she liked. Meanwhile the lady&#x27;s maid kept hinting that her mistress ought to have confided her necessities to the old miser. &quot;To be sure, I told him everything,&quot; cried Nana, &quot;and he told me in answer that he had too many big liabilities.  He won&#x27;t go beyond his thousand francs a month.  The nigger&#x27;s beggared just at present; I expect he&#x27;s lost at play.  As to that poor Mimi, he stands in great need of a loan himself; a fall in stocks has cleaned him out--he can&#x27;t even bring me flowers now.&quot; She was speaking of Daguenet.  In the self-abandonment of her awakening she had no secrets from Zoe, and the latter, inured to such confidences, received them with respeciful sympathy.  Since Madame condescended to speak to her of her affairs she would permit herself to say what she thought.  Besides, she was very fond of Madame; she had left Mme Blanche for the express purpose of taking service with her, and heaven knew Mme Blanche was straining every nerve to have her again!  Situations weren&#x27;t lacking; she was pretty well known, but she would have stayed with Madame even in narrow circumstances, because she believed in Madame&#x27;s future.  And she concluded by stating her advice with precision.  When one was young one often did silly things.  But this time it was one&#x27;s duty to look alive, for the men only thought of having their fun.  Oh dear, yes! Things would right themselves.  Madame had only to say one word in order to quiet her creditors and find the money she stood in need of. &quot;All that doesn&#x27;t help me to three hundred francs,&quot; Nana kept repeating as she plunged her fingers into the vagrant convolutions of her back hair.  &quot;I must have three hundred francs today, at once! It&#x27;s stupid not to know anyone who&#x27;ll give you three hundred francs.&quot; She racked her brains.  She would have sent Mme Lerat, whom she was expecting that very morning, to Rambouillet.  The counteraction of her sudden fancy spoiled for her the triumph of last night.  Among all those men who had cheered her, to think that there wasn&#x27;t one to bring her fifteen louis!  And then one couldn&#x27;t accept money in that way!  Dear heaven, how unfortunate she was!  And she kept harking back again to the subject of her baby--he had blue eyes like a cherub&#x27;s; he could lisp &quot;Mamma&quot; in such a funny voice that you were ready to die of laughing! But at this moment the electric bell at the outer door was heard to ring with its quick and tremulous vibration.  Zoe returned, murmuring with a confidential air: &quot;It&#x27;s a woman.&quot; She had seen this woman a score of times, only she made believe never to recognize her and to be quite ignorant of the nature of her relations with ladies in difficulties. &quot;She has told me her name--Madame Tricon.&quot; &quot;The Tricon,&quot; cried Nana.  &quot;Dear me!  That&#x27;s true.  I&#x27;d forgotten her.  Show her in.&quot; Zoe ushered in a tall old lady who wore ringlets and looked like a countess who haunts lawyers&#x27; offices.  Then she effaced herself, disappearing noiselessly with the lithe, serpentine movement wherewith she was wont to withdraw from a room on the arrival of a gentleman.  However, she might have stayed.  The Tricon did not even sit down.  Only a brief exchange of words took place. &quot;I have someone for you today.  Do you care about it?&quot; &quot;Yes.  How much?&quot; &quot;Twenty louis.&quot; &quot;At what o&#x27;clock?&quot; &quot;At three.  It&#x27;s settled then?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s settled.&quot; Straightway the Tricon talked of the state of the weather.  It was dry weather, pleasant for walking.  She had still four or five persons to see.  And she took her departure after consulting a small memorandum book.  When she was once more alone Nana appeared comforted.  A slight shiver agitated her shoulders, and she wrapped herself softly up again in her warm bedclothes with the lazy movements of a cat who is susceptible to cold.  Little by little her eyes closed, and she lay smiling at the thought of dressing Louiset prettily on the following day, while in the slumber into which she once more sank last night&#x27;s long, feverish dream of endlessly rolling applause returned like a sustained accompaniment to music and gently soothed her lassitude. At eleven o&#x27;clock, when Zoe showed Mme Lerat into the room, Nana was still asleep.  But she woke at the noise and cried out at once: &quot;It&#x27;s you.  You&#x27;ll go to Rambouillet today?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come for,&quot; said the aunt.  &quot;There&#x27;s a train at twenty past twelve.  I&#x27;ve got time to catch it.&quot; &quot;No, I shall only have the money by and by,&quot; replied the young woman, stretching herself and throwing out her bosom.  &quot;You&#x27;ll have lunch, and then we&#x27;ll see.&quot; Zoe brought a dressing jacket. &quot;The hairdresser&#x27;s here, madame,&quot; she murmured. But Nana did not wish to go into the dressing room.  And she herself cried out: &quot;Come in, Francis.&quot; A well-dressed man pushed open the door and bowed.  Just at that moment Nana was getting out of bed, her bare legs in full view.  But she did not hurry and stretched her hands out so as to let Zoe draw on the sleeves of the dressing jacket.  Francis, on his part, was quite at his ease and without turning away waited with a sober expression on his face. &quot;Perhaps Madame has not seen the papers.  There&#x27;s a very nice article in the Figaro.&quot; He had brought the journal.  Mme Lerat put on her spectacles and read the article aloud, standing in front of the window as she did so.  She had the build of a policeman, and she drew herself up to her full height, while her nostrils seemed to compress themselves whenever she uttered a gallant epithet.  It was a notice by Fauchery, written just after the performance, and it consisted of a couple of very glowing columns, full of witty sarcasm about the artist and of broad admiration for the woman. &quot;Excellent!&quot; Francis kept repeating. Nana laughed good-humoredly at his chaffing her about her voice!  He was a nice fellow, was that Fauchery, and she would repay him for his charming style of writing.  Mme Lerat, after having reread the notice, roundly declared that the men all had the devil in their shanks, and she refused to explain her self further, being fully satisfied with a brisk allusion of which she alone knew the meaning her in an income of six hundred francs a year.  Nana promised to rent some pretty little lodgings for her and to give her a hundred francs a month besides.  At the mention of this sum the aunt forgot herself and shrieked to her niece, bidding her squeeze their throats, since she had them in her grasp.  She was meaning the men, of course.  Then they both embraced again, but i. Francis finished turning up and fastening Nana&#x27;s hair.  He bowed and said: &quot;I&#x27;ll keep my eye on the evening papers.  At half-past five as usual, eh?&quot; &quot;Bring me a pot of pomade and a pound of burnt almonds from Boissier&#x27;s,&quot; Nana cried to him across the drawing room just as he was shutting the door after him. Then the two women, once more alone, recollected that they had not embraced, and they planted big kisses on each other&#x27;s cheeks.  The notice warmed their hearts.  Nana, who up till now had been half asleep, was again seized with the fever of her triumph.  Dear, dear, &#x27;twas Rose Mignon that would be spending a pleasant morning!  Her aunt having been unwilling to go to the theater because, as she averred, sudden emotions ruined her stomach, Nana set herself to describe the events of the evening and grew intoxicated at her own recital, as though all Paris had been shaken to the ground by the applause.  Then suddenly interrupting herself, she asked with a laugh if one would ever have imagined it all when she used to go traipsing about the Rue de la Goutte-d&#x27;Or.  Mme Lerat shook her head.  No, no, one never could have foreseen it!  And she began talking in her turn, assuming a serious air as she did so and calling Nana &quot;daughter.&quot;  Wasn&#x27;t she a second mother to her since the first had gone to rejoin Papa and Grandmamma?  Nana was greatly softened and on the verge of tears.  But Mme Lerat declared that the past was the past--oh yes, to be sure, a dirty past with things in it which it was as well not to stir up every day.  She had left off seeing her niece for a long time because among the family she was accused of ruining herself along with the little thing.  Good God, as though that were possible!  She didn&#x27;t ask for confidences; she believed that Nana had always lived decently, and now it was enough for her to have found her again in a fine position and to observe her kind feelings toward her son.  Virtue and hard work were still the only things worth anything in this world. &quot;Who is the baby&#x27;s father?&quot; she said, interrupting herself, her eyes lit up with an exhad crossed two knives on the table in front of her.  Notwithstanding this, the young woman defended herself from the charge of superstition.  Thus, if the salt were upset, it meant nothing, even on a Friday; but when it came to knives, that was too much of a good thing; that had never proved fallacious.  There could be no doubt that something unpleasant was going to happen to her.  She yawned, and then with an air, of profound boredom: &quot;Two o&#x27;clock already.  I must go out.  What a nuisance!&quot; The two old ladies looked at one another.  The three women shook their heads without speaking.  To be sure, life was not always amusing.  Nana had tilted her chair back anew and lit a cigarette, while the others sat pursing up their lips discreetly, thinking deeply philosophic thoughts. &quot;While waiting for you to return we&#x27;ll play a game of bezique,&quot; said Mme Maloir after a short silence.  &quot;Does Madame play bezique?&quot; Certainly Mme Lerat played it, and that to perfection.  It was no good troubling Zoe, who had vanished--a corner of the table would do quite well.  And they pushepression of acute curiosity. Nana was taken by surprise and hesitated a moment. &quot;A gentleman,&quot; she replied. &quot;There now!&quot; rejoined the aunt.  &quot;They declared that you had him by a stonemason who was in the habit of beating you.  Indeed, you shall tell me all about it someday; you know I&#x27;m discreet!  Tut, tut, I&#x27;ll look after him as though he were a prince&#x27;s son.&quot; She had retired from business as a florist and was living on her savings, which she had got together sou by sou, till now they broughtn the midst of her rejoicing Nana&#x27;s face, as she led the talk back to the subject of Louiset, seemed to be overshadowed by a sudden recollection. &quot;Isn&#x27;t it a bore I&#x27;ve got to go out at three o&#x27;clock?&quot; she muttered. &quot;It IS a nuisance!&quot; Just then Zoe came in to say that lunch was on the table.  They went into the dining room, where an old lady was already seated at table. She had not taken her hat off, and she wore a dark dress of an indecisive color midway between puce and goose dripping.  Nana did not seem surprised at sight of her.  She simply asked her why she hadn&#x27;t come into the bedroom. &quot;I heard voices,&quot; replied the old lady.  &quot;I thought you had company.&quot; Mme Maloir, a respectable-looking and mannerly woman, was Nana&#x27;s old friend, chaperon and companion.  Mme Lerat&#x27;s presence seemed to fidget her at first.  Afterward, when she became aware that it was Nana&#x27;s aunt, she looked at her with a sweet expression and a die- away smile.  In the meantime Nana, who averred that she was as hungry as a wolf, threw herself on the radishes and gobbled them up without bread.  Mme Lerat had become ceremonious; she refused the radishes as provocative of phlegm.  By and by when Zoe had brought in the cutlets Nana just chipped the meat and contented herself with sucking the bones.  Now and again she scrutinized her old friend&#x27;s hat out of the corners of her eyes. &quot;It&#x27;s the new hat I gave you?&quot; she ended by saying. &quot;Yes, I made it up,&quot; murmured Mme Maloir, her mouth full of meat. The hat was smart to distraction.  In front it was greatly exaggerated, and it was adorned with a lofty feather.  Mme Maloir had a mania for doing up all her hats afresh; she alone knew what really became her, and with a few stitches she could manufacture a toque out of the most elegant headgear.  Nana, who had bought her this very hat in order not to be ashamed of her when in her company out of doors, was very near being vexed. &quot;Push it up, at any rate,&quot; she cried. &quot;No, thank you,&quot; replied the old lady with dignity.  &quot;It doesn&#x27;t get in my way; I can eat very comfortably as it is.&quot; After the cutlets came cauliflowers and the remains of a cold chicken.  But at the arrival of each successive dish Nana made a little face, hesitated, sniffed and left her plateful untouched. She finished her lunch with the help of preserve. Dessert took a long time.  Zoe did not remove the cloth before serving the coffee.  Indeed, the ladies simply pushed back their plates before taking it.  They talked continually of yesterday&#x27;s charming evening.  Nana kept rolling cigarettes, which she smoked, swinging up and down on her backward-tilted chair.  And as Zoe had remained behind and was lounging idly against the sideboard, it came about that the company were favored with her history.  She said she was the daughter of a midwife at Bercy who had failed in business. First of all she had taken service with a dentist and after that with an insurance agent, but neither place suited her, and she thereupon enumerated, not without a certain amount of pride, the names of the ladies with whom she had served as lady&#x27;s maid.  Zoe spoke of these ladies as one who had had the making of their fortunes.  It was very certain that without her more than one would have had some queer tales to tell.  Thus one day, when Mme Blanche was with M. Octave, in came the old gentleman.  What did Zoe do? She made believe to tumble as she crossed the drawing room; the old boy rushed up to her assistance, flew to the kitchen to fetch her a glass of water, and M. Octave slipped away. &quot;Oh, she&#x27;s a good girl, you bet!&quot; said Nana, who was listening to her with tender interest and a sort of submissive admiration. &quot;Now I&#x27;ve had my troubles,&quot; began Mme Lerat.  And edging up to Mme Maloir, she imparted to her certain confidential confessions.  Both ladies took lumps of sugar dipped in cognac and sucked them.  But Mme Maloir was wont to listen to other people&#x27;s secrets without even confessing anything concerning herself.  People said that she lived on a mysterious allowance in a room whither no one ever penetrated. All of a sudden Nana grew excited. &quot;Don&#x27;t play with the knives, Aunt.  You know it gives me a turn!&quot; Without thinking about it Mme Lerat d back the tablecloth over the dirty plates.  But as Mme Maloir was herself going to take the cards out of a drawer in the sideboard, Nana remarked that before she sat down to her game it would be very nice of her if she would write her a letter.  It bored Nana to write letters; besides, she was not sure of her spelling, while her old friend could turn out the most feeling epistles.  She ran to fetch some good note paper in her bedroom.  An inkstand consisting of a bottle of ink worth about three sous stood untidily on one of the pieces of furniture, with a pen deep in rust beside it.  The letter was for Daguenet.  Mme Maloir herself wrote in her bold English hand, &quot;My darling little man,&quot; and then she told him not to come tomorrow because &quot;that could not be&quot; but hastened to add that &quot;she was with him in thought at every moment of the day, whether she were near or far away.&quot; &quot;And I end with &#x27;a thousand kisses,&#x27;&quot; she murmured. Mme Lerat had shown her approval of each phrase with an emphatic nod.  Her eyes were sparkling; she loved to find herself in the midst of love affairs.  Nay, she was seized with a desire to add some words of her own and, assuming a tender look and cooing like a dove, she suggested: &quot;A thousand kisses on thy beautiful eyes.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s the thing: &#x27;a thousand kisses on thy beautiful eyes&#x27;!&quot;  Nana repeated, while the two old ladies assumed a beatified expression. Zoe was rung for and told to take the letter down to a commissionaire.  She had just been talking with the theater messenger, who had brought her mistress the day&#x27;s playbill and rehearsal arrangements, which he had forgotten in the morning.  Nana had this individual ushered in and got him to take the latter to Daguenet on his return.  Then she put questions to him.  Oh yes!  M. Bordenave was very pleased; people had already taken seats for a week to come; Madame had no idea of the number of people who had been asking her address since morning.  When the man had taken his departure Nana announced that at most she would only be out half an hour.  If there were any visitors Zoe would make them wait.  As she spoke the electric bell sounded.  It was a creditor in the shape of the man of whom she jobbed her carriages.  He had settled himself on the bench in the anteroom, and the fellow was free to twiddle his thumbs till night--there wasn&#x27;t the least hurry now. &quot;Come, buck up!&quot; said Nana, still torpid with laziness and yawning and stretching afresh.  &quot;I ought to be there now!&quot; Yet she did not budge but kept watching the play of her aunt, who had just announced four aces.  Chin on hand, she grew quite engrossed in it but gave a violent start on hearing three o&#x27;clock strike. &quot;Good God!&quot; she cried roughly. Then Mme Maloir, who was counting the tricks she had won with her tens and aces, said cheeringly to her in her soft voice: &quot;It would be better, dearie, to give up your expedition at once.&quot; &quot;No, be quick about it,&quot; said Mme Lerat, shuffling the cards.  &quot;I shall take the half-past four o&#x27;clock train if you&#x27;re back here with the money before four o&#x27;clock.&quot; &quot;Oh, there&#x27;ll be no time lost,&quot; she murmured. Ten minutes after Zoe helped her on with a dress and a hat.  It didn&#x27;t matter much if she were badly turned out.  Just as she was about to go downstairs there was a new ring at the bell.  This time it was the charcoal dealer.  Very well, he might keep the livery- stable keeper company--it would amuse the fellows.  Only, as she dreaded a scene, she crossed the kitchen and made her escape by the back stairs.  She often went that way and in return had only to lift up her flounces. &quot;When one is a good mother anything&#x27;s excusable,&quot; said Mme Maloir sententiously when left alone with Mme Lerat. &quot;Four kings,&quot; replied this lady, whom the play greatly excited. And they both plunged into an interminable game. The table had not been cleared.  The smell of lunch and the cigarette smoke filled the room with an ambient, steamy vapor.  The two ladies had again set to work dipping lumps of sugar in brandy and sucking the same.  For twenty minutes at least they played and sucked simultaneously when, the electric bell having rung a third time, Zoe bustled into the room and roughly disturbed them, just as if they had been her own friends. &quot;Look here, that&#x27;s another ring.  You can&#x27;t stay where you are.  If many foiks call I must have the whole flat.  Now off you go, off you go!&quot; Mme Maloir was for finishing the game, but Zoe looked as if she was going to pounce down on the cards, and so she decided to carry them off without in any way altering their positions, while Mme Lerat undertook the removal of the brandy bottle, the glasses and the sugar.  Then they both scudded to the kitchen, where they installed themselves at the table in an empty space between the dishcloths, which were spread out to dry, and the bowl still full of dishwater. &quot;We said it was three hundred and forty.  It&#x27;s your turn.&quot; &quot;I play hearts.&quot; When Zoe returned she found them once again absorbed.  After a silence, as Mme Lerat was shuffling, Mme Maloir asked who it was. &quot;Oh, nobody to speak of,&quot; replied the servant carelessly; &quot;a slip of a lad!  I wanted to send him away again, but he&#x27;s such a pretty boy with never a hair on his chin and blue eyes and a girl&#x27;s face!  So I told him to wait after all.  He&#x27;s got an enormous bouquet in his hand, which he never once consented to put down.  One would like to catch him one--a brat like that who ought to be at school still!&quot; Mme Lerat went to fetch a water bottle to mix herself some brandy and water, the lumps of sugar having rendered her thirsty.  Zoe muttered something to the effect that she really didn&#x27;t mind if she drank something too.  Her mouth, she averred, was as bitter as gall. &quot;So you put him--?&quot; continued Mme Maloir. &quot;Oh yes, I put him in the closet at the end of the room, the little unfurnished one.  There&#x27;s only one of my lady&#x27;s trunks there and a table.  It&#x27;s there I stow the lubbers.&quot; And she was putting plenty of sugar in her grog when the electric bell made her jump.  Oh, drat it all!  Wouldn&#x27;t they let her have a drink in peace?  If they were to have a peal of bells things promised well.  Nevertheless, she ran off to open the door. Returning presently, she saw Mme Maloir questioning her with a glance. &quot;It&#x27;s nothing,&quot; she said, &quot;only a bouquet.&quot; All three refreshed themselves, nodding to each other in token of salutation.  Then while Zoe was at length busy clearing the table, bringing the plates out one by one and putting them in the sink, two other rings followed close upon one another.  But they weren&#x27;t serious, for while keeping the kitchen informed of what was going on she twice repeated her disdainful expression: &quot;Nothing, only a bouquet.&quot; Notwithstanding which, the old ladies laughed between two of their tricks when they heard her describe the looks of the creditors in the anteroom after the flowers had arrived.  Madame would find her bouquets on her toilet table.  What a pity it was they cost such a lot and that you could only get ten sous for them!  Oh dear, yes, plenty of money was wasted! &quot;For my part,&quot; said Mme Maloir, &quot;I should be quite content if every day of my life I got what the men in Paris had spent on flowers for the women.&quot; &quot;Now, you know, you&#x27;re not hard to please,&quot; murmured Mme Lerat. &quot;Why, one would have only just enough to buy thread with.  Four queens, my dear.&quot; It was ten minutes to four.  Zoe was astonished, could not understand why her mistress was out so long.  Ordinarily when Madame found herself obliged to go out in the afternoons she got it over in double-quick time.  But Mme Maloir declared that one didn&#x27;t always manage things as one wished.  Truly, life was beset with obstacles, averred Mme Lerat.  The best course was to wait.  If her niece was long in coming it was because her occupations detained her; wasn&#x27;t it so?  Besides, they weren&#x27;t overworked--it was comfortable in the kitchen.  And as hearts were out, Mme Lerat threw down diamonds. The bell began aga in her small gloved hands. It was too late now--Mme Lerat would not go to Rambouillet till tomorrow, and Nana entered into long explanations. &quot;There&#x27;s company waiting for you,&quot; the lady&#x27;s maid repeated. But Nana grew excited again.  The company might wait: she&#x27;d go to them all in good time when she&#x27;d finished.  And as her aunt began putting her hand out for the money: &quot;Ah no!  Not all of it,&quot; she said.  &quot;Three hundred francs for the nurse, fifty for your journey and expenses, that&#x27;s three hundred and fifty.  Fifty francs I keep.&quot; The big difficulty was how to find change.  There were not ten francs in the house.  But they did not even address themselves to Mme Maloir who, never having more than a six-sou omnibus fair upon her, was listening in quite a disinterested manner.  At length Zoe went out of the room, remarking that she would go and looin, and when Zoe reappeared she was burning with excitement. &quot;My children, it&#x27;s fat Steiner!&quot; she said in the doorway, lowering her voice as she spoke.  &quot;I&#x27;ve put HIM in the little sitting room.&quot; Thereupon Mme Maloir spoke about the banker to Mme Lerat, who knew no such gentleman.  Was he getting ready to give Rose Mignon the go- by?  Zoe shook her head; she knew a thing or two.  But once more she had to go and open the door. &quot;Here&#x27;s bothers!&quot; she murmured when she came back.  &quot;It&#x27;s the nigger!  &#x27;Twasn&#x27;t any good telling him that my lady&#x27;s gone out, and so he&#x27;s settled himself in the bedroom.  We only expected him this evening.&quot; At a quarter past four Nana was not in yet.  What could she be after?  It was silly of her!  Two other bouquets were brought round, and Zoe, growing bored looked to see if there were any coffee left. Yes, the ladies would willingly finish off the coffee; it would waken them up.  Sitting hunched up on their chairs, they were beginning to fall asleep through dint of constantly taking their cards between their fingers with the accustomed movement.  The half- hour sounded.  Something must decidedly have happened to Madame. And they began whispering to each other. Suddenly Mme Maloir forgot herself and in a ringing voice announced: &quot;I&#x27;ve the five hundred!  Trumps, Major Quint!&quot; &quot;Oh, do be quiet!&quot; said Zoe angrily.  &quot;What will all those gentlemen think?&quot;  And in the silence which ensued and amid the whispered muttering of the two old women at strife over their game, the sound of rapid footsteps ascended from the back stairs.  It was Nana at last.  Before she had opened the door her breathlessness became audible.  She bounced abruptly in, looking very red in the face. Her skirt, the string of which must have been broken, was trailing over the stairs, and her flounces had just been dipped in a puddle of something unpleasant which had oozed out on the landing of the first floor, where the servant girl was a regular slut. &quot;Here you are!  It&#x27;s lucky!&quot; said Mme Lerat, pursing up her lips, for she was still vexed at Mme Maloir&#x27;s &quot;five hundred.&quot;  &quot;You may flatter yourself at the way you keep folks waiting.&quot; &quot;Madame isn&#x27;t reasonable; indeed, she isn&#x27;t!&quot; added Zoe. Nana was already harassed, and these reproaches exasperated her. Was that the way people received her after the worry she had gone through? &quot;Will you blooming well leave me alone, eh?&quot; she cried. &quot;Hush, ma&#x27;am, there are people in there,&quot; said the maid. Then in lower tones the young Woman stuttered breathlessly: &quot;D&#x27;you suppose I&#x27;ve been having a good time?  Why, there was no end to it.  I should have liked to see you there!  I was boiling with rage!  I felt inclined to smack somebody.  And never a cab to come home in!  Luckily it&#x27;s only a step from here, but never mind that; I did just run home.&quot; &quot;You have the money?&quot; asked the aunt. &quot;Dear, dear!  That question!&quot; rejoined Nana. She had sat herself down on a chair close up against the stove, for her legs had failed her after so much running, and without stopping to take breath she drew from behind her stays an envelope in which there were four hundred-franc notes.  They were visible through a large rent she had torn with savage fingers in order to be sure of the contents.  The three women round about her stared fixedly at the envelope, a big, crumpled, dirty receptacle, as it lay claspedk in her box, and she brought back a hundred francs in hundred-sou pieces. They were counted out on a corner of the table, and Mme Lerat took her departure at once after having promised to bring Louiset back with her the following day. &quot;You say there&#x27;s company there?&quot; continued Nana, still sitting on the chair and resting herself. &quot;Yes, madame, three people.&quot; And Zoe mentioned the banker first.  Nana made a face.  Did that man Steiner think she was going to let herself be bored because he had thrown her a bouquet yesterday evening? &quot;Besides, I&#x27;ve had enough of it,&quot; she declared.  &quot;I shan&#x27;t receive today.  Go and say you don&#x27;t expect me now.&quot; &quot;Madame will think the matter over; Madame will receive Monsieur Steiner,&quot; murmured Zoe gravely, without budging from her place.  She was annoyed to see her mistress on the verge of committing another foolish mistake. Then she mentioned the Walachian, who ought by now to find time hanging heavy on his hands in the bedroom.  Whereupon Nana grew furious and more obstinate than ever.  No, she would see nobody, nobody!  Who&#x27;d sent her such a blooming leech of a man? &quot;Chuck &#x27;em all out!  I--I&#x27;m going to play a game of bezique with Madame Maloir.  I prefer doing that.&quot; The bell interrupted her remarks.  That was the last straw.  Another of the beggars yet!  She forbade Zoe to go and open the door, but the latter had left the kitchen without listening to her, and when she reappeared she brought back a couple of cards and said authoritatively: &quot;I told them that Madame was receiving visitors.  The gentlemen are in the drawing room.&quot; Nana had sprung up, raging, but the names of the Marquis de Chouard and of Count Muffat de Beuville, which were inscribed on the cards, calmed her down.  For a moment or two she remained silent. &quot;Who are they?&quot; she asked at last.  &quot;You know them?&quot; &quot;I know the old fellow,&quot; replied Zoe, discreetly pursing up her lips. And her mistress continuing to question her with her eyes, she added simply: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen him somewhere.&quot; This remark seemed to decide the young woman.  Regretfully she left the kitchen, that asylum of steaming warmth, where you could talk and take your ease amid the pleasant fumes of the coffeepot which was being kept warm over a handful of glowing embers.  She left Mme Maloir behind her.  That lady was now busy reading her fortune by the cards; she had never yet taken her hat off, but now in order to be more at her ease she undid the strings and threw them back over her shoulders. In the dressing room, where Zoe rapidly helped her on with a tea gown, Nana revenged herself for the way in which they were all boring her by muttering quiet curses upon the male sex.  These big words caused the lady&#x27;s maid not a little distress, for she saw with pain that her mistress was not rising superior to her origin as quickly as she could have desired.  She even made bold to beg Madame to calm herself. &quot;You bet,&quot; was Nana&#x27;s crude answer; &quot;they&#x27;re swine; they glory in that sort of thing.&quot; Nevertheless, she assumed her princesslike manner, as she was wont to call it.  But just when she was turning to go into the drawing room Zoe held her back and herself introduced the Marquis de Chouard and the Count Muffat into the dressing room.  It was much better so. &quot;I regret having kept you waiting, gentlemen,&quot; said the young woman with studied politeness. The two men bowed and seated themselves.  A blind of embroidered tulle kept the little room in twilight.  It was the most elegant chamber in the flat, for it was hung with some light-colored fabric and contained a cheval glass framed in inlaid wood, a lounge chair and some others with arms and blue satin upholsteries.  On the toilet table the bouquets--roses, lilacs and hyacinths--appeared like a very ruin of flowers.  Their perfume was strong and penetrating, while through the dampish air of the place, which was full of the spoiled exhalations of the washstand, came occasional whiffs of a more pungent scent, the scent of some grains or dry patchouli ground to fine powder at the bottom of a cup.  And as she gathered herself together and drew up her dressing jacket, which had been ill fastened, Nana had all the appearance of having been surprised at her toilet: her skin was still damp; she smiled and looked quite startled amid her frills and laces. &quot;Madame, you will pardon our insistence,&quot; said the Count Muffat gravely.  &quot;We come on a quest.  Monsieur and I are members of the Benevolent Organization of the district.&quot; The Marquis de Chouard hastened gallantly to add: &quot;When we learned that a great artiste lived in this house we promised ourselves that we would put the claims of our poor people before her in a very special manner.  Talent is never without a heart.&quot; Nana pretended to be modest.  She answered them with little assenting movements of her head, making rapid reflections at the same time.  It must be the old man that had brought the other one: he had such wicked eyes.  And yet the other was not to be trusted either: the veins near his temples were so queerly puffed up.  He might quite well have come by himself.  Ah, now that she thought of it, it was this way: the porter had given them her name, and they had egged one another on, each with his own ends in view. &quot;Most certainly, gentlemen, you were quite right to come up,&quot; she said with a very good grace. But the electric bell made her tremble again.  Another call, and that Zoe always opening the door!  She went on: &quot;One is only too happy to be able to give.&quot; At bottom she was flattered. &quot;Ah, madame,&quot; rejoined the marquis, &quot;if only you knew about it! there&#x27;s such misery!  Our district has more than three thousand poor people in it, and yet it&#x27;s one of the richest.  You cannot picture to yourself anything like the present distress--children with no bread, women ill, utterly without assistance, perishing of the cold!&quot; &quot;The poor souls!&quot; cried Nana, very much moved. Such was her feeling of compassion that tears flooded her fine eyes. No longer studying deportment, she leaned forward with a quick movement, and under her open dressing jacket her neck became visible, while the bent position of her knees served to outline the rounded contour of the thigh under the thin fabric of her skirt.  A little flush of blood appeared in the marquis&#x27;s cadaverous cheeks. Count Muffat, who was on the point of speaking, lowered his eyes. The air of that little room was too hot: it had the close, heavy warmth of a greenhouse.  The roses were withering, and intoxicating odors floated up from the patchouli in the cup. &quot;One would like to be very rich on occasions like this,&quot; added Nana. &quot;Well, well, we each do what we can.  Believe me, gentlemen, if I had known--&quot; She was on the point of being guilty of a silly speech, so melted was she at heart.  But she did not end her sentence and for a moment was worried at not being able to remember where she had put her fifty francs on changing her dress.  But she recollected at last: they must be on the corner of her toilet table under an inverted pomatum pot.  As she was in the act of rising the bell sounded for quite a long time.  Capital!  Another of them still!  It would never end.  The count and the marquis had both risen, too, and the ears of the latter seemed to be pricked up and, as it were, pointing toward the door; doubtless he knew that kind of ring.  Muffat looked at him; then they averted their gaze mutually.  They felt awkward and once more assumed their frigid bearing, the one looking square-set and solid with his thick head of hair, the other drawing back his lean shoulders, over which fell his fringe of thin white locks. &quot;My faith,&quot; said Nana, bringing the ten big silver pieces and quite determined to laugh about it, &quot;I am going to entrust you with this, gentlemen.  It is for the poor.&quot; And the adorable little dimple in her chin became apparent.  She assumed her favorite pose, her amiable baby expression, as she held the pile of five-franc pieces on her open palm and offered it to the men, as though she were saying to them, &quot;Now then, who wants some?&quot; The count was the sharper of the two.  He took fifty francs but left one piece behind and, in order to gain possession of it, had to pick it off the young woman&#x27;s very skin, a moist, supple skin, the touch of which sent a thrill through him.  She was thoroughly merry and did not cease laughing. &quot;Come, gentlemen,&quot; she continued.  &quot;Another time I hope to give more.&quot; The gentlemen no longer had any pretext for staying, and they bowed and went toward the door.  But just as they were about to go out the bell rang anew.  The marquis could not conceal a faint smile, while a frown made the count look more grave than before.  Nana detained them some seconds so as to give Zoe time to find yet another corner for the newcomers.  She did not relish meetings at her house.  Only this time the whole place must be packed!  She was therefore much relieved when she saw the drawing room empty and asked herself whether Zoe had really stuffed them into the cupboards. &quot;Au revoir, gentlemen,&quot; she said, pausing on the threshold of the drawing room. It was as though she lapped them in her laughing smile and clear, unclouded glance.  The Count Muffat bowed slightly.  Despite his great social experience he felt that he had lost his equilibrium. He needed air; he was overcome with the dizzy feeling engendered in that dressing room with a scent of flowers, with a feminine essence which choked him.  And behind his back, the Marquis de Chouard, who was sure that he could not be seen, made so bold as to wink at Nana, his whole face suddenly altering its expression as he did so, and his tongue nigh lolling from his mouth. When the young woman re-entered the little room, where Zoe was awaiting her with letters and visiting cards, she cried out, laughing more heartily than ever: &quot;There are a pair of beggars for you!  Why, they&#x27;ve got away with my fifty francs!&quot; She wasn&#x27;t vexed.  It struck her as a joke that MEN should have got money out of her.  All the same, they were swine, for she hadn&#x27;t a sou left.  But at sight of the cards and the letters her bad temper returned.  As to the letters, why, she said &quot;pass&quot; to them.  They were from fellows who, after applauding her last night, were now making their declarations.  And as to the callers, they might go about their business! Zoe had stowed them all over the place, and she called attention to the great capabilities of the flat, every room in which opened on the corridor.  That wasn&#x27;t the case at Mme Blanche&#x27;s, where people had all to go through the drawing room.  Oh yes, Mme Blanche had had plenty of bothers over it! &quot;You will send them all away,&quot; continued Nana in pursuance of her idea.  &quot;Begin with the nigger.&quot; &quot;Oh, as to him, madame, I gave him his marching orders a while ago,&quot; said Zoe with a grin.  &quot;He only wanted to tell Madame that he couldn&#x27;t come to-night.&quot; There was vast joy at this announcement, and Nana clapped her hands. He wasn&#x27;t coming, what good luck!  She would be free then!  And she emitted sighs of relief, as though she had been let off the most abominable of tortures.  Her first thought was for Daguenet.  Poor duck, why, she had just written to tell him to wait till Thursday! Quick, quick, Mme Maloir should write a second letter!  But Zoe announced that Mme Maloir had slipped away unnoticed, according to her wont.  Whereupon Nana, after talking of sending someone to him, began to hesitate.  She was very tired.  A long night&#x27;s sleep--oh, it would be so jolly!  The thought of such a treat overcame her at last.  For once in a way she could allow herself that! &quot;I shall go to bed when I come back from the theater,&quot; she murmured greedily, &quot;and you won&#x27;t wake me before noon.&quot; Then raising her voice: &quot;Now then, gee up!  Shove the others downstairs!&quot; Zoe did not move.  She would never have dreamed of giving her mistress overt advice, only now she made shift to give Madame the benefit of her experience when Madame seemed to be running her hot head against a wall. &quot;Monsieur Steiner as well?&quot; she queried curtly. &quot;Why, certainly!&quot; replied Nana.  &quot;Before all the rest.&quot; The maid still waited, in order to give her mistress time for reflection.  Would not Madame be proud to get such a rich gentleman away from her rival Rose Mignon--a man, moreover, who was known in all the theaters? &quot;Now make haste, my dear,&quot; rejoined Nana, who perfectly understood the situation, &quot;and tell him he pesters me.&quot; But suddenly there was a reversion of feeling.  Tomorrow she might want him.  Whereupon she laughed, winked once or twice and with a naughty little gesture cried out: &quot;After all&#x27;s said and done, if I want him the best way even now is to kick him out of doors.&quot; Zoe seemed much impressed.  Struck with a sudden admiration, she gazed at her mistress and then went and chucked Steiner out of doors without further deliberation. Meanwhile Nana waited patiently for a second or two in order to give her time to sweep the place out, as she phrased it.  No one would ever have expected such a siege!  She craned her head into the drawing room and found it empty.  The dining room was empty too. But as she continued her visitation in a calmer frame of mind, feeling certain that nobody remained behind, she opened the door of a closet and came suddenly upon a very young man.  He was sitting on the top of a trunk, holding a huge bouquet on his knees and looking exceedingly quiet and extremely well behaved. &quot;Goodness gracious me!&quot; she cried.  &quot;There&#x27;s one of &#x27;em in there even now!&quot;  The very young man had jumped down at sight of her and was blushing as red as a poppy.  He did not know what to do with his bouquet, which he kept shifting from one hand to the other, while his looks betrayed the extreme of emotion.  His youth, his embarrassment and the funny figure he cut in his struggles with his flowers melted Nana&#x27;s heart, and she burst into a pretty peal of laughter.  Well, now, the very children were coming, were they?  Men were arriving in long clothes.  So she gave up all airs and graces, became familiar and maternal, tapped her leg and asked for fun: &quot;You want me to wipe your nose; do you, baby?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the lad in a low, supplicating tone. This answer made her merrier than ever.  He was seventeen years old, he said.  His name was Georges Hugon.  He was at the Varietes last night and now he had come to see her. &quot;These flowers are for me?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Then give &#x27;em to me, booby!&quot; But as she took the bouquet from him he sprang upon her hands and kissed them with all the gluttonous eagerness peculiar to his charming time of life.  She had to beat him to make him let go. There was a dreadful little dribbling customer for you!  But as she scolded him she flushed rosy-red and began smiling.  And with that she sent him about his business, telling him that he might call again.  He staggered away; he could not find the doors. Nana went back into her dressing room, where Francis made his appearance almost simultaneously in order to dress her hair for the evening.  Seated in front of her mirror and bending her head beneath the hairdresser&#x27;s nimble hands, she stayed silently meditative. Presently, however, Zoe entered, remarking: &quot;There&#x27;s one of them, madame, who refuses to go.&quot; &quot;Very well, he must be left alone,&quot; she answered quietly. &quot;If that comes to that they still keep arriving.&quot; &quot;Bah!  Tell &#x27;em to wait.  When they begin to feel too hungry they&#x27;ll be off.&quot;  Her humor had changed, and she was now delighted to make people wait about for nothing.  A happy thought struck her as very amusing; she escaped from beneath Francis&#x27; hands and ran and bolted the doors.  They might now crowd in there as much as they liked; they would probably refrain from making a hole through the wall. Zoe could come in and out through the little doorway leading to the kitchen.  However, the electric bell rang more lustily than ever. Every five minutes a clear, lively little ting-ting recurred as regularly as if it had been produced by some well-adjusted piece of mechanism.  And Nana counted these rings to while the time away withal.  But suddenly she remembered something. &quot;I say, where are my burnt almonds?&quot; Francis, too, was forgetting about the burnt almonds.  But now he drew a paper bag from one of the pockets of his frock coat and presented it to her with the discreet gesture of a man who is offering a lady a present.  Nevertheless, whenever his accounts came to be settled, he always put the burnt almonds down on his bill. Nana put the bag between her knees and set to work munching her sweetmeats, turning her head from time to time under the hairdresser&#x27;s gently compelling touch. &quot;The deuce,&quot; she murmured after a silence, &quot;there&#x27;s a troop for you!&quot; Thrice, in quick succession, the bell had sounded.  Its summonses became fast and furious.  There were modest tintinnabulations which seemed to stutter and tremble like a first avowal; there were bold rings which vibrated under some rough touch and hasty rings which sounded through the house with shivering rapidity.  It was a regular peal, as Zoe said, a peal loud enough to upset the neighborhood, seeing that a whole mob of men were jabbing at the ivory button, one after the other.  That old joker Bordenave had really been far too lavish with her address.  Why, the whole of yesterday&#x27;s house was coming! &quot;By the by, Francis, have you five louis?&quot; said Nana. He drew back, looked carefully at her headdress and then quietly remarked: &quot;Five louis, that&#x27;s according!&quot; &quot;Ah, you know if you want securities. . .&quot; she continued. And without finishing her sentence, she indicated the adjoining rooms with a sweeping gesture.  Francis lent the five louis.  Zoe, during each momentary respite, kept coming in to get Madame&#x27;s things ready.  Soon she came to dress her while the hairdresser lingered with the intention of giving some finishing touches to the headdress.  But the bell kept continually disturbing the lady&#x27;s maid, who left Madame with her stays half laced and only one shoe on.  Despite her long experience, the maid was losing her head. After bringing every nook and corner into requisition and putting men pretty well everywhere, she had been driven to stow them away in threes and fours, which was a course of procedure entirely opposed to her principles.  So much the worse for them if they ate each other up!  It would afford more room!  And Nana, sheltering behind her carefully bolted door, began laughing at them, declaring that she could hear them pant.  They ought to be looking lovely in there with their tongues hanging out like a lot of bowwows sitting round on their behinds.  Yesterday&#x27;s success was not yet over, and this pack of men had followed up her scent. &quot;Provided they don&#x27;t break anything,&quot; she murmured. She began to feel some anxiety, for she fancied she felt their hot breath coming through chinks in the door.  But Zoe ushered Labordette in, and the young woman gave a little shout of relief. He was anxious to tell her about an account he had settled for her at the justice of peace&#x27;s court.  But she did not attend and said: &quot;I&#x27;ll take you along with me.  We&#x27;ll have dinner together, and afterward you shall escort me to the Varietes.  I don&#x27;t go on before half-past nine.&quot; Good old Labordette, how lucky it was he had come!  He was a fellow who never asked for any favors.  He was only the friend of the women, whose little bits of business he arranged for them.  Thus on his way in he had dismissed the creditors in the anteroom.  Indeed, those good folks really didn&#x27;t want to be paid.  On the contrary, if they HAD been pressing for payment it was only for the sake of complimenting Madame and of personally renewing their offers of service after her grand success of yesterday. &quot;Let&#x27;s be off, let&#x27;s be off,&quot; said Nana, who was dressed by now. But at that moment Zoe came in again, shouting: &quot;I refuse to open the door any more.  They&#x27;re waiting in a crowd all down the stairs.&quot; A crowd all down the stairs!  Francis himself, despite the English stolidity of manner which he was wont to affect, began laughing as he put up his combs.  Nana, who had already taken Labordette&#x27;s arm, pushed him into the kitchen and effected her escape.  At last she was delivered from the men and felt happily conscious that she might now enjoy his society anywhere without fear of stupid interruptions. &quot;You shall see me back to my door,&quot; she said as they went down the kitchen stairs.  &quot;I shall feel safe, in that case.  Just fancy, I want to sleep a whole night quite by myself--yes, a whole night! It&#x27;s sort of infatuation, dear boy!&quot; CHAPTER III The countess Sabine, as it had become customary to call Mme Muffat de Beuville in order to distinguish her from the count&#x27;s mother, who had died the year before, was wont to receive every Tuesday in her house in the Rue Miromesnil at the corner of the Rue de Pentievre. It was a great square building, and the Muffats had lived in it for a hundred years or more.  On the side of the street its frontage seemed to slumber, so lofty was it and dark, so sad and conventlike, with its great outer shutters, which were nearly always closed.  And at the back in a little dark garden some trees had grown up and were straining toward the sunlight with such long slender branches that their tips were visible above the roof. This particular Tuesday, toward ten o&#x27;clock in the evening, there were scarcely a dozen people in the drawing room.  When she was only expecting intimate friends the countess opened neither the little drawing room nor the dining room.  One felt more at home on such occasions and chatted round the fire.  The drawing room was very large and very lofty; its four windows looked out upon the garden, from which, on this rainy evening of the close of April, issued a sensation of damp despite the great logs burning on the hearth.  The sun never shone down into the room; in the daytime it was dimly lit up by a faint greenish light, but at night, when the lamps and the chandelier were burning, it looked merely a serious old chamber with its massive mahogany First Empire furniture, its hangings and chair coverings of yellow velvet, stamped with a large design.  Entering it, one was in an atmosphere of cold dignity, of ancient manners, of a vanished age, the air of which seemed devotional. Opposite the armchair, however, in which the count&#x27;s mother had died--a square armchair of formal design and inhospitable padding, which stood by the hearthside--the Countess Sabine was seated in a deep and cozy lounge, the red silk upholsteries of which were soft as eider down.  It was the only piece of modern furniture there, a fanciful item introduced amid the prevailing severity and clashing with it. &quot;So we shall have the shah of Persia,&quot; the young woman was saying. They were talking of the crowned heads who were coming to Paris for the exhibition.  Several ladies had formed a circle round the hearth, and Mme du Joncquoy, whose brother, a diplomat, had just fulfilled a mission in the East, was giving some details about the court of Nazr-ed-Din. &quot;Are you out of sorts, my dear?&quot; asked Mme Chantereau, the wife of an ironmaster, seeing the countess shivering slightly and growing pale as she did so. &quot;Oh no, not at all,&quot; replied the latter, smiling.  &quot;I felt a little cold.  This drawing room takes so long to warm.&quot; And with that she raised her melancholy eyes and scanned the walls from floor to ceiling.  Her daughter Estelle, a slight, insignificant- looking girl of sixteen, the thankless period of life, quitted the large footstool on which she was sitting and silently came and propped up one of the logs which had rolled from its place. But Mme de Chezelles, a convent friend of Sabine&#x27;s and her junior by five years, exclaimed: &quot;Dear me, I would gladly be possessed of a drawing room such as yours!  At any rate, you are able to receive visitors.  They only build boxes nowadays.  Oh, if I were in your place!&quot; She ran giddily on and with lively gestures explained how she would alter the hangings, the seats--everything, in fact.  Then she would give balls to which all Paris should run.  Behind her seat her husband, a magistrate, stood listening with serious air.  It was rumored that she deceived him quite openly, but people pardoned her offense and received her just the same, because, they said, &quot;she&#x27;s not answerable for her actions.&quot; &quot;Oh that Leonide!&quot; the Countess Sabine contented herself by murmuring, smiling her faint smile the while. With a languid movement she eked out the thought that was in her. After having lived there seventeen years she certainly would not alter her drawing room now.  It would henceforth remain just such as her mother-in-law had wished to preserve it during her lifetime. Then returning to the subject of conversation: &quot;I have been assured,&quot; she said, &quot;that we shall also have the king of Prussia and the emperor of Russia.&quot; &#x27;Yes, some very fine fetes are promised,&quot; said Mme du Joncquoy. The banker Steiner, not long since introduced into this circle by Leonide de Chezelles, who was acquainted with the whole of Parisian society, was sitting chatting on a sofa between two of the windows. He was questioning a deputy, from whom he was endeavoring with much adroitness to elicit news about a movement on the stock exchange of which he had his suspicions, while the Count Muffat, standing in front of them, was silently listening to their talk, looking, as he did so, even grayer than was his wont. Four or five young men formed another group near the door round the Count Xavier de Vandeuvres, who in a low tone was telling them an anecdote.  It was doubtless a very risky one, for they were choking with laughter.  Companionless in the center of the room, a stout man, a chief clerk at the Ministry of the Interior, sat heavily in an armchair, dozing with his eyes open.  But when one of the young men appeared to doubt the truth of the anecdote Vandeuvres raised his voice. &quot;You are too much of a skeptic, Foucarmont; you&#x27;ll spoil all your pleasures that way.&quot; And he returned to the ladies with a laugh.  Last scion of a great family, of feminine manners and witty tongue, he was at that time running through a fortune with a rage of life and appetite which nothing could appease.  His racing stable, which was one of the best known in Paris, cost him a fabulous amount of money; his betting losses at the Imperial Club amounted monthly to an alarming number of pounds, while taking one year with another, his mistresses would be always devouring now a farm, now some acres of arable land or forest, which amounted, in fact, to quite a respectable slice of his vast estates in Picardy. &quot;I advise you to call other people skeptics!  Why, you don&#x27;t believe a thing yourself,&quot; said Leonide, making shift to find him a little space in which to sit down at her side. &quot;It&#x27;s you who spoil your own pleasures.&quot; &quot;Exactly,&quot; he replied.  &quot;I wish to make others benefit by my experience.&quot; But the company imposed silence on him: he was scandalizing M. Venot.  And, the ladies having changed their positions, a little old man of sixty, with bad teeth and a subtle smile, became visible in the depths of an easy chair.  There he sat as comfortably as in his own house, listening to everybody&#x27;s remarks and making none himself. With a slight gesture he announced himself by no means scandalized. Vandeuvres once more assumed his dignified bearing and added gravely: &quot;Monsieur Venot is fully aware that I believe what it is one&#x27;s duty to believe.&quot; It was an act of faith, and even Leonide appeared satisfied.  The young men at the end of the room no longer laughed; the company were old fogies, and amusement was not to be found there.  A cold breath of wind had passed over them, and amid the ensuing silence Steiner&#x27;s nasal voice became audible.  The deputy&#x27;s discreet answers were at last driving him to desperation.  For a second or two the Countess Sabine looked at the fire; then she resumed the conversation. &quot;I saw the king of Prussia at Baden-Baden last year.  He&#x27;s still full of vigor for his age.&quot; &quot;Count Bismarck is to accompany him,&quot; said Mme du Joncquoy.  &quot;Do you know the count?  I lunched with him at my brother&#x27;s ages ago, when he was representative of Prussia in Paris.  There&#x27;s a man now whose latest successes I cannot in the least understand.&quot; &quot;But why?&quot; asked Mme Chantereau. &quot;Good gracious, how am I to explain?  He doesn&#x27;t please me.  His appearance is boorish and underbred.  Besides, so far as I am concerned, I find him stupid.&quot; With that the whole room spoke of Count Bismarck, and opinions differed considerably.  Vandeuvres knew him and assured the company that he was great in his cups and at play.  But when the discussion was at its height the door was opened, and Hector de la Falois made his appearance.  Fauchery, who followed in his wake, approached the countess and, bowing: &quot;Madame,&quot; he said, &quot;I have not forgotten your extremely kind invitation.&quot; She smiled and made a pretty little speech.  The journalist, after bowing to the count, stood for some moments in the middle of the drawing room.  He only recognized Steiner and accordingly looked rather out of his element.  But Vandeuvres turned and came and shook hands with him.  And forthwith, in his delight at the meeting and with a sudden desire to be confidential, Fauchery buttonholed him and said in a low voice: &quot;It&#x27;s tomorrow.  Are you going?&quot; &quot;Egad, yes.&quot; &quot;At midnight, at her house. &quot;I know, I know.  I&#x27;m going with Blanche.&quot; He wanted to escape and return to the ladies in order to urge yet another reason in M. de Bismarck&#x27;s favor.  But Fauchery detained him. &quot;You never will guess whom she has charged me to invite.&quot; And with a slight nod he indicated Count Muffat, who was just then discussing a knotty point in the budget with Steiner and the deputy. &quot;It&#x27;s impossible,&quot; said Vandeuvres, stupefaction and merriment in his tones.  &quot;My word on it!  I had to swear that I would bring him to her.  Indeed, that&#x27;s one of my reasons for coming here.&quot; Both laughed silently, and Vandeuvres, hurriedly rejoining the circle of ladies, cried out: &quot;I declare that on the contrary Monsieur de Bismarck is exceedingly witty.  For instance, one evening he said a charmingly epigrammatic thing in my presence.&quot; La Faloise meanwhile had heard the few rapid sentences thus whisperingly interchanged, and he gazed at Fauchery in hopes of an explanation which was not vouchsafed him.  Of whom were they talking, and what were they going to do at midnight tomorrow?  He did not leave his cousin&#x27;s side again.  The latter had gone and seated himself.  He was especially interested by the Countess Sabine.  Her name had often been mentioned in his presence, and he knew that, having been married at the age of seventeen, she must now be thirty-four and that since her marriage she had passed a cloistered existence with her husband and her mother-in-law.  In society some spoke of her as a woman of religious chastity, while others pitied her and recalled to memory her charming bursts of laughter and the burning glances of her great eyes in the days prior to her imprisonment in this old town house.  Fauchery scrutinized her and yet hesitated.  One of his friends, a captain who had recently died in Mexico, had, on the very eve of his departure, made him one of those gross postprandial confessions, of which even the most prudent among men are occasionally guilty.  But of this he only retained a vague recollection; they had dined not wisely but too well that evening, and when he saw the countess, in her black dress and with her quiet smile, seated in that Old World drawing room, he certainly had his doubts.  A lamp which had been placed behind her threw into clear relief her dark, delicate, plump side face, wherein a certain heaviness in the contours of the mouth alone indicated a species of imperious sensuality. &quot;What do they want with their Bismarck?&quot; muttered La Faloise, whose constant pretense it was to be bored in good society.  &quot;One&#x27;s ready to kick the bucket here.  A pretty idea of yours it was to want to come!&quot; Fauchery questioned him abruptly. &quot;Now tell me, does the countess admit someone to her embraces?&quot; &quot;Oh dear, no, no!  My dear fellow!&quot; he stammered, manifestly taken aback and quite forgetting his pose.  &quot;Where d&#x27;you think we are?&quot; After which he was conscious of a want of up-to-dateness in this outburst of indignation and, throwing himself back on a great sofa, he added: &quot;Gad!  I say no!  But I don&#x27;t know much about it.  There&#x27;s a little chap out there, Foucarmont they call him, who&#x27;s to be met with everywhere and at every turn.  One&#x27;s seen faster men than that, though, you bet.  However, it doesn&#x27;t concern me, and indeed, all I know is that if the countess indulges in high jinks she&#x27;s still pretty sly about it, for the thing never gets about--nobody talks.&quot; Then although Fauchery did not take the trouble to question him, he told him all he knew about the Muffats.  Amid the conversation of the ladies, which still continued in front of the hearth, they both spoke in subdued tones, and, seeing them there with their white cravats and gloves, one might have supposed them to be discussing in chosen phraseology some really serious topic.  Old Mme Muffat then, whom La Faloise had been well acquainted with, was an insufferable old lady, always hand in glove with the priests.  She had the grand manner, besides, and an authoritative way of comporting herself, which bent everybody to her will.  As to Muffat, he was an old man&#x27;s child; his father, a general, had been created count by Napoleon I, and naturally he had found himself in favor after the second of December.  He hadn&#x27;t much gaiety of manner either, but he passed for a very honest man of straightforward intentions and understanding. Add to these a code of old aristocratic ideas and such a lofty conception of his duties at court, of his dignities and of his virtues, that he behaved like a god on wheels.  It was the Mamma Muffat who had given him this precious education with its daily visits to the confessional, its complete absence of escapades and of all that is meant by youth.  He was a practicing Christian and had attacks of faith of such fiery violence that they might be likened to accesses of burning fever.  Finally, in order to add a last touch to the picture, La Faloise whispered something in his cousin&#x27;s ear. &quot;You don&#x27;t say so!&quot; said the latter. &quot;On my word of honor, they swore it was true!  He was still like that when he married.&quot; Fauchery chuckled as he looked at the count, whose face, with its fringe of whiskers and absence of mustaches, seemed to have grown squarer and harder now that he was busy quoting figures to the writhing, struggling Steiner. &quot;My word, he&#x27;s got a phiz for it!&quot; murmured Fauchery.  &quot;A pretty present he made his wife!  Poor little thing, how he must have bored her!  She knows nothing about anything, I&#x27;ll wager!&quot; Just then the Countess Sabine was saying something to him.  But he did not hear her, so amusing and extraordinary did he esteem the Muffats&#x27; case.  She repeated the question. &quot;Monsieur Fauchery, have you not published a sketch of Monsieur de Bismarck?  You spoke with him once?&quot; He got up briskly and approached the circle of ladies, endeavoring to collect himself and soon with perfect ease of manner finding an answer: &quot;Dear me, madame, I assure you I wrote that &#x27;portrait&#x27; with the help of biographies which had been published in Germany.  I have never seen Monsieur de Bismarck.&quot; He remained beside the countess and, while talking with her, continued his meditations.  She did not look her age; one would have set her down as being twenty-eight at most, for her eyes, above all, which were filled with the dark blue shadow of her long eyelashes, retained the glowing light of youth.  Bred in a divided family, so that she used to spend one month with the Marquis de Chouard, another with the marquise, she had been married very young, urged on, doubtless, by her father, whom she embarrassed after her mother&#x27;s death.  A terrible man was the marquis, a man about whom strange tales were beginning to be told, and that despite his lofty piety!  Fauchery asked if he should have the honor of meeting him. Certainly her father was coming, but only very late; he had so much work on hand!  The journalist thought he knew where the old gentleman passed his evenings and looked grave.  But a mole, which he noticed close to her mouth on the countess&#x27;s left cheek, surprised him.  Nana had precisely the same mole.  It was curious. Tiny hairs curled up on it, only they were golden in Nana&#x27;s case, black as jet in this.  Ah well, never mind!  This woman enjoyed nobody&#x27;s embraces. &quot;I have always felt a wish to know Queen Augusta,&quot; she said.  &quot;They say she is so good, so devout.  Do you think she will accompany the king?&quot; &quot;It is not thought that she will, madame,&quot; he replied. She had no lovers: the thing was only too apparent.  One had only to look at her there by the side of that daughter of hers, sitting so insignificant and constrained on her footstool.  That sepulchral drawing room of hers, which exhaled odors suggestive of being in a church, spoke as plainly as words could of the iron hand, the austere mode of existence, that weighed her down.  There was nothing suggestive of her own personality in that ancient abode, black with the damps of years.  It was Muffat who made himself felt there, who dominated his surroundings with his devotional training, his penances and his fasts.  But the sight of the little old gentleman with the black teeth and subtle smile whom he suddenly discovered in his armchair behind the group of ladies afforded him a yet more decisive argument.  He knew the personage.  It was Theophile Venot, a retired lawyer who had made a specialty of church cases.  He had left off practice with a handsome fortune and was now leading a sufficiently mysterious existence, for he was received everywhere, treated with great deference and even somewhat feared, as though he had been the representative of a mighty force, an occult power, which was felt to be at his back.  Nevertheless, his behavior was very humble.  He was churchwarden at the Madeleine Church and had simply accepted the post of deputy mayor at the town house of the Ninth Arrondissement in order, as he said, to have something to do in his leisure time.  Deuce take it, the countess was well guarded; there was nothing to be done in that quarter. &quot;You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s enough to make one kick the bucket here,&quot; said Fauchery to his cousin when he had made good his escape from the circle of ladies.  &quot;We&#x27;ll hook it!&quot; But Steiner, deserted at last by the Count Muffat and the deputy, came up in a fury.  Drops of perspiration stood on his forehead, and he grumbled huskily: &quot;Gad!  Let &#x27;em tell me nothing, if nothing they want to tell me.  I shall find people who will talk.&quot; Then he pushed the journalist into a corner and, altering his tone, said in accents of victory: &quot;It&#x27;s tomorrow, eh?  I&#x27;m of the party, my bully!&quot; &quot;Indeed!&quot; muttered Fauchery with some astonishment. &quot;You didn&#x27;t know about it.  Oh, I had lots of bother to find her at home.  Besides, Mignon never would leave me alone.&quot; &quot;But they&#x27;re to be there, are the Mignons.&quot; &quot;Yes, she told me so.  In fact, she did receive my visit, and she invited me.  Midnight punctually, after the play.&quot; The banker was beaming.  He winked and added with a peculiar emphasis on the words: &quot;You&#x27;ve worked it, eh?&quot; &quot;Eh, what?&quot; said Fauchery, pretending not to understand him.  &quot;She wanted to thank me for my article, so she came and called on me.&quot; &quot;Yes, yes.  You fellows are fortunate.  You get rewarded.  By the by, who pays the piper tomorrow?&quot; The journalist made a slight outward movement with his arms, as though he would intimate that no one had ever been able to find out. But Vandeuvres called to Steiner, who knew M. de Bismarck.  Mme du Joncquoy had almost convinced herself of the truth of her suppositions; she concluded with these words: &quot;He gave me an unpleasant impression.  I think his face is evil. But I am quite willing to believe that he has a deal of wit.  It would account for his successes.&quot; &quot;Without doubt,&quot; said the banker with a faint smile.  He was a Jew from Frankfort. Meanwhile La Faloise at last made bold to question his cousin.  He followed him up and got inside his guard: &quot;There&#x27;s supper at a woman&#x27;s tomorrow evening?  With which of them, eh?  With which of them?&quot; Fauchery motioned to him that they were overheard and must respect the conventions here.  The door had just been opened anew, and an old lady had come in, followed by a young man in whom the journalist recognized the truant schoolboy, perpetrator of the famous and as yet unforgotten &quot;tres chic&quot; of the Blonde Venus first night.  This lady&#x27;s arrival caused a stir among the company.  The Countess Sabine had risen briskly from her seat in order to go and greet her, and she had taken both her hands in hers and addressed her as her &quot;dear Madame Hugon.&quot;  Seeing that his cousin viewed this little episode with some curiosity, La Faloise sought to arouse his interest and in a few brief phrases explained the position.  Mme Hugon, widow of a notary, lived in retirement at Les Fondettes, an old estate of her family&#x27;s in the neighborhood of Orleans, but she also kept up a small establishment in Paris in a house belonging to her in the Rue de Richelieu and was now passing some weeks there in order to settle her youngest son, who was reading the law and in his &quot;first year.&quot; In old times she had been a dear friend of the Marquise de Chouard and had assisted at the birth of the countess, who, prior to her marriage, used to stay at her house for months at a time and even now was quite familiarly treated by her. &quot;I have brought Georges to see you,&quot; said Mme Hugon to Sabine. &quot;He&#x27;s grown, I trust.&quot; The young man with his clear eyes and the fair curls which suggested a girl dressed up as a boy bowed easily to the countess and reminded her of a bout of battledore and shuttlecock they had had together two years ago at Les Fondettes. &quot;Philippe is not in Paris?&quot; asked Count Muffat. &quot;Dear me, no!&quot; replied the old lady.  &quot;He is always in garrison at Bourges.&quot;  She had seated herself and began talking with considerable pride of her eldest son, a great big fellow who, after enlisting in a fit of waywardness, had of late very rapidly attained the rank of lieutenant.  All the ladies behaved to her with respectful sympathy, and conversation was resumed in a tone at once more amiable and more refined.  Fauchery, at sight of that respectable Mme Hugon, that motherly face lit up with such a kindly smile beneath its broad tresses of white hair, thought how foolish he had been to suspect the Countess Sabine even for an instant. Nevertheless, the big chair with the red silk upholsteries in which the countess sat had attracted his attention.  Its style struck him as crude, not to say fantastically suggestive, in that dim old drawing room.  Certainly it was not the count who had inveigled thither that nest of voluptuous idleness.  One might have described it as an experiment, marking the birth of an appetite and of an enjoyment.  Then he forgot where he was, fell into brown study and in thought even harked back to that vague confidential announcement imparted to him one evening in the dining room of a restaurant. Impelled by a sort of sensuous curiosity, he had always wanted an introduction into the Muffats&#x27; circle, and now that his friend was in Mexico through all eternity, who could tell what might happen? &quot;We shall see,&quot; he thought.  It was a folly, doubtless, but the idea kept tormenting him; he felt himself drawn on and his animal nature aroused.  The big chair had a rumpled look--its nether cushions had been tumbled, a fact which now amused him. &quot;Well, shall we be off?&quot; asked La Faloise, mentally vowing that once outside he would find out the name of the woman with whom people were going to sup. &quot;All in good time,&quot; replied Fauchery. But he was no longer in any hurry and excused himself on the score of the invitation he had been commissioned to give and had as yet not found a convenient opportunity to mention.  The ladies were chatting about an assumption of the veil, a very touching ceremony by which the whole of Parisian society had for the last three days been greatly moved.  It was the eldest daughter of the Baronne de Fougeray, who, under stress of an irresistible vocation, had just entered the Carmelite Convent.  Mme Chantereau, a distant cousin of the Fougerays, told how the baroness had been obliged to take to her bed the day after the ceremony, so overdone was she with weeping. &quot;I had a very good place,&quot; declared Leonide.  &quot;I found it interesting.&quot; Nevertheless, Mme Hugon pitied the poor mother.  How sad to lose a daughter in such a way! &quot;I am accused of being overreligious,&quot; she said in her quiet, frank manner, &quot;but that does not prevent me thinking the children very cruel who obstinately commit such suicide.&quot; &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s a terrible thing,&quot; murmured the countess, shivering a little, as became a chilly person, and huddling herself anew in the depths of her big chair in front of the fire. Then the ladies fell into a discussion.  But their voices were discreetly attuned, while light trills of laughter now and again interrupted the gravity of their talk.  The two lamps on the chimney piece, which had shades of rose-colored lace, cast a feeble light over them while on scattered pieces of furniture there burned but three other lamps, so that the great drawing room remained in soft shadow. Steiner was getting bored.  He was describing to Fauchery an escapade of that little Mme de Chezelles, whom he simply referred to as Leonide.  &quot;A blackguard woman,&quot; he said, lowering his voice behind the ladies&#x27; armchairs.  Fauchery looked at her as she sat quaintly perched, in her voluminous ball dress of pale blue satin, on the corner of her armchair.  She looked as slight and impudent as a boy, and he ended by feeling astonished at seeing her there. People comported themselves better at Caroline Hequet&#x27;s, whose mother had arranged her house on serious principles.  Here was a perfect subject for an article.  Whuat a strange world was this world of Paris!  The most rigid circles found themselves invaded. Evidently that silent Theophile Venot, who contented himself by smiling and showing his ugly teeth, must have been a legacy from the late countess.  So, too, must have been such ladies of mature age as Mme Chantereau and Mme du Joncquoy, besides four or five old gentlemen who sat motionless in corners.  The Count Muffat attracted to the house a series of functionaries, distinguished by the immaculate personal appearance which was at that time required of the men at the Tuileries.  Among others there was the chief clerk, who still sat solitary in the middle of the room with his closely shorn cheeks, his vacant glance and his coat so tight of fit that he could scarce venture to move.  Almost all the young men and certain individuals with distinguished, aristocratic manners were the Marquis de Chouard&#x27;s contribution to the circle, he having kept touch with the Legitimist party after making his peace with the empire on his entrance into the Council of State.  There remained Leonide de Chezelles and Steiner, an ugly little knot against which Mme Hugon&#x27;s elderly and amiable serenity stood out in strange contrast.  And Fauchery, having sketched out his article, named this last group &quot;Countess Sabine&#x27;s little clique.&quot; &quot;On another occasion,&quot; continued Steiner in still lower tones, &quot;Leonide got her tenor down to Montauban.  She was living in the Chateau de Beaurecueil, two leagues farther off, and she used to come in daily in a carriage and pair in order to visit him at the Lion d&#x27;Or, where he had put up.  The carriage used to wait at the door, and Leonide would stay for hours in the house, while a crowd gathered round and looked at the horses.&quot; There was a pause in the talk, and some solemn moments passed silently by in the lofty room.  Two young men were whispering, but they ceased in their turn, and the hushed step of Count Muffat was alone audible as he crossed the floor.  The lamps seemed to have paled; the fire was going out; a stern shadow fell athwart the old friends of the house where they sat in the chairs they had occupied there for forty years back.  It was as though in a momentary pause of conversation the invited guests had become suddenly aware that the count&#x27;s mother, in all her glacial stateliness, had returned among them. But the Countess Sabine had once more resumed: &quot;Well, at last the news of it got about.  The young man was likely to die, and that would explain the poor child&#x27;s adoption of the religious life.  Besides, they say that Monsieur de Fougeray wold never have given his consent to the marriage.&quot; &quot;They say heaps of other things too,&quot; cried Leonide giddily. She fell a-laughing; she refused to talk.  Sabine was won over by this gaiety and put her handkerchief up to her lips.  And in the vast and solemn room their laughter sounded a note which struck Fauchery strangely, the note of delicate glass breaking.  Assuredly here was the first beginning of the &quot;little rift.&quot;  Everyone began talking again.  Mme du Joncquoy demurred; Mme Chantereau knew for certain that a marriage had been projected but that matters had gone no further; the men even ventured to give their opinions.  For some minutes the conversation was a babel of opinions, in which the divers elements of the circle, whether Bonapartist or Legitimist or merely worldly and skeptical, appeared to jostle one another simultaneously.  Estelle had rung to order wood to be put on the fire; the footman turned up the lamps; the room seemed to wake from sleep.  Fauchery began smiling, as though once more at his ease. &quot;Egad, they become the brides of God when they couldn&#x27;t be their cousin&#x27;s,&quot; said Vandeuvres between his teeth. The subject bored him, and he had rejoined Fauchery. &quot;My dear fellow, have you ever seen a woman who was really loved become a nun?&quot; He did not wait for an answer, for he had had enough of the topic, and in a hushed voice: &quot;Tell me,&quot; he said, &quot;how many of us will there be tomorrow? There&#x27;ll be the Mignons, Steiner, yourself, Blanche and I; who else?&quot; &quot;Caroline, I believe, and Simonne and Gaga without doubt.  One never knows exactly, does one?  On such occasions one expects the party will number twenty, and you&#x27;re really thirty.&quot; Vandeuvres, who was looking at the ladies, passed abruptly to another subject: &quot;She must have been very nice-looking, that Du Joncquoy woman, some fifteen years ago.  Poor Estelle has grown lankier than ever.  What a nice lath to put into a bed!&quot; But interrupting himself, he returned to the subject of tomorrow&#x27;s supper. &quot;What&#x27;s so tiresome of those shows is that it&#x27;s always the same set of women.  One wants a novelty.  Do try and invent a new girl.  By Jove, happy thought!  I&#x27;ll go and beseech that stout man to bring the woman he was trotting about the other evening at the Varietes.&quot; He referred to the chief clerk, sound asleep in the middle of the drawing room.  Fauchery, afar off, amused himself by following this delicate negotiation.  Vandeuvres had sat himself down by the stout man, who still looked very sedate.  For some moments they both appeared to be discussing with much propriety the question before the house, which was, &quot;How can one discover the exact state of feeling that urges a young girl to enter into the religious life?&quot; Then the count returned with the remark: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible.  He swears she&#x27;s straight.  She&#x27;d refuse, and yet I would have wagered that I once saw her at Laure&#x27;s.&quot; &quot;Eh, what?  You go to Laure&#x27;s?&quot; murmured Fauchery with a chuckle. &quot;You venture your reputation in places like that?  I was under the impression that it was only we poor devils of outsiders who--&quot; &quot;Ah, dear boy, one ought to see every side of life.&quot; Then they sneered and with sparkling eyes they compared notes about the table d&#x27;hote in the Rue des Martyrs, where big Laure Piedefer ran a dinner at three francs a head for little women in difficulties.  A nice hole, where all the little women used to kiss Laure on the lips!  And as the Countess Sabine, who had overheard a stray word or two, turned toward them, they started back, rubbing shoulders in excited merriment.  They had not noticed that Georges Hugon was close by and that he was listening to them, blushing so hotly the while that a rosy flush had spread from his ears to his girlish throat.  The infant was full of shame and of ecstasy.  From the moment his mother had turned him loose in the room he had been hovering in the wake of Mme de Chezelles, the only woman present who struck him as being the thing.  But after all is said and done, Nana licked her to fits! &quot;Yesterday evening,&quot; Mme Hugon was saying, &quot;Georges took me to the play.  Yes, we went to the Varietes, where I certainly had not set foot for the last ten years.  That child adores music.  As to me, I wasn&#x27;t in the least amused, but he was so happy!  They put extraordinary pieces on the stage nowadays.  Besides, music delights me very little, I confess.&quot; &quot;What!  You don&#x27;t love music, madame?&quot; cried Mme du Joncquoy, lifting her eyes to heaven.  &quot;Is it possible there should be people who don&#x27;t love music?&quot; The exclamation of surprise was general.  No one had dropped a single word concerning the performance at the Varietes, at which the good Mme Hugon had not understood any of the allusions.  The ladies knew the piece but said nothing about it, and with that they plunged into the realm of sentiment and began discussing the masters in a tone of refined and ecstatical admiration.  Mme du Joncquoy was not fond of any of them save Weber, while Mme Chantereau stood up for the Italians.  The ladies&#x27; voices had turned soft and languishing, and in front of the hearth one might have fancied one&#x27;s self listening in meditative, religious retirement to the faint, discreet music of a little chapel. &quot;Now let&#x27;s see,&quot; murmured Vandeuvres, bringing Fauchery back into the middle of the drawing room, &quot;notwithstanding it all, we must invent a woman for tomorrow.  Shall we ask Steiner about it?&quot; &quot;Oh, when Steiner&#x27;s got hold of a woman,&quot; said the journalist, &quot;it&#x27;s because Paris has done with her.&quot; Vandeuvres, however, was searching about on every side. &quot;Wait a bit,&quot; he continued, &quot;the other day I met Foucarmont with a charming blonde.  I&#x27;ll go and tell him to bring her.&quot; And he called to Foucarmont.  They exchanged a few words rapidly. There must have been some sort of complication, for both of them, moving carefully forward and stepping over the dresses of the ladies, went off in quest of another young man with whom they continued the discussion in the embrasure of a window.  Fauchery was left to himself and had just decided to proceed to the hearth, where Mme du Joncquoy was announcing that she never heard Weber played without at the same time seeing lakes, forests and sunrises over landscapes steeped in dew, when a hand touched his shoulder and a voice behind him remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s not civil of you.&quot; &quot;What d&#x27;you mean?&quot; he asked, turning round and recognizing La Faloise. &quot;Why, about that supper tomorrow.  You might easily have got me invited.&quot; Fauchery was at length about to state his reasons when Vandeuvres came back to tell him: &quot;It appears it isn&#x27;t a girl of Foucarmont&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s that man&#x27;s flame out there.  She won&#x27;t be able to come.  What a piece of bad luck! But all the same I&#x27;ve pressed Foucarmont into the service, and he&#x27;s going to try to get Louise from the Palais-Royal.&quot; &quot;Is it not true, Monsieur de Vandeuvres,&quot; asked Mme Chantereau, raising her voice, &quot;that Wagner&#x27;s music was hissed last Sunday?&quot; &quot;Oh, frightfully, madame,&quot; he made answer, coming forward with his usual exquisite politeness. Then, as they did not detain him, he moved off and continued whispering in the journalist&#x27;s ear: &quot;I&#x27;m going to press some more of them.  These young fellows must know some little ladies.&quot; With that he was observed to accost men and to engage them in conversation in his usual amiable and smiling way in every corner of the drawing room.  He mixed with the various groups, said something confidently to everyone and walked away again with a sly wink and a secret signal or two.  It looked as though he were giving out a watchword in that easy way of his.  The news went round; the place of meeting was announced, while the ladies&#x27; sentimental dissertations on music served to conceal the small, feverish rumor of these recruiting operations. &quot;No, do not speak of your Germans,&quot; Mme Chantereau was saying. &quot;Song is gaiety; song is light.  Have you heard Patti in the Barber of Seville?&quot; &quot;She was delicious!&quot; murmured Leonide, who strummed none but operatic airs on her piano. Meanwhile the Countess Sabine had rung.  When on Tuesdays the number of visitors was small, tea was handed round the drawing room itself. While directing a footman to clear a round table the countess followed the Count de Vandeuvres with her eyes.  She still smiled that vague smile which slightly disclosed her white teeth, and as the count passed she questioned him. &quot;What ARE you plotting, Monsieur de Vandeuvres?&quot; &quot;What am I plotting, madame?&quot; he answered quietly.  &quot;Nothing at all.&quot; &quot;Really!  I saw you so busy.  Pray, wait, you shall make yourself useful!&quot; She placed an album in his hands and asked him to put it on the piano.  But he found means to inform Fauchery in a low whisper that they would have Tatan Nene, the most finely developed girl that winter, and Maria Blond, the same who had just made her first appearance at the Folies-Dramatiques.  Meanwhile La Faloise stopped him at every step in hopes of receiving an invitation.  He ended by offering himself, and Vandeuvres engaged him in the plot at once; only he made him promise to bring Clarisse with him, and when La Faloise pretended to scruple about certain points he quieted him by the remark: &quot;Since I invite you that&#x27;s enough!&quot; Nevertheless, La Faloise would have much liked to know the name of the hostess.  But the countess had recalled Vandeuvres and was questioning him as to the manner in which the English made tea.  He often betook himself to England, where his horses ran.  Then as though he had been inwardly following up quite a laborious train of thought during his remarks, he broke in with the question: &quot;And the marquis, by the by?  Are we not to see him?&quot; &quot;Oh, certainly you will!  My father made me a formal promise that he would come,&quot; replied the countess.  &quot;But I&#x27;m beginning to be anxious.  His duties will have kept him.&quot; Vandeuvres smiled a discreet smile.  He, too, seemed to have his doubts as to the exact nature of the Marquis de Chouard&#x27;s duties. Indeed, he had been thinking of a pretty woman whom the marquis occasionally took into the country with him.  Perhaps they could get her too. In the meantime Fauchery decided that the moment had come in which to risk giving Count Muff  his invitation.  The evening, in fact, was drawing to a close. &quot;Are you serious?&quot; asked Vandeuvres, who thought a joke was intended. &quot;Extremely serious.  If I don&#x27;t execute my commission she&#x27;ll tear my eyes out.  It&#x27;s a case of landing her fish, you know.&quot; &quot;Well then, I&#x27;ll help you, dear boy.&quot; Eleven o&#x27;clock struck.  Assisted by her daughter, the countess was pouring out the tea, and as hardly any guests save intimate friends had come, the cups and the platefuls of little cakes were being circulated without ceremony.  Even the ladies did not leave their armchairs in front of the fire and sat sipping their tea and nibbling cakes which they held between their finger tips.  From music the talk had declined to purveyors.  Boissier was the only person for sweetmeats and Catherine for ices.  Mme Chantereau, however, was all for Latinville.  Speech grew more and more indolent, and a sense of lassitude was lulling the room to sleep. Steiner had once more set himself secretly to undermine the deputy, whom he held in a state of blockade in the corner of a settee.  M. Venot, whose teeth must have been ruined by sweet things, was eating little dry cakes, one after the other, with a small nibbling sound suggestive of a mouse, while the chief clerk, his nose in a teacup, seemed never to be going to finish its contents.  As to the countess, she went in a leisurely way from one guest to another, never pressing them, indeed, only pausing a second or two before the gentlemen whom she viewed with an air of dumb interrogation before she smiled and passed on.  The great fire had flushed all her face, and she looked as if she were the sister of her daughter, who appeared so withered and ungainly at her side.  When she drew near Fauchery, who was chatting with her husband and Vandeuvres, she noticed that they grew suddenly silent; accordingly she did not stop but handed the cup of tea she was offering to Georges Hugon beyond them. &quot;It&#x27;s a lady who desires your company at supper,&quot; the journalist gaily continued, addressing Count Muffat. The last-named, whose face had worn its gray look all the evening, seemed very much surprised.  What lady was it? &quot;Oh, Nana!&quot; said Vandeuvres, by way of forcing the invitation. The count became more grave than before.  His eyelids trembled just perceptibly, while a look of discomfort, such as headache produces, hovered for a moment athwart his forehead. &quot;But I&#x27;m not acquainted with that lady,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Come, come, you went to her house,&quot; remarked Vandeuvres. &quot;What d&#x27;you say?  I went to her house?  Oh yes, the other day, in behalf of the Benevolent Organization.  I had forgotten about it. But, no matter, I am not acquainted with her, and I cannot accept.&quot; He had adopted an icy expression in order to make them understand that this jest did not appear to him to be in good taste.  A man of his position did not sit down at tables of such women as that. Vandeuvres protested: it was to be a supper party of dramatic and artistic people, and talent excused everything.  But without listening further to the arguments urged by Fauchery, who spoke of a dinner where the Prince of Scots, the son of a queen, had sat down beside an ex-music-hall singer, the count only emphasized his refusal.  In so doing, he allowed himself, despite his great politeness, to be guilty of an irritated gesture. Georges and La Faloise, standing in front of each other drinking their tea, had overheard the two or three phrases exchanged in their immediate neighborhood. &quot;Jove, it&#x27;s at Nana&#x27;s then,&quot; murmured La Faloise.  &quot;I might have expected as much!&quot; Georges said nothing, but he was all aflame.  His fair hair was in disorder; his blue eyes shone like tapers, so fiercely had the vice, which for some days past had surrounded him, inflamed and stirred his blood.  At last he was going to plunge into all that he had dreamed of! &quot;I don&#x27;t know the address,&quot; La Faloise resumed. &quot;She lives on a third floor in the Boulevard Haussmann, between the Rue de l&#x27;Arcade and the Rue Pesquier,&quot; said Georges all in a breath. And when the other looked at him in much astonishment, he added, turning very red and fit to sink into the ground with embarrassment and conceit: &quot;I&#x27;m of the party.  She invited me this morning.&quot; But there was a great stir in the drawing room, and Vandeuvres and Fauchery could not continue pressing the count.  The Marquis de Chouard had just come in, and everyone was anxious to greet him.  He had moved painfully forward, his legs failing under him, and he now stood in the middle of the room with pallid face and eyes blinking, as though he had just come out of some dark alley and were blinded by the brightness of the lamps. &quot;I scarcely hoped to see you tonight, Father,&quot; said the countess. &quot;I should have been anxious till the morning.&quot; He looked at her without answering, as a man might who fails to understand.  His nose, which loomed immense on his shorn face, looked like a swollen pimple, while his lower lip hung down.  Seeing him such a wreck, Mme Hugon, full of kind compassion, said pitying things to him. &quot;You work too hard.  You ought to rest yourself.  At our age we ought to leave work to the young people.&quot; &quot;Work!  Ah yes, to be sure, work!&quot; he stammered at last.  &quot;Always plenty of work.&quot; He began to pull himself together, straightening up his bent figure and passing his hand, as was his wont, over his scant gray hair, of which a few locks strayed behind his ears. &quot;At what are you working as late as this?&quot; asked Mme du Joncquoy. &quot;I thought you were at the financial minister&#x27;s reception?&quot; But the countess intervened with: &quot;My father had to study the question of a projected law.&quot; &quot;Yes, a projected law,&quot; he said; &quot;exactly so, a projected law.  I shut myself up for that reason.  It refers to work in factories, and I was anxious for a proper observance of the Lord&#x27;s day of rest.  It is really shameful that the government is unwilling to act with vigor in the matter.  Churches are growing empty; we are running headlong to ruin.&quot; Vandeuvres had exchanged glances with Fauchery.  They both happened to be behind the marquis, and they were scanning him suspiciously. When Vandeuvres found an opportunity to take him aside and to speak to him about the good-looking creature he was in the habit of taking down into the country, the old man affected extreme surprise. Perhaps someone had seen him with the Baroness Decker, at whose house at Viroflay he sometimes spent a day or so.  Vandeuvres&#x27;s sole vengeance was an abrupt question: &quot;Tell me, where have you been straying to?  Your elbow is covered with cobwebs and plaster.&quot; &quot;My elbow,&quot; he muttered, slightly disturbed.  &quot;Yes indeed, it&#x27;s true.  A speck or two, I must have come in for them on my way down from my office.&quot; Several people were taking their departure.  It was close on midnight.  Two footmen were noiselessly removing the empty cups and the plates with cakes.  In front of the hearth the ladies had re- formed and, at the same time, narrowed their circle and were chatting more carelessly than before in the languid atmosphere peculiar to the close of a party.  The very room was going to sleep, and slowly creeping shadows were cast by its walls.  It was then Fauchery spoke of departure.  Yet he once more forgot his intention at sight of the Countess Sabine.  She was resting from her cares as hostess, and as she sat in her wonted seat, silent, her eyes fixed on a log which was turning into embers, her face appeared so white and so impassable that doubt again possessed him.  In the glow of the fire the small black hairs on the mole at the corner of her lip became white.  It was Nana&#x27;s very mole, down to the color of the hair.  He could not refrain from whispering something about it in Vandeuvres&#x27;s ear.  Gad, it was true; the other had never noticed it before.  And both men continued this comparison of Nana and the countess.  They discovered a vague resemblance about the chin and the mouth, but the eyes were not at all alike.  Then, too, Nana had a good-natured expression, while with the countess it was hard to decide--she might have been a cat, sleeping with claws withdrawn and paws stirred by a scarce-perceptible nervous quiver. &quot;All the same, one could have her,&quot; declared Fauchery. Vandeuvres stripped her at a glance. &quot;Yes, one could, all the same,&quot; he said.  &quot;But I think nothing of the thighs, you know.  Will you bet she has no thighs?&quot; He stopped, for Fauchery touched him briskly on the arm and showed him Estelle, sitting close to them on her footstool.  They had raised their voices without noticing her, and she must have overheard them.  Nevertheless, she continued sitting there stiff and motionless, not a hair having lifted on her thin neck, which was that of a girl who has shot up all too quickly.  Thereupon they retired three or four paces, and Vandeuvres vowed that the countess was a very honest woman.  Just then voices were raised in front of the hearth.  Mme du Joncquoy was saying: &quot;I was willing to grant you that Monsieur de Bismarck was perhaps a witty man.  Only, if you go as far as to talk of genius--&quot; The ladies had come round again to their earliest topic of conversation. &quot;What the deuce!  Still Monsieur de Bismarck!&quot; muttered Fauchery. &quot;This time I make my escape for good and all.&quot; &quot;Wait a bit,&quot; said Vandeuvres, &quot;we must have a definite no from the count.&quot; The Count Muffat was talking to his father-in-law and a certain serious-looking gentleman.  Vandeuvres drew him away and renewed the invitation, backing it up with the information that he was to be at the supper himself.  A man might go anywhere; no one could think of suspecting evil where at most there could only be curiosity.  The count listened to these arguments with downcast eyes and expressionless face.  Vandeuvres felt him to be hesitating when the Marquis de Chouard approached with a look of interrogation.  And when the latter was informed of the question in hand and Fauchery had invited him in his turn, he looked at his son-in-law furtively. There ensued an embarrassed silence, but both men encouraged one another and would doubtless have ended by accepting had not Count Muffat perceived M. Venot&#x27;s gaze fixed upon him.  The little old man was no longer smiling; his face was cadaverous, his eyes bright and keen as steel. &#x27;No,&quot; replied the count directly, in so decisive a tone that further insistence became impossible. Then the marquis refused with even greater severity of expression. He talked morality.  The aristocratic classes ought to set a good example.  Fauchery smiled and shook hands with Vandeuvres.  He did not wait for him and took his departure immediately, for he was due at his newspaper office. &quot;At Nana&#x27;s at midnight, eh?&quot; La Faloise retired too.  Steiner had made his bow to the countess. Other men followed them, and the same phrase went round--&quot;At midnight, at Nana&#x27;s&quot;--as they went to get their overcoats in the anteroom.  Georges, who could not leave without his mother, had stationed himself at the door, where he gave the exact address. &quot;Third floor, door on your left.&quot;  Yet before going out Fauchery gave a final glance.  Vandeuvres had again resumed his position among the ladies and was laughing with Leonide de Chezelles.  Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard were joining in the conversation, while the good Mme Hugon was falling asleep open-eyed.  Lost among the petticoats, M. Venot was his own small self again and smiled as of old.  Twelve struck slowly in the great solemn room. &quot;What--what do you mean?&quot; Mme du Joncquoy resumed.  &quot;You imagine that Monsieur de Bismarck will make war on us and beat us!  Oh, that&#x27;s unbearable!&quot; Indeed, they were laughing round Mme Chantereau, who had just repeated an assertion she had heard made in Alsace, where her husband owned a foundry. &quot;We have the emperor, fortunately,&quot; said Count Muffat in his grave, official way. It was the last phrase Fauchery was able to catch.  He closed the door after casting one more glance in the direction of the Countess Sabine.  She was talking sedately with the chief clerk and seemed to be interested in that stout individual&#x27;s conversation.  Assuredly he must have been deceiving himself.  There was no &quot;little rift&quot; there at all.  It was a pity. &quot;You&#x27;re not coming down then?&quot; La Faloise shouted up to him from the entrance hall. And out on the pavement, as they separated, they once more repeated: &quot;Tomorrow, at Nana&#x27;s.&quot; CHAPTER IV Since morning Zoe had delivered up the flat to a managing man who had come from Brebant&#x27;s with a staff of helpers and waiters. Brebant was to supply everything, from the supper, the plates and dishes, the glass, the linen, the flowers, down to the seats and footstools.  Nana could not have mustered a dozen napkins out of all her cupboards, and not having had time to get a proper outfit after her new start in life and scorning to go to the restaurant, she had decided to make the restaurant come to her.  It struck her as being more the thing.  She wanted to celebrate her great success as an actress with a supper which should set people talking.  As her dining room was too small, the manager had arranged the table in the drawing room, a table with twenty-five covers, placed somewhat close together. &quot;Is everything ready?&quot; asked Nana when she returned at midnight. &quot;Oh! I don&#x27;t know,&quot; replied Zoe roughly, looking beside herself with worry.  &quot;The Lord be thanked, I don&#x27;t bother about anything. They&#x27;re making a fearful mess in the kitchen and all over the flat! I&#x27;ve had to fight my battles too.  The other two came again.  My eye!  I did just chuck &#x27;em out!&quot; She referred, of course, to her employer&#x27;s old admirers, the tradesman and the Walachian, to whom Nana, sure of her future and longing to shed her skin, as she phrased it, had decided to give the go-by. &quot;There are a couple of leeches for you!&quot; she muttered. &quot;If they come back threaten to go to the police.&quot; Then she called Daguenet and Georges, who had remained behind in the anteroom, where they were hanging up their overcoats.  They had both met at the stage door in the Passage des Panoramas, and she had brought them home with her in a cab.  As there was nobody there yet, she shouted to them to come into the dressing room while Zoe was touching up her toilet.  Hurriedly and without changing her dress she had her hair done up and stuck white roses in her chignon and at her bosom.  The little room was littered with the drawing-room furniture, which the workmen had been compelled to roll in there, and it was full of a motley assemblage of round tables, sofas and armchairs, with their legs in air for the most part.  Nana was quite ready when her dress caught on a castor and tore upward.  At this she swore furiously; such things only happened to her!  Ragingly she took off her dress, a very simple affair of white foulard, of so thin and supple a texture that it clung about her like a long shift. But she put it on again directly, for she could not find another to her taste, and with tears in her eyes declared that she was dressed like a ragpicker.  Daguenet and Georges had to patch up the rent with pins, while Zoe once more arranged her hair.  All three hurried round her, especially the boy, who knelt on the floor with his hands among her skirts.  And at last she calmed down again when Daguenet assured her it could not be later than a quarter past twelve, seeing that by dint of scamping her words and skipping her lines she had effectually shortened the third act of the Blonde Venus. &quot;The play&#x27;s still far too good for that crowd of idiots,&quot; she said. &quot;Did you see?  There were thousands there tonight.  Zoe, my girl, you will wait in here.  Don&#x27;t go to bed, I shall want you.  By gum, it is time they came.  Here&#x27;s company!&quot; She ran off while Georges stayed where he was with the skirts of his coat brushing the floor.  He blushed, seeing Daguenet looking at him.  Notwithstanding which, they had conceived a tender regard the one for the other.  They rearranged the bows of their cravats in front of the big dressing glass and gave each other a mutual dose of the clothesbrush, for they were all white from their close contact with Nana. &quot;One would think it was sugar,&quot; murmured Georges, giggling like a greedy little child. A footman hired for the evening was ushering the guests into the small drawing room, a narrow slip of a place in which only four armchairs had been left in order the better to pack in the company. From the large drawing room beyond came a sound as of the moving of plates and silver, while a clear and brilliant ray of light shone from under the door.  At her entrance Nana found Clarisse Besnus, whom La Faloise had brought, already installed in one of the armchairs. &quot;Dear me, you&#x27;re the first of &#x27;em!&quot; said Nana, who, now that she was successful, treated her familiarly. &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s his doing,&quot; replied Clarisse.  &quot;He&#x27;s always afraid of not getting anywhere in time.  If I&#x27;d taken him at his word I shouldn&#x27;t have waited to take off my paint and my wig.&quot; The young man, who now saw Nana for the first time, bowed, paid her a compliment and spoke of his cousin, hiding his agitation behind an exaggeration of politeness.  But Nana, neither listening to him nor recognizing his face, shook hands with him and then went briskly toward Rose Mignon, with whom she at once assumed a most distinguished manner. &quot;Ah, how nice of you, my dear madame!  I was so anxious to have you here!&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s I who am charmed, I assure you,&quot; said Rose with equal amiability. &quot;Pray, sit down.  Do you require anything?&quot; &quot;Thank you, no!  Ah yes, I&#x27;ve left my fan in my pelisse, Steiner; just look in the right-hand pocket.&quot; Steiner and Mignon had come in behind Rose.  The banker turned back and reappeared with the fan while Mignon embraced Nana fraternally and forced Rose to do so also.  Did they not all belong to the same family in the theatrical world?  Then he winked as though to encourage Steiner, but the latter was disconcerted by Rose&#x27;s clear gaze and contented himself by kissing Nana&#x27;s hand. Just then the Count de Vandeuvres made his appearance with Blanche de Sivry.  There was an interchange of profound bows, and Nana with the utmost ceremony conducted Blanche to an armchair.  Meanwhile Vandeuvres told them laughingly that Fauchery was engaged in a dispute at the foot of the stairs because the porter had refused to allow Lucy Stewart&#x27;s carriage to come in at the gate.  They could hear Lucy telling the porter he was a dirty blackguard in the anteroom.  But when the footman had opened the door she came forward with her laughing grace of manner, announced her name herself, took both Nana&#x27;s hands in hers and told her that she had liked her from the very first and considered her talent splendid.  Nana, puffed up by her novel role of hostess, thanked her and was veritably confused.  Nevertheless, from the moment of Fauchery&#x27;s arrival she appeared preoccupied, and directly she could get near him she asked him in a low voice: &quot;Will he come?&quot; &quot;No, he did not want to,&quot; was the journalist&#x27;s abrupt reply, for he was taken by surprise, though he had got ready some sort of tale to explain Count Muffat&#x27;s refusal. Seeing the young woman&#x27;s sudden pallor, he became conscious of his folly and tried to retract his words. &quot;He was unable to; he is taking the countess to the ball at the Ministry of the Interior tonight.&quot; &quot;All right,&quot; murmured Nana, who suspected him of ill will, &quot;you&#x27;ll pay me out for that, my pippin.&quot; She turned on her heel, and so did he; they were angry.  Just then Mignon was pushing Steiner up against Nana, and when Fauchery had left her he said to her in a low voice and with the good-natured cynicism of a comrade in arms who wishes his friends to be happy: &quot;He&#x27;s dying of it, you know, only he&#x27;s afraid of my wife.  Won&#x27;t you protect him?&quot; Nana did not appear to understand.  She smiled and looked at Rose, the husband and the banker and finally said to the latter: &quot;Monsieur Steiner, you will sit next to me.&quot; With that there came from the anteroom a sound of laughter and whispering and a burst of merry, chattering voices, which sounded as if a runaway convent were on the premises.  And Labordette appeared, towing five women in his rear, his boarding school, as Lucy Stewart cruelly phrased it.  There was Gaga, majestic in a blue velvet dress which was too tight for her, and Caroline Hequet, clad as usual in ribbed black silk, trimmed with Chantilly lace.  Lea de Horn came next, terribly dressed up, as her wont was, and after her the big Tatan Nene, a good-humored fair girl with the bosom of a wet nurse, at which people laughed, and finally little Maria Blond, a young damsel of fifteen, as thin and vicious as a street child, yet on the high road to success, owing to her recent first appearance at the Folies.  Labordette had brought the whole collection in a single fly, and they were stlll laughing at the way they had been squeezed with Maria Blond on her knees.  But on entering the room they pursed up their lips, and all grew very conventional as they shook hands and exchanged salutations.  Gaga even affected the infantile and lisped through excess of genteel deportment.  Tatan Nene alone transgressed.  They had been telling her as they came along that six absolutely naked Negroes would serve up Nana&#x27;s supper, and she now grew anxious about them and asked to see them.  Labordette called her a goose and besought her to be silent. &quot;And Bordenave?&quot; asked Fauchery. &quot;Oh, you may imagine how miserable I am,&quot; cried Nana; &quot;he won&#x27;t be able to join us.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Rose Mignon, &quot;his foot caught in a trap door, and he&#x27;s got a fearful sprain.  If only you could hear him swearing, with his leg tied up and laid out on a chair!&quot; Thereupon everybody mourned over Bordenave&#x27;s absence.  No one ever gave a good supper without Bordenave.  Ah well, they would try and do without him, and they were already talking about other matters when a burly voice was heard: &quot;What, eh, what?  Is that the way they&#x27;re going to write my obituary notice?&quot; There was a shout, and all heads were turned round, for it was indeed Bordenave.  Huge and fiery-faced, he was standing with his stiff leg in the doorway, leaning for support on Simonne Cabiroche&#x27;s shoulder.  Simonne was for the time being his mistress.  This little creature had had a certain amount of education and could play the piano and talk English.  She was a blonde on a tiny, pretty scale and so delicately formed that she seemed to bend under Bordenave&#x27;s rude weight.  Yet she was smilingly submissive withal.  He postured there for some moments, for he felt that together they formed a tableau. &quot;One can&#x27;t help liking ye, eh?&quot; he continued.  &quot;Zounds, I was afraid I should get bored, and I said to myself, &#x27;Here goes.&#x27;&quot; But he interrupted himself with an oath. &quot;Oh, damn!&quot; Simonne had taken a step too quickly forward, and his foot had just felt his full weight.  He gave her a rough push, but she, still smiling away and ducking her pretty head as some animal might that is afraid of a beating, held him up with all the strength a little plump blonde can command.  Amid all these exclamations there was a rush to his assistance.  Nana and Rose Mignon rolled up an armchair, into which Bordenave let himself sink, while the other women slid a second one under his leg.  And with that all the actresses present kissed him as a matter of course.  He kept grumbling and gasping. &quot;Oh, damn!  Oh, damn!  Ah well, the stomach&#x27;s unhurt, you&#x27;ll see.&quot; Other guests had arrived by this time, and motion became impossible in the room.  The noise of clinking plates and silver had ceased, and now a dispute was heard going on in the big drawing room, where the voice of the manager grumbled angrily.  Nana was growing impatient, for she expected no more invited guests and wondered why they did not bring in supper.  She had just sent Georges to find out what was going on when, to her great surprise, she noticed the arrival of more guests, both male and female.  She did not know them in the least.  Whereupon with some embarrassment she questioned Bordenave, Mignon and Labordette about them.  They did not know them any more than she did, but when she turned to the Count de Vandeuvres he seemed suddenly to recollect himself.  They were the young men he had pressed into her service at Count Muffat&#x27;s.  Nana thanked him.  That was capital, capital!  Only they would all be terribly crowded, and she begged Labordette to go and have seven more covers set.  Scarcely had he left the room than the footman ushered in three newcomers.  Nay, this time the thing was becoming ridiculous; one certainly could never take them all in.  Nana was beginning to grow angry and in her haughtiest manner announced that such conduct was scarcely in good taste.  But seeing two more arrive, she began laughing; it was really too funny.  So much the worse.  People would have to fit in anyhow!  The company were all on their feet save Gaga and Rose and Bordenave, who alone took up two armchairs.  There was a buzz of voices, people talking in low tones and stifling slight yawns the while. &quot;Now what d&#x27;you say, my lass,&quot; asked Bordenave, &quot;to our sitting down at table as if nothing had happened?  We are all here, don&#x27;t you think?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, we&#x27;re all here, I promise you!&quot; she answered laughingly. She looked round her but grew suddenly serious, as though she were surprised at not finding someone.  Doubtless there was a guest missing whom she did not mention.  It was a case of waiting.  But a minute or two later the company noticed in their midst a tall gentleman with a fine face and a beautiful white beard.  The most astonishing thing about it was that nobody had seen him come in; indeed, he must have slipped into the little drawing room through the bedroom door, which had remained ajar.  Silence reigned, broken only by a sound of whispering.  The Count de Vandeuvres certainly knew who the gentleman was, for they both exchanged a discreet handgrip, but to the questions which the women asked him he replied by a smile only.  Thereupon Caroline Hequet wagered in a low voice that it was an English lord who was on the eve of returning to London to be married.  She knew him quite well--she had had him. And this account of the matter went the round of the ladies present, Maria Blond alone asserting that, for her part, she recognized a German ambassador.  She could prove it, because he often passed the night with one of her friends.  Among the men his measure was taken in a few rapid phrases.  A real swell, to judge by his looks! Perhaps he would pay for the supper!  Most likely.  It looked like it.  Bah!  Provided only the supper was a good one!  In the end the company remained undecided.  Nay, they were already beginning to forget the old white-bearded gentleman when the manager opened the door of the large drawing room. &quot;Supper is on the table, madame.&quot; Nana had already accepted Steiner&#x27;s proffered arm without noticing a movement on the part of the old gentleman, who started to walk behind her in solitary state.  Thus the march past could not be organized, and men and women entered anyhow, joking with homely good humor over this absence of ceremony.  A long table stretched from one end to the other of the great room, which had been entirely cleared of furniture, and this same table was not long enough, for the plates thereon were touching one another.  Four candelabra, with ten candles apiece, lit up the supper, and of these one was gorgeous in silver plate with sheaves of flowers to right and left of it. Everything was luxurious after the restaurant fashion; the china was ornamented with a gold line and lacked the customary monogram; the silver had become worn and tarnished through dint of continual washings; the glass was of the kind that you can complete an odd set of in any cheap emporium. The scene suggested a premature housewarming in an establishment newly smiled on by fortune and as yet lacking the necessary conveniences.  There was no central luster, and the candelabra, whose tall tapers had scarcely burned up properly, cast a pale yellow light among the dishes and stands on which fruit, cakes and preserves alternated symmetrically. &quot;You sit where you like, you know,&quot; said Nana.  &quot;It&#x27;s more amusing that way.&quot; She remained standing midway down the side of the table.  The old gentleman whom nobody knew had placed himself on her right, while she kept Steiner on her left hand.  Some guests were already sitting down when the sound of oaths came from the little drawing room.  It was Bordenave.  The company had forgotten him, and he was having all the trouble in the world to raise himself out of his two armchairs, for he was howling amain and calling for that cat of a Simonne, who had slipped off with the rest.  The women ran in to him, full of pity for his woes, and Bordenave appeared, supported, nay, almost carried, by Caroline, Clarisse, Tatan Nene and Maria Blond.  And there was much to-do over his installation at the table. &quot;In the middle, facing Nana!&quot; was the cry.  &quot;Bordenave in the middle!  He&#x27;ll be our president!&quot; Thereupon the ladies seated him in the middle.  But he needed a second chair for his leg, and two girls lifted it up and stretched it carefully out.  It wouldn&#x27;t matter; he would eat sideways. &quot;God blast it all!&quot; he grumbled.  &quot;We&#x27;re squashed all the same!  Ah, my kittens, Papa recommends himself to your tender care!&quot; He had Rose Mignon on his right and Lucy Stewart on his left hand, and they promised to take good care of him.  Everybody was now getting settled.  Count de Vandeuvres placed himself between Lucy and Clarisse; Fauchery between Rose Mignon and Caroline Hequet.  On the other side of the table Hector de la Faloise had rushed to get next Gaga, and that despite the calls of Clarisse opposite, while Mignon, who never deserted Steiner, was only separated from him by Blanche and had Tatan Nene on his left.  Then came Labordette and, finally, at the two ends of the table were irregular crowding groups of young men and of women, such as Simonne, Lea de Horn and Maria Blond.  It was in this region that Daguenet and Georges forgathered more warmly than ever while smilingly gazing at Nana. Nevertheless, two people remained standing, and there was much joking about it.  The men offered seats on their knees.  Clarisse, who could not move her elbows, told Vandeuvres that she counted on him to feed her.  And then that Bordenave did just take up space with his chairs!  There was a final effort, and at last everybody was seated, but, as Mignon loudly remarked, they were confoundedly like herrings in a barrel. &quot;Thick asparagus soup a la comtesse, clear soup a la Deslignac,&quot; murmured the waiters, carrying about platefuls in rear of the guests. Bordenave was loudly recommending the thick soup when a shout arose, followed by protests and indignant exclamations.  The door had just opened, and three late arrivals, a woman and two men, had just come in.  Oh dear, no!  There was no space for them!  Nana, however, without leaving her chair, began screwing up her eyes in the effort to find out whether she knew them.  The woman was Louise Violaine, but she had never seen the men before. &quot;This gentleman, my dear,&quot; said Vandeuvres, &quot;is a friend of mine, a naval officer, Monsieur de Foucarmont by name.  I invited him.&quot; Foucarmont bowed and seemed very much at ease, for he added: &quot;And I took leave to bring one of my friends with me.&quot; &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s quite right, quite right!&quot; said Nana.  &quot;Sit down, pray. Let&#x27;s see, you--Clarisse--push up a little.  You&#x27;re a good deal spread out down there.  That&#x27;s it--where there&#x27;s a will--&quot; They crowded more tightly than ever, and Foucarmont and Louise were given a little stretch of table, but the friend had to sit at some distance from his plate and ate his supper through dint of making a long arm between his neighbors&#x27; shoulders.  The waiters took away the soup plates and circulated rissoles of young rabbit with truffles and &quot;niokys&quot; and powdered cheese.  Bordenave agitated the whole table with the announcement that at one moment he had had the idea of bringing with him Prulliere, Fontan and old Bosc.  At this Nana looked sedate and remarked dryly that she would have given them a pretty reception.  Had she wanted colleagues, she would certainly have undertaken to ask them herself.  No, no, she wouldn&#x27;t have third-rate play actors.  Old Bosc was always drunk; Prulliere was fond of spitting too much, and as to Fontan, he made himself unbearable in society with his loud voice and his stupid doings. Then, you know, third-rate play actors were always out of place when they found themselves in the society of gentlemen such as those around her. &quot;Yes, yes, it&#x27;s true,&quot; Mignon declared. All round the table the gentlemen in question looked unimpeachable in the extreme, what with their evening dress and their pale features, the natural distinction of which was still further refined by fatigue.  The old gentleman was as deliberate in his movements and wore as subtle a smile as though he were presiding over a diplomatic congress, and Vandeuvres, with his exquisite politeness toward the ladies next to him, seemed to be at one of the Countess Muffat&#x27;s receptions.  That very morning Nana had been remarking to her aunt that in the matter of men one could not have done better-- they were all either wellborn or wealthy, in fact, quite the thing. And as to the ladies, they were behaving admirably.  Some of them, such as Blanche, Lea and Louise, had come in low dresses, but Gaga&#x27;s only was perhaps a little too low, the more so because at her age she would have done well not to show her neck at all.  Now that the company were finally settled the laughter and the light jests began to fail.  Georges was under the impression that he had assisted at merrier dinner parties among the good folks of Orleans.  There was scarcely any conversation.  The men, not being mutually acquainted, stared at one another, while the women sat quite quiet, and it was this which especially surprised Georges.  He thought them all smugs-- he had been under the impression that everybody would begin kissing at once. The third course, consisting of a Rhine carp a la Chambord and a saddle of venison a l&#x27;anglaise, was being served when Blanche remarked aloud: &quot;Lucy, my dear, I met your Ollivier on Sunday.  How he&#x27;s grown!&quot; &quot;Dear me, yes!  He&#x27;s eighteen,&quot; replied Lucy.  &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make me feel any younger.  He went back to his school yesterday.&quot; Her son Ollivier, whom she was wont to speak of with pride, was a pupil at the Ecole de Marine.  Then ensued a conversation about the young people, during which all the ladies waxed very tender.  Nana described her own great happiness.  Her baby, the little Louis, she said, was now at the house of her aunt, who brought him round to her every morning at eleven o&#x27;clock, when she would take him into her bed, where he played with her griffon dog Lulu.  It was enough to make one die of laughing to see them both burying themselves under the clothes at the bottom of the bed.  The company had no idea how cunning Louiset had already become. &quot;Oh, yesterday I did just pass a day!&quot; said Rose Mignon in her turn. &quot;Just imagine, I went to fetch Charles and Henry at their boarding school, and I had positively to take them to the theater at night. They jumped; they clapped their little hands: &#x27;We shall see Mamma act!  We shall see Mamma act!&#x27;  Oh, it was a to-do!&quot; Mignon smiled complaisantly, his eyes moist with paternal tenderness. &quot;And at the play itself,&quot; he continued, &quot;they were so funny!  They behaved as seriously as grown men, devoured Rose with their eyes and asked me why Mamma had her legs bare like that.&quot; The whole table began laughing, and Mignon looked radiant, for his pride as a father was flattered.  He adored his children and had but one object in life, which was to increase their fortunes by administering the money gained by Rose at the theater and elsewhere with the businesslike severity of a faithful steward.  When as first fiddle in the music hall where she used to sing he had married her, they had been passionately fond of one another.  Now they were good friends.  There was an understanding between them: she labored hard to the full extent of her talent and of her beauty; he had given up his violin in order the better to watch over her successes as an actress and as a woman.  One could not have found a more homely and united household anywhere! &quot;What age is your eldest?&quot; asked Vandeuvres. &quot;Henry&#x27;s nine,&quot; replied Mignon, &quot;but such a big chap for his years!&quot; Then he chaffed Steiner, who was not fond of children, and with quiet audacity informed him that were he a father, he would make a less stupid hash of his fortune.  While talking he watched the banker over Blanche&#x27;s shoulders to see if it was coming off with Nana.  But for some minutes Rose and Fauchery, who were talking very near him, had been getting on his nerves.  Was Rose going to waste time over such a folly as that?  In that sort of case, by Jove, he blocked the way.  And diamond on finger and with his fine hands in great evidence, he finished discussing a fillet of venison. Elsewhere the conversation about children continued.  La Faloise, rendered very restless by the immediate proximity of Gaga, asked news of her daughter, whom he had had the pleasure of noticing in her company at the Varietes.  Lili was quite well, but she was still such a tomboy!  He was astonished to learn that Lili was entering on her nineteenth year.  Gaga became even more imposing in his eyes, and when he endeavored to find out why she had not brought Lili with her: &quot;Oh no, no, never!&quot; she said stiffly.  &quot;Not three months ago she positively insisted on leaving her boarding school.  I was thinking of marrying her off at once, but she loves me so that I had to take her home--oh, so much against my will!&quot; Her blue eyelids with their blackened lashes blinked and wavered while she spoke of the business of settling her young lady.  If at her time of life she hadn&#x27;t laid by a sou but was still always working to minister to men&#x27;s pleasures, especially those very young men, whose grandmother she might well be, it was truly because she considered a good match of far greater importance than mere savings. And with that she leaned over La Faloise, who reddened under the huge, naked, plastered shoulder with which she well-nigh crushed him. &quot;You know,&quot; she murmured, &quot;if she fails it won&#x27;t be my fault.  But they&#x27;re so strange when they&#x27;re young!&quot; There was a considerable bustle round the table, and the waiters became very active.  After the third course the entrees had made their appearance; they consisted of pullets a la marechale, fillets of sole with shallot sauce and escalopes of Strasbourg pate.  The manager, who till then had been having Meursault served, now offered Chambertin and Leoville.  Amid the slight hubbub which the change of plates involved Georges, who was growing momentarily more astonished, asked Daguenet if all the ladies present were similarly provided with children, and the other, who was amused by this question, gave him some further details.  Lucy Stewart was the daughter of a man of English origin who greased the wheels of the trains at the Gare du Nord; she was thirty-nine years old and had the face of a horse but was adorable withal and, though consumptive, never died.  In fact, she was the smartest woman there and represented three princes and a duke.  Caroline Hequet, born at Bordeaux, daughter of a little clerk long since dead of shame, was lucky enough to be possessed of a mother with a head on her shoulders, who, after having cursed her, had made it up again at the end of a year of reflection, being minded, at any rate, to save a fortune for her daughter.  The latter was twenty-five years old and very passionless and was held to be one of the finest women it is possible to enjoy.  Her price never varied.  The mother, a model of orderliness, kept the accounts and noted down receipts and expenditures with severe precision.  She managed the whole household from some small lodging two stories above her daughter&#x27;s, where, moreover, she had established a workroom for dressmaking and plain sewing.  As to Blanche de Sivry, whose real name was Jacqueline Bandu, she hailed from a village near Amiens.  Magnificent in person, stupid and untruthful in character, she gave herself out as the granddaughter of a general and never owned to her thirty-two summers.  The Russians had a great taste for her, owing to her embonpoint.  Then Daguenet added a rapid word or two about the rest. There was Clarisse Besnus, whom a lady had brought up from Saint- Aubin-sur-Mer in the capacity of maid while the lady&#x27;s husband had started her in quite another line.  There was Simonne Cabiroche, the daughter of a furniture dealer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, who had been educated in a large boarding school with a view to becoming a governess.  Finally there were Maria Blond and Louise Violaine and Lea de Horn, who had all shot up to woman&#x27;s estate on the pavements of Paris, not to mention Tatan Nene, who had herded cows in Champagne till she was twenty. Georges listened and looked at these ladies, feeling dizzy and excited by the coarse recital thus crudely whispered in his ear, while behind his chair the waiters kept repeating in respectful tones: &quot;Pullets a la marechale; fillets of sole with ravigote sauce.&quot; &quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Daguenet, giving him the benefit of his experience, &quot;don&#x27;t take any fish; it&#x27;ll do you no good at this time of night.  And be content with Leoville: it&#x27;s less treacherous.&quot; A heavy warmth floated upward from the candelabras, from the dishes which were being handed round, from the whole table where thirty- eight human beings were suffocating.  And the waiters forgot themselves and ran when crossing the carpet, so that it was spotted with grease.  Nevertheless, the supper grew scarce any merrier.  The ladies trifled with their meat, left half of it uneaten.  Tatan Nene alone partook gluttonously of every dish.  At that advanced hour of the night hunger was of the nervous order only, a mere whimsical craving born of an exasperated stomach. At Nana&#x27;s side the old gentleman refused every dish offered him; he had only taken a spoonful of soup, and he now sat in front of his empty plate, gazing silently about.  There was some subdued yawning, and occasionally eyelids closed and faces became haggard and white. It was unutterably slow, as it always was, according to Vandeuvres&#x27;s dictum.  This sort of supper should be served anyhow if it was to be funny, he opined.  Otherwise when elegantly and conventionally done you might as well feed in good society, where you were not more bored than here.  Had it not been for Bordenave, who was still bawling away, everybody would have fallen asleep.  That rum old buffer Bordenave, with his leg duly stretched on its chair, was letting his neighbors, Lucy and Rose, wait on him as though he were a sultan.  They were entirely taken up with him, and they helped him and pampered him and watched over his glass and his plate, and yet that did not prevent his complaining. &quot;Who&#x27;s going to cut up my meat for me?  I can&#x27;t; the table&#x27;s a league away.&quot; Every few seconds Simonne rose and took up a position behind his back in order to cut his meat and his bread.  All the women took a great interest in the things he ate.  The waiters were recalled, and he was stuffed to suffocation.  Simonne having wiped his mouth for him while Rose and Lucy were changing his plate, her act struck him as very pretty and, deigning at length to show contentment: &quot;There, there, my daughter,&quot; he said, &quot;that&#x27;s as it should be. Women are made for that!&quot; There was a slight reawakening, and conversation became general as they finished discussing some orange sherbet.  The hot roast was a fillet with truffles, and the cold roast a galantine of guinea fowl in jelly.  Nana, annoyed by the want of go displayed by her guests, had begun talking with the greatest distinctness. &quot;You know the Prince of Scots has already had a stage box reserved so as to see the Blonde Venus when he comes to visit the exhibition.&quot; &quot;I very much hope that all the princes will come and see it,&quot; declared Bordenave with his mouth full. &quot;They are expecting the shah of Persia next Sunday,&quot; said Lucy Stewart.  Whereupon Rose Mignon spoke of the shah&#x27;s diamonds.  He wore a tunic entirely covered with gems; it was a marvel, a flaming star; it represented millions.  And the ladies, with pale faces and eyes glittering with covetousness, craned forward and ran over the names of the other kings, the other emperors, who were shortly expected.  All of them were dreaming of some royal caprice, some night to be paid for by a fortune. &quot;Now tell me, dear boy,&quot; Caroline Hequet asked Vandeuvres, leaning forward as she did so, &quot;how old&#x27;s the emperor of Russia?&quot; &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s &#x27;present time,&#x27;&quot; replied the count, laughing.  &quot;Nothing to be done in that quarter, I warn you.&quot; Nana made pretense of being hurt.  The witticism appeared somewhat too stinging, and there was a murmur of protest.  But Blanche gave a description of the king of Italy, whom she had once seen at Milan. He was scarcely good looking, and yet that did not prevent him enjoying all the women.  She was put out somewhat when Fauchery assured her that Victor Emmanuel could not come to the exhibition. Louise Violaine and Lea favored the emperor of Austria, and all of a sudden little Maria Blond was heard saying: &quot;What an old stick the king of Prussia is!  I was at Baden last year, and one was always meeting him about with Count Bismarck.&quot; &quot;Dear me, Bismarck!&quot; Simonne interrupted.  &quot;I knew him once, I did. A charming man.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s what I was saying yesterday,&quot; cried Vandeuvres, &quot;but nobody would believe me.&quot; And just as at Countess Sabine&#x27;s, there ensued a long discussion about Bismarck.  Vandeuvres repeated the same phrases, and for a moment or two one was again in the Muffats&#x27; drawing room, the only difference being that the ladies were changed.  Then, just as last night, they passed on to a discussion on music, after which, Foucarmont having let slip some mention of the assumption of the veil of which Paris was still talking, Nana grew quite interested and insisted on details about Mlle de Fougeray.  Oh, the poor child, fancy her burying herself alive like that!  Ah well, when it was a question of vocation!  All round the table the women expressed themselves much touched, and Georges, wearied at hearing these things a second time discussed, was beginning to ask Daguenet about Nana&#x27;s ways in private life, when the conversation veered fatefully back to Count Bismarck.  Tatan Nene bent toward Labordette to ask him privily who this Bismarck might be, for she did not know him. Whereupon Labordette, in cold blood, told her some portentous anecdotes.  This Bismarck, he said, was in the habit of eating raw meat and when he met a woman near his den would carry her off thither on his back; at forty years of age he had already had as many as thirty-two children that way. &quot;Thirty-two children at forty!&quot; cried Tatan Nene, stupefied and yet convinced.  &quot;He must be jolly well worn out for his age.&quot; There was a burst of merriment, and it dawned on her that she was being made game of. &quot;You sillies!  How am I to know if you&#x27;re joking?&quot; Gaga, meanwhile, had stopped at the exhibition.  Like all these ladies, she was delightedly preparing for the fray.  A good season, provincials and foreigners rushing into Paris!  In the long run, perhaps, after the close of the exhibition she would, if her business had flourished, be able to retire to a little house at Jouvisy, which she had long had her eye on. &quot;What&#x27;s to be done?&quot; she said to La Faloise.  &quot;One never gets what one wants!  Oh, if only one were still really loved!&quot; Gaga behaved meltingly because she had felt the young man&#x27;s knee gently placed against her own.  He was blushing hotly and lisping as elegantly as ever.  She weighed him at a glance.  Not a very heavy little gentleman, to be sure, but then she wasn&#x27;t hard to please. La Faloise obtained her address. &quot;Just look there,&quot; murmured Vandeuvres to Clarisse.  &quot;I think Gaga&#x27;s doing you out of your Hector.&quot; &quot;A good riddance, so far as I&#x27;m concerned,&quot; replied the actress. &quot;That fellow&#x27;s an idiot.  I&#x27;ve already chucked him downstairs three times.  You know, I&#x27;m disgusted when dirty little boys run after old women.&quot; She broke off and with a little gesture indicated Blanche, who from the commencement of dinner had remained in a most uncomfortable attitude, sitting up very markedly, with the intention of displaying her shoulders to the old distinguished-looking gentleman three seats beyond her. &quot;You&#x27;re being left too,&quot; she resumed. Vandeuvres smiled his thin smile and made a little movement to signify he did not care.  Assuredly &#x27;twas not he who would ever have prevented poor, dear Blanche scoring a success.  He was more interested by the spectacle which Steiner was presenting to the table at large.  The banker was noted for his sudden flames.  That terrible German Jew who brewed money, whose hands forged millions, was wont to turn imbecile whenever he became enamored of a woman. He wanted them all too!  Not one could make her appearance on the stage but he bought her, however expensive she might be.  Vast sums were quoted.  Twice had his furious appetite for courtesans ruined him.  The courtesans, as Vandeuvres used to say, avenged public morality by emptying his moneybags.  A big operation in the saltworks of the Landes had rendered him powerful on &#x27;change, and so for six weeks past the Mignons had been getting a pretty slice out of those same saltworks.  But people were beginning to lay wagers that the Mignons would not finish their slice, for Nana was showing her white teeth.  Once again Steiner was in the toils, and so deeply this time that as he sat by Nana&#x27;s side he seemed stunned; he ate without appetite; his lip hung down; his face was mottled.  She had only to name a figure.  Nevertheless, she did not hurry but continued playing with him, breathing her merry laughter into his hairy ear and enjoying the little convulsive movements which kept traversing his heavy face.  There would always be time enough to patch all that up if that ninny of a Count Muffat were really to treat her as Joseph did Potiphar&#x27;s wife. &quot;Leoville or Chambertin?&quot; murmured a waiter, who came craning forward between Nana and Steiner just as the latter was addressing her in a low voice. &quot;Eh, what?&quot; he stammered, losing his head.  &quot;Whatever you like--I don&#x27;t care.&quot; Vandeuvres gently nudged Lucy Stewart, who had a very spiteful tongue and a very fierce invention when once she was set going. That evening Mignon was driving her to exasperation. &quot;He would gladly be bottleholder, you know,&quot; she remarked to the count.  &quot;He&#x27;s in hopes of repeating what he did with little Jonquier.  You remember: Jonquier was Rose&#x27;s man, but he was sweet on big Laure.  Now Mignon procured Laure for Jonquier and then came back arm in arm with him to Rose, as if he were a husband who had been allowed a little peccadillo.  But this time the thing&#x27;s going to fail.  Nana doesn&#x27;t give up the men who are lent her.&quot; &quot;What ails Mignon that he should be looking at his wife in that severe way?&quot; asked Vandeuvres. He leaned forward and saw Rose growing exceedingly amorous toward Fauchery.  This was the explanation of his neighbor&#x27;s wrath.  He resumed laughingly: &quot;The devil, are you jealous?&quot; &quot;Jealous!&quot; said Lucy in a fury.  &quot;Good gracious, if Rose is wanting Leon I give him up willingly--for what he&#x27;s worth!  That&#x27;s to say, for a bouquet a week and the rest to match!  Look here, my dear boy, these theatrical trollops are all made the same way.  Why, Rose cried with rage when she read Leon&#x27;s article on Nana; I know she did.  So now, you understand, she must have an article, too, and she&#x27;s gaining it.  As for me, I&#x27;m going to chuck Leon downstairs-- you&#x27;ll see!&quot; She paused to say &quot;Leoville&quot; to the waiter standing behind her with his two bottles and then resumed in lowered tones: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to shout; it isn&#x27;t my style.  But she&#x27;s a cocky slut all the same.  If I were in her husband&#x27;s place I should lead her a lovely dance.  Oh, she won&#x27;t be very happy over it.  She doesn&#x27;t know my Fauchery: a dirty gent he is, too, palling up with women like that so as to get on in the world.  Oh, a nice lot they are!&quot; Vandeuvres did his best to calm her down, but Bordenave, deserted by Rose and by Lucy, grew angry and cried out that they were letting Papa perish of hunger and thirst.  This produced a fortunate diversion.  Yet the supper was flagging; no one was eating now, though platefuls of cepes a&#x27; l&#x27;italienne and pineapple fritters a la Pompadour were being mangled.  The champagne, however, which had been drunk ever since the soup course, was beginning little by little to warm the guests into a state of nervous exaltation.  They ended by paying less attention to decorum than before.  The women began leaning on their elbows amid the disordered table arrangements, while the men, in order to breathe more easily, pushed their chairs back, and soon the black coats appeared buried between the light-colored bodices, and bare shoulders, half turned toward the table, began to gleam as soft as silk.  It was too hot, and the glare of the candles above the table grew ever yellower and duller. Now and again, when a women bent forward, the back of her neck glowed golden under a rain of curls, and the glitter of a diamond clasp lit up a lofty chignon.  There was a touch of fire in the passing jests, in the laughing eyes, in the sudden gleam of white teeth, in the reflection of the candelabra on the surface of a glass of champagne.  The company joked at the tops of their voices, gesticulated, asked questions which no one answered and called to one another across the whole length of the room.  But the loudest din was made by the waiters; they fancied themselves at home in the corridors of their parent restaurant; they jostled one another and served the ices and the dessert to an accompaniment of guttural exclamations. &quot;My children,&quot; shouted Bordenave, &quot;you know we&#x27;re playing tomorrow. Be careful!  Not too much champagne!&quot; &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned,&quot; said Foucarmont, &quot;I&#x27;ve drunk every imaginable kind of wine in all the four quarters of the globe. Extraordinary liquors some of &#x27;em, containing alcohol enough to kill a corpse!  Well, and what d&#x27;you think?  Why, it never hurt me a bit. I can&#x27;t make myself drunk.  I&#x27;ve tried and I can&#x27;t.&quot; He was very pale, very calm and collected, and he lolled back in his chair, drinking without cessation. &quot;Never mind that,&quot; murmured Louise Violaine.  &quot;Leave off; you&#x27;ve had enough.  It would be a funny business if I had to look after you the rest of the night.&quot; Such was her state of exaltation that Lucy Stewart&#x27;s cheeks were assuming a red, consumptive flush, while Rose Mignon with moist eyelids was growing excessively melting.  Tatan Nene, greatly astonished at the thought that she had overeaten herself, was laughing vaguely over her own stupidity.  The others, such as Blanche, Caroline, Simonne and Maria, were all talking at once and telling each other about their private affairs--about a dispute with a coachman, a projected picnic and innumerable complex stories of lovers stolen or restored.  Meanwhile a young man near Georges, having evinced a desire to kiss Lea de Horn, received a sharp rap, accompanied by a &quot;Look here, you, let me go!&quot; which was spoken in a tone of fine indignation; and Georges, who was now very tipsy and greatly excited by the sight of Nana, hesitated about carrying out a project which he had been gravely maturing.  He had been planning, indeed, to get under the table on all fours and to go and crouch at Nana&#x27;s feet like a little dog.  Nobody would have seen him, and he would have stayed there in the quietest way.  But when at Lea&#x27;s urgent request Daguenet had told the young man to sit still, Georges all at once felt grievously chagrined, as though the reproof had just been leveled at him.  Oh, it was all silly and slow, and there was nothing worth living for!  Daguenet, nevertheless, began chaffing and obliged him to swallow a big glassful of water, asking him at the same time what he would do if he were to find himself alone with a woman, seeing that three glasses of champagne were able to bowl him over. &quot;Why, in Havana,&quot; resumed Foucarmont, &quot;they make a spirit with a certain wild berry; you think you&#x27;re swallowing fire!  Well now, one evening I drank more than a liter of it, and it didn&#x27;t hurt me one bit.  Better than that, another time when we were on the coast of Coromandel some savages gave us I don&#x27;t know what sort of a mixture of pepper and vitriol, and that didn&#x27;t hurt me one bit.  I can&#x27;t make myself drunk.&quot; For some moments past La Faloise&#x27;s face opposite had excited his displeasure.  He began sneering and giving vent to disagreeable witticisms.  La Faloise, whose brain was in a whirl, was behaving very restlessly and squeezing up against Gaga.  But at length he became the victim of anxiety; somebody had just taken his handkerchief, and with drunken obstinacy he demanded it back again, asked his neighbors about it, stooped down in order to look under the chairs and the guests&#x27; feet.  And when Gaga did her best to quiet him: &quot;It&#x27;s a nuisance,&quot; he murmured, &quot;my initials and my coronet are worked in the corner.  They may compromise me.&quot; &quot;I say, Monsieur Falamoise, Lamafoise, Mafaloise!&quot; shouted Foucarmont, who thought it exceedingly witty thus to disfigure the young man&#x27;s name ad infinitum. But La Faloise grew wroth and talked with a stutter about his ancestry.  He threatened to send a water bottle at Foucarmont&#x27;s head, and Count de Vandeuvres had to interfere in order to assure him that Foucarmont was a great joker.  Indeed, everybody was laughing.  This did for the already flurried young man, who was very glad to resume his seat and to begin eating with childlike submissiveness when in a loud voice his cousin ordered him to feed. Gaga had taken him back to her ample side; only from time to time he cast sly and anxious glances at the guests, for he ceased not to search for his handkerchief. Then Foucarmont, being now in his witty vein, attacked Labordette right at the other end of the table.  Louise Violaine strove to make him hold his tongue, for, she said, &quot;when he goes nagging at other people like that it always ends in mischief for me.&quot;  He had discovered a witticism which consisted in addressing Labordette as &quot;Madame,&quot; and it must have amused him greatly, for he kept on repeating it while Labordette tranquilly shrugged his shoulders and as constantly replied: &quot;Pray hold your tongue, my dear fellow; it&#x27;s stupid.&quot; But as Foucarmont failed to desist and even became insulting without his neighbors knowing why, he left off answering him and appealed to Count Vandeuvres. &quot;Make your friend hold his tongue, monsieur.  I don&#x27;t wish to become angry.&quot; Foucarmont had twice fought duels, and he was in consequence most politely treated and admitted into every circle.  But there was now a general uprising against him.  The table grew merry at his sallies, for they thought him very witty, but that was no reason why the evening should be spoiled.  Vandeuvres, whose subtle countenance was darkening visibly, insisted on his restoring Labordette his sex. The other men--Mignon, Steiner and Bordenave--who were by this time much exalted, also intervened with shouts which drowned his voice. Only the old gentleman sitting forgotten next to Nana retained his stately demeanor and, still smiling in his tired, silent way, watched with lackluster eyes the untoward finish of the dessert. &quot;What do you say to our taking coffee in here, duckie?&quot; said Bordenave.  &quot;We&#x27;re very comfortable.&quot; Nana did not give an immediate reply.  Since the beginning of supper she had seemed no longer in her own house.  All this company had overwhelmed and bewildered her with their shouts to the waiters, the loudness of their voices and the way in which they put themselves at their ease, just as though they were in a restaurant.  Forgetting her role of hostess, she busied herself exclusively with bulky Steiner, who was verging on apoplexy beside her.  She was listening to his proposals and continually refusing them with shakes of the head and that temptress&#x27;s laughter which is peculiar to a voluptuous blonde.  The champagne she had been drinking had flushed her a rosy- red; her lips were moist; her eyes sparkled, and the banker&#x27;s offers rose with every kittenish movement of her shoulders, with every little voluptuous lift and fall of her throat, which occurred when she turned her head.  Close by her ear he kept espying a sweet little satiny corner which drove him crazy.  Occasionally Nana was interrupted, and then, remembering her guests, she would try and be as pleased as possible in order to show that she knew how to receive.  Toward the end of the supper she was very tipsy.  It made her miserable to think of it, but champagne had a way of intoxicating her almost directly!  Then an exasperating notion struck her.  In behaving thus improperly at her table, these ladies were showing themselves anxious to do her an ugly turn.  Oh yes, she could see it all distinctly.  Lucy had given Foucarmont a wink in order to egg him on against Labordette, while Rose, Caroline and the others were doing all they could to stir up the men.  Now there was such a din you couldn&#x27;t hear your neighbor speak, and so the story would get about that you might allow yourself every kind of liberty when you supped at Nana&#x27;s.  Very well then!  They should see!  She might be tipsy, if you like, but she was still the smartest and most ladylike woman there. &quot;Do tell them to serve the coffee here, duckie,&quot; resumed Bordenave. &quot;I prefer it here because of my leg.&quot; But Nana had sprung savagely to her feet after whispering into the astonished ears of Steiner and the old gentleman: &quot;It&#x27;s quite right; it&#x27;ll teach me to go and invite a dirty lot like that.&quot; Then she pointed to the door of the dining room and added at the top of her voice: &quot;If you want coffee it&#x27;s there, you know.&quot; The company left the table and crowded toward the dining room without noticing Nana&#x27;s indignant outburst.  And soon no one was left in the drawing room save Bordenave, who advanced cautiously, supporting himself against the wall and cursing away at the confounded women who chucked Papa the moment they were chock-full. The waiters behind him were already busy removing the plates and dishes in obedience to the loudly voiced orders of the manager. They rushed to and fro, jostled one another, caused the whole table to vanish, as a pantomime property might at the sound of the chief scene-shifter&#x27;s whistle.  The ladies and gentlemen were to return to the drawing room after drinking their coffee. &quot;By gum, it&#x27;s less hot here,&quot; said Gaga with a slight shiver as she entered the dining room. The window here had remained open.  Two lamps illuminated the table, where coffee and liqueurs were set out.  There were no chairs, and the guests drank their coffee standing, while the hubbub the waiters were making in the next room grew louder and louder.  Nana had disappeared, but nobody fretted about her absence.  They did without her excellently well, and everybody helped himself and rummaged in the drawers of the sideboard in search of teaspoons, which were lacking.  Several groups were formed; people separated during supper rejoined each other, and there was an interchange of glances, of meaning laughter and of phrases which summed up recent situations. &quot;Ought not Monsieur Fauchery to come and lunch with us one of these days, Auguste?&quot; said Rose Mignon. Mignon, who was toying with his watch chain, eyed the journalist for a second or two with his severe glance.  Rose was out of her senses. As became a good manager, he would put a stop to such spendthrift courses.  In return for a notice, well and good, but afterward, decidedly not.  Nevertheless, as he was fully aware of his wife&#x27;s wrongheadedness and as he made it a rule to wink paternally at a folly now and again, when such was necessary, he answered amiably enough: &quot;Certainly, I shall be most happy.  Pray come tomorrow, Monsieur Fauchery.&quot; Lucy Stewart heard this invitation given while she was talking with Steiner and Blanche and, raising her voice, she remarked to the banker: &quot;It&#x27;s a mania they&#x27;ve all of them got.  One of them even went so far as to steal my dog.  Now, dear boy, am I to blame if you chuck her?&quot; Rose turned round.  She was very pale and gazed fixedly at Steiner as she sipped her coffee.  And then all the concentrated anger she felt at his abandonment of her flamed out in her eyes.  She saw more clearly than Mignon; it was stupid in him to have wished to begin the Jonquier ruse a second time--those dodgers never succeeded twice running.  Well, so much the worse for him!  She would have Fauchery! She had been getting enamored of him since the beginning of supper, and if Mignon was not pleased it would teach him greater wisdom! &quot;You are not going to fight?&quot; said Vandeuvres, coming over to Lucy Stewart. &quot;No, don&#x27;t be afraid of that!  Only she must mind and keep quiet, or I let the cat out of the bag!&quot; Then signing imperiously to Fauchery: &quot;I&#x27;ve got your slippers at home, my little man.  I&#x27;ll get them taken to your porter&#x27;s lodge for you tomorrow.&quot; He wanted to joke about it, but she swept off, looking like a queen. Clarisse, who had propped herself against a wall in order to drink a quiet glass of kirsch, was seen to shrug her shoulders.  A pleasant business for a man!  Wasn&#x27;t it true that the moment two women were together in the presence of their lovers their first idea was to do one another out of them?  It was a law of nature!  As to herself, why, in heaven&#x27;s name, if she had wanted to she would have torn out Gaga&#x27;s eyes on Hector&#x27;s account!  But la, she despised him!  Then as La Faloise passed by, she contented herself by remarking to him: &quot;Listen, my friend, you like &#x27;em well advanced, you do!  You don&#x27;t want &#x27;em ripe; you want &#x27;em mildewed!&quot; La Faloise seemed much annoyed and not a little anxious.  Seeing Clarisse making game of him, he grew suspicious of her. &quot;No humbug, I say,&quot; he muttered.  &quot;You&#x27;ve taken my handkerchief. Well then, give it back!&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s dreeing us with that handkerchief of his!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Why, you ass, why should I have taken it from you?&quot; &quot;Why should you?&quot; he said suspiciously.  &quot;Why, that you may send it to my people and compromise me.&quot; In the meantime Foucarmont was diligently attacking the liqueurs. He continued to gaze sneeringly at Labordette, who was drinking his coffee in the midst of the ladies.  And occasionally he gave vent to fragmentary assertions, as thus: &quot;He&#x27;s the son of a horse dealer; some say the illegitimate child of a countess.  Never a penny of income, yet always got twenty-five louis in his pocket!  Footboy to the ladies of the town!  A big lubber, who never goes with any of &#x27;em!  Never, never, never!&quot; he repeated, growing furious.  &quot;No, by Jove!  I must box his ears.&quot; He drained a glass of chartreuse.  The chartreuse had not the slightest effect upon him; it didn&#x27;t affect him &quot;even to that extent,&quot; and he clicked his thumbnail against the edge of his teeth. But suddenly, just as he was advancing upon Labordette, he grew ashy white and fell down in a heap in front of the sideboard.  He was dead drunk.  Louise Violaine was beside herself.  She had been quite right to prophesy that matters would end badly, and now she would have her work cut out for the remainder of the night.  Gaga reassured her.  She examined the officer with the eye of a woman of experience and declared that there was nothing much the matter and that the gentleman would sleep like that for at least a dozen or fifteen hours without any serious consequences.  Foucarmont was carried off. &quot;Well, where&#x27;s Nana gone to?&quot; asked Vandeuvres. Yes, she had certainly flown away somewhere on leaving the table. The company suddenly recollected her, and everybody asked for her. Steiner, who for some seconds had been uneasy on her account, asked Vandeuvres about the old gentleman, for he, too, had disappeared. But the count reassured him--he had just brought the old gentleman back.  He was a stranger, whose name it was useless to mention. Suffice it to say that he was a very rich man who was quite pleased to pay for suppers!  Then as Nana was once more being forgotten, Vandeuvres saw Daguenet looking out of an open door and beckoning to him.  And in the bedroom he found the mistress of the house sitting up, white-lipped and rigid, while Daguenet and Georges stood gazing at her with an alarmed expression. &quot;What IS the matter with you?&quot; he asked in some surprise. She neither answered nor turned her head, and he repeated his question. &quot;Why, this is what&#x27;s the matter with me,&quot; she cried out at length; &quot;I won&#x27;t let them make bloody sport of me!&quot; Thereupon she gave vent to any expression that occurred to her. Yes, oh yes, SHE wasn&#x27;t a ninny--she could see clearly enough.  They had been making devilish light of her during supper and saying all sorts of frightful things to show that they thought nothing of her! A pack of sluts who weren&#x27;t fit to black her boots!  Catch her bothering herself again just to be badgered for it after!  She really didn&#x27;t know what kept her from chucking all that dirty lot out of the house!  And with this, rage choked her and her voice broke down in sobs. &quot;Come, come, my lass, you&#x27;re drunk,&quot; said Vandeuvres, growing familiar.  &quot;You must be reasonable.&quot; No, she would give her refusal now; she would stay where she was. &quot;I am drunk--it&#x27;s quite likely!  But I want people to respect me!&quot; For a quarter of an hour past Daguenet and Georges had been vainly beseeching her to return to the drawing room.  She was obstinate, however; her guests might do what they liked; she despised them too much to come back among them. No, she never would, never.  They might tear her in pieces before she would leave her room! &quot;I ought to have had my suspicions,&quot; she resumed. &quot;It&#x27;s that cat of a Rose who&#x27;s got the plot up!  I&#x27;m certain Rose&#x27;ll have stopped that respectable woman coming whom I was expecting tonight.&quot; She referred to Mme Robert.  Vandeuvres gave her his word of honor that Mme Robert had given a spontaneous refusal.  He listened and he argued with much gravity, for he was well accustomed to similar scenes and knew how women in such a state ought to be treated.  But the moment he tried to take hold of her hands in order to lift her up from her chair and draw her away with him she struggled free of his clasp, and her wrath redoubled.  Now, just look at that!  They would never get her to believe that Fauchery had not put the Count Muffat off coming!  A regular snake was that Fauchery, an envious sort, a fellow capable of growing mad against a woman and of destroying her whole happiness.  For she knew this--the count had become madly devoted to her!  She could have had him! &quot;Him, my dear, never!&quot; cried Vandeuvres, forgetting himself and laughing loud. &quot;Why not?&quot; she asked, looking serious and slightly sobered. &quot;Because he&#x27;s thoroughly in the hands of the priests, and if he were only to touch you with the tips of his fingers he would go and confess it the day after.  Now listen to a bit of good advice. Don&#x27;t let the other man escape you!&quot; She was silent and thoughtful for a moment or two.  Then she got up and went and bathed her eyes.  Yet when they wanted to take her into the dining room she still shouted &quot;No!&quot; furiously.  Vandeuvres left the bedroom, smiling and without further pressing her, and the moment he was gone she had an access of melting tenderness, threw herself into Daguenet&#x27;s arms and cried out: &quot;Ah, my sweetie, there&#x27;s only you in the world.  I love you!  YES, I love you from the bottom of my heart!  Oh, it would be too nice if we could always live together.  My God!  How unfortunate women are!&quot; Then her eye fell upon Georges, who, seeing them kiss, was growing very red, and she kissed him too.  Sweetie could not be jealous of a baby!  She wanted Paul and Georges always to agree, because it would be so nice for them all three to stay like that, knowing all the time that they loved one another very much.  But an extraordinary noise disturbed them: someone was snoring in the room.  Whereupon after some searching they perceived Bordenave, who, since taking his coffee, must have comfortably installed himself there.  He was sleeping on two chairs, his head propped on the edge of the bed and his leg stretched out in front.  Nana thought him so funny with his open mouth and his nose moving with each successive snore that she was shaken with a mad fit of laughter.  She left the room, followed by Daguenet and Georges, crossed the dining room, entered the drawing room, her merriment increasing at every step. &quot;Oh, my dear, you&#x27;ve no idea!&quot; she cried, almost throwing herself into Rose&#x27;s arms.  &quot;Come and see it.&quot; All the women had to follow her.  She took their hands coaxingly and drew them along with her willy-nilly, accompanying her action with so frank an outburst of mirth that they all of them began laughing on trust.  The band vanished and returned after standing breathlessly for a second or two round Bordenave&#x27;s lordly, outstretched form.  And then there was a burst of laughter, and when one of them told the rest to be quiet Bordenave&#x27;s distant snorings became audible. It was close on four o&#x27;clock.  In the dining room a card table had just been set out, at which Vandeuvres, Steiner, Mignon and Labordette had taken their seats.  Behind them Lucy and Caroline stood making bets, while Blanche, nodding with sleep and dissatisfied about her night, kept asking Vandeuvres at intervals of five minutes if they weren&#x27;t going soon.  In the drawing room there was an attempt at dancing.  Daguenet was at the piano or &quot;chest of drawers,&quot; as Nana called it.  She did not want a &quot;thumper,&quot; for Mimi would play as many waltzes and polkas as the company desired.  But the dance was languishing, and the ladies were chatting drowsily together in the corners of sofas.  Suddenly, however, there was an outburst of noise.  A band of eleven young men had arrived and were laughing loudly in the anteroom and crowding to the drawing room. They had just come from the ball at the Ministry of the Interior and were in evening dress and wore various unknown orders.  Nana was annoyed at this riotous entry, called to the waiters who still remained in the kitchen and ordered them to throw these individuals out of doors.  She vowed that she had never seen any of them before. Fauchery, Labordette, Daguenet and the rest of the men had all come forward in order to enforce respectful behavior toward their hostess.  Big words flew about; arms were outstretched, and for some seconds a general exchange of fisticuffs was imminent. Notwithstanding this, however, a little sickly looking light-haired man kept insistently repeating: &quot;Come, come, Nana, you saw us the other evening at Peters&#x27; in the great red saloon!  Pray remember, you invited us.&quot; The other evening at Peters&#x27;?  She did not remember it all.  To begin with, what evening? And when the little light-haired man had mentioned the day, which was Wednesday, she distinctly remembered having supped at Peters&#x27; on the Wednesday, but she had given no invitation to anyone; she was almost sure of that. &quot;However, suppose you HAVE invited them, my good girl,&quot; murmured Labordette, who was beginning to have his doubts.  &quot;Perhaps you were a little elevated.&quot; Then Nana fell a-laughing.  It was quite possible; she really didn&#x27;t know.  So then, since these gentlemen were on the spot, they had her leave to come in.  Everything was quietly arranged; several of the newcomers found friends in the drawing room, and the scene ended in handshakings.  The little sickly looking light-haired man bore one of the greatest names in France.  Furthermore, the eleven announced that others were to follow them, and, in fact, the door opened every few moments, and men in white gloves and official garb presented themselves.  They were still coming from the ball at the Ministry. Fauchery jestingly inquired whether the minister was not coming, too, but Nana answered in a huff that the minister went to the houses of people she didn&#x27;t care a pin for.  What she did not say was that she was possessed with a hope of seeing Count Muffat enter her room among all that stream of people.  He might quite have reconsidered his decision, and so while talking to Rose she kept a sharp eye on the door. Five o&#x27;clock struck.  The dancing had ceased, and the cardplayers alone persisted in their game.  Labordette had vacated his seat, and the women had returned into the drawing room.  The air there was heavy with the somnolence which accompanies a long vigil, and the lamps cast a wavering light while their burned-out wicks glowed red within their globes.  The ladies had reached that vaguely melancholy hour when they felt it necessary to tell each other their histories. Blanche de Sivry spoke of her grandfather, the general, while Clarisse invented a romantic story about a duke seducing her at her uncle&#x27;s house, whither he used to come for the boar hunting.  Both women, looking different ways, kept shrugging their shoulders and asking themselves how the deuce the other could tell such whoppers! As to Lucy Stewart, she quietly confessed to her origin and of her own accord spoke of her childhood and of the days when her father, the wheel greaser at the Northern Railway Terminus, used to treat her to an apple puff on Sundays. &quot;Oh, I must tell you about it!&quot; cried the little Maria Blond abruptly.  &quot;Opposite to me there lives a gentleman, a Russian, an awfully rich man!  Well, just fancy, yesterday I received a basket of fruit--oh, it just was a basket!  Enormous peaches, grapes as big as that, simply wonderful for the time of year!  And in the middle of them six thousand-franc notes!  It was the Russian&#x27;s doing.  Of course I sent the whole thing back again, but I must say my heart ached a little--when I thought of the fruit!&quot; The ladies looked at one another and pursed up their lips.  At her age little Maria Blond had a pretty cheek!  Besides, to think that such things should happen to trollops like her!  Infinite was their contempt for her among themselves.  It was Lucy of whom they were particularly jealous, for they were beside themselves at the thought of her three princes.  Since Lucy had begnn taking a daily morning ride in the Bois they all had become Amazons, as though a mania possessed them. Day was about to dawn, and Nana turned her eyes away from the door, for she was relinquishing all hope.  The company were bored to distraction.  Rose Mignon had refused to sing the &quot;Slipper&quot; and sat huddled up on a sofa, chatting in a low voice with Fauchery and waiting for Mignon, who had by now won some fifty louis from Vandeuvres.  A fat gentleman with a decoration and a serious cast of countenance had certainly given a recitation in Alsatian accents of &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Sacrifice,&quot; a piece in which the Almighty says, &quot;By My blasted Name&quot; when He swears, and Isaac always answers with a &quot;Yes, Papa!&quot;  Nobody, however, understood what it was all about, and the piece had been voted stupid.  People were at their wits&#x27; end how to make merry and to finish the night with fitting hilarity.  For a moment or two Labordette conceived the idea of denouncing different women in a whisper to La Faloise, who still went prowling round each individual lady, looking to see if she were hiding his handkerchief in her bosom.  Soon, as there were still some bottles of champagne on the sideboard, the young men again fell to drinking.  They shouted to one another; they stirred each other up, but a dreary species of intoxication, which was stupid enough to drive one to despair, began to overcome the company beyond hope of recovery. Then the little fair-haired fellow, the man who bore one of the greatest names in France and had reached his wit&#x27;s end and was desperate at the thought that he could not hit upon something really funny, conceived a brilliant notion: he snatched up his bottle of champagne and poured its contents into the piano.  His allies were convulsed with laughter. &quot;La now!  Why&#x27;s he putting champagne into the piano?&quot; asked Tatan Nene in great astonishment as she caught sight of him. &quot;What, my lass, you don&#x27;t know why he&#x27;s doing that?&quot; replied Labordette solemnly.  &quot;There&#x27;s nothing so good as champagne for pianos.  It gives &#x27;em tone.&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; murmured Tatan Nene with conviction. And when the rest began laughing at her she grew angry.  How should she know?  They were always confusing her. Decidedly the evening was becoming a big failure.  The night threatened to end in the unloveliest way.  In a corner by themselves Maria Blond and Lea de Horn had begun squabbling at close quarters, the former accusing the latter of consorting with people of insufficient wealth.  They were getting vastly abusive over it, their chief stumbling block being the good looks of the men in question.  Lucy, who was plain, got them to hold their tongues. Good looks were nothing, according to her; good figures were what was wanted.  Farther off, on a sofa, an attache had slipped his arm round Simonne&#x27;s waist and was trying to kiss her neck, but Simonne, sullen and thoroughly out of sorts, pushed him away at every fresh attempt with cries of &quot;You&#x27;re pestering me!&quot; and sound slaps of the fan across his face.  For the matter of that, not one of the ladies allowed herself to be touched.  Did people take them for light women?  Gaga, in the meantime, had once more caught La Faloise and had almost hoisted him upon her knees while Clarisse was disappearing from view between two gentlemen, shaking with nervous laughter as women will when they are tickled.  Round about the piano they were still busy with their little game, for they were suffering from a fit of stupid imbecillty, which caused each man to jostle his fellow in his frantic desire to empty his bottle into the instrument.  It was a simple process and a charming one. &quot;Now then, old boy, drink a glass!  Devil take it, he&#x27;s a thirsty piano!  Hi!  &#x27;Tenshun!  Here&#x27;s another bottle!  You mustn&#x27;t lose a drop!&quot; Nana&#x27;s back was turned, and she did not see them.  Emphatically she was now falling back on the bulky Steiner, who was seated next to her.  So much the worse!  It was all on account of that Muffat, who had refused what was offered him.  Sitting there in her white foulard dress, which was as light and full of folds as a shift, sitting there with drooped eyelids and cheeks pale with the touch of intoxication from which she was suffering, she offered herself to him with that quiet expression which is peculiar to a good-natured courtesan.  The roses in her hair and at her throat had lost their leaves, and their stalks alone remained.  Presently Steiner withdrew his hand quickly from the folds of her skirt, where he had come in contact with the pins that Georges had stuck there.  Some drops of blood appeared on his fingers, and one fell on Nana&#x27;s dress and stained it. &quot;Now the bargain&#x27;s struck,&quot; said Nana gravely. The day was breaking apace.  An uncertain glimmer of light, fraught with a poignant melancholy, came stealing through the windows.  And with that the guests began to take their departure.  It was a most sour and uncomfortable retreat.  Caroline Hequet, annoyed at the loss of her night, announced that it was high time to be off unless you were anxious to assist at some pretty scenes.  Rose pouted as if her womanly character had been compromised.  It was always so with these girls; they didn&#x27;t know how to behave and were guilty of disgusting conduct when they made their first appearance in society! And Mignon having cleaned Vandeuvres out completely, the family took their departure.  They did not trouble about Steiner but renewed their invitation for tomorrow to Fauchery.  Lucy thereupon refused the journalist&#x27;s escort home and sent him back shrilly to his &quot;strolling actress.&quot;  At this Rose turned round immediately and hissed out a &quot;Dirty sow&quot; by way of answer.  But Mignon, who in feminine quarrels was always paternal, for his experience was a long one and rendered him superior to them, had already pushed her out of the house, telling her at the same time to have done.  Lucy came downstairs in solitary state behind them.  After which Gaga had to carry off La Faloise, ill, sobbing like a child, calling after Clarisse, who had long since gone off with her two gentlemen. Simonne, too, had vanished.  Indeed, none remained save Tatan, Lea and Maria, whom Labordette complaisantly took under his charge. &quot;Oh, but I don&#x27;t the least bit want to go to bed!&quot; said Nana.  &quot;One ought to find something to do.&quot; She looked at the sky through the windowpanes.  It was a livid sky, and sooty clouds were scudding across it.  It was six o&#x27;clock in the morning.  Over the way, on the opposite side of the Boulevard Haussmann, the glistening roofs of the still-slumbering houses were sharply outlined against the twilight sky while along the deserted roadway a gang of street sweepers passed with a clatter of wooden shoes.  As she viewed Paris thus grimly awakening, she was overcome by tender, girlish feelings, by a yearning for the country, for idyllic scenes, for things soft and white. &quot;Now guess what you&#x27;re to do,&quot; she said, coming back to Steiner. &quot;You&#x27;re going to take me to the Bois de Boulogne, and we&#x27;ll drink milk there.&quot; She clapped her hands in childish glee.  Without waiting for the banker&#x27;s reply--he naturally consented, though he was really rather bored and inclined to think of other things--she ran off to throw a pelisse over her shoulders.  In the drawing room there was now no one with Steiner save the band of young men.  These had by this time dropped the very dregs of their glasses into the piano and were talking of going, when one of their number ran in triumphantly.  He held in his hands a last remaining bottle, which he had brought back with him from the pantry. &quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute!&quot; he shouted.  &quot;Here&#x27;s a bottle of chartreuse; that&#x27;ll pick him up!  And now, my young friends, let&#x27;s hook it.  We&#x27;re blooming idiots.&quot; In the dressing room Nana was compelled to wake up Zoe, who had dozed off on a chair.  The gas was still alight, and Zoe shivered as she helped her mistress on with her hat and pelisse. &quot;Well, it&#x27;s over; I&#x27;ve done what you wanted me to,&quot; said Nana, speaking familiarly to the maid in a sudden burst of expansive confidence and much relieved at the thought that she had at last made her election.  &quot;You were quite right; the banker&#x27;s as good as another.&quot; The maid was cross, for she was still heavy with sleep.  She grumbled something to the effect that Madame ought to have come to a decision the first evening.  Then following her into the bedroom, she asked what she was going to do with &quot;those two,&quot; meaning Bordenave, who was snoring away as usual, and Georges, who had slipped in slyly, buried his head in a pillow and, finally falling asleep there, was now breathing as lightly and regularly as a cherub.  Nana in reply told her that she was to let them sleep on. But seeing Daguenet come into the room, she again grew tender.  He had been watching her from the kitchen and was looking very wretched. &quot;Come, my sweetie, be reasonable,&quot; she said, taking him in her arms and kissing him with all sorts of little wheedling caresses. &quot;Nothing&#x27;s changed; you know that it&#x27;s sweetie whom I always adore! Eh, dear?  I had to do it.  Why, I swear to you we shall have even nicer times now.  Come tomorrow, and we&#x27;ll arrange about hours.  Now be quick, kiss and hug me as you love me.  Oh, tighter, tighter than that!&quot; And she escaped and rejoined Steiner, feeling happy and once more possessed with the idea of drinking milk.  In the empty room the Count de Vandeuvres was left alone with the &quot;decorated&quot; man who had recited &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Sacrifice.&quot;  Both seemed glued to the card table; they had lost count of their whereabouts and never once noticed the broad light of day without, while Blanche had made bold to put her feet up on a sofa in order to try and get a little sleep. &quot;Oh, Blanche is with them!&quot; cried Nana.  &quot;We are going to drink milk, dear.  Do come; you&#x27;ll find Vandeuvres here when we return.&quot; Blanche got up lazily.  This time the banker&#x27;s fiery face grew white with annoyance at the idea of having to take that big wench with him too.  She was certain to bore him.  But the two women had already got him by the arms and were reiterating: &quot;We want them to milk the cow before our eyes, you know.&quot; CHAPTER V At the Varietes they were giving the thirty-fourth performance of the Blonde Venus.  The first act had just finished, and in the greenroom Simonne, dressed as the little laundress, was standing in front of a console table, surmounted by a looking glass and situated between the two corner doors which opened obliquely on the end of the dressing-room passage.  No one was with her, and she was scrutinizing her face and rubbing her finger up and down below her eyes with a view to putting the finishing touches to her make-up. The gas jets on either side of the mirror flooded her with warm, crude light. &quot;Has he arrived?&quot; asked Prulliere, entering the room in his Alpine admiral&#x27;s costume, which was set off by a big sword, enormous top boots and a vast tuft of plumes. &quot;Who d&#x27;you mean?&quot; said Simonne, taking no notice of him and laughing into the mirror in order to see how her lips looked. &quot;The prince.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t know; I&#x27;ve just come down.  Oh, he&#x27;s certainly due here tonight; he comes every time!&quot; Prulliere had drawn near the hearth opposite the console table, where a coke fire was blazing and two more gas jets were flaring brightly.  He lifted his eyes and looked at the clock and the barometer on his right hand and on his left.  They had gilded sphinxes by way of adornment in the style of the First Empire.  Then he stretched himself out in a huge armchair with ears, the green velvet of which had been so worn by four generations of comedians that it looked yellow in places, and there he stayed, with moveless limbs and vacant eyes, in that weary and resigned attitude peculiar to actors who are used to long waits before their turn for going on the stage. Old Bosc, too, had just made his appearance.  He came in dragging one foot behind the other and coughing.  He was wrapped in an old box coat, part of which had slipped from his shoulder in such a way as to uncover the gold-laced cloak of King Dagobert.  He put his crown on the piano and for a moment or two stood moodily stamping his feet.  His hands were trembling slightly with the first beginnings of alcoholism, but he looked a sterling old fellow for all that, and a long white beard lent that fiery tippler&#x27;s face of his a truly venerable appearance.  Then in the silence of the room, while the shower of hail was whipping the panes of the great window that looked out on the courtyard, he shook himself disgustedly. &quot;What filthy weather!&quot; he growled. Simonne and Prulliere did not move.  Four or five pictures--a landscape, a portrait of the actor Vernet--hung yellowing in the hot glare of the gas, and a bust of Potier, one of the bygone glories of the Varietes, stood gazing vacant-eyed from its pedestal.  But just then there was a burst of voices outside.  It was Fontan, dressed for the second act.  He was a young dandy, and his habiliments, even to his gloves, were entirely yellow. &quot;Now say you don&#x27;t know!&quot; he shouted, gesticulating.  &quot;Today&#x27;s my patron saint&#x27;s day!&quot; &quot;What?&quot; asked Simonne, coming up smilingly, as though attracted by the huge nose and the vast, comic mouth of the man.  &quot;D&#x27;you answer to the name of Achille?&quot; &quot;Exactly so!  And I&#x27;m going to get &#x27;em to tell Madame Bron to send up champagne after the second act.&quot; For some seconds a bell had been ringing in the distance.  The long- drawn sound grew fainter, then louder, and when the bell ceased a shout ran up the stair and down it till it was lost along the passages.  &quot;All on the stage for the second act!  All on the stage for the second act!&quot;  The sound drew near, and a little pale-faced man passed by the greenroom doors, outside each of which he yelled at the top of his shrill voice, &quot;On the stage for the second act!&quot; &quot;The deuce, it&#x27;s champagne!&quot; said Prulliere without appearing to hear the din.  &quot;You&#x27;re prospering!&quot; &quot;If I were you I should have it in from the cafe,&quot; old Bosc slowly announced.  He was sitting on a bench covered with green velvet, with his head against the wall. But Simonne said that it was one&#x27;s duty to consider Mme Bron&#x27;s small perquisites.  She clapped her hands excitedly and devoured Fontan with her gaze while his long goatlike visage kept up a continuous twitching of eyes and nose and mouth. &quot;Oh, that Fontan!&quot; she murmured.  &quot;There&#x27;s no one like him, no one like him!&quot; The two greenroom doors stood wide open to the corridor leading to the wings.  And along the yellow wall, which was brightly lit up by a gas lamp out of view, passed a string of rapidly moving shadows-- men in costume, women with shawls over their scant attire, in a word, the whole of the characters in the second act, who would shortly make their appearance as masqeuraders in the ball at the Boule Noire.  And at the end of the corridor became audible a shuffling of feet as these people clattered down the five wooden steps which led to the stage.  As the big Clarisse went running by Simonne called to her, but she said she would be back directly. And, indeed, she reappeared almost at once, shivering in the thin tunic and scarf which she wore as Iris. &quot;God bless me!&quot; she said.  &quot;It isn&#x27;t warm, and I&#x27;ve left my furs in my dressing room!&quot; Then as she stood toasting her legs in their warm rose-colored tights in front of the fireplace she resumed: &quot;The prince has arrived.&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot; cried the rest with the utmost curiosity. &quot;Yes, that&#x27;s why I ran down: I wanted to see.  He&#x27;s in the first stage box to the right, the same he was in on Thursday.  It&#x27;s the third time he&#x27;s been this week, eh?  That&#x27;s Nana; well, she&#x27;s in luck&#x27;s way!  I was willing to wager he wouldn&#x27;t come again.&quot; Simonne opened her lips to speak, but her remarks were drowned by a fresh shout which arose close to the greenroom.  In the passage the callboy was yelling at the top of his shrill voice, &quot;They&#x27;ve knocked!&quot; &quot;Three times!&quot; said Simonne when she was again able to speak.  &quot;It&#x27;s getting exciting.  You know, he won&#x27;t go to her place; he takes her to his.  And it seems that he has to pay for it too!&quot; &quot;Egad!  It&#x27;s a case of when one &#x27;has to go out,&#x27;&quot; muttered Prulliere wickedly, and he got up to have a last look at the mirror as became a handsome fellow whom the boxes adored. &quot;They&#x27;ve knocked!  They&#x27;ve knocked!&quot; the callboy kept repeating in tones that died gradually away in the distance as he passed through the various stories and corridors. Fontan thereupon, knowing how it had all gone off on the first occasion the prince and Nana met, told the two women the whole story while they in their turn crowded against him and laughed at the tops of their voices whenever he stooped to whisper certain details in their ears.  Old Bosc had never budged an inch--he was totally indifferent.  That sort of thing no longer interested him now.  He was stroking a great tortoise-shell cat which was lying curled up on the bench.  He did so quite beautifully and ended by taking her in his arms with the tender good nature becoming a worn-out monarch. The cat arched its back and then, after a prolonged sniff at the big white beard, the gluey odor of which doubtless disgusted her, she turned and, curling herself up, went to sleep again on the bench beside him.  Bosc remained grave and absorbed. &quot;That&#x27;s all right, but if I were you I should drink the champagne at the restaurant--its better there,&quot; he said, suddenly addressing Fontan when he had finished his recital. &quot;The curtain&#x27;s up!&quot; cried the callboy in cracked and long-drawn accents &quot;The curtain&#x27;s up!  The curtain&#x27;s up!&quot; The shout sounded for some moments, during which there had been a noise of rapid footsteps.  Through the suddenly opened door of the passage came a burst of music and a far-off murmur of voices, and then the door shut to again and you could hear its dull thud as it wedged itself into position once more. A heavy, peaceful, atmosphere again pervaded the greenroom, as though the place were situated a hundred leagues from the house where crowds were applauding.  Simonne and Clarisse were still on the topic of Nana.  There was a girl who never hurried herself! Why, yesterday she had again come on too late!  But there was a silence, for a tall damsel had just craned her head in at the door and, seeing that she had made a mistake, had departed to the other end of the passage.  It was Satin.  Wearing a hat and a small veil for the nonce she was affecting the manner of a lady about to pay a call. &quot;A pretty trollop!&quot; muttered Prulliere, who had been coming across her for a year past at the Cafe des Varietes.  And at this Simonne told them how Nana had recognized in Satin an old schoolmate, had taken a vast fancy to her and was now plaguing Bordenave to let her make a first appearance on the stage. &quot;How d&#x27;ye do?&quot; said Fontan, shaking hands with Mignon and Fauchery, who now came into the room. Old Bosc himself gave them the tips of his fingers while the two women kissed Mignon. &quot;A good house this evening?&quot; queried Fauchery. &quot;Oh, a splendid one!&quot; replied Prulliere.  &quot;You should see &#x27;em gaping.&quot; &quot;I say, my little dears,&quot; remarked Mignon, &quot;it must be your turn!&quot; Oh, all in good time!  They were only at the fourth scene as yet, but Bosc got up in obedience to instinct, as became a rattling old actor who felt that his cue was coming.  At that very moment the callboy was opening the door. &quot;Monsieur Bosc!&quot; he called.  &quot;Mademoiselle Simonne!&quot; Simonne flung a fur-lined pelisse briskly over her shoulders and went out.  Bosc, without hurrying at all, went and got his crown, which he settled on his brow with a rap.  Then dragging himself unsteadily along in his greatcoat, he took his departure, grumbling and looking as annoyed as a man who has been rudely disturbed. &quot;You were very amiable in your last notice,&quot; continued Fontan, addressing Fauchery.  &quot;Only why do you say that comedians are vain?&quot; &quot;Yes, my little man, why d&#x27;you say that?&quot; shouted Mignon, bringing down his huge hands on the journalist&#x27;s slender shoulders with such force as almost to double him up. Prulliere and Clarisse refrained from laughing aloud.  For some time past the whole company had been deriving amusement from a comedy which was going on in the wings.  Mignon, rendered frantic by his wife&#x27;s caprice and annoyed at the thought that this man Fauchery brought nothing but a certain doubiful notoriety to his household, had conceived the idea of revenging himself on the journalist by overwhelming him with tokens of friendship.  Every evening, therefore, when he met him behind scenes he would shower friendly slaps on his back and shoulders, as though fairly carried away by an outburst of tenderness, and Fauchery, who was a frail, small man in comparison with such a giant, was fain to take the raps with a strained smile in order not to quarrel with Rose&#x27;s husband. &quot;Aha, my buck, you&#x27;ve insulted Fontan,&quot; resumed Mignon, who was doing his best to force the joke.  &quot;Stand on guard!  One--two--got him right in the middle of his chest!&quot; He lunged and struck the young man with such force that the latter grew very pale and could not speak for some seconds.  With a wink Clarisse showed the others where Rose Mignon was standing on the threshold of the greenroom.  Rose had witnessed the scene, and she marched straight up to the journalist, as though she had failed to notice her husband and, standing on tiptoe, bare-armed and in baby costume, she held her face up to him with a caressing, infantine pout. &quot;Good evening, baby,&quot; said Fauchery, kissing her familiarly. Thus he indemnified himself.  Mignon, however, did not seem to have observed this kiss, for everybody kissed his wife at the theater. But he laughed and gave the journalist a keen little look.  The latter would assurely have to pay for Rose&#x27;s bravado. In the passage the tightly shutting door opened and closed again, and a tempest of applause was blown as far as the greenroom. Simonne came in after her scene. &quot;Oh, Father Bosc HAS just scored!&quot; she cried.  &quot;The prince was writhing with laughter and applauded with the rest as though he had been paid to.  I say, do you know the big man sitting beside the prince in the stage box?  A handsome man, with a very sedate expression and splendid whiskers!&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Count Muffat,&quot; replied Fauchery.  &quot;I know that the prince, when he was at the empress&#x27;s the day before yesterday, invited him to dinner for tonight.  He&#x27;ll have corrupted him afterward!&quot; &quot;So that&#x27;s Count Muffat!  We know his father-in-law, eh, Auguste?&quot; said Rose, addressing her remark to Mignon.  &quot;You know the Marquis de Chouard, at whose place I went to sing?  Well, he&#x27;s in the house too.  I noticed him at the back of a box.  There&#x27;s an old boy for you!&quot; Prulliere, who had just put on his huge plume of feathers, turned round and called her. &quot;Hi, Rose!  Let&#x27;s go now!&quot; She ran after him, leaving her sentence unfinished.  At that moment Mme Bron, the portress of the theater, passed by the door with an immense bouquet in her arms.  Simonne asked cheerfully if it was for her, but the porter woman did not vouchsafe an answer and only pointed her chin toward Nana&#x27;s dressing room at the end of the passage.  Oh, that Nana!  They were loading her with flowers!  Then when Mme Bron returned she handed a letter to Clarisse, who allowed a smothered oath to escape her.  That beggar La Faloise again! There was a fellow who wouldn&#x27;t let her alone!  And when she learned the gentleman in question was waiting for her at the porter&#x27;s lodge she shrieked: &quot;Tell him I&#x27;m coming down after this act.  I&#x27;m going to catch him one on the face.&quot; Fontan had rushed forward, shouting: &quot;Madame Bron, just listen.  Please listen, Madame Bron.  I want you to send up six bottles of champagne between the acts.&quot; But the callboy had again made his appearance.  He was out of breath, and in a singsong voice he called out: &quot;All to go on the stage!  It&#x27;s your turn, Monsieur Fontan.  Make haste, make haste!&quot; &quot;Yes, yes, I&#x27;m going, Father Barillot,&quot; replied Fontan in a flurry. And he ran after Mme Bron and continued: &quot;You understand, eh?  Six bottles of champagne in the greenroom between the acts.  It&#x27;s my patron saint&#x27;s day, and I&#x27;m standing the racket.&quot; Simonne and Clarisse had gone off with a great rustling of skirts. Everybody was swallowed up in the distance, and when the passage door had banged with its usual hollow sound a fresh hail shower was heard beating against the windows in the now-silent greenroom. Barillot, a small, pale-faced ancient, who for thirty years had been a servant in the theater, had advanced familiarly toward Mignon and had presented his open snuffbox to him.  This proffer of a pinch and its acceptance allowed him a minute&#x27;s rest in his interminable career up and down stairs and along the dressing-room passage.  He certainly had still to look up Mme Nana, as he called her, but she was one of those who followed her own sweet will and didn&#x27;t care a pin for penalties.  Why, if she chose to be too late she was too late!  But he stopped short and murmured in great surprise: &quot;Well, I never!  She&#x27;s ready; here she is!  She must know that the prince is here.&quot; Indeed, Nana appeared in the corridor.  She was dressed as a fish hag: her arms and face were plastered with white paint, and she had a couple of red dabs under her eyes.  Without entering the greenroom she contented herself by nodding to Mignon and Fauchery. &quot;How do?  You&#x27;re all right?&quot; Only Mignon shook her outstretched hand, and she hied royally on her way, followed by her dresser, who almost trod on her heels while stooping to adjust the folds of her skirt.  In the rear of the dresser came Satin, closing the procession and trying to look quite the lady, though she was already bored to death. &quot;And Steiner?&quot; asked Mignon sharply. &quot;Monsieur Steiner has gone away to the Loiret,&quot; said Barillot, preparing to return to the neighborhood of the stage.  &quot;I expect he&#x27;s gone to buy a country place in those parts.&quot; &quot;Ah yes, I know, Nana&#x27;s country place.&quot; Mignon had grown suddenly serious.  Oh, that Steiner!  He had promised Rose a fine house in the old days!  Well, well, it wouldn&#x27;t do to grow angry with anybody.  Here was a position that would have to be won again.  From fireplace to console table Mignon paced, sunk in thought yet still unconquered by circumstances.  There was no one in the greenroom now save Fauchery and himself.  The journalist was tired and had flung himself back into the recesses of the big armchair.  There he stayed with half-closed eyes and as quiet as quiet could be, while the other glanced down at him as he passed. When they were alone Mignon scorned to slap him at every turn.  What good would it have done, since nobody would have enjoyed the spectacle?  He was far too disinterested to be personally entertained by the farcical scenes in which he figured as a bantering husband.  Glad of this short-lived respite, Fauchery stretched his feet out languidly toward the fire and let his upturned eyes wander from the barometer to the clock.  In the course of his march Mignon planted himself in front of Potier&#x27;s bust, looked at it without seeming to see it and then turned back to the window, outside which yawned the darkling gulf of the courtyard. The rain had ceased, and there was now a deep silence in the room, which the fierce heat of the coke fire and the flare of the gas jets rendered still more oppressive.  Not a sound came from the wings: the staircase and the passages were deadly still. That choking sensation of quiet, which behind the scenes immediately precedes the end of an act, had begun to pervade the empty greenroom.  Indeed, the place seemed to be drowsing off through very breathlessness amid that faint murmur which the stage gives forth when the whole troupe are raising the deafening uproar of some grand finale. &quot;Oh, the cows!&quot; Bordenave suddeniy shouted in his hoarse voice. He had only just come up, and he was already howling complaints about two chorus girls who had nearly fallen flat on the stage because they were playing the fool together.  When his eye lit on Mignon and Fauchery he called them; he wanted to show them something.  The prince had just notified a desire to compliment Nana in her dressing room during the next interval.  But as he was leading them into the wings the stage manager passed. &quot;Just you find those hags Fernande and Maria!&quot; cried Bordenave savagely. Then calming down and endeavoring to assume the dignified expression worn by &quot;heavy fathers,&quot; he wiped his face with his pocket handkerchief and added: &quot;I am now going to receive His Highness.&quot; The curtain fell amid a long-drawn salvo of applause.  Then across the twilight stage, which was no longer lit up by the footlights, there followed a disorderly retreat.  Actors and supers and chorus made haste to get back to their dressing rooms while the sceneshifters rapidly changed the scenery.  Simonne and Clarisse, however, had remained &quot;at the top,&quot; talking together in whispers. On the stage, in an interval between their lines, they had just settled a little matter.  Clarisse, after viewing the thing in every light, found she preferred not to see La Faloise, who could never decide to leave her for Gaga, and so Simonne was simply to go and explain that a woman ought not to be palled up to in that fashion! At last she agreed to undertake the mission. Then Simonne, in her theatrical laundress&#x27;s attire but with furs over her shoulders, ran down the greasy steps of the narrow, winding stairs which led between damp walls to the porter&#x27;s lodge.  This lodge, situated between the actors&#x27; staircase and that of the management, was shut in to right and left by large glass partitions and resembled a huge transparent lantern in which two gas jets were flaring. There was a set of pigeonholes in the place in which were piled letters and newspapers, while on the table various bouquets lay awaiting their recipients in close proximity to neglected heaps of dirty plates and to an old pair of stays, the eyelets of which the portress was busy mending.  And in the middle of this untidy, ill- kept storeroom sat four fashionable, white-gloved society men.  They occupied as many ancient straw-bottomed chairs and, with an expression at once patient and submissive, kept sharply turning their heads in Mme Bron&#x27;s direction every time she came down from the theater overhead, for on such occasions she was the bearer of replies.  Indeed, she had but now handed a note to a young man who had hurried out to open it beneath the gaslight in the vestibule, where he had grown slightly pale on reading the classic phrase--how often had others read it in that very place!--&quot;Impossible tonight, my dearie!  I&#x27;m booked!&quot;  La Faloise sat on one of these chairs at the back of the room, between the table and the stove.  He seemed bent on passing the evening there, and yet he was not quite happy. Indeed, he kept tucking up his long legs in his endeavors to escape from a whole litter of black kittens who were gamboling wildly round them while the mother cat sat bolt upright, staring at him with yellow eyes. &quot;Ah, it&#x27;s you, Mademoiselle Simonne!  What can I do for you?&quot; asked the portress. Simonne begged her to send La Faloise out to her.  But Mme Bron was unable to comply with her wishes all at once.  Under the stairs in a sort of deep cupboard she kept a little bar, whither the supers were wont to descend for drinks between the acts, and seeing that just at that moment there were five or six tall lubbers there who, still dressed as Boule Noire masqueraders, were dying of thirst and in a great hurry, she lost her head a bit.  A gas jet was flaring in the cupboard, within which it was possible to descry a tin-covered table and some shelves garnished with half-emptied bottles.  Whenever the door of this coalhole was opened a violent whiff of alcohol mingled with the scent of stale cooking in the lodge, as well as with the penetrating scent of the flowers upon the table. &quot;Well now,&quot; continued the portress when she had served the supers, &quot;is it the little dark chap out there you want?&quot; &quot;No, no; don&#x27;t be silly!&quot; said Simonne.  &quot;It&#x27;s the lanky one by the side of the stove.  Your cat&#x27;s sniffing at his trouser legs!&quot; And with that she carried La Faloise off into the lobby, while the other gentlemen once more resigned themselves to their fate and to semisuffocation and the masqueraders drank on the stairs and indulged in rough horseplay and guttural drunken jests. On the stage above Bordenave was wild with the sceneshifters, who seemed never to have done changing scenes.  They appeared to be acting of set purpose--the prince would certainly have some set piece or other tumbling on his head. &quot;Up with it!  Up with it!&quot; shouted the foreman. At length the canvas at the back of the stage was raised into position, and the stage was clear.  Mignon, who had kept his eye on Fauchery, seized this opportunity in order to start his pummeling matches again.  He hugged him in his long arms and cried: &quot;Oh, take care!  That mast just missed crushing you!&quot; And he carried him off and shook him before setting him down again. In view of the sceneshifters&#x27; exaggerated mirth, Fauchery grew white.  His lips trembled, and he was ready to flare up in anger while Mignon, shamming good nature, was clapping him on the shoulder with such affectionate violence as nearly to pulverize him. &quot;I value your health, I do!&quot; he kept repeating.  &quot;Egad!  I should be in a pretty pickle if anything serious happened to you!&quot; But just then a whisper ran through their midst: &quot;The prince!  The prince!  And everybody turned and looked at the little door which opened out of the main body of the house.  At first nothing was visible save Bordenave&#x27;s round back and beefy neck, which bobbed down and arched up in a series of obsequious obeisances.  Then the prince made his appearance.  Largely and strongly built, light of beard and rosy of hue, he was not lacking in the kind of distinction peculiar to a sturdy man of pleasure, the square contours of whose limbs are clearly defined by the irreproachable cut of a frock coat. Behind him walked Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard, but this particular corner of the theater being dark, the group were lost to view amid huge moving shadows. In order fittingly to address the son of a queen, who would someday occupy a throne, Bordenave had assumed the tone of a man exhibiting a bear in the street.  In a voice tremulous with false emotion he kept repeating: &quot;If His Highness will have the goodness to follow me--would His Highness deign to come this way?  His Highness will take care!&quot; The prince did not hurry in the least.  On the contrary, he was greatly interested and kept pausing in order to look at the sceneshifters&#x27; maneuvers.  A batten had just been lowered, and the group of gaslights high up among its iron crossbars illuminated the stage with a wide beam of light.  Muffat, who had never yet been behind scenes at a theater, was even more astonished than the rest. An uneasy feeling of mingled fear and vague repugnance took possession of him.  He looked up into the heights above him, where more battens, the gas jets on which were burning low, gleamed like galaxies of little bluish stars amid a chaos of iron rods, connecting lines of all sizes, hanging stages and canvases spread out in space, like huge cloths hung out to dry. &quot;Lower away!&quot; shouted the foreman unexpectedly. And the prince himself had to warn the count, for a canvas was descending.  They were setting the scenery for the third act, which was the grotto on Mount Etna.  Men were busy planting masts in the sockets, while others went and took frames which were leaning against the walls of the stage and proceeded to lash them with strong cords to the poles already in position.  At the back of the stage, with a view to producing the bright rays thrown by Vulcan&#x27;s glowing forge, a stand had been fixed by a limelight man, who was now lighting various burners under red glasses.  The scene was one of confusion, verging to all appearances on absolute chaos, but every little move had been prearranged.  Nay, amid all the scurry the whistle blower even took a few turns, stepping short as he did so, in order to rest his legs. &quot;His Highness overwhelms me,&quot; said Bordenave, still bowing low. &quot;The theater is not large, but we do what we can.  Now if His Highness deigns to follow me--&quot; Count Muffat was already making for the dressing-room passage.  The really sharp downward slope of the stage had surprised him disagreeably, and he owed no small part of his present anxiety to a feeling that its boards were moving under his feet.  Through the open sockets gas was descried burning in the &quot;dock.&quot;  Human voices and blasts of air, as from a vault, came up thence, and, looking down into the depths of gloom, one became aware of a whole subterranean existence.  But just as the count was going up the stage a small incident occurred to stop him.  Two little women, dressed for the third act, were chatting by the peephole in the curtain.  One of them, straining forward and widening the hole with her fingers in order the better to observe things, was scanning the house beyond. &quot;I see him,&quot; said she sharply.  &quot;Oh, what a mug!&quot; Horrified, Bordenave had much ado not to give her a kick.  But the prince smiled and looked pleased and excited by the remark.  He gazed warmly at the little woman who did not care a button for His Highness, and she, on her part, laughed unblushingly.  Bordenave, however, persuaded the prince to follow him.  Muffat was beginning to perspire; he had taken his hat off.  What inconvenienced him most was the stuffy, dense, overheated air of the place with its strong, haunting smell, a smell peculiar to this part of a theater, and, as such, compact of the reek of gas, of the glue used in the manufacture of the scenery, of dirty dark nooks and corners and of questionably clean chorus girls.  In the passage the air was still more suffocating, and one seemed to breathe a poisoned atmosphere, which was occasionally relieved by the acid scents of toilet waters and the perfumes of various soaps emanating from the dressing rooms. The count lifted his eyes as he passed and glanced up the staircase, for he was well-nigh startled by the keen flood of light and warmth which flowed down upon his back and shoulders.  High up above him there was a clicking of ewers and basins, a sound of laughter and of people calling to one another, a banging of doors, which in their continual opening and shutting allowed an odor of womankind to escape--a musky scent of oils and essences mingling with the natural pungency exhaled from human tresses.  He did not stop.  Nay, he hastened his walk: he almost ran, his skin tingling with the breath of that fiery approach to a world he knew nothing of. &quot;A theater&#x27;s a curious sight, eh?&quot; said the Marquis de Chouard with the enchanted expression of a man who once more finds himself amid familiar surroundings. But Bordenave had at length reached Nana&#x27;s dressing room at the end of the passage.  He quietly turned the door handle; then, cringing again: &quot;If His Highness will have the goodness to enter--&quot; They heard the cry of a startled woman and caught sight of Nana as, stripped to the waist, she slipped behind a curtain while her dresser, who had been in the act of drying her, stood, towel in air, before them. &quot;Oh, it IS silly to come in that way!&quot; cried Nana from her hiding place.  &quot;Don&#x27;t come in; you see you mustn&#x27;t come in!&quot; Bordenave did not seem to relish this sudden flight. &quot;Do stay where you were, my dear.  Why, it doesn&#x27;t matter,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s His Highness.  Come, come, don&#x27;t be childish.&quot; And when she still refused to make her appearance--for she was startled as yet, though she had begun to laugh--he added in peevish, paternal tones: &quot;Good heavens, these gentlemen know perfectly well what a woman looks like.  They won&#x27;t eat you.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m not so sure of that,&quot; said the prince wittily. With that the whole company began laughing in an exaggerated manner in order to pay him proper court. &quot;An exquisitely witty speech--an altogether Parisian speech,&quot; as Bordenave remarked. Nana vouchsafed no further reply, but the curtain began moving. Doubtless she was making up her mind.  Then Count Muffat, with glowing cheeks, began to take stock of the dressing room.  It was a square room with a very low ceiling, and it was entirely hung with a light-colored Havana stuff.  A curtain of the same material depended from a copper rod and formed a sort of recess at the end of the room, while two large windows opened on the courtyard of the theater and were faced, at a distance of three yards at most, by a leprous- looking wall against which the panes cast squares of yellow light amid the surrounding darkness.  A large dressing glass faced a white marble toilet table, which was garnished with a disorderly array of flasks and glass boxes containing oils, essences and powders.  The count went up to the dressing glass and discovered that he was looking very flushed and had small drops of perspiration on his forehead.  He dropped his eyes and came and took up a position in front of the toilet table, where the basin, full of soapy water, the small, scattered, ivory toilet utensils and the damp sponges, appeared for some moments to absorb his attention.  The feeling of dizziness which he had experienced when he first visited Nana in the Boulevard Haussmann once more overcame him.  He felt the thick carpet soften under foot, and the gasjets burning by the dressing table and by the glass seemed to shoot whistling flames about his temples.  For one moment, being afraid of fainting away under the influence of those feminine odors which he now re-encountered, intensified by the heat under the low-pitched ceiling, he sat down on the edge of a softly padded divan between the two windows.  But he got up again almost directly and, returning to the dressing table, seemed to gaze with vacant eyes into space, for he was thinking of a bouquet of tuberoses which had once faded in his bedroom and had nearly killed him in their death.  When tuberoses are turning brown they have a human smell. &quot;Make haste!&quot; Bordenave whispered, putting his head in behind the curtain. The prince, however, was listening complaisantly to the Marquis de Chouard, who had taken up a hare&#x27;s-foot on the dressing table and had begun explaining the way grease paint is put on.  In a corner of the room Satin, with her pure, virginal face, was scanning the gentlemen keenly, while the dresser, Mme Jules by name, was getting ready Venus&#x27; tights and tunic.  Mme Jules was a woman of no age. She had the parchment skin and changeless features peculiar to old maids whom no one ever knew in their younger years.  She had indeed shriveled up in the burning atmosphere of the dressing rooms and amid the most famous thighs and bosoms in all Paris.  She wore everlastingly a faded black dress, and on her flat and sexless chest a perfect forest of pins clustered above the spot where her heart should have been. &quot;I beg your pardon, gentlemen,&quot; said Nana, drawing aside the curtain, &quot;but you took me by surprise.&quot; They all turned round.  She had not clothed herself at all, had, in fact, only buttoned on a little pair of linen stays which half revealed her bosom.  When the gentlemen had put her to flight she had scarcely begun undressing and was rapidly taking off her fishwife&#x27;s costume.  Through the opening in her drawers behind a corner of her shift was even now visible.  There she stood, bare- armed, bare-shouldered, bare-breasted, in all the adorable glory of her youth and plump, fair beauty, but she still held the curtain with one hand, as though ready to draw it to again upon the slightest provocation. &quot;Yes, you took me by surprise!  I never shall dare--&quot; she stammered in pretty, mock confusion, while rosy blushes crossed her neck and shoulders and smiles of embarrassment played about her lips. &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t apologize,&quot; cried Bordenave, &quot;since these gentlemen approve of your good looks!&quot; But she still tried the hesitating, innocent, girlish game, and, shivering as though someone were tickling her, she continued: &quot;His Highness does me too great an honor.  I beg His Highness will excuse my receiving him thus--&quot; &quot;It is I who am importunate,&quot; said the prince, &quot;but, madame, I could not resist the desire of complimenting you.&quot; Thereupon, in order to reach her dressing table, she walked very quietly and just as she was through the midst of the gentlemen, who made way for her to pass. She had strongly marked hips, which filled her drawers out roundly, while with swelling bosom she still continued bowing and smiling her delicate little smile.  Suddenly she seemed to recognize Count Muffat, and she extended her hand to him as an old friend.  Then she scolded him for not having come to her supper party.  His Highness deigned to chaff Muffat about this, and the latter stammered and thrilled again at the thought that for one second he had held in his own feverish clasp a little fresh and perfumed hand.  The count had dined excellently at the prince&#x27;s, who, indeed, was a heroic eater and drinker.  Both of them were even a little intoxicated, but they behaved very creditably.  To hide the commotion within him Muffat could only remark about the heat. &quot;Good heavens, how hot it is here!&quot; he said.  &quot;How do you manage to live in such a temperature, madame?&quot; And conversation was about to ensue on this topic when noisy voices were heard at the dressing-room door.  Bordenave drew back the slide over a grated peephole of the kind used in convents.  Fontan was outside with Prulliere and Bosc, and all three had bottles under their arms and their hands full of glasses.  He began knocking and shouting out that it was his patron saint&#x27;s day and that he was standing champagne round.  Nana consulted the prince with a glance. Eh!  Oh dear, yes!  His Highness did not want to be in anyone&#x27;s way; he would be only too happy!  But without waiting for permission Fontan came in, repeating in baby accents: &quot;Me not a cad, me pay for champagne!&quot; Then all of a sudden he became aware of the prince&#x27;s presence of which he had been totally ignorant.  He stopped short and, assuming an air of farcical solemnity, announced: &quot;King Dagobert is in the corridor and is desirous of drinking the health of His Royal Highness.&quot; The prince having made answer with a smile, Fontan&#x27;s sally was voted charming.  But the dressing room was too small to accommodate everybody, and it became necessary to crowd up anyhow, Satin and Mme Jules standing back against the curtain at the end and the men clustering closely round the half-naked Nana.  The three actors still had on the costumes they had been wearing in the second act, and while Prulliere took off his Alpine admiral&#x27;s cocked hat, the huge plume of which would have knocked the ceiling, Bosc, in his purple cloak and tinware crown, steadied himself on his tipsy old legs and greeted the prince as became a monarch receiving the son of a powerful neighbor.  The glasses were filled, and the company began clinking them together. &quot;I drink to Your Highness!&quot; said ancient Bosc royally. &quot;To the army!&quot; added Prulliere. &quot;To Venus!&quot; cried Fontan. The prince complaisantly poised his glass, waited quietly, bowed thrice and murmured: &quot;Madame!  Admiral!  Your Majesty!&quot; Then he drank it off.  Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard had followed his example.  There was no more jesting now--the company were at court.  Actual life was prolonged in the life of the theater, and a sort of solemn farce was enacted under the hot flare of the gas.  Nana, quite forgetting that she was in her drawers and that a corner of her shift stuck out behind, became the great lady, the queen of love, in act to open her most private palace chambers to state dignitaries.  In every sentence she used the words &quot;Royal Highness&quot; and, bowing with the utmost conviction, treated the masqueraders, Bosc and Prulliere, as if the one were a sovereign and the other his attendant minister.  And no one dreamed of smiling at this strange contrast, this real prince, this heir to a throne, drinking a petty actor&#x27;s champagne and taking his ease amid a carnival of gods, a masquerade of royalty, in the society of dressers and courtesans, shabby players and showmen of venal beauty. Bordenave was simply ravished by the dramatic aspects of the scene and began dreaming of the receipts which would have accrued had His Highness only consented thus to appear in the second act of the Blonde Venus. &quot;I say, shall we have our little women down?&quot; he cried, becoming familiar. Nana would not hear of it.  But notwithstanding this, she was giving way herself.  Fontan attracted her with his comic make-up.  She brushed against him and, eying him as a woman in the family way might do when she fancies some unpleasant kind of food, she suddenly became extremely familiar: &quot;Now then, fill up again, ye great brute!&quot; Fontan charged the glasses afresh, and the company drank, repeating the same toasts. &quot;To His Highness!&quot; &quot;To the army!&quot; &quot;To Venus!&quot; But with that Nana made a sign and obtained silence.  She raised her glass and cried: &quot;No, no!  To Fontan!  It&#x27;s Fontan&#x27;s day; to Fontan!  To Fontan!&quot; Then they clinked glasses a third time and drank Fontan with all the honors.  The prince, who had noticed the young woman devouring the actor with her eyes, saluted him with a &quot;Monsieur Fontan, I drink to your success!&quot;  This he said with his customary courtesy. But meanwhile the tail of his highness&#x27;s frock coat was sweeping the marble of the dressing table.  The place, indeed, was like an alcove or narrow bathroom, full as it was of the steam of hot water and sponges and of the strong scent of essences which mingled with the tartish, intoxicating fumes of the champagne.  The prince and Count Muffat, between whom Nana was wedged, had to lift up their hands so as not to brush against her hips or her breast with every little movement.  And there stood Mme Jules, waiting, cool and rigid as ever, while Satin, marveling in the depths of her vicious soul to see a prince and two gentlemen in black coats going after a naked woman in the society of dressed-up actors, secretly concluded that fashionable people were not so very particular after all. But Father Barillot&#x27;s tinkling bell approached along the passage. At the door of the dressing room he stood amazed when he caught sight of the three actors still clad in the costumes which they had worn in the second act. &quot;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&quot; he stammered, &quot;do please make haste. They&#x27;ve just rung the bell in the public foyer.&quot; &quot;Bah, the public will have to wait!&quot; said Bordenave placidly. However, as the bottles were now empty, the comedians went upstairs to dress after yet another interchange of civilities.  Bosc, having dipped his beard in the champagne, had taken it off, and under his venerable disguise the drunkard had suddenly reappeared.  His was the haggard, empurpled face of the old actor who has taken to drink. At the foot of the stairs he was heard remarking to Fontan in his boozy voice: &quot;I pulverized him, eh?&quot; He was alluding to the prince. In Nana&#x27;s dressing room none now remained save His Highness, the count and the marquis.  Bordenave had withdrawn with Barillot, whom he advised not to knock without first letting Madame know. &quot;You will excuse me, gentlemen?&quot; asked Nana, again setting to work to make up her arms and face, of which she was now particularly careful, owing to her nude appearance in the third act. The prince seated himself by the Marquis de Chouard on the divan, and Count Muffat alone remained standing.  In that suffocating heat the two glasses of champagne they had drunk had increased their intoxication.  Satin, when she saw the gentlemen thus closeting themselves with her friend, had deemed it discreet to vanish behind the curtain, where she sat waiting on a trunk, much annoyed at being compelled to remain motionless, while Mme Jules came and went quietly without word or look. &quot;You sang your numbers marvelously,&quot; said the prince. And with that they began a conversation, but their sentences were short and their pauses frequent.  Nana, indeed, was not always able to reply.  After rubbing cold cream over her arms and face with the palm of her hand she laid on the grease paint with the corner of a towel.  For one second only she ceased looking in the glass and smilingly stole a glance at the prince. &quot;His Highness is spoiling me,&quot; she murmured without putting down the grease paint. Her task was a complicated one, and the Marquis de Chouard followed it with an expression of devout enjoyment.  He spoke in his turn. &quot;Could not the band accompany you more softly?&quot; he said.  &quot;It drowns your voice, and that&#x27;s an unpardonable crime.&quot; This time Nana did not turn round.  She had taken up the hare&#x27;s-foot and was lightly manipulating it.  All her attention was concentrated on this action, and she bent forward over her toilet table so very far that the white round contour of her drawers and the little patch of chemise stood out with the unwonted tension.  But she was anxious to prove that she appreciated the old man&#x27;s compliment and therefore made a little swinging movement with her hips. Silence reigned.  Mme Jules had noticed a tear in the right leg of her drawers.  She took a pin from over her heart and for a second or so knelt on the ground, busily at work about Nana&#x27;s leg, while the young woman, without seeming to notice her presence, applied the rice powder, taking extreme pains as she did so, to avoid putting any on the upper part of her cheeks.  But when the prince remarked that if she were to come and sing in London all England would want to applaud her, she laughed amiably and turned round for a moment with her left cheek looking very white amid a perfect cloud of powder.  Then she became suddenly serious, for she had come to the operation of rouging.  And with her face once more close to the mirror, she dipped her finger in a jar and began applying the rouge below her eyes and gently spreading it back toward her temples.  The gentlemen maintained a respectful silence. Count Muffat, indeed, had not yet opened his lips.  He was thinking perforce of his own youth.  The bedroom of his childish days had been quite cold, and later, when he had reached the age of sixteen and would give his mother a good-night kiss every evening, he used to carry the icy feeling of the embrace into the world of dreams. One day in passing a half-open door he had caught sight of a maidservant washing herself, and that was the solitary recollection which had in any way troubled his peace of mind from the days of puberty till the time of marriage.  Afterward he had found his wife strictly obedient to her conjugal duties but had himself felt a species of religious dislike to them.  He had grown to man&#x27;s estate and was now aging, in ignorance of the flesh, in the humble observance of rigid devotional practices and in obedience to a rule of life full of precepts and moral laws.  And now suddenly he was dropped down in this actress&#x27;s dressing room in the presence of this undraped courtesan. He, who had never seen the Countess Muffat putting on her garters, was witnessing, amid that wild disarray of jars and basins and that strong, sweet perfume, the intimate details of a woman&#x27;s toilet. His whole being was in turmoil; he was terrified by the stealthy, all-pervading influence which for some time past Nana&#x27;s presence had been exercising over him, and he recalled to mind the pious accounts of diabolic possession which had amused his early years.  He was a believer in the devil, and, in a confused kind of way, Nana was he, with her laughter and her bosom and her hips, which seemed swollen with many vices.  But he promised himself that he would be strong-- nay, he would know how to defend himself. &quot;Well then, it&#x27;s agreed,&quot; said the prince, lounging quite comfortably on the divan.  &quot;You will come to London next year, and we shall receive you so cordially that you will never return to France again.  Ah, my dear Count, you don&#x27;t value your pretty women enough.  We shall take them all from you!&quot; &quot;That won&#x27;t make much odds to him,&quot; murmured the Marquis de Chouard wickedly, for he occasionally said a risky thing among friends. &quot;The count is virtue itself.&quot; Hearing his virtue mentioned, Nana looked at him so comically that Muffat felt a keen twinge of annoyance.  But directly afterward he was surprised and angry with himself.  Why, in the presence of this courtesan, should the idea of being virtuous embarrass him?  He could have struck her.  But in attempting to take up a brush Nana had just let it drop on the ground, and as she stooped to pick it up he rushed forward.  Their breath mingled for one moment, and the loosened tresses of Venus flowed over his hands.  But remorse mingled with his enjoyment, a kind of enjoyment, moreover, peculiar to good Catholics, whom the fear of hell torments in the midst of their sin. At this moment Father Barillot&#x27;s voice was heard outside the door. &quot;May I give the knocks, madame?  The house is growing impatient.&quot; &quot;All in good time,&quot; answered Nana quietly. She had dipped her paint brush in a pot of kohl, and with the point of her nose close to the glass and her left eye closed she passed it delicately along between her eyelashes.  Muffat stood behind her, looking on.  He saw her reflection in the mirror, with her rounded shoulders and her bosom half hidden by a rosy shadow.  And despite all his endeavors he could not turn away his gaze from that face so merry with dimples and so worn with desire, which the closed eye rendered more seductive.  When she shut her right eye and passed the brush along it he understood that he belonged to her. &quot;They are stamping their feet, madame,&quot; the callboy once more cried. &quot;They&#x27;ll end by smashing the seats.  May I give the knocks?&quot; &quot;Oh, bother!&quot; said Nana impatiently.  &quot;Knock away; I don&#x27;t care!  If I&#x27;m not ready, well, they&#x27;ll have to wait for me!&quot; She grew calm again and, turning to the gentlemen, added with a smile: &quot;It&#x27;s true: we&#x27;ve only got a minute left for our talk.&quot; Her face and arms were now finished, and with her fingers she put two large dabs of carmine on her lips.  Count Muffat felt more excited than ever.  He was ravished by the perverse transformation wrought by powders and paints and filled by a lawless yearning for those young painted charms, for the too-red mouth and the too-white face and the exaggerated eyes, ringed round with black and burning and dying for very love.  Meanwhile Nana went behind the curtain for a second or two in order to take off her drawers and slip on Venus&#x27; tights.  After which, with tranquil immodesty, she came out and undid her little linen stays and held out her arms to Mme Jules, who drew the short-sleeved tunic over them. &quot;Make haste; they&#x27;re growing angry!&quot; she muttered. The prince with half-closed eyes marked the swelling lines of her bosom with an air of connoisseurship, while the Marquis de Chouard wagged his head involuntarily.  Muffat gazed at the carpet in order not to see any more.  At length Venus, with only her gauze veil over her shoulders, was ready to go on the stage.  Mme Jules, with vacant, unconcerned eyes and an expression suggestive of a little elderly wooden doll, still kept circling round her.  With brisk movements she took pins out of the inexhaustible pincushion over her heart and pinned up Venus&#x27; tunic, but as she ran over all those plump nude charms with her shriveled hands, nothing was suggested to her.  She was as one whom her sex does not concern. &quot;There!&quot; said the young woman, taking a final look at herself in the mirror. Bordenave was back again.  He was anxious and said the third act had begun. &quot;Very well!  I&#x27;m coming,&quot; replied Nana.  &quot;Here&#x27;s a pretty fuss! Why, it&#x27;s usually I that waits for the others.&quot; The gentlemen left the dressing room, but they did not say good-by, for the prince had expressed a desire to assist behind the scenes at the performance of the third act.  Left alone, Nana seemed greatly surprised and looked round her in all directions. &quot;Where can she be?&quot; she queried. She was searching for Satin.  When she had found her again, waiting on her trunk behind the curtain, Satin quietly replied: &quot;Certainly I didn&#x27;t want to be in your way with all those men there!&quot; And she added further that she was going now.  But Nana held her back.  What a silly girl she was!  Now that Bordenave had agreed to take her on!  Why, the bargain was to be struck after the play was over!  Satin hesitated.  There were too many bothers; she was out of her element!  Nevertheless, she stayed. As the prince was coming down the little wooden staircase a strange sound of smothered oaths and stamping, scuffling feet became audible on the other side of the theater.  The actors waiting for their cues were being scared by quite a serious episode.  For some seconds past Mignon had been renewing his jokes and smothering Fauchery with caresses.  He had at last invented a little game of a novel kind and had begun flicking the other&#x27;s nose in order, as he phrased it, to keep the flies off him.  This kind of game naturally diverted the actors to any extent. But success had suddenly thrown Mignon off his balance.  He had launched forth into extravagant courses and had given the journalist a box on the ear, an actual, a vigorous, box on the ear.  This time he had gone too far: in the presence of so many spectators it was impossible for Fauchery to pocket such a blow with laughing equanimity.  Whereupon the two men had desisted from their farce, had sprung at one another&#x27;s throats, their faces livid with hate, and were now rolling over and over behind a set of side lights, pounding away at each other as though they weren&#x27;t breakable. &quot;Monsieur Bordenave, Monsieur Bordenave!&quot; said the stage manager, coming up in a terrible flutter. Bordenave made his excuses to the prince and followed him.  When he recognized Fauchery and Mignon in the men on the floor he gave vent to an expression of annoyance.  They had chosen a nice time, certainly, with His Highness on the other side of the scenery and all that houseful of people who might have overheard the row!  To make matters worse, Rose Mignon arrived out of breath at the very moment she was due on the stage.  Vulcan, indeed, was giving her the cue, but Rose stood rooted to the ground, marveling at sight of her husband and her lover as they lay wallowing at her feet, strangling one another, kicking, tearing their hair out and whitening their coats with dust.  They barred the way.  A sceneshifter had even stopped Fauchery&#x27;s hat just when the devilish thing was going to bound onto the stage in the middle of the struggle.  Meanwhile Vulcan, who had been gagging away to amuse the audience, gave Rose her cue a second time.  But she stood motionless, still gazing at the two men. &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t look at THEM!&quot; Bordenave furiously whispered to her.  &quot;Go on the stage; go on, do!  It&#x27;s no business of yours!  Why, you&#x27;re missing your cue!&quot; And with a push from the manager, Rose stepped over the prostrate bodies and found herself in the flare of the footlights and in the presence of the audience.  She had quite failed to understand why they were fighting on the floor behind her.  Trembling from head to foot and with a humming in her ears, she came down to the footlights, Diana&#x27;s sweet, amorous smile on her lips, and attacked the opening lines of her duet with so feeling a voice that the public gave her a veritable ovation. Behind the scenery she could hear the dull thuds caused by the two men.  They had rolled down to the wings, but fortunately the music covered the noise made by their feet as they kicked against them. &quot;By God!&quot; yelled Bordenave in exasperation when at last he had succeeded in separating them.  &quot;Why couldn&#x27;t you fight at home?  You know as well as I do that I don&#x27;t like this sort of thing.  You, Mignon, you&#x27;ll do me the pleasure of staying over here on the prompt side, and you, Fauchery, if you leave the O.P. side I&#x27;ll chuck you out of the theater.  You understand, eh?  Prompt side and O.P. side or I forbid Rose to bring you here at all.&quot; When he returned to the prince&#x27;s presence the latter asked what was the matter. &quot;Oh, nothing at all,&quot; he murmured quietly. Nana was standing wrapped in furs, talking to these gentlemen while awaiting her cue.  As Count Muffat was coming up in order to peep between two of the wings at the stage, he understood from a sign made him by the stage manager that he was to step softly.  Drowsy warmth was streaming down from the flies, and in the wings, which were lit by vivid patches of light, only a few people remained, talking in low voices or making off on tiptoe.  The gasman was at his post amid an intricate arrangement of cocks; a fireman, leaning against the side lights, was craning forward, trying to catch a glimpse of things, while on his seat, high up, the curtain man was watching with resigned expression, careless of the play, constantly on the alert for the bell to ring him to his duty among the ropes. And amid the close air and the shuffling of feet and the sound of whispering, the voices of the actors on the stage sounded strange, deadened, surprisingly discordant.  Farther off again, above the confused noises of the band, a vast breathing sound was audible.  It was the breath of the house, which sometimes swelled up till it burst in vague rumors, in laughter, in applause.  Though invisible, the presence of the public could be felt, even in the silences. &quot;There&#x27;s something open,&quot; said Nana sharply, and with that she tightened the folds of her fur cloak.  &quot;Do look, Barillot.  I bet they&#x27;ve just opened a window.  Why, one might catch one&#x27;s death of cold here!&quot; Barillot swore that he had closed every window himself but suggested that possibly there were broken panes about.  The actors were always complaining of drafts.  Through the heavy warmth of that gaslit region blasts of cold air were constantly passing--it was a regular influenza trap, as Fontan phrased it. &quot;I should like to see YOU in a low-cut dress,&quot; continued Nana, growing annoyed. &quot;Hush!&quot; murmured Bordenave. On the stage Rose rendered a phrase in her duet so cleverly that the stalls burst into universal applause.  Nana was silent at this, and her face grew grave.  Meanwhile the count was venturing down a passage when Barillot stopped him and said he would make a discovery there.  Indeed, he obtained an oblique back view of the scenery and of the wings which had been strengthened, as it were, by a thick layer of old posters.  Then he caught sight of a corner of the stage, of the Etna cave hollowed out in a silver mine and of Vulcan&#x27;s forge in the background.  Battens, lowered from above, lit up a sparkling substance which had been laid on with large dabs of the brush.  Side lights with red glasses and blue were so placed as to produce the appearance of a fiery brazier, while on the floor of the stage, in the far background, long lines of gaslight had been laid down in order to throw a wall of dark rocks into sharp relief. Hard by on a gentle, &quot;practicable&quot; incline, amid little points of light resembling the illumination lamps scattered about in the grass on the night of a public holiday, old Mme Drouard, who played Juno, was sitting dazed and sleepy, waiting for her cue. Presently there was a commotion, for Simonne, while listening to a story Clarisse was telling her, cried out: &quot;My!  It&#x27;s the Tricon!&quot; It was indeed the Tricon, wearing the same old curls and looking as like a litigious great lady as ever. When she saw Nana she went straight up to her. &quot;No,&quot; said the latter after some rapid phrases had been exchanged, &quot;not now.&quot;  The old lady looked grave.  Just then Prulliere passed by and shook hands with her, while two little chorus girls stood gazing at her with looks of deep emotion.  For a moment she seemed to hesitate.  Then she beckoned to Simonne, and the rapid exchange of sentences began again. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Simonne at last.  &quot;In half an hour.&quot; But as she was going upstairs again to her dressing room, Mme Bron, who was once more going the rounds with letters, presented one to her.  Bordenave lowered his voice and furiously reproached the portress for having allowed the Tricon to come in.  That woman!  And on such an evening of all others!  It made him so angry because His Highness was there!  Mme Bron, who had been thirty years in the theater, replied quite sourly.  How was she to know? she asked.  The Tricon did business with all the ladies--M. le Directeur had met her a score of times without making remarks.  And while Bordenave was muttering oaths the Tricon stood quietly by, scrutinizing the prince as became a woman who weighs a man at a glance.  A smile lit up her yellow face.  Presently she paced slowly off through the crowd of deeply deferential little women. &quot;Immediately, eh?&quot; she queried, turning round again to Simonne. Simonne seemed much worried.  The letter was from a young man to whom she had engaged herself for that evening.  She gave Mme Bron a scribbled note in which were the words, &quot;Impossible tonight, darling--I&#x27;m booked.&quot;  But she was still apprehensive; the young man might possibly wait for her in spite of everything.  As she was not playing in the third act, she had a mind to be off at once and accordingly begged Clarisse to go and see if the man were there. Clarisse was only due on the stage toward the end of the act, and so she went downstairs while Simonne ran up for a minute to their common dressing room. In Mme Bron&#x27;s drinking bar downstairs a super, who was charged with the part of Pluto, was drinking in solitude amid the folds of a great red robe diapered with golden flames.  The little business plied by the good portress must have been progressing finely, for the cellarlike hole under the stairs was wet with emptied heeltaps and water.  Clarisse picked up the tunic of Iris, which was dragging over the greasy steps behind her, but she halted prudently at the turn in the stairs and was content simply to crane forward and peer into the lodge.  She certainly had been quick to scent things out! Just fancy!  That idiot La Faloise was still there, sitting on the same old chair between the table and the stove!  He had made pretense of sneaking off in front of Simonne and had returned after her departure.  For the matter of that, the lodge was still full of gentlemen who sat there gloved, elegant, submissive and patient as ever.  They were all waiting and viewing each other gravely as they waited.  On the table there were now only some dirty plates, Mme Bron having recently distributed the last of the bouquets.  A single fallen rose was withering on the floor in the neighborhood of the black cat, who had lain down and curled herself up while the kittens ran wild races and danced fierce gallops among the gentlemen&#x27;s legs. Clarisse was momentarily inclined to turn La Faloise out.  The idiot wasn&#x27;t fond of animals, and that put the finishing touch to him!  He was busy drawing in his legs because the cat was there, and he didn&#x27;t want to touch her. &quot;He&#x27;ll nip you; take care!&quot; said Pluto, who was a joker, as he went upstairs, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. After that Clarisse gave up the idea of hauling La Faloise over the coals.  She had seen Mme Bron giving the letter to Simonne&#x27;s young man, and he had gone out to read it under the gas light in the lobby.  &quot;Impossible tonight, darling--I&#x27;m booked.&quot;  And with that he had peaceably departed, as one who was doubtless used to the formula.  He, at any rate, knew how to conduct himself!  Not so the others, the fellows who sat there doggedly on Mme Bron&#x27;s battered straw-bottomed chairs under the great glazed lantern, where the heat was enough to roast you and there was an unpleasant odor.  What a lot of men it must have held!  Clarisse went upstairs again in disgust, crossed over behind scenes and nimbly mounted three flights of steps which led to the dressing rooms, in order to bring Simonne her reply. Downstairs the prince had withdrawn from the rest and stood talking to Nana.  He never left her; he stood brooding over her through half-shut eyelids.  Nana did not look at him but, smiling, nodded yes.  Suddenly, however, Count Muffat obeyed an overmastering impulse, and leaving Bordenave, who was explaining to him the working of the rollers and windlasses, he came up in order to interrupt their confabulations.  Nana lifted her eyes and smiled at him as she smiled at His Highness.  But she kept her ears open notwithstanding, for she was waiting for her cue. &quot;The third act is the shortest, I believe,&quot; the prince began saying, for the count&#x27;s presence embarrassed him. She did not answer; her whole expression altered; she was suddenly intent on her business.  With a rapid movement of the shoulders she had let her furs slip from her, and Mme Jules, standing behind, had caught them in her arms.  And then after passing her two hands to her hair as though to make it fast, she went on the stage in all her nudity. &quot;Hush, hush!&quot; whispered Bordenave. The count and the prince had been taken by surprise.  There was profound silence, and then a deep sigh and the far-off murmur of a multitude became audible.  Every evening when Venus entered in her godlike nakedness the same effect was produced.  Then Muffat was seized with a desire to see; he put his eye to the peephole.  Above and beyond the glowing arc formed by the footlights the dark body of the house seemed full of ruddy vapor, and against this neutral- tinted background, where row upon row of faces struck a pale, uncertain note, Nana stood forth white and vast, so that the boxes from the balcony to the flies were blotted from view.  He saw her from behind, noted her swelling hips, her outstretched arms, while down on the floor, on the same level as her feet, the prompter&#x27;s head--an old man&#x27;s head with a humble, honest face--stood on the edge of the stage, looking as though it had been severed from the body.  At certain points in her opening number an undulating movement seemed to run from her neck to her waist and to die out in the trailing border of her tunic.  When amid a tempest of applause she had sung her last note she bowed, and the gauze floated forth round about her limbs, and her hair swept over her waist as she bent sharply backward.  And seeing her thus, as with bending form and with exaggerated hips she came backing toward the count&#x27;s peephole, he stood upright again, and his face was very white.  The stage had disappeared, and he now saw only the reverse side of the scenery with its display of old posters pasted up in every direction.  On the practicable slope, among the lines of gas jets, the whole of Olympus had rejoined the dozing Mme Drouard.  They were waiting for the close of the act.  Bosc and Fontan sat on the floor with their knees drawn up to their chins, and Prulliere stretched himself and yawned before going on.  Everybody was worn out; their eyes were red, and they were longing to go home to sleep. Just then Fauchery, who had been prowling about on the O.P. side ever since Bordenave had forbidden him the other, came and buttonholed the count in order to keep himself in countenance and offered at the same time to show him the dressing rooms.  An increasing sense of languor had left Muffat without any power of resistance, and after looking round for the Marquis de Chouard, who had disappeared, he ended by following the journalist.  He experienced a mingled feeling of relief and anxiety as he left the wings whence he had been listening to Nana&#x27;s songs. Fauchery had already preceded him up the staircase, which was closed on the first and second floors by low-paneled doors.  It was one of those stairways which you find in miserable tenements.  Count Muffat had seen many such during his rounds as member of the Benevolent Organization.  It was bare and dilapidated: there was a wash of yellow paint on its walls; its steps had been worn by the incessant passage of feet, and its iron balustrade had grown smooth under the friction of many hands.  On a level with the floor on every stairhead there was a low window which resembled a deep, square venthole, while in lanterns fastened to the walls flaring gas jets crudely illuminatcd the surrounding squalor and gave out a glowing heat which, as it mounted up the narrow stairwell, grew ever more intense. When he reached the foot of the stairs the count once more felt the hot breath upon his neck and shoulders.  As of old it was laden with the odor of women, wafted amid floods of light and sound from the dressing rooms above, and now with every upward step he took the musky scent of powders and the tart perfume of toilet vinegars heated and bewildered him more and more.  On the first floor two corridors ran backward, branching sharply off and presenting a set of doors to view which were painted yellow and numbered with great white numerals in such a way as to suggest a hotel with a bad reputation.  The tiles on the floor had been many of them unbedded, and the old house being in a state of subsidence, they stuck up like hummocks.  The count dashed recklessly forward, glanced through a half-open door and saw a very dirty room which resembled a barber&#x27;s shop in a poor part of the town.  In was furnished with two chairs, a mirror and a small table containing a drawer which had been blackened by the grease from brushes and combs.  A great perspiring fellow with smoking shoulders was changing his linen there, while in a similar room next door a woman was drawing on her gloves preparatory to departure.  Her hair was damp and out of curl, as though she had just had a bath.  But Fauchery began calling the count, and the latter was rushing up without delay when a furious &quot;damn!&quot; burst from the corridor on the right.  Mathilde, a little drab of a miss, had just broken her washhand basin, the soapy water from which was flowing out to the stairhead.  A dressing room door banged noisily.  Two women in their stays skipped across the passage, and another, with the hem of her shift in her mouth, appeared and immediately vanished from view.  Then followed a sound of laughter, a dispute, the snatch of a song which was suddenly broken off short.  All along the passage naked gleams, sudden visions of white skin and wan underlinen were observable through chinks in doorways.  Two girls were making very merry, showing each other their birthmarks.  One of them, a very young girl, almost a child, had drawn her skirts up over her knees in order to sew up a rent in her drawers, and the dressers, catching sight of the two men, drew some curtains half to for decency&#x27;s sake.  The wild stampede which follows the end of a play had already begun, the grand removal of white paint and rouge, the reassumption amid clouds of rice powder of ordinary attire.  The strange animal scent came in whiffs of redoubled intensity through the lines of banging doors. On the third story Muffat abandoned himself to the feeling of intoxication which was overpowering him.  For the chorus girls&#x27; dressing room was there, and you saw a crowd of twenty women and a wild display of soaps and flasks of lavender water.  The place resembled the common room in a slum lodging house.  As he passed by he heard fierce sounds of washing behind a closed door and a perfect storm raging in a washhand basin.  And as he was mounting up to the topmost story of all, curiosity led him to risk one more little peep through an open loophole.  The room was empty, and under the flare of the gas a solitary chamber pot stood forgotten among a heap of petticoats trailing on the floor.  This room afforded him his ultimate impression.  Upstairs on the fourth floor he was well-nigh suffocated.  All the scents, all the blasts of heat, had found their goal there.  The yellow ceiling looked as if it had been baked, and a lamp burned amid fumes of russet-colored fog.  For some seconds he leaned upon the iron balustrade which felt warm and damp and well- nigh human to the touch.  And he shut his eyes and drew a long breath and drank in the sexual atmosphere of the place.  Hitherto he had been utterly ignorant of it, but now it beat full in his face. &quot;Do come here,&quot; shouted Fauchery, who had vanished some moments ago. &quot;You&#x27;re being asked for.&quot; At the end of the corridor was the dressing room belonging to Clarisse and Simonne.  It was a long, ill-built room under the roof with a garret ceiling and sloping walls.  The light penetrated to it from two deep-set openings high up in the wall, but at that hour of the night the dressing room was lit by flaring gas.  It was papered with a paper at seven sous a roll with a pattern of roses twining over green trelliswork.  Two boards, placed near one another and covered with oilcloth, did duty for dressing tables.  They were black with spilled water, and underneath them was a fine medley of dinted zinc jugs, slop pails and coarse yellow earthenware crocks. There was an array of fancy articles in the room--a battered, soiled and well-worn array of chipped basins, of toothless combs, of all those manifold untidy trifles which, in their hurry and carelessness, two women will leave scattered about when they undress and wash together amid purely temporary surroundings, the dirty aspect of which has ceased to concern them. &quot;Do come here,&quot; Fauchery repeated with the good-humored familiarity which men adopt among their fallen sisters.  &quot;Clarisse is wanting to kiss you.&quot; Muffat entered the room at last.  But what was his surprise when he found the Marquis de Chouard snugly enscounced on a chair between the two dressing tables!  The marquis had withdrawn thither some time ago.  He was spreading his feet apart because a pail was leaking and letting a whitish flood spread over the floor.  He was visibly much at his ease, as became a man who knew all the snug corners, and had grown quite merry in the close dressing room, where people might have been bathing, and amid those quietly immodest feminine surroundings which the uncleanness of the little place rendered at once natural and poignant. &quot;D&#x27;you go with the old boy?&quot; Simonne asked Clarisse in a whisper. &quot;Rather!&quot; replied the latter aloud. The dresser, a very ugly and extremely familiar young girl, who was helping Simonne into her coat, positively writhed with laughter. The three pushed each other and babbled little phrases which redoubled their merriment. &quot;Come, Clarisse, kiss the gentleman,&quot; said Fauchery.  &quot;You know, he&#x27;s got the rhino.&quot; And turning to the count: &quot;You&#x27;ll see, she&#x27;s very nice!  She&#x27;s going to kiss you!&quot; But Clarisse was disgusted by the men.  She spoke in violent terms of the dirty lot waiting at the porter&#x27;s lodge down below.  Besides, she was in a hurry to go downstairs again; they were making her miss her last scene.  Then as Fauchery blocked up the doorway, she gave Muffat a couple of kisses on the whiskers, remarking as she did so: &quot;It&#x27;s not for you, at any rate!  It&#x27;s for that nuisance Fauchery!&quot; And with that she darted off, and the count remained much embarrassed in his father-in-law&#x27;s presence.  The blood had rushed to his face.  In Nana&#x27;s dressing room, amid all the luxury of hangings and mirrors, he had not experienced the sharp physical sensation which the shameful wretchedness of that sorry garret excited within him, redolent as it was of these two girls&#x27; self- abandonment.  Meanwhile the marquis had hurried in the rear of Simonne, who was making off at the top of her pace, and he kept whispering in her ear while she shook her head in token of refusal. Fauchery followed them, laughing.  And with that the count found himself alone with the dresser, who was washing out the basins. Accordingly he took his departure, too, his legs almost failing under him.  Once more he put up flights of half-dressed women and caused doors to bang as he advanced.  But amid the disorderly, disbanded troops of girls to be found on each of the four stories, he was only distinctly aware of a cat, a great tortoise-shell cat, which went gliding upstairs through the ovenlike place where the air was poisoned with musk, rubbing its back against the banisters and keeping its tail exceedingly erect. &quot;Yes, to be sure!&quot; said a woman hoarsely.  &quot;I thought they&#x27;d keep us back tonight!  What a nuisance they are with their calls!&quot; The end had come; the curtain had just fallen.  There was a veritable stampede on the staircase--its walls rang with exclamations, and everyone was in a savage hurry to dress and be off.  As Count Muffat came down the last step or two he saw Nana and the prince passing slowly along the passage.  The young woman halted and lowered her voice as she said with a smile: &quot;All right then--by and by!&quot; The prince returned to the stage, where Bordenave was awaiting him. And left alone with Nana, Muffat gave way to an impulse of anger and desire.  He ran up behind her and, as she was on the point of entering her dressing room, imprinted a rough kiss on her neck among little golden hairs curling low down between her shoulders.  It was as though he had returned the kiss that had been given him upstairs. Nana was in a fury; she lifted her hand, but when she recognized the count she smiled. &quot;Oh, you frightened me,&quot; she said simply. And her smile was adorable in its embarrassment and submissiveness, as though she had despaired of this kiss and were happy to have received it.  But she could do nothing for him either that evening or the day after.  It was a case of waiting.  Nay, even if it had been in her power she would still have let herself be desired.  Her glance said as much.  At length she continued: &quot;I&#x27;m a landowner, you know.  Yes, I&#x27;m buying a country house near Orleans, in a part of the world to which you sometimes betake yourself.  Baby told me you did--little Georges Hugon, I mean.  You know him?  So come and see me down there.&quot; The count was a shy man, and the thought of his roughness had frightened him; he was ashamed of what he had done and he bowed ceremoniously, promising at the same time to take advantage of her invitation.  Then he walked off as one who dreams. He was rejoining the prince when, passing in front of the foyer, he heard Satin screaming out: &quot;Oh, the dirty old thing!  Just you bloody well leave me alone!&quot; It was the Marquis de Chouard who was tumbling down over Satin.  The girl had decidedly had enough of the fashionable world!  Nana had certainly introduced her to Bordenave, but the necessity of standing with sealed lips for fear of allowing some awkward phrase to escape her had been too much for her feelings, and now she was anxious to regain her freedom, the more so as she had run against an old flame of hers in the wings.  This was the super, to whom the task of impersonating Pluto had been entrusted, a pastry cook, who had already treated her to a whole week of love and flagellation.  She was waiting for him, much irritated at the things the marquis was saying to her, as though she were one of those theatrical ladies! And so at last she assumed a highly respectable expression and jerked out this phrase: &quot;My husband&#x27;s coming!  You&#x27;ll see.&quot; Meanwhile the worn-looking artistes were dropping off one after the other in their outdoor coats.  Groups of men and women were coming down the little winding staircase, and the outlines of battered hats and worn-out shawls were visible in the shadows.  They looked colorless and unlovely, as became poor play actors who have got rid of their paint.  On the stage, where the side lights and battens were being extinguished, the prince was listening to an anecdote Bordenave was telling him.  He was waiting for Nana, and when at length she made her appearance the stage was dark, and the fireman on duty was finishing his round, lantern in hand.  Bordenave, in order to save His Highness going about by the Passage des Panoramas, had made them open the corridor which led from the porter&#x27;s lodge to the entrance hall of the theater.  Along this narrow alley little women were racing pell-mell, for they were delighted to escape from the men who were waiting for them in the other passage.  They went jostling and elbowing along, casting apprehensive glances behind them and only breathing freely when they got outside.  Fontan, Bosc and Prulliere, on the other hand, retired at a leisurely pace, joking at the figure cut by the serious, paying admirers who were striding up and down the Galerie des Varietes at a time when the little dears were escaping along the boulevard with the men of their hearts.  But Clarisse was especially sly.  She had her suspicions about La Faloise, and, as a matter of fact, he was still in his place in the lodge among the gentlemen obstinately waiting on Mme Bron&#x27;s chairs.  They all stretched forward, and with that she passed brazenly by in the wake of a friend.  The gentlemen were blinking in bewilderment over the wild whirl of petticoats eddying at the foot of the narrow stairs.  It made them desperate to think they had waited so long, only to see them all flying away like this without being able to recognize a single one.  The litter of little black cats were sleeping on the oilcloth, nestled against their mother&#x27;s belly, and the latter was stretching her paws out in a state of beatitude while the big tortoise-shell cat sat at the other end of the table, her tail stretched out behind her and her yellow eyes solemnly following the flight of the women. &quot;If His Highness will be good enough to come this way,&quot; said Bordenave at the bottom of the stairs, and he pointed to the passage. Some chorus girls were still crowding along it.  The prince began following Nana while Muffat and the marquis walked behind. It was a long, narrow passage lying between the theater and the house next door, a kind of contracted by-lane which had been covered with a sloping glass roof.  Damp oozed from the walls, and the footfall sounded as hollow on the tiled floor as in an underground vault.  It was crowded with the kind of rubbish usually found in a garret.  There was a workbench on which the porter was wont to plane such parts of the scenery as required it, besides a pile of wooden barriers which at night were placed at the doors of the theater for the purpose of regulating the incoming stream of people.  Nana had to pick up her dress as she passed a hydrant which, through having been carelessly turned off, was flooding the tiles underfoot.  In the entrance hall the company bowed and said good-by.  And when Bordenave was alone he summed up his opinion of the prince in a shrug of eminently philosophic disdain. &quot;He&#x27;s a bit of a duffer all the same,&quot; he said to Fauchery without entering on further explanations, and with that Rose Mignon carried the journalist off with her husband in order to effect a reconciliation between them at home. Muffat was left alone on the sidewalk.  His Highness had handed Nana quietly into his carriage, and the marquis had slipped off after Satin and her super.  In his excitement he was content to follow this vicious pair in vague hopes of some stray favor being granted him.  Then with brain on fire Muffat decided to walk home.  The struggle within him had wholly ceased.  The ideas and beliefs of the last forty years were being drowned in a flood of new life.  While he was passing along the boulevards the roll of the last carriages deafened him with the name of Nana; the gaslights set nude limbs dancing before his eyes--the nude limbs, the lithe arms, the white shoulders, of Nana.  And he felt that he was hers utterly: he would have abjured everything, sold everything, to possess her for a single hour that very night.  Youth, a lustful puberty of early manhood, was stirring within him at last, flaming up suddenly in the chaste heart of the Catholic and amid the dignified traditions of middle age. CHAPTER VI Count Muffat, accompanied by his wife and daughter, had arrived overnight at Les Fondettes, where Mme Hugon, who was staying there with only her son Georges, had invited them to come and spend a week.  The house, which had been built at the end of the eighteenth century, stood in the middle of a huge square enclosure.  It was perfectly unadorned, but the garden possessed magnificent shady trees and a chain of tanks fed by running spring water.  It stood at the side of the road which leads from Orleans to Paris and with its rich verdure and high-embowered trees broke the monotony of that flat countryside, where fields stretched to the horizon&#x27;s verge. At eleven o&#x27;clock, when the second lunch bell had called the whole household together, Mme Hugon, smiling in her kindly maternal way, gave Sabine two great kisses, one on each cheek, and said as she did so: &quot;You know it&#x27;s my custom in the country.  Oh, seeing you here makes me feel twenty years younger.  Did you sleep well in your old room?&quot; Then without waiting for her reply she turned to Estelle: &quot;And this little one, has she had a nap too?  Give me a kiss, my child.&quot; They had taken their seats in the vast dining room, the windows of which looked out on the park.  But they only occupied one end of the long table, where they sat somewhat crowded together for company&#x27;s sake.  Sabine, in high good spirits, dwelt on various childish memories which had been stirred up within her--memories of months passed at Les Fondettes, of long walks, of a tumble into one of the tanks on a summer evening, of an old romance of chivalry discovered by her on the top of a cupboard and read during the winter before fires made of vine branches.  And Georges, who had not seen the countess for some months, thought there was something curious about her.  Her face seemed changed, somehow, while, on the other hand, that stick of an Estelle seemed more insignificant and dumb and awkward than ever. While such simple fare as cutlets and boiled eggs was being discussed by the company, Mme Hugon, as became a good housekeeper, launched out into complaints.  The butchers, she said, were becoming impossible.  She bought everything at Orleans, and yet they never brought her the pieces she asked for.  Yet, alas, if her guests had nothing worth eating it was their own fault: they had come too late in the season. &quot;There&#x27;s no sense in it,&quot; she said.  &quot;I&#x27;ve been expecting you since June, and now we&#x27;re half through September.  You see, it doesn&#x27;t look pretty.&quot; And with a movement she pointed to the trees on the grass outside, the leaves of which were beginning to turn yellow.  The day was covered, and the distance was hidden by a bluish haze which was fraught with a sweet and melancholy peacefulness. &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m expecting company,&quot; she continued.  &quot;We shall be gayer then!  The first to come will be two gentlemen whom Georges has invited--Monsieur Fauchery and Monsieur Daguenet; you know them, do you not?  Then we shall have Monsieur de Vandeuvres, who has promised me a visit these five years past.  This time, perhaps, he&#x27;ll make up his mind!&quot; &quot;Oh, well and good!&quot; said the countess, laughing.  &quot;If we only can get Monsieur de Vandeuvres!  But he&#x27;s too much engaged.&quot; &quot;And Philippe?&quot; queried Muffat. &quot;Philippe has asked for a furlough,&quot; replied the old lady, &quot;but without doubt you won&#x27;t be at Les Fondettes any longer when he arrives.&quot; The coffee was served.  Paris was now the subject of conversation, and Steiner&#x27;s name was mentioned, at which Mme Hugon gave a little cry. &quot;Let me see,&quot; she said; &quot;Monsieur Steiner is that stout man I met at your house one evening.  He&#x27;s a banker, is he not?  Now there&#x27;s a detestable man for you!  Why, he&#x27;s gone and bought an actress an estate about a league from here, over Gumieres way, beyond the Choue.  The whole countryside&#x27;s scandalized.  Did you know about that, my friend?&quot; &quot;I knew nothing about it,&quot; replied Muffat.  &quot;Ah, then, Steiner&#x27;s bought a country place in the neighborhood!&quot; Hearing his mother broach the subject, Georges looked into his coffee cup, but in his astonishment at the count&#x27;s answer he glanced up at him and stared.  Why was he lying so glibly?  The count, on his side, noticed the young fellow&#x27;s movement and gave him a suspicious glance.  Mme Hugon continued to go into details: the country place was called La Mignotte.  In order to get there one had to go up the bank of the Choue as far as Gumieres in order to cross the bridge; otherwise one got one&#x27;s feet wet and ran the risk of a ducking. &quot;And what is the actress&#x27;s name?&quot; asked the countess. &quot;Oh, I wasn&#x27;t told,&quot; murmured the old lady.  &quot;Georges, you were there the morning the gardener spoke to us about it.&quot; Georges appeared to rack his brains.  Muffat waited, twirling a teaspoon between his fingers.  Then the countess addressed her husband: &quot;Isn&#x27;t Monsieur Steiner with that singer at the Varietes, that Nana?&quot; &quot;Nana, that&#x27;s the name!  A horrible woman!&quot; cried Mme Hugon with growing annoyance.  &quot;And they are expecting her at La Mignotte. I&#x27;ve heard all about it from the gardener.  Didn&#x27;t the gardener say they were expecting her this evening, Georges?&quot; The count gave a little start of astonishment, but Georges replied with much vivacity: &quot;Oh, Mother, the gardener spoke without knowing anything about it. Directly afterward the coachman said just the opposite.  Nobody&#x27;s expected at La Mignotte before the day after tomorrow.&quot; He tried hard to assume a natural expression while he slyly watched the effect of his remarks on the count.  The latter was twirling his spoon again as though reassured.  The countess, her eyes fixed dreamily on the blue distances of the park, seemed to have lost all interest in the conversation.  The shadow of a smile on her lips, she seemed to be following up a secret thought which had been suddenly awakened within her.  Estelle, on the other hand, sitting stiffly on her chair, had heard all that had been said about Nana, but her white, virginal face had not betrayed a trace of emotion. &quot;Dear me, dear me!  I&#x27;ve got no right to grow angry,&quot; murmured Mme Hugon after a pause, and with a return to her old good humor she added: &quot;Everybody&#x27;s got a right to live.  If we meet this said lady on the road we shall not bow to her--that&#x27;s all!&quot; And as they got up from table she once more gently upbraided the Countess Sabine for having been so long in coming to her that year. But the countess defended herself and threw the blame of the delays upon her husband&#x27;s shoulders.  Twice on the eve of departure, when all the trunks were locked, he counterordered their journey on the plea of urgent business.  Then he had suddenly decided to start just when the trip seemed shelved.  Thereupon the old lady told them how Georges in the same way had twice announced his arrival without arriving and had finally cropped up at Les Fondettes the day before yesterday, when she was no longer expecting him.  They had come down into the garden, and the two men, walking beside the ladies, were listening to them in consequential silence. &quot;Never mind,&quot; said Mme Hugon, kissing her son&#x27;s sunny locks, &quot;Zizi is a very good boy to come and bury himself in the country with his mother.  He&#x27;s a dear Zizi not to forget me!&quot; In the afternoon she expressed some anxiety, for Georges, directly after leaving the table, had complained of a heavy feeling in his head and now seemed in for an atrocious sick headache.  Toward four o&#x27;clock he said he would go upstairs to bed: it was the only remedy. After sleeping till tomorrow morning he would be perfectly himself again.  His mother was bent on putting him to bed herself, but as she left the room he ran and locked the door, explaining that he was shutting himself in so that no one should come and disturb him. Then caressingly he shouted, &quot;Good night till tomorrow, little Mother!&quot; and promised to take a nap.  But he did not go to bed again and with flushed cheeks and bright eyes noiselessly put on his clothes.  Then he sat on a chair and waited.  When the dinner bell rang he listened for Count Muffat, who was on his way to the dining room, and ten minutes later, when he was certain that no one would see him, he slipped from the window to the ground with the assistance of a rain pipe.  His bedroom was situated on the first floor and looked out upon the rear of the house.  He threw himself among some bushes and got out of the park and then galloped across the fields with empty stomach and heart beating with excitement. Night was closing in, and a small fine rain was beginning to fall. It was the very evening that Nana was due at La Mignotte.  Ever since in the preceding May Steiner had bought her this country place she had from time to time been so filled with the desire of taking possession that she had wept hot tears about, but on each of these occasions Bordenave had refused to give her even the shortest leave and had deferred her holiday till September on the plea that he did not intend putting an understudy in her place, even for one evening, now that the exhibition was on.  Toward the close of August he spoke of October.  Nana was furious and declared that she would be at La Mignotte in the middle of September.  Nay, in order to dare Bordenave, she even invited a crowd of guests in his very presence. One afternoon in her rooms, as Muffat, whose advances she still adroitly resisted, was beseeching her with tremulous emotion to yield to his entreaties, she at length promised to be kind, but not in Paris, and to him, too, she named the middle of September.  Then on the twelfth she was seized by a desire to be off forthwith with Zoe as her sole companion.  It might be that Bordenave had got wind of her intentions and was about to discover some means of detaining her.  She was delighted at the notion of putting him in a fix, and she sent him a doctor&#x27;s certificate.  When once the idea had entered her head of being the first to get to La Mignotte and of living there two days without anybody knowing anything about it, she rushed Zoe through the operation of packing and finally pushed her into a cab, where in a sudden burst of extreme contrition she kissed her and begged her pardon.  It was only when they got to the station refreshment room that she thought of writing Steiner of her movements.  She begged him to wait till the day after tomorrow before rejoining her if he wanted to find her quite bright and fresh.  And then, suddenly conceiving another project, she wrote a second letter, in which she besought her aunt to bring little Louis to her at once.  It would do Baby so much good!  And how happy they would be together in the shade of the trees!  In the railway carriage between Paris and Orleans she spoke of nothing else; her eyes were full of tears; she had an unexpected attack of maternal tenderness and mingled together flowers, birds and child in her every sentence. La Mignotte was more than three leagues away from the station, and Nana lost a good hour over the hire of a carriage, a huge, dilapidated calash, which rumbled slowly along to an accompaniment of rattling old iron.  She had at once taken possession of the coachman, a little taciturn old man whom she overwhelmed with questions.  Had he often passed by La Mignotte?  It was behind this hill then?  There ought to be lots of trees there, eh?  And the house could one see it at a distance?  The little old man answered with a succession of grunts.  Down in the calash Nana was almost dancing with impatience, while Zoe, in her annoyance at having left Paris in such a hurry, sat stiffly sulking beside her.  The horse suddenly stopped short, and the young woman thought they had reached their destination.  She put her head out of the carriage door and asked: &quot;Are we there, eh?&quot; By way of answer the driver whipped up his horse, which was in the act of painfully climbing a hill.  Nana gazed ecstatically at the vast plain beneath the gray sky where great clouds were banked up. &quot;Oh, do look, Zoe!  There&#x27;s greenery!  Now, is that all wheat?  Good lord, how pretty it is!&quot; &quot;One can quite see that Madame doesn&#x27;t come from the country,&quot; was the servant&#x27;s prim and tardy rejoinder.  &quot;As for me, I knew the country only too well when I was with my dentist.  He had a house at Bougival.  No, it&#x27;s cold, too, this evening.  It&#x27;s damp in these parts.&quot; They were driving under the shadow of a wood, and Nana sniffed up the scent of the leaves as a young dog might.  All of a sudden at a turn of the road she caught sight of the corner of a house among the trees.  Perhaps it was there!  And with that she began a conversation with the driver, who continued shaking his head by way of saying no.  Then as they drove down the other side of the hill he contented himself by holding out his whip and muttering, &quot;&#x27;Tis down there.&quot; She got up and stretched herself almost bodily out of the carriage door. &quot;Where is it?  Where is it?&quot; she cried with pale cheeks, but as yet she saw nothing. At last she caught sight of a bit of wall.  And then followed a succession of little cries and jumps, the ecstatic behavior of a woman overcome by a new and vivid sensation. &quot;I see it!  I see it, Zoe!  Look out at the other side.  Oh, there&#x27;s a terrace with brick ornaments on the roof!  And there&#x27;s a hothouse down there!  But the place is immense.  Oh, how happy I am!  Do look, Zoe!  Now, do look!&quot; The carriage had bthin a wall.  Then the view of the kitchen garden entirely engrossed her attention.  She darted back, jostling the lady&#x27;s maid at the top of the stairs and bursting out: &quot;It&#x27;s full of cabbages!  Oh, such woppers!  And lettuces and sorrel and onions and everything!  Come along, make haste!&quot; The rain was falling more heavily now, and she opened her white silk sunshade and ran down the garden walks. &quot;Madame will catch cold,&quot; cried Zoe, who had stayed quietly behind under the awning over the garden door. But Madame wanted to see things, and at each new discovery there was a burst of wonderment. &quot;Zoe, here&#x27;s spinach!  Do come.  Oh, look at the artichokes!  They are funny.  So they grow in the ground, do they?  Now, what can that be?  I don&#x27;t know it.  Do come, Zoe, perhaps you know.&quot; The lady&#x27;s maid never budged an inch.  Madame must really be raving mad.  For now the rain was coming down in torrents, and the little white silk sunshade was aly this time pulled up before the park gates.  A side door was opened, and the gardener, a tall, dry fellow, made his appearance, cap in hand.  Nana made an effort to regain her dignity, for the driver seemed now to be suppressing a laugh behind his dry, speechless lips.  She refrained from setting off at a run and listened to the gardener, who was a very talkative fellow.  He begged Madame to excuse the disorder in which she found everything, seeing that he had only received Madame&#x27;s letter that very morning. But despite all his efforts, she flew off at a tangent and walked so quickly that Zoe could scarcely follow her.  At the end of the avenue she paused for a moment in order to take the house in at a glance.  It was a great pavilionlike building in the Italian manner, and it was flanked by a smaller construction, which a rich Englishman, after two years&#x27; residence in Naples, had caused to be erected and had forthwith become disgusted with. &quot;I&#x27;ll take Madame over the house,&quot; said the gardener. But she had outrun him entirely, and she shouted back that he was not to put himself out and that she would go over the house by herself.  She preferred doing that, she said.  And without removing her hat she dashed into the different rooms, calling to Zoe as she did so, shouting her impressions from one end of each corridor to the other and filling the empty house, which for long months had been uninhabited, with exclamations and bursts of laughter.  In the first place, there was the hall.  It was a little damp, but that didn&#x27;t matter; one wasn&#x27;t going to sleep in it.  Then came the drawing room, quite the thing, the drawing room, with its windows opening on the lawn.  Only the red upholsteries there were hideous; she would alter all that.  As to the dining room-well, it was a lovely dining room, eh?  What big blowouts you might give in Paris if you had a dining room as large as that!  As she was going upstairs to the first floor it occurred to her that she had not seen the kitchen, and she went down again and indulged in ecstatic exclamations.  Zoe ought to admire the beautiful dimensions of the sink and the width of the hearth, where you might have roasted a sheep!  When she had gone upstairs again her bedroom especially enchanted her.  It had been hung with delicate rose-colored Louis XVI cretonne by an Orleans upholsterer.  Dear me, yes!  One ought to sleep jolly sound in such a room as that; why, it was a real best bedroom!  Then came four or five guest chambers and then some splendid garrets, which would be extremely convenient for trunks and boxes.  Zoe looked very gruff and cast a frigid glance into each of the rooms as she lingered in Madame&#x27;s wake.  She saw Nana disappearing up the steep garret ladder and said, &quot;Thanks, I haven&#x27;t the least wish to break my legs.&quot;  But the sound of a voice reached her from far away; indeed, it seemed to come whistling down a chimney. &quot;Zoe, Zoe, where are you?  Come up, do!  You&#x27;ve no idea!  It&#x27;s like fairyland!&quot; Zoe went up, grumbling.  On the roof she found her mistress leaning against the brickwork balustrade and gazing at the valley which spread out into the silence.  The horizon was immeasurably wide, but it was now covered by masses of gray vapor, and a fierce wind was driving fine rain before it.  Nana had to hold her hat on with both hands to keep it from being blown away while her petticoats streamed out behind her, flapping like a flag. &quot;Not if I know it!&quot; said Zoe, drawing her head in at once.  &quot;Madame will be blown away.  What beastly weather!&quot; Madame did not hear what she said.  With her head over the balustrade she was gazing at the grounds beneath.  They consisted of seven or eight acres of land enclosed wiready dark with it.  Nor did it shelter Madame, whose skirts were wringing wet.  But that didn&#x27;t put her out in the smallest degree, and in the pouring rain she visited the kitchen garden and the orchard, stopping in front of every fruit tree and bending over every bed of vegetables.  Then she ran and looked down the well and lifted up a frame to see what was underneath it and was lost in the contemplation of a huge pumpkin. She wanted to go along every single garden walk and to take immediate possession of all the things she had been wont to dream of in the old days, when she was a slipshod work-girl on the Paris pavements.  The rain redoubled, but she never heeded it and was only miserable at the thought that the daylight was fading.  She could not see clearly now and touched things with her fingers to find out what they were.  Suddenly in the twilight she caught sight of a bed of strawberries, and all that was childish in her awoke. &quot;Strawberries!  Strawberries!  There are some here; I can feel them. A plate, Zoe!  Come and pick strawberries.&quot; And dropping her sunshade, Nana crouched down in the mire under the full force of the downpour.  With drenched hands she began gathering the fruit among the leaves.  But Zoe in the meantime brought no plate, and when the young woman rose to her feet again she was frightened.  She thought she had seen a shadow close to her. &quot;It&#x27;s some beast!&quot; she screamed. But she stood rooted to the path in utter amazement.  It was a man, and she recognized him. &quot;Gracious me, it&#x27;s Baby!  What ARE you doing there, baby?&quot; &quot;&#x27;Gad, I&#x27;ve come--that&#x27;s all!&quot; replied Georges. Her head swam. &quot;You knew I&#x27;d come through the gardener telling you?  Oh, that poor child!  Why, he&#x27;s soaking!&quot; &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll explain that to you!  The rain caught me on my way here, and then, as I didn&#x27;t wish to go upstream as far as Gumieres, I crossed the Choue and fell into a blessed hole.&quot; Nana forgot the strawberries forthwith.  She was trembling and full of pity.  That poor dear Zizi in a hole full of water!  And she drew him with her in the direction of the house and spoke of making up a roaring fire. &quot;You know,&quot; he murmured, stopping her among the shadows, &quot;I was in hiding because I was afraid of being scolded, like in Paris, when I come and see you and you&#x27;re not expecting me.&quot; She made no reply but burst out laughing and gave him a kiss on the forehead.  Up till today she had always treated him like a naughty urchin, never taking his declarations seriously and amusing herself at his expense as though he were a little man of no consequence whatever.  There was much ado to install him in the house.  She absolutely insisted on the fire being lit in her bedroom, as being the most comfortable place for his reception.  Georges had not surprised Zoe, who was used to all kinds of encounters, but the gardener, who brought the wood upstairs, was greatly nonplused at sight of this dripping gentleman to whom he was certain he had not opened the front door.  He was, however, dismissed, as he was no longer wanted. A lamp lit up the room, and the fire burned with a great bright flame. &quot;He&#x27;ll never get dry, and he&#x27;ll catch cold,&quot; said Nana, seeing Georges beginning to shiver. And there  and with his delicate young arms showing and his bright damp hair falling almost to his shoulders, he looked just like a girl. &quot;Why, he&#x27;s as slim as I am!&quot; said Nana, putting her arm round his waist.  &quot;Zoe, just come here and see how it suits him.  It&#x27;s were no men&#x27;s trousers in her house! She was on the point of calling the gardener back when an idea struck her.  Zoe, who was unpacking the trunks in the dressing room, brought her mistress a change of underwear, consisting of a shift and some petticoats with a dressing jacket. &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s first rate!&quot; cried the young woman.  &quot;Zizi can put &#x27;em all on.  You&#x27;re not angry with me, eh?  When your clothes are dry you can put them on again, and then off with you, as fast as fast can be, so as not to have a scolding from your mamma.  Make haste! I&#x27;m going to change my things, too, in the dressing room.&quot; Ten minutes afterward, when she reappeared in a tea gown, she clasped her hands in a perfect ecstasy. &quot;Oh, the darling!  How sweet he looks dressed like a little woman!&quot; He had simply slipped on a long nightgown with an insertion front, a pair of worked drawers and the dressing jacket, which was a long cambric garment trimmed with lace.  Thus attiredmade for him, eh?  All except the bodice part, which is too large.  He hasn&#x27;t got as much as I have, poor, dear Zizi!&quot; &quot;Oh, to be sure, I&#x27;m a bit wanting there,&quot; murmured Georges with a smile. All three grew very merry about it.  Nana had set to work buttoning the dressing jacket from top to bottom so as to make him quite decent.  Then she turned him round as though he were a doll, gave him little thumps, made the skirt stand well out behind.  After which she asked him questions.  Was he comfortable?  Did he feel warm?  Zounds, yes, he was comfortable!  Nothing fitted more closely and warmly than a woman&#x27;s shift; had he been able, he would always have worn one.  He moved round and about therein, delighted with the fine linen and the soft touch of that unmanly garment, in the folds of which he thought he discovered some of Nana&#x27;s own warm life. Meanwhile Zoe had taken the soaked clothes down to the kitchen in order to dry them as quickly as possible in front of a vine-branch fire.  Then Georges, as he lounged in an easy chair, ventured to make a confession. &quot;I say, are you going to feed this evening?  I&#x27;m dying of hunger.  I haven&#x27;t dined.&quot; Nana was vexed.  The great silly thing to go sloping off from Mamma&#x27;s with an empty stomach, just to chuck himself into a hole full of water!  But she was as hungry as a hunter too.  They certainly must feed!  Only they would have to eat what they could get.  Whereupon a round table was rolled up in front of the fire, and the queerest of dinners was improvised thereon.  Zoe ran down to the gardener&#x27;s, he having cooked a mess of cabbage soup in case Madame should not dine at Orleans before her arrival.  Madame, indeed, had forgotten to tell him what he was to get ready in the letter she had sent him.  Fortunately the cellar was well furnished. Accordingly they had cabbage soup, followed by a piece of bacon. Then Nana rummaged in her handbag and found quite a heap of provisions which she had taken the precaution of stuffing into it. There was a Strasbourg pate, for instance, and a bag of sweet-meats and some oranges.  So they both ate away like ogres and, while they satisfied their healthy young appetites, treated one another with easy good fellowship.  Nana kept calling Georges &quot;dear old girl,&quot; a form of address which struck her as at once tender and familiar.  At dessert, in order not to give Zoe any more trouble, they used the same spoon turn and turn about while demolishing a pot of preserves they had discovered at the top of a cupboard. &quot;Oh, you dear old girl!&quot; said Nana, pushing back the round table. &quot;I haven&#x27;t made such a good dinner these ten years past!&quot; Yet it was growing late, and she wanted to send her boy off for fear he should be suspected of all sorts of things.  But he kept declaring that he had plenty of time to spare.  For the matter of that, his clothes were not drying well, and Zoe averred that it would take an hour longer at least, and as she was dropping with sleep after the fatigues of the journey, they sent her off to bed. After which they were alone in the silent house. It was a very charming evening.  The fire was dying out amid glowing embers, and in the great blue room, where Zoe had made up the bed before going upstairs, the air felt a little oppressive.  Nana, overcome by the heavy warmth, got up to open the window for a few minutes, and as she did so she uttered a little cry. &quot;Great heavens, how beautiful it is!  Look, dear old girl!&quot; Georges had come up, and as though the window bar had not been sufficiently wide, he put his arm round Nana&#x27;s waist and rested his head against her shoulder.  The weather had undergone a brisk change: the skies were clearing, and a full moon lit up the country with its golden disk of light.  A sovereign quiet reigned over the valley.  It seemed wider and larger as it opened on the immense distances of the plain, where the trees loomed like little shadowy islands amid a shining and waveless lake.  And Nana grew tenderhearted, felt herself a child again.  Most surely she had dreamed of nights like this at an epoch which she could not recall. Since leaving the train every object of sensation--the wide countryside, the green things with their pungent scents, the house, the vegetables--had stirred her to such a degree that now it seemed to her as if she had left Paris twenty years ago.  Yesterday&#x27;s existence was far, far away, and she was full of sensations of which she had no previous experience.  Georges, meanwhile, was giving her neck little coaxing kisses, and this again added to her sweet unrest.  With hesitating hand she pushed him from her, as though he were a child whose affectionate advances were fatiguing, and once more she told him that he ought to take his departure.  He did not gainsay her.  All in good time--he would go all in good time! But a bird raised its song and again was silent.  It was a robin in an elder tree below the window. &quot;Wait one moment,&quot; whispered Georges; &quot;the lamp&#x27;s frightening him. I&#x27;ll put it out.&quot; And when he came back and took her waist again he added: &quot;We&#x27;ll relight it in a minute.&quot; Then as she listened to the robin and the boy pressed against her side, Nana remembered.  Ah yes, it was in novels that she had got to know all this!  In other days she would have given her heart to have a full moon and robins and a lad dying of love for her.  Great God, she could have cried, so good and charming did it all seem to her! Beyond a doubt she had been born to live honestly!  So she pushed Georges away again, and he grew yet bolder. &quot;No, let me be.  I don&#x27;t care about it.  It would be very wicked at your age.  Now listen--I&#x27;ll always be your mamma.&quot; A sudden feeling of shame overcame her.  She was blushing exceedingly, and yet not a soul could see her.  The room behind them was full of black night while the country stretched before them in silence and lifeless solitude.  Never had she known such a sense of shame before.  Little by little she felt her power of resistance ebbing away, and that despite her embarrassed efforts to the contrary.  That disguise of his, that woman&#x27;s shift and that dressing jacket set her laughing again.  It was as though a girl friend were teasing her. &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s not right; it&#x27;s not right!&quot; she stammered after a last effort. And with that, in face of the lovely night, she sank like a young virgin into the arms of this mere child.  The house slept. Next morning at Les Fondettes, when the bell rang for lunch, the dining-room table was no longer too big for the company.  Fauchery and Daguenet had been driven up together in one carriage, and after them another had arrived with the Count de Vandeuvres, who had followed by the next train.  Georges was the last to come downstairs.  He was looking a little pale, and his eyes were sunken, but in answer to questions he said that he was much better, though he was still somewhat shaken by the violence of the attack.  Mme Hugon looked into his eyes with an anxious smile and adjusted his hair which had been carelessly combed that morning, but he drew back as though embarrassed by this tender little action.  During the meal she chaffed Vandeuvres very pleasantly and declared that she had expected him for five years past. &quot;Well, here you are at last!  How have you managed it?&quot; Vandeuvres took her remarks with equal pleasantry.  He told her that he had lost a fabulous sum of money at the club yesterday and thereupon had come away with the intention of ending up in the country. &quot;&#x27;Pon my word, yes, if only you can find me an heiress in these rustic parts!  There must be delightful women hereabouts.&quot; The old lady rendered equal thanks to Daguenet and Fauchery for having been so good as to accept her son&#x27;s invitation, and then to her great and joyful surprise she saw the Marquis de Chouard enter the room.  A third carriage had brought him. &quot;Dear me, you&#x27;ve made this your trysting place today!&quot; she cried. &quot;You&#x27;ve passed word round!  But what&#x27;s happening?  For years I&#x27;ve never succeeded in bringing you all together, and now you all drop in at once.  Oh, I certainly don&#x27;t complain.&quot; Another place was laid.  Fauchery found himself next the Countess Sabine, whose liveliness and gaiety surprised him when he remembered her drooping, languid state in the austere Rue Miromesnil drawing room.  Daguenet, on the other hand, who was seated on Estelle&#x27;s left, seemed slightly put out by his propinquity to that tall, silent girl.  The angularity of her elbows was disagreeable to him. Muffat and Chouard had exchanged a sly glance while Vandeuvres continued joking about his coming marriage. &quot;Talking of ladies,&quot; Mme Hugon ended by saying, &quot;I have a new neighbor whom you probably know.&quot; And she mentioned Nana.  Vandeuvres affected the liveliest astonishment. &quot;Well, that is strange!  Nana&#x27;s property near here!&quot; Fauchery and Daguenet indulged in a similar demonstration while the Marquis de Chouard discussed the breast of a chicken without appearing to comprehend their meaning.  Not one of the men had smiled. &quot;Certainly,&quot; continued the old lady, &quot;and the person in question arrived at La Mignotte yesterday evening, as I was saying she would. I got my information from the gardener this morning.&quot; At these words the gentlemen could not conceal their very real surprise.  They all looked up.  Eh?  What?  Nana had come down!  But they were only expecting her next day; they were privately under the impression that they would arrive before her!  Georges alone sat looking at his glass with drooped eyelids and a tired expression. Ever since the beginning of lunch he had seemed to be sleeping with open eyes and a vague smile on his lips. &quot;Are you still in pain, my Zizi?&quot; asked his mother, who had been gazing at him throughout the meal. He started and blushed as he said that he was very well now, but the worn-out insatiate expression of a girl who has danced too much did not fade from his face. &quot;What&#x27;s the matter with your neck?&quot; resumed Mme Hugon in an alarmed tone.  &quot;It&#x27;s all red.&quot; He was embarrassed and stammered.  He did not know--he had nothing the matter with his neck.  Then drawing his shirt collar up: &quot;Ah yes, some insect stung me there!&quot; The Marquis de Chouard had cast a sidelong glance at the little red place.  Muffat, too, looked at Georges.  The company was finishing lunch and planning various excursions.  Fauchery was growing increasingly excited with the Countess Sabine&#x27;s laughter.  As he was passing her a dish of fruit their hands touched, and for one second she looked at him with eyes so full of dark meaning that he once more thought of the secret which had been communicated to him one evening after an uproarious dinner.  Then, too, she was no longer the same woman.  Something was more pronounced than of old, and her gray foulard gown which fitted loosely over her shoulders added a touch of license to her delicate, high-strung elegance. When they rose from the table Daguenet remained behind with Fauchery in order to impart to him the following crude witticism about Estelle: &quot;A nice broomstick that to shove into a man&#x27;s hands!&quot; Nevertheless, he grew serious when the journalist told him the amount she was worth in the way of dowry. &quot;Four hundred thousand francs.&quot; &quot;And the mother?&quot; queried Fauchery.  &quot;She&#x27;s all right, eh?&quot; &quot;Oh, SHE&#x27;LL work the oracle!  But it&#x27;s no go, my dear man!&quot; &quot;Bah!  How are we to know?  We must wait and see.&quot; It was impossible to go out that day, for the rain was still falling in heavy showers.  Georges had made haste to disappear from the scene and had double-locked his door.  These gentlemen avoided mutual explanations, though they were none of them deceived as to the reasons which had brought them together.  Vandeuvres, who had had a very bad time at play, had really conceived the notion of lying fallow for a season, and he was counting on Nana&#x27;s presence in the neighborhood as a safeguard against excessive boredom.  Fauchery had taken advantage of the holidays granted him by Rose, who just then was extremely busy.  He was thinking of discussing a second notice with Nana, in case country air should render them reciprocally affectionate.  Daguenet, who had been just a little sulky with her since Steiner had come upon the scene, was dreaming of resuming the old connection or at least of snatching some delightful opportunities if occasion offered.  As to the Marquis de Chouard, he was watching for times and seasons.  But among all those men who were busy following in the tracks of Venus--a Venus with the rouge scarce washed from her cheeks--Muffat was at once the most ardent and the most tortured by the novel sensations of desire and fear and anger warring in his anguished members.  A formal promise had been made him; Nana was awaiting him.  Why then had she taken her departure two days sooner than was expected? He resolved to betake himself to La Mignotte after dinner that same evening.  At night as the count was leaving the park Georges fled forth after him.  He left him to follow the road to Gumieres, crossed the Choue, rushed into Nana&#x27;s presence, breathless, furious and with tears in his eyes.  Ah yes, he understood everything!  That old fellow now on his way to her was coming to keep an appointment! Nana was dumfounded by this ebullition of jealousy, and, greatly moved by the way things were turning out, she took him in her arms and comforted him to the best of her ability.  Oh no, he was quite beside the mark; she was expecting no one.  If the gentleman came it would not be her fault.  What a great ninny that Zizi was to be taking on so about nothing at all!  By her child&#x27;s soul she swore she loved nobody except her own Georges.  And with that she kissed him and wiped away his tears. &quot;Now just listen!  You&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s all for your sake,&quot; she went on when he had grown somewhat calmer.  &quot;Steiner has arrived--he&#x27;s up above there now.  You know, duckie, I can&#x27;t turn HIM out of doors.&quot; &quot;Yes, I know; I&#x27;m not talking of HIM,&quot; whispered the boy. &quot;Very well then, I&#x27;ve stuck him into the room at the end.  I said I was out of sorts.  He&#x27;s unpacking his trunk.  Since nobody&#x27;s seen you, be quick and run up and hide in my room and wait for me. Georges sprang at her and threw his arms round her neck.  It was true after all!  She loved him a little!  So they would put the lamp out as they did yesterday and be in the dark till daytime!  Then as the front-door bell sounded he quietly slipped away.  Upstairs in the bedroom he at once took off his shoes so as not to make any noise and straightway crouched down behind a curtain and waited soberly. Nana welcomed Count Muffat, who, though still shaken with passion, was now somewhat embarrassed.  She had pledged her word to him and would even have liked to keep it since he struck her as a serious, practicable lover.  But truly, who could have foreseen all that happened yesterday?  There was the voyage and the house she had never set eyes on before and the arrival of the drenched little lover!  How sweet it had all seemed to her, and how delightful it would be to continue in it!  So much the worse for the gentleman! For three months past she had been keeping him dangling after her while she affected conventionality in order the further to inflame him.  Well, well!  He would have to continue dangling, and if he didn&#x27;t like that he could go!  She would sooner have thrown up everything than have played false to Georges. The count had seated himself with all the ceremonious politeness becoming a country caller.  Only his hands were trembling slightly. Lust, which Nana&#x27;s skillful tactics daily exasperated, had at last wrought terrible havoc in that sanguine, uncontaminated nature.  The grave man, the chamberlain who was wont to tread the state apartments at the Tuileries with slow and dignified step, was now nightly driven to plunge his teeth into his bolster, while with sobs of exasperation he pictured to himself a sensual shape which never changed.  But this time he was determined to make an end of the torture.  Coming along the highroad in the deep quiet of the gloaming, he had meditated a fierce course of action.  And the moment he had finished his opening remarks he tried to take hold of Nana with both hands. &quot;No, no!  Take care!&quot; she said simply.  She was not vexed; nay, she even smiled. He caught her again, clenching his teeth as he did so.  Then as she struggled to get free he coarsely and crudely reminded her that he had come to stay the night.  Though much embarrassed at this, Nana did not cease to smile.  She took his hands and spoke very familiarly in order to soften her refusal. &quot;Come now, darling, do be quiet!  Honor bright, I can&#x27;t: Steiner&#x27;s upstairs.&quot; But he was beside himself.  Never yet had she seen a man in such a state.  She grew frightened and put her hand over his mouth in order to stifle his cries.  Then in lowered tones she besought him to be quiet and to let her alone.  Steiner was coming downstairs.  Things were getting stupid, to be sure!  When Steiner entered the room he heard Nana remarking: &quot;I adore the country.&quot; She was lounging comfortably back in her deep easy chair, and she turned round and interrupted herself. &quot;It&#x27;s Monsieur le Comte Muffat, darling.  He saw a light here while he was strolling past, and he came in to bid us welcome.&quot; The two men clasped hands.  Muffat, with his face in shadow, stood silent for a moment or two.  Steiner seemed sulky.  Then they chatted about Paris: business there was at a standstill; abominable things had been happening on &#x27;change.  When a quarter of an hour had elapsed Muffat took his departure, and, as the young woman was seeing him to the door, he tried without success to make an assignation for the following night.  Steiner went up to bed almost directly afterward, grumbling, as he did so, at the everlasting little ailments that seemed to afflict the genus courtesan.  The two old boys had been packed off at last!  When she was able to rejoin him Nana found Georges still hiding exemplarily behind the curtain. The room was dark.  He pulled her down onto the floor as she sat near him, and together they began playfully rolling on the ground, stopping now and again and smothering their laughter with kisses whenever they struck their bare feet against some piece of furniture.  Far away, on the road to Gumieres, Count Muffat walked slowly home and, hat in hand, bathed his burning forehead in the freshness and silence of the night. During the days that followed Nana found life adorable.  In the lad&#x27;s arms she was once more a girl of fifteen, and under the caressing influence of this renewed childhood love&#x27;s white flower once more blossomed forth in a nature which had grown hackneyed and disgusted in the service of the other sex.  She would experience sudden fits of shame, sudden vivid emotions, which left her trembling.  She wanted to laugh and to cry, and she was beset by nervous, maidenly feelings, mingled with warm desires that made her blush again.  Never yet had she felt anything comparable to this. The country filled her with tender thoughts.  As a little girl she had long wished to dwell in a meadow, tending a goat, because one day on the talus of the fortifications she had seen a goat bleating at the end of its tether.  Now this estate, this stretch of land belonging to her, simply swelled her heart to bursting, so utterly had her old ambition been surpassed.  Once again she tasted the novel sensations experienced by chits of girls, and at night when she went upstairs, dizzy with her day in the open air and intoxicated by the scent of green leaves, and rejoined her Zizi behind the curtain, she fancied herself a schoolgirl enjoying a holiday escapade.  It was an amour, she thought, with a young cousin to whom she was going to be married.  And so she trembled at the slightest noise and dread lest parents should hear her, while making the delicious experiments and suffering the voluptuous terrors attendant on a girl&#x27;s first slip from the path of virtue. Nana in those days was subject to the fancies a sentimental girl will indulge in.  She would gaze at the moon for hours.  One night she had a mind to go down into the garden with Georges when all the household was asleep.  When there they strolled under the trees, their arms round each other&#x27;s waists, and finally went and laid down in the grass, where the dew soaked them through and through.  On another occasion, after a long silence up in the bedroom, she fell sobbing on the lad&#x27;s neck, declaring in broken accents that she was afraid of dying.  She would often croon a favorite ballad of Mme Lerat&#x27;s, which was full of flowers and birds.  The song would melt her to tears, and she would break off in order to clasp Georges in a passionate embrace and to extract from him vows of undying affection.  In short she was extremely silly, as she herself would admit when they both became jolly good fellows again and sat up smoking cigarettes on the edge of the bed, dangling their bare legs over it the while and tapping their heels against its wooden side. But what utterly melted the young woman&#x27;s heart was Louiset&#x27;s arrival.  She had an access of maternal affection which was as violent as a mad fit.  She would carry off her boy into the sunshine outside to watch him kicking about; she would dress him like a little prince and roll with him in the grass.  The moment he arrived she decided that he was to sleep near her, in the room next hers, where Mme Lerat, whom the country greatly affected, used to begin snoring the moment her head touched the pillow.  Louiset did not hurt Zizi&#x27;s position in the least.  On the contrary, Nana said that she had now two children, and she treated them with the same wayward tenderness.  At night, more than ten times running, she would leave Zizi to go and see if Louiset were breathing properly, but on her return she would re-embrace her Zizi and lavish on him the caresses that had been destined for the child.  She played at being Mamma while he wickedly enjoyed being dandled in the arms of the great wench and allowed himself to be rocked to and fro like a baby that is being sent to sleep.  It was all so delightful, and Nana was so charmed with her present existence, that she seriously proposed to him never to leave the country.  They would send all the other people away, and he, she and the child would live alone.  And with that they would make a thousand plans till daybreak and never once hear Mme Lerat as she snored vigorously after the fatigues of a day spent in picking country flowers. This charming existence lasted nearly a week.  Count Muffat used to come every evening and go away again with disordered face and burning hands.  One evening he was not even received, as Steiner had been obliged to run up to Paris.  He was told that Madame was not well.  Nana grew daily more disgusted at the notion of deceiving Georges.  He was such an innocent lad, and he had such faith in her! She would have looked on herself as the lowest of the low had she played him false.  Besides, it would have sickened her to do so! Zoe, who took her part in this affair in mute disdain, believed that Madame was growing senseless. On the sixth day a band of visitors suddenly blundered into Nana&#x27;s idyl.  She had, indeed, invited a whole swarm of people under the belief that none of them would come.  And so one fine afternoon she was vastly astonished and annoyed to see an omnibus full of people pulling up outside the gate of La Mignotte. &quot;It&#x27;s us!&quot; cried Mignon, getting down first from the conveyance and extracting then his sons Henri and Charles. Labordette thereupon appeared and began handing out an interminable file of ladies--Lucy Stewart, Caroline Hequet, Tatan Nene, Maria Blond.  Nana was in hopes that they would end there, when La Faloise sprang from the step in order to receive Gaga and her daughter Amelie in his trembling arms.  That brought the number up to eleven people.  Their installation proved a laborious undertaking.  There were five spare rooms at La Mignotte, one of which was already occupied by Mme Lerat and Louiset.  The largest was devoted to the Gaga and La Faloise establishment, and it was decided that Amelie should sleep on a truckle bed in the dressing room at the side. Mignon and his two sons had the third room.  Labordette the fourth. There thus remained one room which was transformed into a dormitory with four beds in it for Lucy, Caroline, Tatan and Maria.  As to Steiner, he would sleep on the divan in the drawing room.  At the end of an hour, when everyone was duly settled, Nana, who had begun by being furious, grew enchanted at the thought of playing hostess on a grand scale.  The ladies complimented her on La Mignotte. &quot;It&#x27;s a stunning property, my dear!&quot;  And then, too, they brought her quite a whiff of Parisian air, and talking all together with bursts of laughter and exclamation and emphatic little gestures, they gave her all the petty gossip of the week just past.  By the by, and how about Bordenave?  What had he said about her prank?  Oh, nothing much!  After bawling about having her brought back by the police, he had simply put somebody else in her place at night. Little Violaine was the understudy, and she had even obtained a very pretty success as the Blonde Venus.  Which piece of news made Nana rather serious. It was only four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, and there was some talk of taking a stroll around. &quot;Oh, I haven&#x27;t told you,&quot; said Nana, &quot;I was just off to get up potatoes when you arrived.&quot; Thereupon they all wanted to go and dig potatoes without even changing their dresses first.  It was quite a party.  The gardener and two helpers were already in the potato field at the end of the grounds.  The ladies knelt down and began fumbling in the mold with their beringed fingers, shouting gaily whenever they discovered a potato of exceptional size.  It struck them as so amusing!  But Tatan Nene was in a state of triumph!  So many were the potatoes she had gathered in her youth that she forgot herself entirely and gave the others much good advice, treating them like geese the while. The gentlemen toiled less strenuously.  Mignon looked every inch the good citizen and father and made his stay in the country an occasion for completing his boys&#x27; education.  Indeed, he spoke to them of Parmentier! Dinner that evening was wildly hilarious.  The company ate ravenously.  Nana, in a state of great elevation, had a warm disagreement with her butler, an individual who had been in service at the bishop&#x27;s palace in Orleans.  The ladies smoked over their coffee.  An earsplitting noise of merrymaking issued from the open windows and died out far away under the serene evening sky while peasants, belated in the lanes, turned and looked at the flaring rooms. &quot;It&#x27;s most tiresome that you&#x27;re going back the day after tomorrow,&quot; said Nana.  &quot;But never mind, we&#x27;ll get up an excursion all the same!&quot; They decided to go on the morrow, Sunday, and visit the ruins of the old Abbey of Chamont, which were some seven kilometers distant. Five carriages would come out from Orleans, take up the company after lunch and bring them back to dinner at La Mignotte at about seven.  It would be delightful. That evening, as his wont was, Count Muffat mounted the hill to ring at the outer gate.  But the brightly lit windows and the shouts of laughter astonished him.  When, however, he recognized Mignon&#x27;s voice, he understood it all and went off, raging at this new obstacle, driven to extremities, bent on some violent act.  Georges passed through a little door of which he had the key, slipped along the staircase walls and went quietly up into Nana&#x27;s room.  Only he had to wait for her till past midnight.  She appeared at last in a high state of intoxication and more maternal even than on the previous nights.  Whenever she had drunk anything she became so amorous as to be absurd.  Accordingly she now insisted on his accompanying her to the Abbey of Chamont.  But he stood out against this; he was afraid of being seen.  If he were to be seen driving with her there would be an atrocious scandal.  But she burst into tears and evinced the noisy despair of a slighted woman.  And he thereupon consoled her and formally promised to be one of the party. &quot;So you do love me very much,&quot; she blurted out.  &quot;Say you love me very much.  Oh, my darling old bear, if I were to die would you feel it very much?  Confess!&quot; At Les Fondettes the near neighborhood of Nana had utterly disorganized the party.  Every morning during lunch good Mme Hugon returned to the subject despite herself, told her guests the news the gardener had brought her and gave evidence of the absorbing curiosity with which notorious courtesans are able to inspire even the worthiest old ladies.  Tolerant though she was, she was revolted and maddened by a vague presentiment of coming ill, which frightened her in the evenings as thoroughly as if a wild beast had escaped from a menagerie and were known to be lurking in the countryside. She began trying to pick a little quarrel with her guests, whom she each and all accused of prowling round La Mignotte.  Count Vandeuvres had been seen laughing on the highroad with a golden- haired lady, but he defended himself against the accusation; he denied that it was Nana, the fact being that Lucy had been with him and had told him how she had just turned her third prince out of doors.  The Marquis de Chouard used also to go out every day, but his excuse was doctor&#x27;s orders.  Toward Daguenet and Fauchery Mme Hugon behaved unjustly too.  The former especially never left Les Fondettes, for he had given up the idea of renewing the old connection and was busy paying the most respectful attentions to Estelle.  Fauchery also stayed with the Muffat ladies.  On one occasion only he had met Mignon with an armful of flowers, putting his sons through a course of botanical instruction in a by-path. The two men had shaken hands and given each other the news about Rose.  She was perfectly well and happy; they had both received a letter from her that morning in which she besought them to profit by the fresh country air for some days longer.  Among all her guests the old lady spared only Count Muffat and Georges.  The count, who said he had serious business in Orleans, could certainly not be running after the bad woman, and as to Georges, the poor child was at last causing her grave anxiety, seeing that every evening he was seized with atrocious sick headaches which kept him to his bed in broad daylight. Meanwhile Fauchery had become the Countess Sabine&#x27;s faithful attendant in the absence during each afternoon of Count Muffat. Whenever they went to the end of the park he carried her campstool and her sunshade.  Besides, he amused her with the original witticisms peculiar to a second-rate journalist, and in so doing he prompted her to one of those sudden intimacies which are allowable in the country.  She had apparently consented to it from the first, for she had grown quite a girl again in the society of a young man whose noisy humor seemed unlikely to compromize her.  But now and again, when for a second or two they found themselves alone behind the shrubs, their eyes would meet; they would pause amid their laughter, grow suddenly serious and view one another darkly, as though they had fathomed and divined their inmost hearts. On Friday a fresh place had to be laid at lunch time.  M. Theophile Venot, whom Mme Hugon remembered to have invited at the Muffats&#x27; last winter, had just arrived.  He sat stooping humbly forward and behaved with much good nature, as became a man of no account, nor did he seem to notice the anxious deference with which he was treated.  When he had succeeded in getting the company to forget his presence he sat nibbling small lumps of sugar during dessert, looking sharply up at Daguenet as the latter handed Estelle strawberries and listening to Fauchery, who was making the countess very merry over one of his anecdotes.  Whenever anyone looked at HIM he smiled in his quiet way.  When the guests rose from table he took the count&#x27;s arm and drew him into the park.  He was known to have exercised great influence over the latter ever since the death of his mother.  Indeed, singular stories were told about the kind of dominion which the ex-lawyer enjoyed in that household.  Fauchery, whom his arrival doubtless embarrassed, began explaining to Georges and Daguenet the origin of the man&#x27;s wealth.  It was a big lawsuit with the management of which the Jesuits had entrusted him in days gone by.  In his opinion the worthy man was a terrible fellow despite his gentle, plump face and at this time of day had his finger in all the intrigues of the priesthood.  The two young men had begun joking at this, for they thought the little old gentleman had an idiotic expression.  The idea of an unknown Venot, a gigantic Venot, acting for the whole body of the clergy, struck them in the light of a comical invention.  But they were silenced when, still leaning on the old man&#x27;s arm, Count Muffat reappeared with blanched cheeks and eyes reddened as if by recent weeping. I bet they&#x27;ve been chatting about hell,&quot; muttered Fauchery in a bantering tone. The Countess Sabine overheard the remark.  She turned her head slowly, and their eyes met in that long gaze with which they were accustomed to sound one another prudently before venturing once for all. After the breakfast it was the guests&#x27; custom to betake themselves to a little flower garden on a terrace overlooking the plain.  This Sunday afternoon was exquisitely mild.  There had been signs of rain toward ten in the morning, but the sky, without ceasing to be covered, had, as it were, melted into milky fog, which now hung like a cloud of luminous dust in the golden sunlight.  Soon Mme Hugon proposed that they should step down through a little doorway below the terrace and take a walk on foot in the direction of Gumieres and as far as the Choue.  She was fond of walking and, considering her threescore years, was very active.  Besides, all her guests declared that there was no need to drive.  So in a somewhat straggling order they reached the wooden bridge over the river.  Fauchery and Daguenet headed the column with the Muffat ladies and were followed by the count and the marquis, walking on either side of Mme Hugon, while Vandeuvres, looking fashionable and out of his element on the highroad, marched in the rear, smoking a cigar.  M. Venot, now slackening, now hastening his pace, passed smilingly from group to group, as though bent on losing no scrap of conversation. &quot;To think of poor dear Georges at Orleans!&quot; said Mme Hugon.  &quot;He was anxious to consult old Doctor Tavernier, who never goes out now, on the subject of his sick headaches.  Yes, you were not up, as he went off before seven o&#x27;clock.  But it&#x27;ll be a change for him all the same.&quot; She broke off, exclaiming: &quot;Why, what&#x27;s making them stop on the bridge?&quot; The fact was the ladies and Fauchery and Daguenet were standing stock-still on the crown of the bridge.  They seemed to be hesitating as though some obstacle or other rendered them uneasy and yet the way lay clear before them. &quot;Go on!&quot; cried the count. They never moved and seemed to be watching the approach of something which the rest had not yet observed.  Indeed the road wound considerably and was bordered by a thick screen of poplar trees. Nevertheless, a dull sound began to grow momentarily louder, and soon there was a noise of wheels, mingled with shouts of laughter and the cracking of whips.  Then suddenly five carriages came into view, driving one behind the other.  They were crowded to bursting, and bright with a galaxy of white, blue and pink costumes. &quot;What is it?&quot; said Mme Hugon in some surprise. Then her instinct told her, and she felt indignant at such an untoward invasion of her road. &quot;Oh, that woman!&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Walk on, pray walk on.  Don&#x27;t appear to notice.&quot; But it was too late.  The five carriages which were taking Nana and her circle to the ruins of Chamont rolled on to the narrow wooden bridge.  Fauchery, Daguenet and the Muffat ladies were forced to step backward, while Mme Hugon and the others had also to stop in Indian file along the roadside.  It was a superb ride past!  The laughter in the carriages had ceased, and faces were turned with an expression of curiosity.  The rival parties took stock of each other amid a silence broken only by the measured trot of the horses.  In the first carriage Maria Blond and Tatan Nene were lolling backward like a pair of duchesses, their skirts swelling forth over the wheels, and as they passed they cast disdainful glances at the honest women who were walking afoot.  Then came Gaga, filling up a whole seat and half smothering La Faloise beside her so that little but his small anxious face was visible.  Next followed Caroline Hequet with Labordette, Lucy Stewart with Mignon and his boys and at the close of all Nana in a victoria with Steiner and on a bracket seat in front of her that poor, darling Zizi, with his knees jammed against her own. &quot;It&#x27;s the last of them, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; the countess placidly asked Fauchery, pretending at the same time not to recognize Nana. The wheel of the victoria came near grazing her, but she did not step back.  The two women had exchanged a deeply significant glance. It was, in fact, one of those momentary scrutinies which are at once complete and definite.  As to the men, they behaved unexceptionably. Fauchery and Daguenet looked icy and recognized no one.  The marquis, more nervous than they and afraid of some farcical ebullition on the part of the ladies, had plucked a blade of grass and was rolling it between his fingers.  Only Vandeuvres, who had stayed somewhat apart from the rest of the company, winked imperceptibly at Lucy, who smiled at him as she passed. &quot;Be careful!&quot; M. Venot had whispered as he stood behind Count Muffat. The latter in extreme agitation gazed after this illusive vision of Nana while his wife turned slowly round and scrutinized him.  Then he cast his eyes on the ground as though to escape the sound of galloping hoofs which were sweeping away both his senses and his heart.  He could have cried aloud in his agony, for, seeing Georges among Nana&#x27;s skirts, he understood it all now.  A mere child!  He was brokenhearted at the thought that she should have preferred a mere child to him!  Steiner was his equal, but that child! Mme Hugon, in the meantime, had not at once recognized Georges. Crossing the bridge, he was fain to jump into the river, but Nana&#x27;s knees restrained him.  Then white as a sheet and icy cold, he sat rigidly up in his place and looked at no one.  It was just possible no one would notice him. &quot;Oh, my God!&quot; said the old lady suddenly.  &quot;Georges is with her!&quot; The carriages had passed quite through the uncomfortable crowd of people who recognized and yet gave no sign of recognition.  The short critical encounter seemed to have been going on for ages.  And now the wheels whirled away the carriageloads of girls more gaily than ever.  Toward the fair open country they went, amid the buffetings of the fresh air of heaven.  Bright-colored fabrics fluttered in the wind, and the merry laughter burst forth anew as the voyagers began jesting and glancing back at the respectable folks halting with looks of annoyance at the roadside.  Turning round, Nana could see the walking party hesitating and then returning the way they had come without crossing the bridge.  Mme Hugon was leaning silently on Count Muffat&#x27;s arm, and so sad was her look that no one dared comfort her. &quot;I say, did you see Fauchery, dear?&quot; Nana shouted to Lucy, who was leaning out of the carriage in front.  &quot;What a brute he was!  He shall pay out for that.  And Paul, too, a fellow I&#x27;ve been so kind to!  Not a sign!  They&#x27;re polite, I&#x27;m sure.&quot; And with that she gave Steiner a terrible dressing, he having ventured to suggest that the gentlemen&#x27;s attitude had been quite as it should be.  So then they weren&#x27;t even worth a bow?  The first blackguard that came by might insult them?  Thanks!  He was the right sort, too, he was!  It couldn&#x27;t be better!  One ought always to bow to a woman. &quot;Who&#x27;s the tall one?&quot; asked Lucy at random, shouting through the noise of the wheels. &quot;It&#x27;s the Countess Muffat,&quot; answered Steiner. &quot;There now!  I suspected as much,&quot; said Nana.  &quot;Now, my dear fellow, it&#x27;s all very well her being a countess, for she&#x27;s no better than she should be.  Yes, yes, she&#x27;s no better that she should be.  You know, I&#x27;ve got an eye for such things, I have!  And now I know your countess as well as if I had been at the making of her!  I&#x27;ll bet you that she&#x27;s the mistress of that viper Fauchery!  I tell you, she&#x27;s his mistress!  Between women you guess that sort of thing at once!&quot; Steiner shrugged his shoulders.  Since the previous day his irritation had been hourly increasing.  He had received letters which necessitated his leaving the following morning, added to which he did not much appreciate coming down to the country in order to sleep on the drawing-room divan. &quot;And this poor baby boy!&quot; Nana continued, melting suddenly at sight of Georges&#x27;s pale face as he still sat rigid and breathless in front of her. &quot;D&#x27;you think Mamma recognized me?&quot; he stammered at last. &quot;Oh, most surely she did!  Why, she cried out!  But it&#x27;s my fault. He didn&#x27;t want to come with us; I forced him to.  Now listen, Zizi, would you like me to write to your mamma?  She looks such a kind, decent sort of lady!  I&#x27;ll tell her that I never saw you before and that it was Steiner who brought you with him for the first time today.&quot; &quot;No, no, don&#x27;t write,&quot; said Georges in great anxiety.  &quot;I&#x27;ll explain it all myself.  Besides, if they bother me about it I shan&#x27;t go home again.&quot; But he continued plunged in thought, racking his brains for excuses against his return home in the evening.  The five carriages were rolling through a flat country along an interminable straight road bordered by fine trees.  The country was bathed in a silvery-gray atmosphere.  The ladies still continued shouting remarks from carriage to carriage behind the backs of the drivers, who chuckled over their extraordinary fares.  Occasionally one of them would rise to her feet to look at the landscape and, supporting herself on her neighbor&#x27;s shoulder, would grow extremely excited till a sudden jolt brought her down to the seat again.  Caroline Hequet in the meantime was having a warm discussion with Labordette.  Both of them were agreed that Nana would be selling her country house before three months were out, and Caroline was urging Labordette to buy it back for her for as little as it was likely to fetch.  In front of them La Faloise, who was very amorous and could not get at Gaga&#x27;s apoplectic neck, was imprinting kisses on her spine through her dress, the strained fabric of which was nigh splitting, while Amelie, perching stiffly on the bracket seat, was bidding them be quiet, for she was horrified to be sitting idly by, watching her mother being kissed.  In the next carriage Mignon, in order to astonish Lucy, was making his sons recite a fable by La Fontaine. Henri was prodigious at this exercise; he could spout you one without pause or hesitation.  But Maria Blond, at the head of the procession, was beginning to feel extremely bored.  She was tired of hoaxing that blockhead of a Tatan Nene with a story to the effect that the Parisian dairywomen were wont to fabricate eggs with a mixture of paste and saffron.  The distance was too great: were they never going to get to their destination?  And the question was transmitted from carriage to carriage and finally reached Nana, who, after questioning her driver, got up and shouted: &quot;We&#x27;ve not got a quarter of an hour more to go.  You see that church behind the trees down there?&quot; Then she continued: &quot;Do you know, it appears the owner of the Chateau de Chamont is an old lady of Napoleon&#x27;s time?  Oh, SHE was a merry one!  At least, so Joseph told me, and he heard it from the servants at the bishop&#x27;s palace.  There&#x27;s no one like it nowadays, and for the matter of that, she&#x27;s become goody-goody.&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s her name?&quot; asked Lucy. &quot;Madame d&#x27;Anglars.&quot; &quot;Irma d&#x27;Anglars--I knew her!&quot; cried Gaga. Admiring exclamations burst from the line of carriages and were borne down the wind as the horses quickened their trot.  Heads were stretched out in Gaga&#x27;s direction; Maria Blond and Tatan Nene turned round and knelt on the seat while they leaned over the carriage hood, and the air was full of questions and cutting remarks, tempered by a certain obscure admiration.  Gaga had known her!  The idea filled them all with respect for that far-off past. &quot;Dear me, I was young then,&quot; continued Gaga.  &quot;But never mind, I remember it all.  I saw her pass.  They said she was disgusting in her own house, but, driving in her carriage, she WAS just smart! And the stunning tales about her!  Dirty doings and money flung about like one o&#x27;clock!  I don&#x27;t wonder at all that she&#x27;s got a fine place.  Why, she used to clean out a man&#x27;s pockets as soon as look at him.  Irma d&#x27;Anglars still in the land of the living!  Why, my little pets, she must be near ninety.&quot; At this the ladies became suddenly serious.  Ninety years old!  The deuce, there wasn&#x27;t one of them, as Lucy loudly declared, who would live to that age.  They were all done for.  Besides, Nana said she didn&#x27;t want to make old bones; it wouldn&#x27;t be amusing.  They were drawing near their destination, and the conversation was interrupted by the cracking of whips as the drivers put their horses to their best paces.  Yet amid all the noise Lucy continued talking and, suddenly changing the subject, urged Nana to come to town with them all to-morrow.  The exhibition was soon to close, and the ladies must really return to Paris, where the season was surpassing their expectations.  But Nana was obstinate.  She loathed Paris; she wouldn&#x27;t set foot there yet! &quot;Eh, darling, we&#x27;ll stay?&quot; she said, giving Georges&#x27;s knees a squeeze, as though  Steiner were of no account. The carriages had pulled up abruptly, and in some surprise the company got out on some waste ground at the bottom of a small hill. With his whip one of the drivers had to point them out the ruins of the old Abbey of Chamont where they lay hidden among trees.  It was a great sell!  The ladies voted them silly.  Why, they were only a heap of old stones with briers growing over them and part of a tumble-down tower.  It really wasn&#x27;t worth coming a couple of leagues to see that!  Then the driver pointed out to them the countryseat, the park of which stretched away from the abbey, and he advised them to take a little path and follow the walls surrounding it.  They would thus make the tour of the place while the carriages would go and await them in the village square.  It was a delightful walk, and the company agreed to the proposition. &quot;Lord love me, Irma knows how to take care of herself!&quot; said Gaga, halting before a gate at the corner of the park wall abutting on the highroad. All of them stood silently gazing at the enormous bush which stopped up the gateway.  Then following the little path, they skirted the park wall, looking up from time to time to admire the trees, whose lofty branches stretched out over them and formed a dense vault of greenery.  After three minutes or so they found themselves in front of a second gate.  Through this a wide lawn was visible, over which two venerable oaks cast dark masses of shadow.  Three minutes farther on yet another gate afforded them an extensive view of a great avenue, a perfect corridor of shadow, at the end of which a bright spot of sunlight gleamed like a star.  They stood in silent, wondering admiration, and then little by little exclamations burst from their lips.  They had been trying hard to joke about it all with a touch of envy at heart, but this decidedly and immeasurably impressed them.  What a genius that Irma was!  A sight like this gave you a rattling notion of the woman!  The trees stretched away and away, and there were endlessly recurrent patches of ivy along the wall with glimpses of lofty roofs and screens of poplars interspersed with dense masses of elms and aspens.  Was there no end to it then?  The ladies would have liked to catch sight of the mansion house, for they were weary of circling on and on, weary of seeing nothing but leafy recesses through every opening they came to.  They took the rails of the gate in their hands and pressed their faces against the ironwork.  And thus excluded and isolated, a feeling of respect began to overcome them as they thought of the castle lost to view in surrounding immensity.  Soon, being quite unused to walking, they grew tired.  And the wall did not leave off; at every turn of the small deserted path the same range of gray stones stretched ahead of them.  Some of them began to despair of ever getting to the end of it and began talking of returning.  But the more their long walk fatigued them, the more respectful they became, for at each successive step they were increasingly impressed by the tranquil, lordly dignity of the domain. &quot;It&#x27;s getting silly, this is!&quot; said Caroline Hequet, grinding her teeth. Nana silenced her with a shrug.  For some moments past she had been rather pale and extremely serious and had not spoken a single word. Suddenly the path gave a final turn; the wall ended, and as they came out on the village square the mansion house stood before them on the farther side of its grand outer court.  All stopped to admire the proud sweep of the wide steps, the twenty frontage windows, the arrangement of the three wings, which were built of brick framed by courses of stone.  Henri IV had erewhile inhabited this historic mansion, and his room, with its great bed hung with Genoa velvet, was still preserved there.  Breathless with admiration, Nana gave a little childish sigh. &quot;Great God!&quot; she whispered very quietly to herself. But the party were deeply moved when Gaga suddenly announced that Irma herself was standing yonder in front of the church.  She recognized her perfectly.  She was as upright as of old, the hoary campaigner, and that despite her age, and she still had those eyes which flashed when she moved in that proud way of hers!  Vespers were just over, and for a second or two Madame stood in the church porch.  She was dressed in a dark brown silk and looked very simple and very tall, her venerable face reminding one of some old marquise who had survived the horrors of the Great Revolution.  In her right hand a huge Book of Hours shone in the sunlight, and very slowly she crossed the square, followed some fifteen paces off by a footman in livery.  The church was emptying, and all the inhabitants of Chamont bowed before her with extreme respect.  An old man even kissed her hand, and a woman wanted to fall on her knees.  Truly this was a potent queen, full of years and honors.  She mounted her flight of steps and vanished from view. &quot;That&#x27;s what one attains to when one has methodical habits!&quot; said Mignon with an air of conviction, looking at his sons and improving the occasion. Then everybody said his say.  Labordette thought her extraordinarily well preserved.  Maria Blond let slip a foul expression and vexed Lucy, who declared that one ought to honor gray hairs.  All the women, to sum up, agreed that she was a perfect marvel.  Then the company got into their conveyances again.  From Chamont all the way to La Mignotte Nana remained silent.  She had twice turned round to look back at the house, and now, lulled by the sound of the wheels, she forgot that Steiner was at her side and that Georges was in front of her.  A vision had come up out of the twilight, and the great lady seemed still to be sweeping by with all the majesty of a potent queen, full of years and of honors. That evening Georges re-entered Les Fondettes in time for dinner. Nana, who had grown increasingly absent-minded and singular in point of manner, had sent him to ask his mamma&#x27;s forgiveness.  It was his plain duty, she remarked severely, growing suddenly solicitous for the decencies of family life.  She even made him swear not to return for the night; she was tired, and in showing proper obedience he was doing no more than his duty.  Much bored by this moral discourse, Georges appeared in his mother&#x27;s presence with heavy heart and downcast head. Fortunately for him his brother Philippe, a great merry devil of a military man, had arrived during the day, a fact which greatly curtailed the scene he was dreading.  Mme Hugon was content to look at him with eyes full of tears while Philippe, who had been put in possession of the facts, threatened to go and drag him home by the scruff of the neck if ever he went back into that woman&#x27;s society. Somewhat comforted, Georges began slyly planning how to make his escape toward two o&#x27;clock next day in order to arrange about future meetings with Nana. Nevertheless, at dinnertime the house party at Les Fondettes seemed not a little embarrassed.  Vandeuvres had given notice of departure, for he was anxious to take Lucy back to Paris with him.  He was amused at the idea of carrying off this girl whom he had known for ten years yet never desired.  The Marquis de Chouard bent over his plate and meditated on Gaga&#x27;s young lady.  He could well remember dandling Lili on his knee.  What a way children had of shooting up! This little thing was becoming extremely plump!  But Count Muffat especially was silent and absorbed.  His cheeks glowed, and he had given Georges one long look.  Dinner over, he went upstairs, intending to shut himself in his bedroom, his pretext being a slight feverish attack.  M. Venot had rushed after him, and upstairs in the bedroom a scene ensued.  The count threw himself upon the bed and strove to stifle a fit of nervous sobbing in the folds of the pillow while M. Venot, in a soft voice, called him brother and advised him to implore heaven for mercy.  But he heard nothing: there was a rattle in his throat.  Suddenly he sprang off the bed and stammered: &quot;I am going there.  I can&#x27;t resist any longer.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; said the old man, &quot;I go with you.&quot; As they left the house two shadows were vanishing into the dark depths of a garden walk, for every evening now Fauchery and the Countess Sabine left Daguenet to help Estelle make tea.  Once on the highroad the count walked so rapidly that his companion had to run in order to follow him.  Though utterly out of breath, the latter never ceased showering on him the most conclusive arguments against the temptations of the flesh.  But the other never opened his mouth as he hurried away into the night.  Arrived in front of La Mignotte, he said simply: &quot;I can&#x27;t resist any longer.  Go!&quot; &quot;God&#x27;s will be done then!&quot; muttered M. Venot.  &quot;He uses every method to assure His final triumph.  Your sin will become His weapon.&quot; At La Mignotte there was much wrangling during the evening meal. Nana had found a letter from Bordenave awaiting her, in which he advised rest, just as though he were anxious to be rid of her. Little Violaine, he said, was being encored twice nightly.  But when Mignon continued urging her to come away with them on the morrow Nana grew exasperated and declared that she did not intend taking advice from anybody.  In other ways, too, her behavior at table was ridiculously stuck up.  Mme Lerat having made some sharp little speech or other, she loudly announced that, God willing, she wasn&#x27;t going to let anyone--no, not even her own aunt--make improper remarks in her presence.  After which she dreed her guests with honorable sentiments.  She seemed to be suffering from a fit of stupid right-mindedness, and she treated them all to projects of religious education for Louiset and to a complete scheme of regeneration for herself.  When the company began laughing she gave vent to profound opinions, nodding her head like a grocer&#x27;s wife who knows what she is saying.  Nothing but order could lead to fortune! And so far as she was concerned, she had no wish to die like a beggar!  She set the ladies&#x27; teeth on edge.  They burst out in protest.  Could anyone have been converting Nana?  No, it was impossible!  But she sat quite still and with absent looks once more plunged into dreamland, where the vision of an extremely wealthy and greatly courted Nana rose up before her. The household were going upstairs to bed when Muffat put in an appearance.  It was Labordette who caught sight of him in the garden.  He understood it all at once and did him a service, for he got Steiner out of the way and, taking his hand, led him along the dark corridor as far as Nana&#x27;s bedroom.  In affairs of this kind Labordette was wont to display the most perfect tact and cleverness. Indeed, he seemed delighted to be making other people happy.  Nana showed no surprise; she was only somewhat annoyed by the excessive heat of Muffat&#x27;s pursuit.  Life was a serious affair, was it not? Love was too silly: it led to nothing.  Besides, she had her scruples in view of Zizi&#x27;s tender age.  Indeed, she had scarcely behaved quite fairly toward him.  Dear me, yes, she was choosing the proper course again in taking up with an old fellow. &quot;Zoe,&quot; she said to the lady&#x27;s maid, who was enchanted at the thought of leaving the country, &quot;pack the trunks when you get up tomorrow. We are going back to Paris.&quot; And she went to bed with Muffat but experienced no pleasure. CHAPTER VII One December evening three months afterward Count Muffat was strolling in the Passage des Panoramas.  The evening was very mild, and owing to a passing shower, the passage had just become crowded with people.  There was a perfect mob of them, and they thronged slowly and laboriously along between the shops on either side. Under the windows, white with reflected light, the pavement was violently illuminated.  A perfect stream of brilliancy emanated from white globes, red lanterns, blue transparencies, lines of gas jets, gigantic watches and fans, outlined in flame and burning in the open.  And the motley displays in the shops, the gold ornaments of the jeweler&#x27;s, the glass ornaments of the confectioner&#x27;s, the light- colored silks of the modiste&#x27;s, seemed to shine again in the crude light of the reflectors behind the clear plate-glass windows, while among the bright-colored, disorderly array of shop signs a huge purple glove loomed in the distance like a bleeding hand which had been severed from an arm and fastened to a yellow cuff. Count Muffat had slowly returned as far as the boulevard.  He glanced out at the roadway and then came sauntering back along the shopwindows.  The damp and heated atmosphere filled the narrow passage with a slight luminous mist.  Along the flagstones, which had been wet by the drip-drop of umbrellas, the footsteps of the crowd rang continually, but there was no sound of voices.  Passers- by elbowed him at every turn and cast inquiring looks at his silent face, which the gaslight rendered pale.  And to escape these curious manifestations the count posted himself in front of a stationer&#x27;s, where with profound attention contemplated an array of paperweights in the form of glass bowls containing floating landscapes and flowers. He was conscious of nothing: he was thinking of Nana.  Why had she lied to him again?  That morning she had written and told him not to trouble about her in the evening, her excuse being that Louiset was ill and that she was going to pass the night at her aunt&#x27;s in order to nurse him.  But he had felt suspicious and had called at her house, where he learned from the porter that Madame had just gone off to her theater.  He was astonished at this, for she was not playing in the new piece.  Why then should she have told him this falsehood, and what could she be doing at the Varietes that evening? Hustled by a passer-by, the count unconsciously left the paperweights and found himself in front of a glass case full of toys, where he grew absorbed over an array of pocketbooks and cigar cases, all of which had the same blue swallow stamped on one corner. Nana was most certainly not the same woman!  In the early days after his return from the country she used to drive him wild with delight, as with pussycat caresses she kissed him all round his face and whiskers and vowed that he was her own dear pet and the only little man she adored.  He was no longer afraid of Georges, whom his mother kept down at Les Fondettes.  There was only fat Steiner to reckon with, and he believed he was really ousting him, but he did not dare provoke an explanation on his score.  He knew he was once more in an extraordinary financial scrape and on the verge of being declared bankrupt on &#x27;change, so much so that he was clinging fiercely to the shareholders in the Landes Salt Pits and striving to sweat a final subscription out of them.  Whenever he met him at Nana&#x27;s she would explain reasonably enough that she did not wish to turn him out of doors like a dog after all he had spent on her.  Besides, for the last three months he had been living in such a whirl of sensual excitement that, beyond the need of possessing her, he had felt no very distinct impressions.  His was a tardy awakening of the fleshly instinct, a childish greed of enjoyment, which left no room for either vanity or jealousy.  Only one definite feeling could affect him now, and that was Nana&#x27;s decreasing kindness.  She no longer kissed him on the beard!  It made him anxious, and as became a man quite ignorant of womankind, he began asking himself what possible cause of offense he could have given her.  Besides, he was under the impression that he was satisfying all her desires.  And so he harked back again and again to the letter he had received that morning with its tissue of falsehoods, invented for the extremely simple purpose of passing an evening at her own theater.  The crowd had pushed him forward again, and he had crossed the passage and was puzzling his brain in front of the entrance to a restaurant, his eyes fixed on some plucked larks and on a huge salmon laid out inside the window. At length he seemed to tear himself away from this spectacle.  He shook himself, looked up and noticed that it was close on nine o&#x27;clock.  Nana would soon be coming out, and he would make her tell the truth.  And with that he walked on and recalled to memory the evenings he once passed in that region in the days when he used to meet her at the door of the theater. He knew all the shops, and in the gas-laden air he recognized their different scents, such, for instance, as the strong savor of Russia leather, the perfume of vanilla emanating from a chocolate dealer&#x27;s basement, the savor of musk blown in whiffs from the open doors of the perfumers.  But he did not dare linger under the gaze of the pale shopwomen, who looked placidly at him as though they knew him by sight.  For one instant he seemed to be studying the line of little round windows above the shops, as though he had never noticed them before among the medley of signs.  Then once again he went up to the boulevard and stood still a minute or two.  A fine rain was now falling, and the cold feel of it on his hands calmed him.  He thought of his wife who was staying in a country house near Macon, where her friend Mme de Chezelles had been ailing a good deal since the autumn.  The carriages in the roadway were rolling through a stream of mud.  The country, he thought, must be detestable in such vile weather.  But suddenly he became anxious and re-entered the hot, close passage down which he strode among the strolling people. A thought struck him: if Nana were suspicious of his presence there she would be off along the Galerie Montmartre. After that the count kept a sharp lookout at the very door of the theater, though he did not like this passage end, where he was afraid of being recognized.  It was at the corner between the Galerie des Varietes and the Galerie Saint-Marc, an equivocal corner full of obscure little shops.  Of these last one was a shoemaker&#x27;s, where customers never seemed to enter.  Then there were two or three upholsterers&#x27;, deep in dust, and a smoky, sleepy reading room and library, the shaded lamps in which cast a green and slumberous light all the evening through.  There was never anyone in this corner save well-dressed, patient gentlemen, who prowled about the wreckage peculiar to a stage door, where drunken sceneshifters and ragged chorus girls congregate.  In front of the theater a single gas jet in a ground-glass globe lit up the doorway.  For a moment or two Muffat thought of questioning Mme Bron; then he grew afraid lest Nana should get wind of his presence and escape by way of the boulevard.  So he went on the march again and determined to wait till he was turned out at the closing of the gates, an event which had happened on two previous occasions.  The thought of returning home to his solitary bed simply wrung his heart with anguish.  Every time that golden-haired girls and men in dirty linen came out and stared at him he returned to his post in front of the reading room, where, looking in between two advertisements posted on a windowpane, he was always greeted by the same sight.  It was a little old man, sitting stiff and solitary at the vast table and holding a green newspaper in his green hands under the green light of one of the lamps.  But shortly before ten o&#x27;clock another gentleman, a tall, good-looking, fair man with well-fitting gloves, was also walking up and down in front of the stage door.  Thereupon at each successive turn the pair treated each other to a suspicious sidelong glance. The count walked to the corner of the two galleries, which was adorned with a high mirror, and when he saw himself therein, looking grave and elegant, he was both ashamed and nervous. Ten o&#x27;clock struck, and suddenly it occurred to Muffat that it would be very easy to find out whether Nana were in her dressing room or not.  He went up the three steps, crossed the little yellow-painted lobby and slipped into the court by a door which simply shut with a latch.  At that hour of the night the narrow, damp well of a court, with its pestiferous water closets, its fountain, its back view ot the kitchen stove and the collection of plants with which the portress used to litter the place, was drenched in dark mist; but the two walls, rising pierced with windows on either hand, were flaming with light, since the property room and the firemen&#x27;s office were situated on the ground floor, with the managerial bureau on the left, and on the right and upstairs the dressing rooms of the company.  The mouths of furnaces seemed to be opening on the outer darkness from top to bottom of this well.  The count had at once marked the light in the windows of the dressing room on the first floor, and as a man who is comforted and happy, he forgot where he was and stood gazing upward amid the foul mud and faint decaying smell peculiar to the premises of this antiquated Parisian building. Big drops were dripping from a broken waterspout, and a ray of gaslight slipped from Mme Bron&#x27;s window and cast a yellow glare over a patch of moss-clad pavement, over the base of a wall which had been rotted by water from a sink, over a whole cornerful of nameless filth amid which old pails and broken crocks lay in fine confusion round a spindling tree growing mildewed in its pot.  A window fastening creaked, and the count fled. Nana was certainly going to come down.  He returned to his post in front of the reading room; among its slumbering shadows, which seemed only broken by the glimmer of a night light, the little old man still sat motionless, his side face sharply outlined against his newspaper.  Then Muffat walked again and this time took a more prolonged turn and, crossing the large gallery, followed the Galerie des Varietes as far as that of Feydeau.  The last mentioned was cold and deserted and buried in melancholy shadow.  He returned from it, passed by the theater, turned the corner of the Galerie Saint-Marc and ventured as far as the Galerie Montmartre, where a sugar- chopping machine in front of a grocer&#x27;s interested him awhile.  But when he was taking his third turn he was seized with such dread lest Nana should escape behind his back that he lost all self-respect. Thereupon he stationed himself beside the fair gentleman in front of the very theater.  Both exchanged a glance of fraternal humility with which was mingled a touch of distrust, for it was possible they might yet turn out to be rivals.  Some sceneshifters who came out smoking their pipes between the acts brushed rudely against them, but neither one nor the other ventured to complain.  Three big wenches with untidy hair and dirty gowns appeared on the doorstep. They were munching apples and spitting out the cores, but the two men bowed their heads and patiently braved their impudent looks and rough speeches, though they were hustled and, as it were, soiled by these trollops, who amused themselves by pushing each other down upon them. At that very moment Nana descended the three steps.  She grew very pale when she noticed Muffat. &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s you!&quot; she stammered. The sniggering extra ladies were quite frightened when they recognized her, and they formed in line and stood up, looking as stiff and serious as servants whom their mistress has caught behaving badly.  The tall fair gentleman had moved away; he was at once reassured and sad at heart. &quot;Well, give me your arm,&quot; Nana continued impatiently. They walked quietly off.  The count had been getting ready to question her and now found nothing to say. It was she who in rapid tones told a story to the effect that she had been at her aunt&#x27;s as late as eight o&#x27;clock, when, seeing Louiset very much better, she had conceived the idea of going down to the theater for a few minutes. &quot;On some important business?&quot; he queried. &#x27;Yes, a new piece,&quot; she replied after some slight hesitation.  &quot;They wanted my advice.&quot; He knew that she was not speaking the truth, but the warm touch of her arm as it leaned firmly on his own, left him powerless.  He felt neither anger nor rancor after his long, long wait; his one thought was to keep her where she was now that he had got hold of her. Tomorrow, and not before, he would try and find out what she had come to her dressing room after.  But Nana still appeared to hesitate; she was manifestly a prey to the sort of secret anguish that besets people when they are trying to regain lost ground and to initiate a plan of action.  Accordingly, as they turned the corner of the Galerie des Varietes, she stopped in front of the show in a fan seller&#x27;s window. &quot;I say, that&#x27;s pretty,&quot; she whispered; &quot;I mean that mother-of-pearl mount with the feathers.&quot; Then, indifferently: &quot;So you&#x27;re seeing me home?&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; he said, with some surprise, &quot;since your child&#x27;s better.&quot; She was sorry she had told him that story.  Perhaps Louiset was passing through another crisis!  She talked of returning to the Batignolles.  But when he offered to accompany her she did not insist on going.  For a second or two she was possessed with the kind of white-hot fury which a woman experiences when she feels herself entrapped and must, nevertheless, behave prettily.  But in the end she grew resigned and determined to gain time.  If only she could get rid of the count toward midnight everything would happen as she wished. &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s true; you&#x27;re a bachelor tonight,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Your wife doesn&#x27;t return till tomorrow, eh?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Muffat.  It embarrassed him somewhat to hear her talking familiarly about the countess. But she pressed him further, asking at what time the train was due and wanting to know whether he were going to the station to meet her.  She had begun to walk more slowly than ever, as though the shops interested her very much. &quot;Now do look!&quot; she said, pausing anew before a jeweler&#x27;s window, &quot;what a funny bracelet!&quot; She adored the Passage des Panoramas.  The tinsel of the ARTICLE DE PARIS, the false jewelry, the gilded zinc, the cardboard made to look like leather, had been the passion of her early youth.  It remained, and when she passed the shop-windows she could not tear herself away from them.  It was the same with her today as when she was a ragged, slouching child who fell into reveries in front of the chocolate maker&#x27;s sweet-stuff shows or stood listening to a musical box in a neighboring shop or fell into supreme ecstasies over cheap, vulgarly designed knickknacks, such as nutshell workboxes, ragpickers&#x27; baskets for holding toothpicks, Vendome columns and Luxor obelisks on which thermometers were mounted.  But that evening she was too much agitated and looked at things without seeing them. When all was said and done, it bored her to think she was not free. An obscure revolt raged within her, and amid it all she felt a wild desire to do something foolish.  It was a great thing gained, forsooth, to be mistress of men of position!  She had been devouring the prince&#x27;s substance and Steiner&#x27;s, too, with her childish caprices, and yet she had no notion where her money went.  Even at this time of day her flat in the Boulevard Haussmann was not entirely furnished.  The drawing room alone was finished, and with its red satin upholsteries and excess of ornamentation and furnirure it struck a decidedly false note.  Her creditors, moreover, would now take to tormenting her more than ever before whenever she had no money on hand, a fact which caused her constant surprise, seeing that she was wont to quote her self as a model of economy.  For a month past that thief Steiner had been scarcely able to pay up his thousand francs on the occasions when she threatened to kick him out of doors in case he failed to bring them.  As to Muffat, he was an idiot: he had no notion as to what it was usual to give, and she could not, therefore, grow angry with him on the score of miserliness.  Oh, how gladly she would have turned all these folks off had she not repeated to herself a score of times daily a whole string of economical maxims! One ought to be sensible, Zoe kept saying every morning, and Nana herself was constantly haunted by the queenly vision seen at Chamont.  It had now become an almost religious memory with her, and through dint of being ceaselessly recalled it grew even more grandiose.  And for these reasons, though trembling with repressed indignation, she now hung submissively on the count&#x27;s arm as they went from window to window among the fast-diminishing crowd.  The pavement was drying outside, and a cool wind blew along the gallery, swept the close hot air up beneath the glass that imprisoned it and shook the colored lanterns and the lines of gas jets and the giant fan which was flaring away like a set piece in an illumination.  At the door of the restaurant a waiter was putting out the gas, while the motionless attendants in the empty, glaring shops looked as though they had dropped off to sleep with their eyes open. &quot;Oh, what a duck!&quot; continued Nana, retracing her steps as far as the last of the shops in order to go into ecstasies over a porcelain greyhound standing with raised forepaw in front of a nest hidden among roses. At length they quitted the passage, but she refused the offer of a cab.  It was very pleasant out she said; besides, they were in no hurry, and it would be charming to return home on foot.  When they were in front of the Cafe Anglais she had a sudden longing to eat oysters.  Indeed, she said that owing to Louiset&#x27;s illness she had tasted nothing since morning.  Muffat dared not oppose her.  Yet as he did not in those days wish to be seen about with her he asked for a private supper room and hurried to it along the corridors.  She followed him with the air of a woman familiar with the house, and they were on the point of entering a private room, the door of which a waiter held open, when from a neighboring saloon, whence issued a perfect tempest of shouts and laughter, a man rapidiy emerged.  It was Daguenet. &quot;By Jove, it&#x27;s Nana!&quot; he cried. The count had briskly disappeared into the private room, leaving the door ajar behind him.  But Daguenet winked behind his round shoulders and added in chaffing tones: &quot;The deuce, but you&#x27;re doing nicely!  You catch &#x27;em in the Tuileries nowadays!&quot; Nana smiled and laid a finger on her lips to beg him to be silent. She could see he was very much exalted, and yet she was glad to have met him, for she still felt tenderly toward him, and that despite the nasty way he had cut her when in the company of fashionable ladies. &quot;What are you doing now?&quot; she asked amicably. &quot;Becoming respectable.  Yes indeed, I&#x27;m thinking of getting married.&quot; She shrugged her shoulders with a pitying air.  But he jokingly continued to the effect that to be only just gaining enough on &#x27;change to buy ladies bouquets could scarcely be called an income, provided you wanted to look respectable too!  His three hundred thousand francs had only lasted him eighteen months!  He wanted to be practical, and he was going to marry a girl with a huge dowry and end off as a PREFET, like his father before him!  Nana still smiled incredulously.  She nodded in the direction of the saloon: &quot;Who are you with in there?&quot; &quot;Oh, a whole gang,&quot; he said, forgetting all about his projects under the influence of returning intoxication.  &quot;Just think!  Lea is telling us about her trip in Egypt.  Oh, it&#x27;s screaming!  There&#x27;s a bathing story--&quot; And he told the story while Nana lingered complaisantly.  They had ended by leaning up against the wall in the corridor, facing one another.  Gas jets were flaring under the low ceiling, and a vague smell of cookery hung about the folds of the hangings.  Now and again, in order to hear each other&#x27;s voices when the din in the saloon became louder than ever, they had to lean well forward. Every few seconds, however, a waiter with an armful of dishes found his passage barred and disturbed them.  But they did not cease their talk for that; on the contrary, they stood close up to the walls and, amid the uproar of the supper party and the jostlings of the waiters, chatted as quietly as if they were by their own firesides. &quot;Just look at that,&quot; whispered the young man, pointing to the door of the private room through which Muffat had vanished. Both looked.  The door was quivering slightly; a breath of air seemed to be disturbing it, and at last, very, very slowly and without the least sound, it was shut to.  They exchanged a silent chuckle.  The count must be looking charmingly happy all alone in there! &quot;By the by,&quot; she asked, &quot;have you read Fauchery&#x27;s article about me?&quot; &quot;Yes, &#x27;The Golden Fly,&#x27;&quot; replied Daguenet; &quot;I didn&#x27;t mention it to you as I was afraid of paining you.&quot; &quot;Paining me--why?  His article&#x27;s a very long one.&quot; She was flattered to think that the Figaro should concern itself about her person.  But failing the explanations of her hairdresser Francis, who had brought her the paper, she would not have understood that it was she who was in question.  Daguenet scrutinized her slyly, sneering in his chaffing way.  Well, well, since she was pleased, everybody else ought to be. &quot;By your leave!&quot; shouted a waiter, holding a dish of iced cheese in both hands as he separated them. Nana had stepped toward the little saloon where Muffat was waiting. &quot;Well, good-by!&quot; continued Daguenet.  &quot;Go and find your cuckold again.&quot; But she halted afresh. &quot;Why d&#x27;you call him cuckold?&quot; &quot;Because he is a cuckold, by Jove!&quot; She came and leaned against the wall again; she was profoundly interested. &quot;Ah!&quot; she said simply. &quot;What, d&#x27;you mean to say you didn&#x27;t know that?  Why, my dear girl, his wife&#x27;s Fauchery&#x27;s mistress.  It probably began in the country. Some time ago, when I was coming here, Fauchery left me, and I suspect he&#x27;s got an assignation with her at his place tonight. They&#x27;ve made up a story about a journey, I fancy.&quot; Overcome with surprise, Nana remained voiceless. &quot;I suspected it,&quot; she said at last, slapping her leg.  &quot;I guessed it by merely looking at her on the highroad that day.  To think of its being possible for an honest woman to deceive her husband, and with that blackguard Fauchery too!  He&#x27;ll teach her some pretty things!&quot; &quot;Oh, it isn&#x27;t her trial trip,&quot; muttered Daguenet wickedly.  &quot;Perhaps she knows as much about it as he does.&quot; At this Nana gave vent to an indignant exclamation. &quot;Indeed she does!  What a nice world!  It&#x27;s too foul!&quot; &quot;By your leave!&quot; shouted a waiter, laden with bottles, as he separated them. Daguenet drew her forward again and held her hand for a second or two.  He adopted his crystalline tone of voice, the voice with notes as sweet as those of a harmonica, which had gained him his success among the ladies of Nana&#x27;s type. &quot;Good-by, darling!  You know I love you always.&quot; She disengaged her hand from his, and while a thunder of shouts and bravos, which made the door in the saloon tremble again, almost drowned her words she smilingly remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s over between us, stupid!  But that doesn&#x27;t matter.  Do come up one of these days, and we&#x27;ll have a chat.&quot; Then she became serious again and in the outraged tones of a respectable woman: &quot;So he&#x27;s a cuckold, is he?&quot; she cried.  &quot;Well, that IS a nuisance, dear boy.  They&#x27;ve always sickened me, cuckolds have.&quot; When at length she went into the private room she noticed that Muffat was sitting resignedly on a narrow divan with pale face and twitching hands.  He did not reproach her at all, and she, greatly moved, was divided between feelings of pity and of contempt.  The poor man!  To think of his being so unworthily cheated by a vile wife!  She had a good mind to throw her arms round his neck and comfort him.  But it was only fair all the same!  He was a fool with women, and this would teach him a lesson!  Nevertheless, pity overcame her.  She did not get rid of him as she had determined to do after the oysters had been discussed.  They scarcely stayed a quarter of an hour in the Cafe Anglais, and together they went into the house in the Boulevard Haussmann.  It was then eleven.  Before midnight she would have easily have discovered some means of getting rid of him kindly. In the anteroom, however, she took the precaution of giving Zoe an order.  &quot;You&#x27;ll look out for him, and you&#x27;ll tell him not to make a noise if the other man&#x27;s still with me.&quot; &quot;But where shall I put him, madame?&quot; &quot;Keep him in the kitchen.  It&#x27;s more safe.&quot; In the room inside Muffat was already taking off his overcoat.  A big fire was burning on the hearth.  It was the same room as of old, with its rosewood furniture and its hangings and chair coverings of figured damask with the large blue flowers on a gray background.  On two occasions Nana had thought of having it redone, the first in black velvet, the second in white satin with bows, but directly Steiner consented she demanded the money that these changes would cost simply with a view to pillaging him.  She had, indeed, only indulged in a tiger skin rug for the hearth and a cut-glass hanging lamp. &quot;I&#x27;m not sleepy; I&#x27;m not going to bed,&quot; she said the moment they were shut in together. The count obeyed her submissively, as became a man no longer afraid of being seen.  His one care now was to avoid vexing her. &quot;As you will,&quot; he murmured. Nevertheless, he took his boots off, too, before seating himself in front of the fire.  One of Nana&#x27;s pleasures consisted in undressing herself in front of the mirror on her wardrobe door, which reflected her whole height.  She would let everything slip off her in turn and then would stand perfectly naked and gaze and gaze in complete oblivion of all around her.  Passion for her own body, ecstasy over her satin skin and the supple contours of her shape, would keep her serious, attentive and absorbed in the love of herself.  The hairdresser frequently found her standing thus and would enter without her once turning to look at him.  Muffat used to grow angry then, but he only succeeded in astonishing her.  What was coming over the man?  She was doing it to please herself, not other people. That particular evening she wanted to have a better view of herself, and she lit the six candles attached to the frame of the mirror. But while letting her shift slip down she paused.  She had been preoccupied for some moments past, and a question was on her lips. &quot;You haven&#x27;t read the Figaro article, have you?  The paper&#x27;s on the table.&quot;  Daguenet&#x27;s laugh had recurred to her recollections, and she was harassed by a doubt.  If that Fauchery had slandered her she would be revenged. &quot;They say that it&#x27;s about me,&quot; she continued, affecting indifference.  &quot;What&#x27;s your notion, eh, darling?&quot; And letting go her shift and waiting till Muffat should have done reading, she stood naked.  Muffat was reading slowly Fauchery&#x27;s article entitled &quot;The Golden Fly,&quot; describing the life of a harlot descended from four or five generations of drunkards and tainted in her blood by a cumulative inheritance of misery and drink, which in her case has taken the form of a nervous exaggeration of the sexual instinct.  She has shot up to womanhood in the slums and on the pavements of Paris, and tall, handsome and as superbly grown as a dunghill plant, she avenges the beggars and outcasts of whom she is the ultimate product.  With her the rottenness that is allowed to ferment among the populace is carried upward and rots the aristocracy.  She becomes a blind power of nature, a leaven of destruction, and unwittingly she corrupts and disorganizes all Paris, churning it between her snow-white thighs as milk is monthly churned by housewives.  And it was at the end of this article that the comparison with a fly occurred, a fly of sunny hue which has flown up out of the dung, a fly which sucks in death on the carrion tolerated by the roadside and then buzzing, dancing and glittering like a precious stone enters the windows of palaces and poisons the men within by merely settling on them in her flight. Muffat lifted his head; his eyes stared fixedly; he gazed at the fire. &quot;Well?&quot; asked Nana. But he did not answer.  It seemed as though he wanted to read the article again.  A cold, shivering feeling was creeping from his scalp to his shoulders.  This article had been written anyhow.  The phrases were wildly extravagant; the unexpected epigrams and quaint collocations of words went beyond all bounds.  Yet notwithstanding this, he was struck by what he had read, for it had rudely awakened within him much that for months past he had not cared to think about. He looked up.  Nana had grown absorbed in her ecstatic self- contemplation.  She was bending her neck and was looking attentively in the mirror at a little brown mark above her right haunch.  She was touching it with the tip of her finger and by dint of bending backward was making it stand out more clearly than ever.  Situated where it was, it doubtless struck her as both quaint and pretty. After that she studied other parts of her body with an amused expression and much of the vicious curiosity of a child.  The sight of herself always astonished her, and she would look as surprised and ecstatic as a young girl who has discovered her puberty. Slowly, slowly, she spread out her arms in order to give full value to her figure, which suggested the torso of a plump Venus.  She bent herself this way and that and examined herself before and behind, stooping to look at the side view of her bosom and at the sweeping contours of her thighs.  And she ended with a strange amusement which consisted of swinging to right and left, her knees apart and her body swaying from the waist with the perpetual jogging, twitching movements peculiar to an oriental dancer in the danse du ventre. Muffat sat looking at her.  She frightened him.  The newspaper had dropped from his hand.  For a moment he saw her as she was, and he despised himself.  Yes, it was just that; she had corrupted his life; he already felt himself tainted to his very marrow by impurities hitherto undreamed of.  Everything was now destined to rot within him, and in the twinkling of an eye he understood what this evil entailed.  He saw the ruin brought about by this kind of &quot;leaven&quot;--himself poisoned, his family destroyed, a bit of the social fabric cracking and crumbling.  And unable to take his eyes from the sight, he sat looking fixedly at her, striving to inspire himself with loathing for her nakedness. Nana no longer moved.  With an arm behind her neck, one hand clasped in the other, and her elbows far apart, she was throwing back her head so that he could see a foreshortened reflection of her half- closed eyes, her parted lips, her face clothed with amorous laughter.  Her masses of yellow hair were unknotted behind, and they covered her back with the fell of a lioness. Bending back thus, she displayed her solid Amazonian waist and firm bosom, where strong muscles moved under the satin texture of the skin.  A delicate line, to which the shoulder and the thigh added their slight undulations, ran from one of her elbows to her foot, and Muffat&#x27;s eyes followed this tender profile and marked how the outlines of the fair flesh vanished in golden gleams and how its rounded contours shone like silk in the candlelight.  He thought of his old dread of Woman, of the Beast of the Scriptures, at once lewd and wild.  Nana was all covered with fine hair; a russet made her body velvety, while the Beast was apparent in the almost equine development of her flanks, in the fleshy exuberances and deep hollows of her body, which lent her sex the mystery and suggestiveness lurking in their shadows.  She was, indeed, that Golden Creature, blind as brute force, whose very odor ruined the world.  Muffat gazed and gazed as a man possessed, till at last, when he had shut his eyes in order to escape it, the Brute reappeared in the darkness of the brain, larger, more terrible, more suggestive in its attitude.  Now, he understood, it would remain before his eyes, in his very flesh, forever. But Nana was gathering herself together.  A little thrill of tenderness seemed to have traversed her members.  Her eyes were moist; she tried, as it were, to make herself small, as though she could feel herself better thus.  Then she threw her head and bosom back and, melting, as it were, in one great bodily caress, she rubbed her cheeks coaxingly, first against one shoulder, then against the other.  Her lustful mouth breathed desire over her limbs.  She put out her lips, kissed herself long in the neighborhood of her armpit and laughed at the other Nana who also was kissing herself in the mirror. Then Muffat gave a long sigh.  This solitary pleasure exasperated him.  Suddenly all his resolutions were swept away as though by a mighty wind.  In a fit of brutal passion he caught Nana to his breast and threw her down on the carpet. &quot;Leave me alone!&quot; she cried.  &quot;You&#x27;re hurting me!&quot; He was conscious of his undoing; he recognized in her stupidity, vileness and falsehood, and he longed to possess her, poisoned though she was. &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re a fool!&quot; she said savagely when he let her get up. Nevertheless, she grew calm.  He would go now.  She slipped on a nightgown trimmed with lace and came and sat down on the floor in front of the fire.  It was her favorite position.  When she again questioned him about Fauchery&#x27;s article Muffat replied vaguely, for he wanted to avoid a scene.  Besides, she declared that she had found a weak spot in Fauchery.  And with that she relapsed into a long silence and reflected on how to dismiss the count.  She would have liked to do it in an agreeable way, for she was still a good- natured wench, and it bored her to cause others pain, especially in the present instance where the man was a cuckold.  The mere thought of his being that had ended by rousing her sympathies! &quot;So you expect your wife tomorrow morning?&quot; she said at last. Muffat had stretched himself in an armchair.  He looked drowsy, and his limbs were tired.  He gave a sign of assent.  Nana sat gazing seriously at him with a dull tumult in her brain.  Propped on one leg, among her slightly rumpled laces she was holding one of her bare feet between her hands and was turning it mechanically about and about. &quot;Have you been married long?&quot; she asked. &quot;Nineteen years,&quot; replied the count &quot;Ah!  And is your wife amiable?  Do you get on comfortably together?&quot; He was silent.  Then with some embarrassment: &quot;You know I&#x27;ve begged you never to talk of those matters.&quot; &quot;Dear me, why&#x27;s that?&quot; she cried, beginning to grow vexed directly. &quot;I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t eat your wife if I DO talk about her.  Dear boy, why, every woman&#x27;s worth--&quot; But she stopped for fear of saying too much.  She contented herself by assuming a superior expression, since she considered herself extremely kind.  The poor fellow, he needed delicate handling! Besides, she had been struck by a laughable notion, and she smiled as she looked him carefully over. &quot;I say,&quot; she continued, &quot;I haven&#x27;t told you the story about you that Fauchery&#x27;s circulating.  There&#x27;s a viper, if you like!  I don&#x27;t bear him any ill will, because his article may be all right, but he&#x27;s a regular viper all the same.&quot; And laughing more gaily than ever, she let go her foot and, crawling along the floor, came and propped herself against the count&#x27;s knees. &quot;Now just fancy, he swears you were still like a babe when you married your wife.  You were still like that, eh?  Is it true, eh?&quot; Her eyes pressed for an answer, and she raised her hands to his shoulders and began shaking him in order to extract the desired confession. &quot;Without doubt,&quot; he at last made answer gravely. Thereupon she again sank down at his feet.  She was shaking with uproarious laughter, and she stuttered and dealt him little slaps. &quot;No, it&#x27;s too funny!  There&#x27;s no one like you; you&#x27;re a marvel. But, my poor pet, you must just have been stupid!  When a man doesn&#x27;t know--oh, it is so comical!  Good heavens, I should have liked to have seen you!  And it came off well, did it?  Now tell me something about it!  Oh, do, do tell me!&quot; She overwhelmed him with questions, forgetting nothing and requiring the veriest details.  And she laughed such sudden merry peals which doubled her up with mirth, and her chemise slipped and got turned down to such an extent, and her skin looked so golden in the light of the big fire, that little by little the count described to her his bridal night.  He no longer felt at all awkward.  He himself began to be amused at last as he spoke.  Only he kept choosing his phrases, for he still had a certain sense of modesty.  The young woman, now thoroughly interested, asked him about the countess. According to his account, she had a marvelous figure but was a regular iceberg for all that. &quot;Oh, get along with you!&quot; he muttered indolently.  &quot;You have no cause to be jealous.&quot; Nana had ceased laughing, and she now resumed her former position and, with her back to the fire, brought her knees up under her chin with her clasped hands.  Then in a serious tone she declared: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t pay, dear boy, to look like a ninny with one&#x27;s wife the first night.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; queried the astonished count. &quot;Because,&quot; she replied slowly, assuming a doctorial expression. And with that she looked as if she were delivering a lecture and shook her head at him.  In the end, however, she condescended to explain herself more lucidly. &quot;Well, look here!  I know how it all happens.  Yes, dearie, women don&#x27;t like a man to be foolish.  They don&#x27;t say anything because there&#x27;s such a thing as modesty, you know, but you may be sure they think about it for a jolly long time to come.  And sooner or later, when a man&#x27;s been an ignoramus, they go and make other arrangements. That&#x27;s it, my pet.&quot; He did not seem to understand.  Whereupon she grew more definite still.  She became maternal and taught him his lesson out of sheer goodness of heart, as a friend might do.  Since she had discovered him to be a cuckold the information had weighed on her spirits; she was madly anxious to discuss his position with him. &quot;Good heavens!  I&#x27;m talking of things that don&#x27;t concern me.  I&#x27;ve said what I have because everybody ought to be happy.  We&#x27;re having a chat, eh?  Well then, you&#x27;re to answer me as straight as you can.&quot; But she stopped to change her position, for she was burning herself. &quot;It&#x27;s jolly hot, eh?  My back&#x27;s roasted.  Wait a second.  I&#x27;ll cook my tummy a bit.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s good for the aches!&quot; And when she had turned round with her breast to the fire and her feet tucked under her: &quot;Let me see,&quot; she said; &quot;you don&#x27;t sleep with your wife any longer?&quot; &quot;No, I swear to you I don&#x27;t,&quot; said Muffat, dreading a scene. &quot;And you believe she&#x27;s really a stick?&quot; He bowed his head in the affirmative. &quot;And that&#x27;s why you love me?  Answer me!  I shan&#x27;t be angry.&quot; He repeated the same movement. &quot;Very well then,&quot; she concluded.  &quot;I suspected as much!  Oh, the poor pet.  Do you know my aunt Lerat?  When she comes get her to tell you the story about the fruiterer who lives opposite her.  Just fancy that man--Damn it, how hot this fire is!  I must turn round. I&#x27;m going to roast my left side now.&quot;  And as she presented her side to the blaze a droll idea struck her, and like a good-tempered thing, she made fun of herself for she was dellghted to see that she was looking so plump and pink in the light of the coal fire. &quot;I look like a goose, eh?  Yes, that&#x27;s it!  I&#x27;m a goose on the spit, and I&#x27;m turning, turning and cooking in my own juice, eh?&quot; And she was once more indulging in a merry fit of laughter when a sound of voices and slamming doors became audible.  Muffat was surprised, and he questioned her with a look.  She grew serious, and an anxious expression came over her face.  It must be Zoe&#x27;s cat, a cursed beast that broke everything.  It was half-past twelve o&#x27;clock.  How long was she going to bother herself in her cuckold&#x27;s behalf?  Now that the other man had come she ought to get him out of the way, and that quickly. &quot;What were you saying?&quot; asked the count complaisantly, for he was charmed to see her so kind to him. But in her desire to be rid of him she suddenly changed her mood, became brutal and did not take care what she was saying. &quot;Oh yes!  The fruiterer and his wife.  Well, my dear fellow, they never once touched one another!  Not the least bit!  She was very keen on it, you understand, but he, the ninny, didn&#x27;t know it.  He was so green that he thought her a stick, and so he went elsewhere and took up with streetwalkers, who treated him to all sorts of nastiness, while she, on her part, made up for it beautifully with fellows who were a lot slyer than her greenhorn of a husband.  And things always turn out that way through people not understanding one another.  I know it, I do!&quot; Muffat was growing pale.  At last he was beginning to understand her allusions, and he wanted to make her keep silence.  But she was in full swing. &quot;No, hold your tongue, will you?  If you weren&#x27;t brutes you would be as nice with your wives as you are with us, and if your wives weren&#x27;t geese they would take as much pains to keep you as we do to get you.  That&#x27;s the way to behave.  Yes, my duck, you can put that in your pipe and smoke it.&quot; &quot;Do not talk of honest women,&quot; he said in a hard voice.  &quot;You do not know them.&quot; At that Nana rose to her knees. &quot;I don&#x27;t know them!  Why, they aren&#x27;t even clean, your honest women aren&#x27;t!  They aren&#x27;t even clean!  I defy you to find me one who would dare show herself as I am doing.  Oh, you make me laugh with your honest women.  Don&#x27;t drive me to it; don&#x27;t oblige me to tell you things I may regret afterward.&quot; The count, by way of answer, mumbled something insulting.  Nana became quite pale in her turn.  For some seconds she looked at him without speaking.  Then in her decisive way: &quot;What would you do if your wife were deceiving you?&quot; He made a threatening gesture. &quot;Well, and if I were to?&quot; &quot;Oh, you,&quot; he muttered with a shrug of his shoulders. Nana was certainly not spiteful.  Since the beginning of the conversation she had been strongly tempted to throw his cuckold&#x27;s reputation in his teeth, but she had resisted.  She would have liked to confess him quietly on the subject, but he had begun to exasperate her at last.  The matter ought to stop now. &quot;Well, then, my dearie,&quot; she continued, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting at with me.  For two hours past you&#x27;ve been worrying my life out.  Now do just go and find your wife, for she&#x27;s at it with Fauchery.  Yes, it&#x27;s quite correct; they&#x27;re in the Rue Taitbout, at the corner of the Rue de Provence.  You see, I&#x27;m giving you the address.&quot; Then triumphantly, as she saw Muffat stagger to his feet like an ox under the hammer: &quot;If honest women must meddle in our affairs and take our sweethearts from us--Oh, you bet they&#x27;re a nice lot, those honest women!&quot; But she was unable to proceed.  With a terrible push he had cast her full length on the floor and, lifting his heel, he seemed on the point of crushing in her head in order to silence her.  For the twinkling of an eye she felt sickening dread.  Blinded with rage, he had begun beating about the room like a maniac.  Then his choking silence and the struggle with which he was shaken melted her to tears.  She felt a mortal regret and, rolling herself up in front of the fire so as to roast her right side, she undertook the task of comforting him. &quot;I take my oath, darling, I thought you knew it all.  Otherwise I shouldn&#x27;t have spoken; you may be sure.  But perhaps it isn&#x27;t true. I don&#x27;t say anything for certain.  I&#x27;ve been told it, and people are talking about it, but what does that prove?  Oh, get along!  You&#x27;re very silly to grow riled about it.  If I were a man I shouldn&#x27;t care a rush for the women!  All the women are alike, you see, high or low; they&#x27;re all rowdy and the rest of it.&quot; In a fit of self-abnegation she was severe on womankind, for she wished thus to lessen the cruelty of her blow.  But he did not listen to her or hear what she said.  With fumbling movements he had put on his boots and his overcoat.  For a moment longer he raved round, and then in a final outburst, finding himself near the door, he rushed from the room.  Nana was very much annoyed. &quot;Well, well!  A prosperous trip to you!&quot; she continued aloud, though she was now alone.  &quot;He&#x27;s polite, too, that fellow is, when he&#x27;s spoken to!  And I had to defend myself at that!  Well, I was the first to get back my temper and I made plenty of excuses, I&#x27;m thinking!  Besides, he had been getting on my nerves!&quot; Nevertheless, she was not happy and sat scratching her legs with both hands.  Then she took high ground: &quot;Tut, tut, it isn&#x27;t my fault if he is a cuckold!&quot; And toasted on every side and as hot as a roast bird, she went and buried herself under the bedclothes after ringing for Zoe to usher in the other man, who was waiting in the kitchen. Once outside, Muffat began walking at a furious pace.  A fresh shower had just fallen, and he kept slipping on the greasy pavement. When he looked mechanically up into the sky he saw ragged, soot- colored clouds scudding in front of the moon.  At this hour of the night passers-by were becoming few and far between in the Boulevard Haussmann.  He skirted the enclosures round the opera house in his search for darkness, and as he went along he kept mumbling inconsequent phrases.  That girl had been lying.  She had invented her story out of sheer stupidity and cruelty.  He ought to have crushed her head when he had it under his heel.  After all was said and done, the business was too shameful.  Never would he see her; never would he touch her again, or if he did he would be miserably weak.  And with that he breathed hard, as though he were free once more.  Oh, that naked, cruel monster, roasting away like any goose and slavering over everything that he had respected for forty years back.  The moon had come out, and the empty street was bathed in white light.  He felt afraid, and he burst into a great fit of sobbing, for he had grown suddenly hopeless and maddened as though he had sunk into a fathomless void. &quot;My God!&quot; he stuttered out.  &quot;It&#x27;s finished!  There&#x27;s nothing left now!&quot; Along the boulevards belated people were hurrying.  He tried hard to be calm, and as the story told him by that courtesan kept recurring to his burning consciousness, he wanted to reason the matter out. The countess was coming up from Mme de Chezelles&#x27;s country house tomorrow morning.  Yet nothing, in fact, could have prevented her from returning to Paris the night before and passing it with that man.  He now began recalling to mind certain details of their stay at Les Fondettes.  One evening, for instance, he had surprised Sabine in the shade of some trees, when she was so much agitated as to be unable to answer his questions.  The man had been present; why should she not be with him now?  The more he thought about it the more possible the whole story became, and he ended by thinking it natural and even inevitable.  While he was in his shirt sleeves in the house of a harlot his wife was undressing in her lover&#x27;s room. Nothing could be simpler or more logical!  Reasoning in this way, he forced himself to keep cool.  He felt as if there were a great downward movement in the direction of fleshly madness, a movement which, as it grew, was overcoming the whole world round about him. Warm images pursued him in imagination.  A naked Nana suddenly evoked a naked Sabine.  At this vision, which seemed to bring them together in shameless relationship and under the influence of the same lusts, he literally stumbled, and in the road a cab nearly ran over him.  Some women who had come out of a cafe jostled him amid loud laughter.  Then a fit of weeping once more overcame him, despite all his efforts to the contrary, and, not wishing to shed tears in the presence of others, he plunged into a dark and empty street.  It was the Rue Rossini, and along its silent length he wept like a child. &quot;It&#x27;s over with us,&quot; he said in hollow tones.  &quot;There&#x27;s nothing left us now, nothing left us now!&quot; He wept so violently that he had to lean up against a door as he buried his face in his wet hands.  A noise of footsteps drove him away.  He felt a shame and a fear which made him fly before people&#x27;s faces with the restless step of a bird of darkness.  When passers-by met him on the pavement he did his best to look and walk in a leisurely way, for he fancied they were reading his secret in the very swing of his shoulders.  He had followed the Rue de la Grange Bateliere as far as the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre, where the brilliant lamplight surprised him, and he retraced his steps.  For nearly an hour he traversed the district thus, choosing always the darkest corners.  Doubtless there was some goal whither his steps were patiently, instinctively, leading him through a labyrinth of endless turnings.  At length he lifted his eyes up it a street corner.  He had reached his destination, the point where the Rue Taitbout and the Rue de la Provence met.  He had taken an hour amid his painful mental sufferings to arrive at a place he could have reached in five minutes.  One morning a month ago he remembered going up to Fauchery&#x27;s rooms to thank him for a notice of a ball at the Tuileries, in which the journalist had mentioned him.  The flat was between the ground floor and the first story and had a row of small square windows which were half hidden by the colossal signboard belonging to a shop.  The last window on the left was bisected by a brilliant band of lamplight coming from between the half-closed curtains.  And he remained absorbed and expectant, with his gaze fixed on this shining streak. The moon had disappeared in an inky sky, whence an icy drizzle was falling.  Two o&#x27;clock struck at the Trinite.  The Rue de Provence and the Rue Taitbout lay in shadow, bestarred at intervals by bright splashes of light from the gas lamps, which in the distance were merged in yellow mist.  Muffat did not move from where he was standing.  That was the room.  He remembered it now: it had hangings of red &quot;andrinople,&quot; and a Louis XIII bed stood at one end of it. The lamp must be standing on the chimney piece to the right. Without doubt they had gone to bed, for no shadows passed across the window, and the bright streak gleamed as motionless as the light of a night lamp.  With his eyes still uplifted he began forming a plan; he would ring the bell, go upstairs despite the porter&#x27;s remonstrances, break the doors in with a push of his shoulder and fall upon them in the very bed without giving them time to unlace their arms.  For one moment the thought that he had no weapon upon him gave him pause, but directly afterward he decided to throttle them.  He returned to the consideration of his project, and he perfected it while waiting for some sign, some indication, which should bring certainty with it. Had a woman&#x27;s shadow only shown itself at that moment he would have rung.  But the thought that perhaps he was deceiving himself froze him.  How could he be certain?  Doubts began to return.  His wife could not be with that man.  It was monstrous and impossible. Nevertheless, he stayed where he was and was gradually overcome by a species of torpor which merged into sheer feebleness while he waited long, and the fixity of his gaze induced hallucinations. A shower was falling.  Two policemen were approaching, and he was forced to leave the doorway where he had taken shelter.  When these were lost to view in the Rue de Provence he returned to his post, wet and shivering.  The luminous streak still traversed the window, and this time he was going away for good when a shadow crossed it. It moved so quickly that he thought he had deceived himself.  But first one and then another black thing followed quickly after it, and there was a regular commotion in the room.  Riveted anew to the pavement, he experienced an intolerable burning sensation in his inside as he waited to find out the meaning of it all.  Outlines of arms and legs flitted after one another, and an enormous hand traveled about with the silhouette of a water jug.  He distinguished nothing clearly, but he thought he recognized a woman&#x27;s headdress. And he disputed the point with himself; it might well have been Sabine&#x27;s hair, only the neck did not seem sufficiently slim.  At that hour of the night he had lost the power of recognition and of action.  In this terrible agony of uncertainty his inside caused him such acute suffering that he pressed against the door in order to calm himself, shivering like a man in rags, as he did so.  Then seeing that despite everything he could not turn his eyes away from the window, his anger changed into a fit of moralizing.  He fancied himself a deputy; he was haranguing an assembly, loudly denouncing debauchery, prophesying national ruin.  And he reconstructed Fauchery&#x27;s article on the poisoned fly, and he came before the house and declared that morals such as these, which could only be paralleled in the days of the later Roman Empire, rendered society an impossibility; that did him good.  But the shadows had meanwhile disappeared.  Doubtless they had gone to bed again, and, still watching, he continued waiting where he was. Three o&#x27;clock struck, then four, but he could not take his departure.  When showers fell he buried himself in a corner of the doorway, his legs splashed with wet.  Nobody passed by now, and occasionally his eyes would close, as though scorched by the streak of light, which he kept watching obstinately, fixedly, with idiotic persistence.  On two subsequent occasions the shadows flitted about, repeating the same gestures and agitating the silhouette of the same gigantic jug, and twice quiet was re-established, and the night lamp again glowed discreetly out.  These shadows only increased his uncertainty.  Then, too, a sudden idea soothed his brain while it postponed the decisive moment.  After all, he had only to wait for the woman when she left the house.  He could quite easily recognize Sabine.  Nothing could be simpler, and there would be no scandal, and he would be sure of things one way or the other.  It was only necessary to stay where he was.  Among all the confused feelings which had been agitating him he now merely felt a dull need of certain knowledge.  But sheer weariness and vacancy began lulling him to sleep under his doorway, and by way of distraction he tried to reckon up how long he would have to wait.  Sabine was to be at the station toward nine o&#x27;clock; that meant about four hours and a half more.  He was very patient; he would even have been content not to move again, and he found a certain charm in fancying that his night vigil would last through eternity. Suddenly the streak of light was gone.  This extremely simple event was to him an unforeseen catastrophe, at once troublesome and disagreeable.  Evidently they had just put the lamp out and were going to sleep.  lt was reasonable enough at that hour, but he was irritated thereat, for now the darkened window ceased to interest him.  He watched it for a quarter of an hour longer and then grew tired and, leaving the doorway, took a turn upon the pavement. Until five o&#x27;clock he walked to and fro, looking upward from time to time.  The window seemed a dead thing, and now and then he asked himself if he had not dreamed that shadows had been dancing up there behind the panes.  An intolerable sense of fatigue weighed him down, a dull, heavy feeling, under the influence of which he forgot what he was waiting for at that particular street corner.  He kept stumbling on the pavement and starting into wakefulness with the icy shudder of a man who does not know where he is.  Nothing seemed to justify the painful anxiety he was inflicting on himself.  Since those people were asleep--well then, let them sleep!  What good could it do mixing in their affairs?  It was very dark; no one would ever know anything about this night&#x27;s doings.  And with that every sentiment within him, down to curiosity itself, took flight before the longing to have done with it all and to find relief somewhere. The cold was increasing, and the street was becoming insufferable. Twice he walked away and slowly returned, dragging one foot behind the other, only to walk farther away next time.  It was all over; nothing was left him now, and so he went down the whole length of the boulevard and did not return. His was a melancholy progress through the streets.  He walked slowly, never changing his pace and simply keeping along the walls of the houses. His boot heels re-echoed, and he saw nothing but his shadow moving at his side.  As he neared each successive gaslight it grew taller and immediately afterward diminished.  But this lulled him and occupied him mechanically.  He never knew afterward where he had been; it seemed as if he had dragged himself round and round in a circle for hours.  One reminiscence only was very distinctly retained by him.  Without his being able to explain how it came about he found himself with his face pressed close against the gate at the end of the Passage des Panoramas and his two hands grasping the bars.  He did not shake them but, his whole heart swelling with emotion, he simply tried to look into the passage.  But he could make nothing out clearly, for shadows flooded the whole length of the deserted gallery, and the wind, blowing hard down the Rue Saint- Marc, puffed in his face with the damp breath of a cellar.  For a time he tried doggedly to see into the place, and then, awakening from his dream, he was filled with astonishment and asked himself what he could possibly be seeking for at that hour and in that position, for he had pressed against the railings so fiercely that they had left their mark on his face.  Then he went on tramp once more.  He was hopeless, and his heart was full of infinite sorrow, for he felt, amid all those shadows, that he was evermore betrayed and alone. Day broke at last.  It was the murky dawn that follows winter nights and looks so melancholy from muddy Paris pavements.  Muffat had returned into the wide streets, which were then in course of construction on either side of the new opera house.  Soaked by the rain and cut up by cart wheels, the chalky soil had become a lake of liquid mire.  But he never looked to see where he was stepping and walked on and on, slipping and regaining his footing as he went. The awakening of Paris, with its gangs of sweepers and early workmen trooping to their destinations, added to his troubles as day brightened.  People stared at him in surprise as he went by with scared look and soaked hat and muddy clothes.  For a long while he sought refuge against palings and among scaffoldings, his desolate brain haunted by the single remaining thought that he was very miserable. Then he thought of God.  The sudden idea of divine help, of superhuman consolation, surprised him, as though it were something unforeseen and extraordinary.  The image of M. Venot was evoked thereby, and he saw his little plump face and ruined teeth. Assuredly M. Venot, whom for months he had been avoiding and thereby rendering miserable, would be delighted were he to go and knock at his door and fall weeping into his arms.  In the old days God had been always so merciful toward him.  At the least sorrow, the slightest obstacle on the path of life, he had been wont to enter a church, where, kneeling down, he would humble his littleness in the presence of Omnipotence.  And he had been used to go forth thence, fortified by prayer, fully prepared to give up the good things of this world, possessed by the single yearning for eternal salvation. But at present he only practiced by fits and starts, when the terror of hell came upon him.  All kinds of weak inclinations had overcome him, and the thought of Nana disturbed his devotions.  And now the thought of God astonished him.  Why had he not thought of God before, in the hour of that terrible agony when his feeble humanity was breaking up in ruin? Meanwhile with slow and painful steps he sought for a church.  But he had lost his bearings; the early hour had changed the face of the streets.  Soon, however, as he turned the corner of the Rue de la Chaussee-d&#x27;Antin, he noticed a tower looming vaguely in the fog at the end of the Trinite Church.  The white statues overlooking the bare garden seemed like so many chilly Venuses among the yellow foliage of a park.  Under the porch he stood and panted a little, for the ascent of the wide steps had tired him.  Then he went in. The church was very cold, for its heating apparatus had been fireless since the previous evening, and its lofty, vaulted aisles were full of a fine damp vapor which had come filtering through the windows.  The aisles were deep in shadow; not a soul was in the church, and the only sound audible amid the unlovely darkness was that made by the old shoes of some verger or other who was dragging himself about in sulky semiwakefulness.  Muffat, however, after knocking forlornly against an untidy collection of chairs, sank on his knees with bursting heart and propped himself against the rails in front of a little chapel close by a font.  He clasped his hands and began searching within himself for suitable prayers, while his whole being yearned toward a transport.  But only his lips kept stammering empty words; his heart and brain were far away, and with them he returned to the outer world and began his long, unresting march through the streets, as though lashed forward by implacable necessity.  And he kept repeating, &quot;O my God, come to my assistance! O my God, abandon not Thy creature, who delivers himself up to Thy justice!  O my God, I adore Thee: Thou wilt not leave me to perish under the buffetings of mine enemies!&quot;  Nothing answered: the shadows and the cold weighed upon him, and the noise of the old shoes continued in the distance and prevented him praying.  Nothing, indeed, save that tiresome noise was audible in the deserted church, where the matutinal sweeping was unknown before the early masses had somewhat warmed the air of the place.  After that he rose to his feet with the help of a chair, his knees cracking under him as he did so.  God was not yet there.  And why should he weep in M. Venot&#x27;s arms?  The man could do nothing. And then mechanically he returned to Nana&#x27;s house.  Outside he slipped, and he felt the tears welling to his eyes again, but he was not angry with his lot--he was only feeble and ill.  Yes, he was too tired; the rain had wet him too much; he was nipped with cold, but the idea of going back to his great dark house in the Rue Miromesnil froze his heart.  The house door at Nana&#x27;s was not open as yet, and he had to wait till the porter made his appearance.  He smiled as he went upstairs, for he already felt penetrated by the soft warmth of that cozy retreat, where he would be able to stretch his limbs and go to sleep. When Zoe opened the door to him she gave a start of most uneasy astonishment.  Madame had been taken ill with an atrocious sick headache, and she hadn&#x27;t closed her eyes all night.  Still, she could quite go and see whether Madame had gone to sleep for good. And with that she slipped into the bedroom while he sank back into one of the armchairs in the drawing room.  But almost at that very moment Nana appeared.  She had jumped out of bed and had scarce had time to slip on a petticoat.  Her feet were bare, her hair in wild disorder, her nightgown all crumpled. &quot;What!  You here again?&quot; she cried with a red flush on her cheeks. Up she rushed, stung by sudden indignation, in order herself to thrust him out of doors.  But when she saw him in such sorry plight-- nay, so utterly done for--she felt infinite pity. &quot;Well, you are a pretty sight, my dear fellow!&quot; she continued more gently.  &quot;But what&#x27;s the matter?  You&#x27;ve spotted them, eh?  And it&#x27;s given you the hump?&quot; He did not answer; he looked like a broken-down animal. Nevertheless, she came to the conclusion that he still lacked proofs, and to hearten him up the said: &quot;You see now?  I was on the wrong tack.  Your wife&#x27;s an honest woman, on my word of honor!  And now, my little friend, you must go home to bed.  You want it badly.&quot; He did not stir. &quot;Now then, be off!  I can&#x27;t keep you here.  But perhaps you won&#x27;t presume to stay at such a time as this?&quot; &quot;Yes, let&#x27;s go to bed,&quot; he stammered. She repressed a violent gesture, for her patience was deserting her. Was the man going crazy? &quot;Come, be off!&quot; she repeated. &quot;No.&quot; But she flared up in exasperation, in utter rebellion. &quot;It&#x27;s sickening!  Don&#x27;t you understand I&#x27;m jolly tired of your company?  Go and find your wife, who&#x27;s making a cuckold of you. Yes, she&#x27;s making a cuckold of you.  I say so--yes, I do now. There, you&#x27;ve got the sack!  Will you leave me or will you not?&quot; Muffat&#x27;s eyes filled with tears.  He clasped his hands together. &quot;Oh, let&#x27;s go to bed!&quot; At this Nana suddenly lost all control over herself and was choked by nervous sobs.  She was being taken advaatage of when all was said and done!  What had these stories to do with her?  She certainly had used all manner of delicate methods in order to teach him his lesson gently.  And now he was for making her pay the damages!  No, thank you!  She was kindhearted, but not to that extent. &quot;The devil, but I&#x27;ve had enough of this!&quot; she swore, bringing her fist down on the furniture.  &quot;Yes, yes, I wanted to be faithful--it was all I could do to be that!  Yet if I spoke the word I could be rich tomorrow, my dear fellow!&quot; He looked up in surprise.  Never once had he thought of the monetary question.  If she only expressed a desire he would realize it at once; his whole fortune was at her service. &quot;No, it&#x27;s too late now,&quot; she replied furiously.  &quot;I like men who give without being asked.  No, if you were to offer me a million for a single interview I should say no!  It&#x27;s over between us; I&#x27;ve got other fish to fry there!  So be off or I shan&#x27;t answer for the consequences.  I shall do something dreadful!&quot; She advanced threateningly toward him, and while she was raving, as became a good courtesan who, though driven to desperation, was yet firmly convinced of her rights and her superiority over tiresome, honest folks, the door opened suddenly and Steiner presented himself.  That proved the finishing touch.  She shrieked aloud: &quot;Well, I never.  Here&#x27;s the other one!&quot; Bewildered by her piercing outcry, Steiner stopped short.  Muffat&#x27;s unexpected presence annoyed him, for he feared an explanation and had been doing his best to avoid it these three months past.  With blinking eyes he stood first on one leg, then on the other, looking embarrassed the while and avoiding the count&#x27;s gaze.  He was out of breath, and as became a man who had rushed across Paris with good news, only to find himself involved in unforeseen trouble, his face was flushed and distorted. &quot;Que veux-tu, toi?&quot; asked Nana roughly, using the second person singular in open mockery of the count. &quot;What--what do I--&quot; he stammered.  &quot;I&#x27;ve got it for you--you know what.&quot; &quot;Eh?&quot; He hesitated.  The day before yesterday she had given him to understand that if he could not find her a thousand francs to pay a bill with she would not receive him any more.  For two days he had been loafing about the town in quest of the money and had at last made the sum up that very morning. &quot;The thousand francs!&quot; he ended by declaring as he drew an envelope from his pocket. Nana had not remembered. &quot;The thousand francs!&quot; she cried.  &quot;D&#x27;you think I&#x27;m begging alms? Now look here, that&#x27;s what I value your thousand francs at!&quot; And snatching the envelope, she threw it full in his face.  As became a prudent Hebrew, he picked it up slowly and painfully and then looked at the young woman with a dull expression of face. Muffat and he exchanged a despairing glance, while she put her arms akimbo in order to shout more loudly than before. &quot;Come now, will you soon have done insulting me?  I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve come, too, dear boy, because now you see the clearance&#x27;ll be quite complete.  Now then, gee up!  Out you go!&quot; Then as they did not hurry in the least, for they were paralyzed: &quot;D&#x27;you mean to say I&#x27;m acting like a fool, eh?  It&#x27;s likely enough! But you&#x27;ve bored me too much!  And, hang it all, I&#x27;ve had enough of swelldom!  If I die of what I&#x27;m doing--well, it&#x27;s my fancy!&quot; They sought to calm her; they begged her to listen to reason. &quot;Now then, once, twice, thrice!  Won&#x27;t you go?  Very well!  Look there!  I&#x27;ve got company.&quot; And with a brisk movement she flung wide the bedroom door. Whereupon in the middle of the tumbled bed the two men caught sight of Fontan.  He had not expected to be shown off in this situation; nevertheless, he took things very easily, for he was used to sudden surprises on the stage.  Indeed, after the first shock he even hit upon a grimace calculated to tide him honorably over his difficulty; he &quot;turned rabbit,&quot; as he phrased it, and stuck out his lips and wrinkled up his nose, so as completely to transform the lower half of his face.  His base, satyrlike head seemed to exude incontinence. It was this man Fontan then whom Nana had been to fetch at the Varieties every day for a week past, for she was smitten with that fierce sort of passion which the grimacing ugliness of a low comedian is wont to inspire in the genus courtesan. &quot;There!&quot; she said, pointing him out with tragic gesture. Muffat, who hitherto had pocketed everything, rebelled at this affront. &quot;Bitch!&quot; he stammered. But Nana, who was once more in the bedroom, came back in order to have the last word. &quot;How am I a bitch?  What about your wife?&quot; And she was off and, slamming the door with a bang, she noisily pushed to the bolt.  Left alone, the two men gazed at one another in silence.  Zoe had just come into the room, but she did not drive them out.  Nay, she spoke to them in the most sensible manner.  As became a woman with a head on her shoulders, she decided that Madame&#x27;s conduct was rather too much of a good thing.  But she defended her, nonetheless: this union with the play actor couldn&#x27;t last; the madness must be allowed to pass off!  The two men retired without uttering a sound.  On the pavement outside they shook hands silently, as though swayed by a mutual sense of fraternity.  Then they turned their backs on one another and went crawling off in opposite directions. When at last Muffat entered his town house in the Rue Miromesnil his wife was just arriving.  The two met on the great staircase, whose walls exhaled an icy chill.  They lifted up their eyes and beheld one another.  The count still wore his muddy clothes, and his pale, bewildered face betrayed the prodigal returning from his debauch. The countess looked as though she were utterly fagged out by a night in the train.  She was dropping with sleep, but her hair had been brushed anyhow, and her eyes were deeply sunken.</div></div></div><div class="loadMoreContainer_BmfX"><button class="loadMoreButton_n9A7">See
