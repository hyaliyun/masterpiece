Chapter I Introduction The literature of our time, as of all the centuries of Christendom, is full of allusions to the gods and goddesses of the Greeks and Romans.  Occasionally, and, in modern days, more often, it contains allusions to the worship and the superstitions of the northern nations of Europe.  The object of this book is to teach readers who are not yet familiar with the writers of Greece and Rome, or the ballads or legends of the Scandinavians, enough of the stories which form what is called their mythology, to make those allusions intelligible which one meets every day, even in the authors of our own time. The Greeks and Romans both belong to the same race or stock.  It is generally known in our time as the Aryan family of mankind; and so far as we know its history, the Greeks and Romans descended from the tribes which emigrated from the high table- lands of Northern India.  Other tribes emigrated in different directions from the same centre, so that traces of the Aryan language are found in the islands of the Pacific ocean. The people of this race, who moved westward, seem to have had a special fondness for open air nature, and a willingness to personify the powers of nature.  They were glad to live in the open air, and they specially encouraged the virtues which an open-air people prize.  Thus no Roman was thought manly who could not swim, and every Greek exercised in the athletic sports of the palaestra. The Romans and Grecian and German divisions of this great race are those with which we have most to do in history and in literature.  Our own English language is made up of the dialects of different tribes, many of whom agreed in their use of words which they had derived from our Aryan ancestry.  Thus our substantive verb I AM appears in the original Sanscrit of the Aryans as ESMI, and m for ME (MOI), or the first person singular, is found in all the verbal inflections.  The Greek form of the same verb was ESMI, which became ASMI,   and in Latin the first and last vowels have disappeared, the verb is SUM.  Similar relationships are traced in the numerals, and throughout all the languages of these nations. The Romans, like the Etruscans who came before them, were neither poetical nor imaginative in temperament.  Their activity ran in practical directions.  They therefore invented few, if any stories, of the gods whom they worshipped with fixed rites.  Mr. Macaulay speaks of these gods as &quot;the sober abstractions of the Roman pantheon.&quot;  We owe most of the stories of the ancient mythology to the wit and fancy of the Greeks,   more playful and imaginative,   who seized from Egypt and from the East such legends as pleased them,   and adapted them in their own way.  It often happens that such stories, resembling each other in their foundation, are found in the Greek and Roman authors in several different forms. To understand these stories, we will here first acquaint ourselves with the ideas of the structure of the universe, which the poets and others held, and which will form the scenery, so to speak, of the narratives. The Greek poets believed the earth to be flat and circular, their own country occupying the middle of it, the central point being either Mount Olympus, the abode of the gods, or Delphi, so famous for its oracle. The circular disk of the earth was crossed from west to east, and divided into two equal parts by the SEA, as they called the Mediterranean, and its continuation the Euxine. Around the earth flowed the RIVER OCEAN, its course being from south to north on the western side of the earth, and in a contrary direction on the eastern side.  It flowed in a steady, equable current, unvexed by storm or tempest.  The sea, and all the rivers on earth, received their waters from it. The northern portion of the earth was supposed to be inhabited by a happy race named the Hyperboreans [this word means &quot;who live beyond the north&quot; from the word &quot;hyper,&quot; beyond, and boreas, the north wind], dwelling in everlasting bliss and spring beyond the lofty mountains whose caverns were supposed to send forth the piercing blasts of the north wind, which chilled the people of Hellas (Greece).  Their country was inaccessible by land or sea. They lived exempt from disease or old age, from toils and warfare.  Moore has given us the &quot;Song of a Hyperborean,&quot; beginning &quot;I come from a land in the sun-bright deep, Where golden gardens glow, Where the winds of the north, becalmed in sleep, Their conch-shells never blow.&quot; On the south side of the earth, close to the stream of Ocean, dwelt a people happy and virtuous as the Hyperboreans.  They were named the AEthiopians.  The gods favored them so highly that they were wont to leave at times their Olympian abodes, and go to share their sacrifices and banquets. On the western margin of the earth, by the stream of Ocean, lay a happy place named the Elysian Plain, whither mortals favored by the gods were transported without tasting of death, to enjoy an immortality of bliss.  This happy region was also called the &quot;fortunate fields,&quot; and the &quot;Isles of the Blessed.&quot; We thus see that the Greeks of the early ages knew little of any real people except those to the east and south of their own country, or near the coast of the Mediterranean.  Their imagination meantime peopled the western portion of this sea with giants, monsters, and enchantresses; while they placed around the disk of the earth, which they probably regarded as of no great width, nations enjoying the peculiar favor of the gods, and blessed with happiness and longevity. The Dawn, the Sun, and the Moon were supposed to rise out of the Ocean, on the western side, and to drive through the air, giving light to gods and men.  The stars also, except those forming Charles&#x27; Wain or Bear, and others near them, rose out of and sank into the stream of Ocean.  There the sun-god embarked in a winged boat, which conveyed him round by the northern part of the earth, back to his place of rising in the east.  Milton alludes to this in his &quot;Commmus.&quot; &quot;Now the gilded car of day His golden axle doth allay In the steep Atlantic stream, And the slope sun his upward beam Shoots against the dusky pole, Pacing towards the other goal Of his chamber in the east.&quot; The abode of the gods was on the summit of Mount Olympus, in Thessaly.  A gate of clouds, kept by the goddesses named the Seasons, opened to permit the passage of the Celestials to earth, and to receive them on their return.  The gods had their separate dwellings; but all, when summoned, repaired to the palace of Jupiter [Or Zeus.  The relation of these names to each other will be explained on the next page], as did also those deities whose usual abode was the earth, the waters, or the underworld.  It was also in the great hall of the palace of the Olympian king that the gods feasted each day on ambrosia and nectar, their food and drink, the latter being handed round by the lovely goddess Hebe. Here they conversed of the affairs of heaven and earth; and as they quaffed their nectar, Apollo, the god of music, delighted them with the tones of his lyre, to which the muses sang in responsive strains.  When the sun was set, the gods retired to sleep in their respective dwellings. The following lines from the Odyssey will show how Homer conceived of Olympus:-- &quot;So saying, Minerva, goddess azure-eyed, Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat Eternal of the gods, which never storms Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day. There the inhabitants divine rejoice Forever.:&quot; Cowper Such were the abodes of the gods as the Greeks conceived them. The Romans, before they knew the Greek poetry, seem to have had no definite imagination of such an assembly of gods.  But the Roman and Etruscan races were by no means irreligious.  They venerated their departed ancestors,   and in each family the worship of these ancestors was an important duty.  The images of the ancestors were kept in a sacred place,   each family observed, at fixed times, memorial rites in their honor,   and for these and other religious observances the family hearth was consecrated.  The earliest rites of Roman worship are supposed to be connected with such family devotions. As the Greeks and Romans became acquainted with other nations, they imported their habits of worship, even in early times.  It will be remembered that as late as St. Paul&#x27;s time, he found an altar at Athens &quot;to an unknown god.&quot;  Greeks and Romans alike were willing to receive from other nations the legends regarding their gods, and to incorporate them as well as they could with their own.  It is thus that in the poetical mythology of those nations, which we are now to study, we frequently find a Latin and a Greek name for one imagined divinity.  Thus Zeus, of the Greeks, becomes in Latin   with the addition of the word pater (a father) [The reader will observe that father is one of the words derived from an Ayan root.  Let p and t become rough, as the grammarians say,   let p become ph, and t th, and you have phather or father], Jupiter   Kronos of the Greeks appears as &quot;Vulcanus&quot; of the Latins, &quot;Ares&quot; of the Greeks is &quot;Mars&quot; or Mavors of the Latins, &quot;Poseidon&quot; of the Greeks is &quot;Neptunus&quot; of the Latins, &quot;Aphrodite&quot; of the Greeks is &quot;Venus&quot; of the Latins. This variation is not to be confounded with a mere translation, as where &quot;Paulos&quot; of the Greek becomes &quot;Paulus&quot; in Latin, or &quot;Odysseus&quot; becomes &quot;Ulysses,&quot;   or as when &quot;Pierre&quot; of the French becomes &quot;Peter&quot; in English.  What really happened was, that as the Romans, more cultivated than their fathers, found in Greek literature a god of fire and smithery,   they transferred his name &quot;Hephaistos&quot; to their own old god &quot;Vulcanus,&quot;   who had the same duties,   and in their after literature the Latin name was used for the stories of Greek and Latin origin. As the English literature came into being largely on French and Latin models, and as French is but a degraded Latin and retains Latin roots largely,   in our older English poets the Latin forms of these names are generally used.  In our own generation, with the precision now so much courted, a fashion has come in, of designating Mars by his Greek name of &quot;Ares,&quot; Venus by her name of &quot;Aphrodite,&quot; and so on.  But in this book, as our object is to make familiar the stores of general English literature which refer to such subjects, we shall retain, in general, the Latin names,   only calling the attention of the reader to the Greek names, as they appear in Greek authors,   and in many writers of the more recent English schools. The real monarch of the heavens in the mythology of both Greece and Rome is Jupiter (Zeus-pater, father-Jove) [Jove appears to be a word derived from the same root as Zeus, and it appears in the root dev of the Sanscrit, where devas are gods of different forms.  Our English word devil probably comes from the French diable, Italian diavolo, Latin diabolus, one who makes division,- - literally one who separates balls, or throws balls about,-- instead of throwing them frankly and truly at the batsman.  It is not to be traced to the Sanscrit deva.] In the mythological system we are tracing Zeus is himself the father of many of the gods, and he is often spoken of as father of gods and men.  He is the father of Vulcan [In Greek Hephaistos], of Venus [in Greek Aphrodite], of Minerva [in Greek Pallas Athene, or either name separately], of Apollo [of Phoebus], Diana [in Greek Artemis], and of Mercury [in Greek Hermes], who are ranked among the twelve superior gods, and of many inferior deities.  But Jupiter himself is not the original deity in these systems.  He is the son of Saturnus, as in the Greek Zeus is the son of Kronos.  Still the inevitable question would occur where did Saturnus or Kronos come from.  And, in forms and statements more and more vague, the answer was that he was born from Uranus or Ouranos, which is the name of the Heaven over all which seemed to embrace all things.  The Greek name of Saturn was spelled Kronos.  The Greek name of Time was spelled Chronos.  A similarity between the two was imagined.  And the whole statement, when reduced to rationalistic language, would be that from Uranus, the infinite, was born Chronos, Time,-- that from Time, Zeus or Jupiter was born, and that he is the only child of Time who has complete sway over mortals and immortals. &quot;The will of Jove I own, Who mortals and immortals rules alone.&quot; Homer, II.xii Jupiter was son of Saturn (Kronos) [The names included in parentheses are the Greek, the others being the Roman or Latin names] and Ops (Rhea in Greek, sometimes confounded with the Phrygian Cybele). Saturn and Rhea were of the race of Titans, who were the children of Earth and Heaven, which sprang from Chaos, of which we shall give a further account in our next chapter. In allusion to the dethronement of Ouranos by Kronos, and of Kronos or Saturnus by Zeus or Jupiter, Prometheus says in AEschylus&#x27;s tragedy,-- &quot;You may deem Its towers impregnable; but have I not already seen two monarchs hurled from them.&quot; Thee is another cosmogony, or account of the creation, according to which Earth, Erebus, and Love were the first of beings.  Love (Eros)_ issued from the egg of Night, which floated on Chaos.  By his arrows and torch he pierced and vivified all things, producing life and joy. Saturn and Rhea were not the only Titans.  There were others, whose names were Oceanus, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Ophion, males; and Themis, Mnemosyne, Eurynome, females.  They are spoken of as the elder gods, whose dominion was afterwards transferred to others.  Saturn yielded to Jupiter, Oceanus to Neptune, Hyperion to Apollo.  Hyperion was the father of the Sun, Moon, and Dawn. He is therefore the original sun-god, and is painted with the splendor and beauty which were afterwards bestowed on Apollo. &quot;Hyperion&#x27;s curls, the front of Jove himself.&quot;   Shakespeare Ophion and Eurynome ruled over Olympus till they were dethroned by Saturn and Rhea.  Milton alludes to them in Paradise Lost.  He says the heathen seem to have had some knowledge of the temptation and fall of man,-- &quot;And fabled how the serpent, whom they called Ophion, with Eurynome (the wide- Encroaching Eve perhaps), had first the rule Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven.&quot; The representations given of Saturn are not very consistent, for on the one hand his reign is said to have been the golden age of innocence and purity, and on the other he is described as a monster who devoured his own children [This inconsistency arises from considering the Saturn of the Romans the same with the Grecian deity Chronos (Time), which, as it brings an end to all things which have had a beginning, may be said to devour its own offspring.] Jupiter, however, escaped this fate, and when grown up espoused Metis (Prudence), who administered a draught to Saturn which caused him to disgorge his children.  Jupiter, with his brothers and sisters, now rebelled against their father Saturn, and his brothers the Titans; vanquished them, and imprisoned some of them in Tartarus, inflicting other penalties on others.  Atlas was condemned to bear up the heavens on his shoulders. On the dethronement of Saturn, Jupiter with his brothers Neptune (Poseidon) and Pluto (Dis) divided his dominions.  Jupiter&#x27;s portion was the heavens, Neptune&#x27;s the ocean, and Pluto&#x27;s the realms of the dead.  Earth and Olympus were common property. Jupiter was king of gods and men.  The thunder was his weapon, and he bore a shield called AEgis, made for him by Vulcan.  The eagle was his favorite bird, and bore his thunderbolts. Juno (Hera)[pronounce He-re, in two syllables] was the wife of Jupiter, and queen of the gods.  Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, was her attendant and messenger.  The peacock was her favorite bird. Vulcan (Hephaistos), the celestial artist, was the son of Jupiter and Juno.  He was born lame, and his mother was so displeased at the sight of him that she flung him out of heaven.  Other accounts say that Jupiter kicked him out for taking part with his mother, in a quarrel which occurred between them.  Vulcan&#x27;s lameness, according to this account, was the consequence of his fall.  He was a whole day falling, and at last alighted in the island of Lemnos, which was thenceforth sacred to him.  Milton alludes to this story in Paradise lost, Book I. &quot;From morn To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, A summer&#x27;s day; and with the setting sun Dropped from the zenith, like a falling star, On Lemnos, the AEgean isle.&quot; Mars (Ares), the god of war, was the son of Jupiter and Juno. Phoebus Apollo [this is a Greek name of a Greek divinity, who seems to have had no Roman resemblance], the god of archery, prophecy, and music, was the son of Jupiter and Latona, and brother of Diana (Artemis).  He was god of the sun, as Diana, his sister, was the goddess of the moon. Venus (Aphrodite), the goddess of love and beauty, was the daughter of Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from the foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her for his wife. Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the most ill-favored of the gods. Venus possessed an embroidered girdle called the Cestus, which had the power of inspiring love.  Her favorite birds were swans and doves, and the plants sacred to her were the rose and the myrtle. Cupid (Eros), the god of love, was the son of Venus.  He was her constant companion; and, armed with bow and arrows, he shot the darts of desire into the bosoms of both gods and men.  There was a deity named Anteros, who was sometimes represented as the avenger of slighted love, and sometimes as the symbol of reciprocal affection.  The following legend is told of him:-- Venus, complaining to Themis that her son Eros continued always a child, was told by her that it was because he was solitary, and that if he had a brother he would grow apace.  Anteros was soon afterwards born, and Eros immediately was seen to increase rapidly in size and strength. Minerva (Pallas Athene), the goddess of wisdom, was the offspring of Jupiter, without a mother.  She sprang from his head, completely armed.  Her favorite bird was the owl, and the plant sacred to her the olive. Byron, in &quot;Childe Harold,&quot; alludes to the birth of Minerva thus:- - &quot;Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be, And freedom find no champion and no child, Such as Columbia saw arise, when she Sprang forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled? Or must such minds be nourished in the wild, Deep in the unpruned forest, &#x27;midst the roar Of Cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled On infant Washington?  Has earth no more Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?&quot; Mercury (Hermes), was the son of Jupiter and Maia.  He presided over commerce, wrestling and other gymnastic exercises; even over thieving, and everything, in short, which required skill and dexterity.  He was the messenger of Jupiter, and wore a winged cap and winged shoes.  He bore in his hand a rod entwined with two serpents, called the Caduceus. Mercury is said to have invented the lyre.  Four hours after his birth he found the shell of a tortoise, made holes in the opposite edges of it, and drew cords of linen through them, and the instrument was complete [From this origin of the instrument, the word &quot;shell&quot; is often used as synonymous with :&quot;lyre,&quot; and figuratively for music and poetry.  Thus Gray, in his ode on the &quot;Progress of Poesy,&quot; says,-- &quot;O Sovereign of the willing soul, Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, Enchanting shell! The sullen Cares And Frantic Passions hear thy soft control.&quot;] The cords were nine, in honor of the nine Muses.  Mercury gave the lyre to Apollo, and received from him in exchange the caduceus. Ceres (Demeter) was the daughter of Saturn and Rhea.  She had a daughter named Proserpine (Persephone), who became the wife of Pluto, and queen of the realms of the dead.  Ceres presided over agriculture. Bacchus (Dionysus)_, the god of wine, was the son of Jupiter and Semele.  He represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but its social and beneficent influences likewise; so that he is viewed as the promoter of civilization, and a lawgiver and lover of peace. The muses were the daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne (Memory). They presided over song, and prompted the memory.  They were nine in number, to each of whom was assigned the presidency over some particular department of literature, art, or science.  Calliope was the muse of epic poetry, Clio of history, Euterpe of lyric poetry, Melpomene of tragedy, Terpischore of choral dance and song, Erato of love-poetry, Polyhymnia of sacred poetry, Urania of astronomy, Thalia [Pronounced Tha-lei-a, with the emphasis on the second syllable] of comedy. Spenser described the office of the Graces thus:-- &quot;These three on men all gracious gifts bestow Which deck the body or adorn the mind, To make them lovely or well-favored show; As comely carriage, entertainment kind, Sweet semblance, friendly offices that bind, And all the compliments of courtesy; They teach us how to each degree and kind We should ourselves demean, to low, to high. To friends, to foes; which skill men call Civility.&quot; The Fates were also three   Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.  Their office was to spin the thread of human destiny, and they were armed with shears, with which they cut it off when they pleased. They were the daughters of Themis (Law), who sits by Jove on his throne to give him counsel. The Erinnyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished crimes by their secret stings.  The heads of the Furies were wreathed with serpents, and their whole appearance was terrific and appalling.  Their names were Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera. They were also called Eumenides. Nemesis was also an avenging goddess.  She represents the righteous anger of the gods, particularly towards the proud and insolent. Pan [the name Pan means everything, and he is sometimes spoken of as the god of all nature] was the god of flocks and shepherds. His favorite residence, as the Greeks describe him, was in Arcadia. The Satyrs were deities of the woods and fields.  They were conceived to be covered with bristly hair, their heads decorated with short, sprouting horns, and their feet like goats&#x27; feet. Momus was the god of laughter, and Plutus the god of wealth. ROMAN DIVINITIES The preceding are Grecian divinities, though received also by the Romans.  Those which follow are peculiar to Roman mythology. Saturn was an ancient Italian deity.  The Roman poets tried to identify him with the Grecian god Kronos, and fabled that after his dethronement by Jupiter, he fled to Italy, where he reigned during what was called the Golden Age.  In memory of his beneficent dominion, the feast of Saturnalia was held every year in the winter season.  Then all public business was suspended, declarations of war and criminal executions were postponed, friends made presents to one another, and the slaves were indulged with great liberties.  A feast was given them at which they sat at table, while their masters served them, to show the natural equality of men, and that all things belonged equally to all, in the reign of Saturn. Faunus [there was also a goddess called Fauna, or Bona Dea], the grandson of Saturn, was worshipped as the god of fields and shepherds, and also as a prophetic god.  His name in the plural, Fauns, expressed a class of gamesome deities, like the Satyrs of the Greeks. Quirinus was a war god, said to be no other than Romulus the founder of Rome, exalted after his death to a place among the gods. Bellona, a war goddess. Terminus, the god of landmarks.  His statue was a rude stone or post, set in the ground to mark the boundaries of fields. Pales, the goddess presiding over cattle and pastures. Pomona presided over fruit trees. Flora, the goddess of flowers. Lucina, the goddess of childbirth. Vesta (the Hestia of the Greeks) was a deity presiding over the public and private hearth.  A sacred fire, tended by six virgin priestesses called Vestals, flamed in her temple.  As the safety of the city was held to be connected with its conservation, the neglect of the virgins, if they let it go out, was severely punished, and the fire was rekindled from the rays of the sun. Liber is another Latin name of Bacchus; and Mulciber of Vulcan. Janus was the porter of heaven.  He opens the year, the first month being named after him.  He is the guardian deity of gates, on which account he is commonly represented with two heads, because every door looks two ways.  His temples at Rome were numerous.  In war time the gates of the principal one were always open.  In peace they were closed; but they were shut only once between the reign of Numa and that of Augustus. The Penates were the gods who were supposed to attend to the welfare and prosperity of the family.  Their name is derived from Penus, the pantry, which was sacred to them.  Every master of a family was the priest to the Penates of his own house. The Lares, or Lars, were also household gods, but differed from the Penates in being regarded as the deified spirits of mortals. The family Lars were held to be the souls of the ancestors, who watched over and protected their descendants.  The words Lemur and Larva more nearly correspond to our word Ghost. The Romans believed that every man had his Genius, and every woman her Juno; that is, a spirit who had given them being, and was regarded as a protector through life.  On birthdays men made offerings to their Genius, women to their Juno. Macaulay thus alludes to some of the Roman gods:-- &quot;Pomona loves the orchard, And Liber loves the vine, And Pales loves the straw-built shed Warm with the breath of kine; And Venus loves the whisper Of plighted youth and maid In April&#x27;s ivory moonlight, Beneath the Chestnut shade.&quot; &quot;Prophecy of Capys.&quot; N.B.  It is to be observed that in proper names the final e and es are to be sounded.  Thus Cybele and Penates are words of three syllables.   But Proserpine and Thebes have been so long used as English words, that they may be regarded as exceptions, to be pronounced as if English.  Hecate is sometimes pronounced by the poets as a dissylable.  In the Index at the close of the volume, we shall mark the accented syllable, in all words which appear to require it. CHAPTER II Prometheus and Pandora The Roman poet Ovid gives us a connected narrative of creation. Before the earth and sea and the all-covering heaven, one aspect, which we call Chaos, covered all the face of Nature,-- a rough heap of inert weight and discordant beginnings of things clashing together.  As yet no sun gave light to the world, nor did the moon renew her slender horn month by month,-- neither did the earth hang in the surrounding air, poised by its own weight,-- nor did the sea stretch its long arms around the earth.  Wherever there was earth, there was also sea and air.  So the earth was not solid nor was the water fluid, neither was the air transparent. God and Nature at last interposed and put an end to this discord, separating earth from sea, and heaven from both.  The fiery part, being the lightest, sprang up, and formed the skies; the air was next in weight and place.  The earth, being heavier, sank below, and the water took the lowest place and buoyed up the earth. Here some god, no man knows who, arranged and divided the land. He placed the rivers and bays, raised mountains and dug out valleys and distributed woods, fountains, fertile fields and stony plains.  Now that the air was clear the stars shone out, the fishes swam the sea and birds flew in the air, while the four-footed beasts roamed around the earth.  But a nobler animal was needed, and man was made in the image of the gods with an upright stature [The two Greek words for man have the root an, &quot;up], so that while all other animals turn their faces downward and look to the earth, he raises his face to heaven and gazes on the stars [Every reader will be interested in comparing this narrative with that in the beginning of Genesis.  It seems clear that so many Jews were in Rome in Ovid&#x27;s days, many of whom were people of consideration among those with whom he lived, that he may have heard the account in the Hebrew Scriptures translated. Compare JUDAISM by Prof. Frederic Huidekoper.] To Prometheus the Titan and to his brother Epimetheus was committed the task of making man and all other animals, and of endowing them with all needful faculties.  This Epimetheus did, and his brother overlooked the work.  Epimetheus then gave to the different animals their several gifts of courage, strength, swiftness and sagacity.  He gave wings to one, claws to another, a shelly covering to the third.  Man, superior to all other animals, came last.  But for man Epimetheus had nothing,-- he had bestowed all his gifts elsewhere.  He came to his brother for help, and Prometheus, with the aid of Minerva, went up to heaven, lighted his torch at the chariot of the sun, and brought down fire to man.  With this, man was more than equal to all other animals.  Fire enabled him to make weapons to subdue wild beasts, tools with which to till the earth.  With fire he warmed his dwelling and bid defiance to the cold. Woman was not yet made.  The story is, that Jupiter made her, and sent her to Prometheus and his brother, to punish them for their presumption in stealing fire from heaven; and man, for accepting the gift.  The first woman was named Pandora.  She was made in heaven, every god contributing something to perfect her.  Venus gave her beauty, Mercury persuasion, Apollo music.  Thus equipped, she was conveyed to earth, and presented to Epimetheus, who gladly accepted her, though cautioned by his brother to beware of Jupiter and his gifts.  Epimetheus had in his house a jar, in which were kept certain noxious articles, for which, in fitting man for his new abode, he had had no occasion.  Pandora was seized with an eager curiosity to know what this jar contained; and one day she slipped off the cover and looked in. Forthwith there escaped a multitude of plagues for hapless man,-- such as gout, rheumatism, and colic for his body, and envy, spite, and revenge for his mind,-- and scattered themselves far and wide.  Pandora hastened to replace the lid; but, alas! The whole contents of the jar had escaped, one thing only excepted, which lay at the bottom, and that was HOPE.  So we see at this day, whatever evils are abroad, hope never entirely leaves us; and while we have THAT, no amount of other ills can make us completely wretched. Another story is, that Pandora was sent in good faith, by Jupiter, to bless man; that she was furnished with a box, containing her marriage presents, into which every god had put some blessing.  She opened the box incautiously, and the blessings all escaped, HOPE only excepted.  This story seems more consistent than the former; for how could HOPE, so precious a jewel as it is, have been kept in a jar full of all manner of evils? The world being thus furnished with inhabitants, the first age was an age of innocence and happiness, called the GOLDEN AGE. Truth and right prevailed, though not enforced by law, nor was there any magistrate to threaten or punish.  The forest had not yet been robbed of its trees to furnish timbers for vessels, nor had men built fortifications round their towns.  There were no such things as swords, spears, or helmets.  The earth brought forth all things necessary for man, without his labor in ploughing or sowing.  Perpetual spring reigned, flowers sprang up without seed, the rivers flowed with milk and wine, and yellow honey distilled from the oaks. &quot;But when good Saturn, banished from above, Was driven to hell, the world was under Jove. Succeeding times a Silver Age behold, Excelling brass, but more excelled by gold. Then summer, autumn, winter did appear, And spring was but a season of the year. The sun his annual course obliquely made, Good days contracted and enlarged the bad, Then air, with sultry heats, began to glow; The wings of winds were clogged with ice and sno And shivering mortals into houses driven, Sought shelter from the inclemency of heaven. Those houses then were caves, or homely sheds; With twining osiers fenced; and moss their beds. Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke, And oxen labored first beneath the yoke. To this came next in course the Brazen Age: A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage, Not impious yet! . . . . . Hard Steel succeeded then; And stubborn as the metal were the men.&quot; Ovid&#x27;s Metam, Book I.  Dryden&#x27;s Translation. Crime burst in like a flood; modesty, truth, and honor fled.  In their places came fraud and cunning, violence, and the wicked love of gain.  Then seamen spread sails to the wind, and the trees were torn from the mountains to serve for keels to ships, and vex the face of ocean.  The earth, which till now had been cultivated in common, began to be divided off into possessions. Men were not satisfied with what the surface produced, but must dig into its bowels, and draw forth from thence the ores of metals.  Mischievous IRON, and more mischievous GOLD, were produced.  War sprang up, using both as weapons; the guest was not safe in his friend&#x27;s house; and sons-in-law and fathers-in- law, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, could not trust one another.  Sons wished their fathers dead, that they might come to the inheritance; family love lay prostrate.  The earth was wet with slaughter, and the gods abandoned it, one by one, till Astraea [the goddess of innocence and purity.  After leaving earth, she was placed among the stars, where she became the constellation Virgo  The Virgin.  Themis (Justice) was the mother of Astraea.  She is represented as holding aloft a pair of scales, in which she weighs the claims of opposing parties.  It was a favorite idea of the old poets, that these goddesses would one day return, and bring back the Golden Age.  Even in a Christian Hymn, the Messiah of Pope, this idea occurs. &quot;All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail, Returning Justice lift aloft her scale, Peace o&#x27;er the world her olive wand extend, And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend.&quot;  See, also, Milton&#x27;s Hymn on the nativity, stanzas xiv, and xv] alone was left, and finally she also took her departure. Jupiter, seeing this state of things, burned with anger.  He summoned the gods to council.  They obeyed the call, and took The road to the palace of heaven.  The road, which any one may see in a clear night, stretches across the face of the sky, and is called the Milky Way.  Along the road stand the palaces of the illustrious gods; the common people of the skies live apart, on either side.  Jupiter addressed the assembly.  He set forth the frightful condition of things on the earth, and closed by announcing his intention to destroy the whole of its inhabitants, and provide a new race, unlike the first, who would be more worthy of life, and much better worshippers of   the gods.  So saying he took a thunderbolt, and was about to launch it at the world, and destroy it by burning it; but recollecting the danger that such a conflagration might set heaven itself on fire, he changed his plan, and resolved to drown the world.  Aquilo, the north wind, which scatters the clouds, was chained up; Notus, the south, was sent out, and soon covered all the face of heaven with a cloak of pitchy darkness.  The clouds, driven together, resound with a crash; torrents of rain fall; the crops are laid low; the year&#x27;s labor of the husbandman perishes in an hour.  Jupiter, not satisfied with his own waters, calls on his brother Neptune to aid him with his.  He lets loose the rivers, and pours them over the land.  At the same time, he heaves the land with an earthquake, and brings in the reflux of the ocean over the shores.  Flocks, herds, men, and houses are swept away, and temples, with their sacred enclosures, profaned.  If any edifice remained standing, it was overwhelmed, and its turrets lay hid beneath the waves.  Now all was sea; sea without shore.  Here and there some one remained on a projecting hill-top, and a few, in boats, pulled the oar where they had lately driven the plough. The fishes swim among the tree-tops; the anchor is let down into a garden.  Where the graceful lambs played but now, unwieldy sea- calves gambol.  The wolf swims among the sheep; the yellow lions and tigers struggle in the water.  The strength of the wild boar serves him not, nor his swiftness the stag.  The birds fall with weary wing into the water, having found no land for a resting place.  Those living beings whom the water spared fell a prey to hunger. Parnassus alone, of all the mountains, overtopped the waves; and there Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha, of the race of Prometheus, found refuge   he a just man, and she a faithful worshipper of the gods.  Jupiter, when he saw none left alive but this pair, and remembered their harmless lives and pious demeanor, ordered the north winds to drive away the clouds, and disclose the skies to earth, and earth to the skies.  Neptune also directed Triton to blow on his shell, and sound a retreat to the waters.  The waters obeyed, and the sea returned to its shores, and the rivers to their channels.  Then Deucalion thus addressed Pyrrha: &quot;O wife, only surviving woman, joined to me first by the ties of kindred and marriage, and now by a common danger, would that we possessed the power of our ancestor Prometheus, and could renew the race as he at first made it!  But as we cannot, let us seek yonder temple, and inquire of the gods what remains for us to do.&quot;  They entered the temple, deformed as it was with slime, and approached the altar, where no fire burned.  There they fell prostrate on the earth, and prayed the goddess to inform them how they might retrieve their miserable affairs.  The oracle answered, &quot;Depart from the temple with head veiled and garments unbound, and cast behind you the bones of your mother.&quot;  They heard the words with astonishment.  Pyrrha first broke silence: &quot;We cannot obey; we dare not profane the remains of our parents.&quot; They sought the thickest shades of the wood, and revolved the oracle in their minds.  At length Deucalion spoke: &quot;Either my sagacity deceives me, or the command is one we may obey without impiety.  The earth is the great parent of all; the stones are her bones; these we may cast behind us; and I think this is what the oracle means.  At least, it will do no harm to try.&quot;  They veiled their faces, unbound their garments, and picked up stones, and cast them behind them.  The stones (wonderful to relate) began to grow soft, and assume shape.  By degrees, they put on a rude resemblance to the human form, like a block half finished in the hands of the sculptor.  The moisture and slime that were about them became flesh; the stony part became bones; the veins remained veins, retaining their name, only changing their use. Those thrown by the hand of the man became men, and those by the woman became women.  It was a hard race, and well adapted to labor, as we find ourselves to be at this day, giving plain indications of our origin. The comparison of Eve to Pandora is too obvious to have escaped Milton, who introduces it in Book IV, of Paradise Lost:-- &quot;More lovely than Pandora, whom the gods Endowed with all their gifts; and O, too like In sad event, when to the unwiser son Of Jupiter, brought by Hermes, she ensnared Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged On him who had stole Jove&#x27;s authentic fire.&quot; Prometheus and Epimetheus were sons of Iapetus, which Milton changes to Japhet. Prometheus, the Titan son of Iapetus and Themis, is a favorite subject with the poets.  AEschylus wrote three tragedies on the subjects of his confinement, his release, and his worship at Athens.  Of these only the first is preserved, the Prometheus Bound.  Prometheus was the only one in the council of the gods who favored man.  He alone was kind to the human race, and taught and protected them. &quot;I formed his mind, And through the cloud of barbarous ignorance Diffused the beams of knowledge . . . . They saw indeed, they heard, but what availed Or sight or hearing, all things round them rolling, Like the unreal imagery of dreams In wild confusion mixed!  The lightsome wall Of finer masonry, the raftered roof They knew not; but like ants still buried, delved Deep in the earth and scooped their sunless caves. Unmarked the seasons ranged, the biting winter, The flower-perfumed spring, the ripening summer Fertile of fruits.  At random all their works Till I instructed them to mark the stars, Their rising, and, a harder science yet, Their setting.  The rich train of marshalled numbers I taught them, and the meet array of letters. To impress these precepts on their hearts I sent Memory, the active mother of all reason. I taught the patient steer to bear the yoke, In all his toils joint-laborer of man. By me the harnessed steed was trained to whirl The rapid car, and grace the pride of wealth. The tall bark, lightly bounding o&#x27;er the waves, I taught its course, and winged its flying sail. To man I gave these arts.&quot; Potter&#x27;s Translation from the Prometheus Bound Jupiter, angry at the insolence and presumption of Prometheus in taking upon himself to give all these blessings to man, condemned the Titan to perpetual imprisonment, bound on a rock on Mount Caucasus while a vulture should forever prey upon his liver. This state of torment might at any time have been brought to an end by Prometheus if he had been willing to submit to his oppressor.  For Prometheus knew of a fatal marriage which Jove must make and by which he must come to ruin.  Had Prometheus revealed this secret he would at once have been taken into favor. But this he disdained to do.  He has therefore become the symbol of magnanimous endurance of unmerited suffering and strength of will resisting oppression. Byron and Shelley have both treated this theme.  The following are Byron&#x27;s lines:-- &quot;Titan!  To whose immortal eyes The sufferings of mortality, Seen in their sad reality, Were not as things that gods despise, What was thy pity&#x27;s recompense? A silent suffering, and intense; The rock, the vulture, and the chain; All that the proud can feel of pain; The agony they do not show; The suffocating sense of woe. &quot;Thy godlike crime was to be kind; To render with thy precepts less The sum of human wretchedness, And strengthen man with his own mind. And, baffled as thou wert from high, Still, in thy patient energy, In the endurance and repulse, Of thine impenetrable spirit, Which earth and heaven could not convulse, A mighty lesson we inherit.&quot; PYTHON The slime with which the earth was covered by the waters of the flood, produced an excessive fertility, which called forth every variety of production, both bad and good.  Among the rest, Python, an enormous serpent, crept forth, the terror of the people, and lurked in the caves of Mount Parnassus.  Apollo slew him with his arrows   weapons which he had not before used against any but feeble animals, hares, wild goats, and such game. In commemoration of this illustrious conquest he instituted the Pythian games, in which the victor in feats of strength, swiftness of foot, or in the chariot race, was crowned with a wreath of beech leaves; for the laurel was not yet adopted by Apollo as his own tree.  And here Apollo founded his oracle at Delphi, the only oracle &quot;that was not exclusively national, for it was consulted by many outside nations, and, in fact, was held in the highest repute all over the world.  In obedience to its decrees, the laws of Lycurgus were introduced, and the earliest Greek colonies founded.  No cities were built without first consulting the Delphic oracle, for it was believed that Apollo took special delight in the founding of cities, the first stone of which he laid in person; nor was any enterprise ever undertaken without inquiry at this sacred fane as to its probable success&quot; [From Beren&#x27;s Myths and Legends of Greece and Rome.] The famous statue of Apollo called the Belvedere [From the Belvedere of the Vatican palace where it stands] represents the god after his victory over the serpent Python.  To this Byron alludes in his Childe Harold, iv. 161:-- &quot;The lord of the unerring bow, The god of life, and poetry, and light, The Sun, in human limbs arrayed, and brow All radiant from his triumph in the fight. The shaft has just been shot; the arrow bright With an immortal&#x27;s vengeance; in his eye And nostril, beautiful disdain, and might, And majesty flash their full lightnings by, Developing in that one glance the Deity.&quot; APOLLO AND DAPHNE Daphne was Apollo&#x27;s first love.  It was not brought about by accident, but by the malice of Cupid.  Apollo saw the boy playing with his bow and arrows; and being himself elated with his recent victory over Python, he said to him, &quot;What have you to do with warlike weapons, saucy boy?  Leave them for hands worthy of them. Behold the conquest I have won by means of them over the vast serpent who stretched his poisonous body over acres of the plain! Be content with your torch, child, and kindle up your flames, as you call them, where you will, but presume not to meddle with my weapons.&quot; Venus&#x27;s boy heard these words, and rejoined, &quot;:Your arrows may strike all things else, Apollo, but mine shall strike you.:&quot; So saying, he took his stand on a rock of Parnassus, and drew from his quiver two arrows of different workmanship, one to excite love, the other to repel it.  The former was of gold and sharp- pointed, the latter blunt and tipped with lead.  With the leaden shaft he struck the nymph Daphne, the daughter of the river god Peneus, and with the golden one Apollo, through the heart. Forthwith the god was seized with love for the maiden, and she abhorred the thought of loving.  Her delight was in woodland sports and in the spoils of the chase.  Many lovers sought her, but she spurned them all, ranging the woods, and taking thought neither of Cupid nor of Hymen.  Her father often said to her, &quot;Daughter, you owe me a son-in-law; you owe me grandchildren.&quot; She, hating the thought of marriage as a crime, with her beautiful face tinged all over with blushes, threw her arms around her father&#x27;s neck, and said, &quot;Dearest father, grant me this favor, that I may always remain unmarried, like Diana.&quot;  He consented, but at the same time said, &quot;Your own face will forbid it.&quot; Apollo loved her, and longed to obtain her; and he who gives oracles to all in the world was not wise enough to look into his own fortunes.  He saw her hair flung loose over her shoulders, and said, &quot;If so charming in disorder, what would it be if arranged?&quot;  He saw her eyes bright as stars; he saw her lips, and was not satisfied with only seeing them.  He admired her hands and arms bared to the shoulder, and whatever was hidden from view he imagined more beautiful still.  He followed her; she fled, swifter than the wind, and delayed not a moment at his entreaties.  &quot;Stay,&quot; said he, &quot;daughter of Peneus; I am not a foe.  Do not fly me as a lamb flies the wolf, or a dove the hawk. It is for love I pursue you.  You make me miserable, for fear you should fall and hurt yourself on these stones, and I should be the cause.  Pray run slower, and I will follow slower.  I am no clown, no rude peasant.  Jupiter is my father, and I am lord of Delphos and Tenedos, and know all things, present and future.  I am the god of song and the lyre.  My arrows fly true to the mark; but alas!  An arrow more fatal than mine has pierced my heart!  I am the god of medicine, and know the virtues of all healing plants.  Alas!  I suffer a malady that no balm can cure!&quot; The nymph continued her flight, and left his plea half uttered. And even as she fled she charmed him.  The wind blew her garments, and her unbound hair streamed loose behind her.  The god grew impatient to find his wooings thrown away, and, sped by Cupid, gained upon her in the race.  It was like a hound pursuing a hare, with open jaws ready to seize, while the feebler animal darts forward, slipping from the very grasp.  So flew the god and the virgin   he on the wings of love, and she on those of fear. The pursuer is the more rapid, however, and gains upon her, and his panting breath blows upon her hair.  Now her strength begins to fail, and, ready to sink, she calls upon her father, the river god: &quot;Help me, Peneus!  Open the earth to enclose me, or change my form, which has brought me into this danger!&quot; Scarcely had she spoken, when a stiffness seized all her limbs; her bosom began to be enclosed in a tender bark; her hair became leaves; her arms became branches; her feet stuck fast in the ground, as roots; her face became a tree-top, retaining nothing of its former self but its beauty.  Apollo stood amazed.  He touched the stem, and felt the flesh tremble under the new bark. He embraced the branches, and lavished kisses on the wood.  The branches shrank from his lips.  &quot;Since you cannot be my wife,&quot; said he, &quot;you shall assuredly be my tree.  I will wear you for my crown.  With you I will decorate my harp and my quiver; and when the great Roman conquerors lead up the triumphal pomp to the Capitol, you shall be woven into wreaths for their brows.  And, as eternal youth is mine, you also shall be always green, and your leaf know no decay.&quot;  The nymph, now changed into a laurel tree, bowed its head in grateful acknowledgment. Apollo was god of music and of poetry and also of medicine.  For, as the poet Armstrong says, himself a physician:-- &quot;Music exalts each joy, allays each grief, Expels disease, softens every pain; And hence the wise of ancient days adored One power of physic, melody, and song.&quot; The story of Apollo and Daphne is often alluded to by the poets. Waller applies it to the case of one whose amatory verses, though they did not soften the heart of his mistress, yet won for the poet wide-spread fame. &quot;Yet what he sung in his immortal strain, Though unsuccessful, was not sung in vain. All but the nymph that should redress his wrong, Attend his passion and approve his song. Like Phoebus thus, acquiring unsought praise, He caught at love and filled his arms with bays.&quot; The following stanza from Shelley&#x27;s Adonais alludes to Byron&#x27;s early quarrel with the reviewers:-- &quot;The herded wolves, bold only to pursue; The obscene ravens, clamorous o&#x27;er the dead; The vultures, to the conqueror&#x27;s banner true, Who feed where Desolation first has fed. And whose wings rain contagion; how they fled, When like Apollo, from his golden bow, The Pythian of the age one arrow sped And smiled!  The spoilers tempt no second blow; They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them as they go.&quot; PYRAMUS AND THISBE Pyramus was the handsomest youth, and Thisbe the fairest maiden, in all Babylonia, where Semiramis reigned.  Their parents occupied adjoining houses; and neighborhood brought the young people together, and acquaintance ripened into love.  They would gladly have married, but their parents forbade.  One thing, however, they could not forbid   that love should glow with equal ardor in the bosoms of both.  They conversed by signs and glances, and the fire burned more intensely for being covered up. In the wall that parted the two houses there was a crack, caused by some fault in the structure.  No one had remarked it before, but the lovers discovered it.  &#x27;What will love not discover?  It afforded a passage to the voice; and tender messages used to pass backward and forward through the gap.  As they stood, Pyramus on this side, Thisbe on that, their breaths would mingle.  &quot;Cruel wall,&quot; they said, &quot;why do you keep two lovers apart?  But we will not be ungrateful.  We owe you, we confess, the privilege of transmitting loving words to willing ears.&quot;  Such words they uttered on different sides of the wall; and when night came and they must say farewell, they pressed their lips upon the wall, she on her side, he on his, as they could come no nearer. One morning, when Aurora had put out the stars, and the sun had melted the frost from the grass, they met at the accustomed spot. Then, after lamenting their hard fate, they agreed that next night, when all was still, they would slip away from watchful eyes, leave their dwellings and walk out into the fields; and to insure a meeting, repair to a well-known edifice, standing without the city&#x27;s bounds, called the tomb of Ninus, and that the one who came first should await the other at the foot of a certain tree.  It was a white mulberry tree and stood near a cool spring.  All was agreed on, and they waited impatiently for the sun to go down beneath the waters and night to rise up from them. Then cautiously Thisbe stole forth, unobserved by the family, her head covered with a veil, made her way to the monument and sat down under the tree.  As she sat alone in the dim light of the evening she descried a lioness, her jaws reeking with recent slaughter, approaching the fountain to slake her thirst.  Thisbe fled at the sight, and sought refuge in the hollow of a rock.  As she fled she dropped her veil.  The lioness, after drinking at the spring, turned to retreat to the woods, and seeing the veil on the ground, tossed and rent it with her bloody mouth. Pyramus, having been delayed, now approached the place of meeting.  He saw in the sand the footsteps of the lion, and the color fled from his cheeks at the sight.  Presently he found the veil all rent and bloody.  &quot;Oh, hapless girl,&quot; said he, &quot;I have been the cause of thy death!  Thou, more worthy of life than I, hast fallen the first victim.  I will follow.  I am the guilty cause, in tempting thee forth to a place of such peril, and not being myself on the spot to guard thee.  Come forth, ye lions, from the rocks, and tear this guilty body with your teeth&quot; He took up the veil, carried it with him to the appointed tree, and covered it with kisses and with tears.  &quot;My blood also shall stain your texture,&quot; said he, and drawing his sword plunged it into his heart.  The blood spurted from the wound, and tinged the white mulberries of the tree all red; and sinking into the earth reached the roots, so that the red color mounted through the trunk to the fruit. By this time, Thisbe, still trembling with fear, yet wishing not to disappoint her lover, stepped cautiously forth, looking anxiously for the youth, eager to tell him the danger she had escaped.  When she came to the spot and saw the changed color of the mulberries she doubted whether it was the same place.  While she hesitated she saw the form of one struggling in the agonies of death.  She started back, a shudder ran through her frame as a ripple on the face of the still water when a sudden breeze sweeps over it.  But as soon as she recognized her lover, she screamed and beat her breast; embracing the lifeless body, pouring tears into its wounds, and imprinting kisses on the cold lips.  &quot;Oh, Pyramus,&quot; she cried, &quot;what has done this?  Answer me, Pyramus; it is your own Thisbe that speaks.  Hear me, dearest, and lift that drooping head!&quot;  At the name of Thisbe, Pyramus opened his eyes, then closed them again.  She saw her veil stained with blood and the scabbard empty of its sword.  &quot;Thy own hand has slain thee, and for my sake,&quot; she said.  &quot;I too can be brave for once, and my love is as strong as thine.  I will follow thee in death, for I have been the cause; and death, which alone could part us, shall not prevent my joining thee.  And ye, unhappy parents of us both, deny us not our united request.  As love and death have joined us, let one tomb contain us.  And thou, tree, retain the marks of slaughter.  Let thy berries still serve for memorials of our blood.&quot;  So saying, she plunged the sword into her breast.  Her parents acceded to her wish; the gods also ratified it.  The two bodies were buried in one sepulchre, and the tree ever after brought forth purple berries, as it does to this day. Moore, in the Sylph&#x27;s Ball, speaking of Davy&#x27;s Safety Lamp, is reminded of the wall that separated Thisbe and her lover:-- &quot;O for that lamp&#x27;s metallic gauze, That curtain of protecting wire, Which Davy delicately draws Around illicit, dangerous fire! &quot;The wall he sets &#x27;twixt Flame and Air, (Like that which barred young Thisbe&#x27;s bliss), Through whose small holes this dangerous pair May see each other, but not kiss.&quot; In Mickle&#x27;s translation of the Lusiad occurs the following allusion to the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, and the metamorphosis of the mulberries.  The poet is describing the Island of Love. &quot;   here each gift Pomona&#x27;s hand bestows In cultured garden, free uncultured flows, The flavor sweeter and the hue more fair Than e&#x27;er was fostered by the hand of care. The cherry here in shining crimson glows, And stained with lover&#x27;s blood, in pendent rows, The mulberries o&#x27;erload the bending boughs.&quot; If any of our young readers can be so hard-hearted as to enjoy a laugh at the expense of poor Pyramus and Thisbe, they may find an opportunity by turning to Shakespeare&#x27;s play of Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, where it is most amusingly burlesqued. Here is the description of the play and the characters by the Prologue. &quot;Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show; But wonder on, till truth makes all things plain. This man is Pyramus, if you would know; This lovely lady Thisby is certain. This man with lime and roughcast, doth present Wall, that vile Wall, which did these lovers sunder; And through Wall&#x27;s chink, poor souls, they are content To whisper.  At the which let no man wonder. This man, with lanthorn, dog and bush of thorn, Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know, By Moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus&#x27; tomb, there, there to woo. This grisly beast, which by name Lion hight. The trusty Thisby, coming first by night, Did scare away, or rather did affright; And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall, Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain. Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall, And finds his trusty Thisby&#x27;s mantle slain; Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade, He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast; And, Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade, His dagger drew and died.&quot; Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, v.1,128, et seq. CEPHALUS AND PROCRIS Cephalus was a beautiful youth and fond of manly sports.  He would rise before the dawn to pursue the chase.  Aurora saw him when she first looked forth, fell in love with him, and stole him away.  But Cephalus was just married to a charming wife whom he loved devotedly.  Her name was Procris.  She was a favorite of Diana, the goddess of hunting, who had given her a dog which could outrun every rival, and a javelin which would never fail of its mark; and Procris gave these presents to her husband. Cephalus was so happy in his wife that he resisted all the entreaties of Aurora, and she finally dismissed him in displeasure, saying, &quot;Go, ungrateful mortal, keep your wife, whom, if I am not much mistaken, you will one day be very sorry you ever saw again.&quot; Cephalus returned, and was as happy as ever in his wife and his woodland sports.  Now it happened some angry deity had sent a ravenous fox to annoy the country; and the hunters turned out in great strength to capture it.  Their efforts were all in vain; no dog could run it down; and at last they came to Cephalus to borrow his famous dog, whose name was Lelaps.  No sooner was the dog let loose than he darted off, quicker than their eye could follow him.  If they had not seen his footprints in the sand they would have thought he flew.  Cephalus and others stood on a hill and saw the race.  The fox tried every art; he ran in a circle and turned on his track, the dog close upon him, with open jaws, snapping at his heels, but biting only the air.  Cephalus was about to use his javelin, when suddenly he saw both dog and game stop instantly.  The heavenly powers who had given both, were not willing that either should conquer.  In the very attitude of life and action they were turned into stone.  So lifelike and natural did they look, you would have thought, as you looked at them, that one was going to bark, the other to leap forward. Cephalus, though he had lost his dog, still continued to take delight in the chase.  He would go out at early morning, ranging the woods and hills unaccompanied by any one, needing no help, for his javelin was a sure weapon in all cases.  Fatigued with hunting, when the sun got high he would seek a shady nook where a cool stream flowed, and, stretched on the grass with his garments thrown aside, would enjoy the breeze.  Sometimes he would say aloud, &quot;Come, sweet breeze, come and fan my breast, come and allay the heat that burns me.&quot;  Some one passing by one day heard him talking in this way to the air, and, foolishly believing that he was talking to some maiden, went and told the secret to Procris, Cephalus&#x27;s wife.  Love is credulous.  Procris, at the sudden shock, fainted away.  Presently recovering, she said, &quot;It cannot be true; I will not believe it unless I myself am a witness to it.&quot;  So she waited, with anxious heart, till the next morning, when Cephalus went to hunt as usual.  Then she stole out after him, and concealed herself in the place where the informer directed her.  Cephalus came as he was wont when tired with sport, and stretched himself on the green bank, saying, &quot;Come, sweet breeze, come and fan me; you know how I love you!  You make the groves and my solitary rambles delightful.&quot;  He was running on in this way when he heard, or thought he heard, a sound as of a sob in the bushes.  Supposing it some wild animal, he threw hie javelin at the spot.  A cry from his beloved Procris told him that the weapon had too surely met its mark.  He rushed to the place, and found her bleeding and with sinking strength endeavoring to draw forth from the wound the javelin, her own gift.  Cephalus raised her from the earth, strove to stanch the blood, and called her to revive and not to leave him miserable, to reproach himself with her death.  She opened her feeble eyes, and forced herself to utter these few words: &quot;I implore you, if you have ever loved me, if I have ever deserved kindness at your hands, my husband, grant me this last request; do not marry that odious Breeze!&quot;  This disclosed the whole mystery; but alas! What advantage to disclose it now?  She died; but her face wore a calm expression, and she looked pityingly and forgivingly on her husband when he made her understand the truth. In Shakespeare&#x27;s play just quoted, there is an allusion to Cephalus and Procris, although rather badly spelt. Pyramus says, &quot;Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.&quot; Thisbe.  &quot;As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.&quot; Moore, in his Legendary Ballads, has one on Cephalus and Procris, beginning thus:-- &quot;A hunter once in a grove reclined, To shun the noon&#x27;s bright eye, And oft he wooed the wandering wind To cool his brow with its sigh. While mute lay even the wild bee&#x27;s hum, Nor breath could stir the aspen&#x27;s hair, His song was still, &#x27;Sweet Air, O come!&#x27; While Echo answered, &#x27;Come, sweet Air!&#x27;&quot; Chapter III Io and Callisto. Diana and Actaeon. The Story of Phaeton Jupiter and Juno, although husband and wife, did not live together very happily.  Jupiter did not love his wife very much, and Juno distrusted her husband, and was always accusing him of unfaithfulness.  One day she perceived that it suddenly grew dark, and immediately suspected that her husband had raised a cloud to hide some of his doings that would not bear the light. She brushed away the cloud, and saw her husband, on the banks of a glassy river, with a beautiful heifer standing near him.  Juno suspected that the heifer&#x27;s form concealed some fair nymph of mortal mould.  This was indeed the case; for it was Io, the daughter of the river god Inachus, whom Jupiter had been flirting with, and, when he became aware of the approach of his wife, had changed into that form. Juno joined her husband, and noticing the heifer, praised its beauty, and asked whose it was, and of what herd.  Jupiter, to stop questions, replied that it was a fresh creation from the earth.  Juno asked to have it as a gift.  What could Jupiter do? He was loth to give his mistress to his wife; yet how refuse so trifling a present as a simple heifer?  He could not, without arousing suspicion; so he consented.  The goddess was not yet relieved of her suspicions; and she delivered the heifer to Argus, to be strictly watched. Now Argus had a hundred eyes in his head, and never went to sleep with more than two at a time, so that he kept watch of Io constantly.  He suffered her to feed through the day, and at night tied her up with a vile rope round her neck.  She would have stretched out her arms to implore freedom of Argus, but she had no arms to stretch out, and her voice was a bellow that frightened even herself. She saw her father and her sisters, went near them, and suffered them to pat her back, and heard them admire her beauty.  Her father reached her a tuft o gras, and she licked the outstretched hand.  She longed to make herself known to him, and would have uttered her wish; but, alas!  words were wanting.   At length she bethought herself of writing, and inscribed her name   it was a short one   with her hoof on the sand.  Inachus recognized it, and discovering that his daughter, whom he had long sought in vain, was hidden under this disguise, mourned over her, and, embracing her white neck, exclaimed, &quot;Alas!  My daughter, it would have been a less grief to have lost you altogether!&quot;  While he thus lamented, Argus, observing, came and drove her away, and took his seat on a high bank, whence he could see in every direction. Jupiter was troubled at beholding the sufferings of his mistress, and calling Mercury, told him to go and despatch Argus.  Mercury made haste, put his winged slippers on his feet, and cap on his head, took his sleep-producing wand, and leaped down from the heavenly towers to the earth.  There he laid aside his wings, and kept only his wand, with which he presented himself as a shepherd driving his flock.  As he strolled on he blew upon his pipes. These were what are called the Syrinx or Pandean pipes.  Argus listened with delight, for he had never heard the instrument before.  &quot;Young man,&quot; said he, &quot;come and take a seat by me on this stone.  There is no better place for your flock to graze in than hereabouts, and here is a pleasant shade such as shepherds love.&quot;  Mercury sat down, talked, and told stories until it grew late, and played upon his pipes his most soothing strains, hoping to lull the watchful eyes to sleep, but all in vain; for Argus still contrived to keep some of his eyes open, though he shut the rest. Among other stories, Mercury told him how the instrument on which he played was invented.  &quot;There was a certain nymph, whose name was Syrinx, who was much beloved by the satyrs and spirits of the wood; but she would have none of them, but was a faithful worshipper of Diana, and followed the chase.  You would have thought it was Diana herself, had you seen her in her hunting dress, only that her bow was of horn and Diana&#x27;s of silver.  One day, as she was returning from the chase, Pan met her, told her just this, and added more of the same sort.  She ran away, without stopping to hear his compliments, and he pursued till she came to the bank of the river, where he overtook her, and she had only time to call for help on her friends, the water nymphs. They heard and consented.  Pan threw his arms around what he supposed to be the form of the nymph, and found he embraced only a tuft of reeds!  As he breathed a sigh, the air sounded through the reeds, and produced a plaintive melody.  The god, charmed with the novelty and with the sweetness of the music, said &#x27;Thus, then, at least, you shall be mine.&#x27;  And he took some of the reeds, and placing them together, of unequal lengths, side by side, made an instrument which he called Syrinx, in honor of the nymph.&quot; Before Mercury had finished his story, he saw Argus&#x27;s eyes all asleep.  As his head nodded forward on his breast, Mercury with one stroke cut his neck through, and tumbled his head down the rocks.  O hapless Argus!  The light of your hundred eyes is quenched at once!  Juno took them and put them as ornaments on the tail of her peacock, where they remain to this day. But the vengeance of Juno was not yet satiated.  She sent a gadfly to torment Io, who fled over the whole world from its pursuit.  She swam through the Ionian Sea, which derived its name from her, then roamed over the plains of Illyria, ascended Mount Haemus, and crossed the Thracian strait, thence named the Bosphorus (cow-bearer), rambled on through Scythia and the country of the Cimmerians, and arrived at last on the banks of the Nile.  At length Jupiter interceded for her, and, upon his promising not to pay her any more attentions, Juno consented to restore her to her form.  It was curious to see her gradually recover her former self.  The coarse hairs fell from her body, her horns shrunk up, her eyes grew narrower, her mouth shorter; hands and fingers came instead of hoofs to her forefeet; in fine, there was nothing left of the heifer except her beauty.  At first she was afraid to speak for fear she should low, but gradually she recovered her confidence, and was restored to her father and sisters. In a poem dedicated to Leigh Hunt, by Keats, the following allusion to the story of Pan and Syrinx occurs:-- &quot;So did he feel who pulled the boughs aside, That we might look into a forest wide,                                              *    *    *    *    *    *    *    * Telling us how fair trembling Syrinx fled Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread. Poor nymph   poor Pan   how he did weep to find Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind Along the reedy stream; a half-heard strain, Full of sweet desolation, balmy pain.&quot; CALLISTO Callisto was another maiden who excited the jealousy of Juno, and the goddess changed her into a bear.  &quot;I will take away,&quot; said she, :&quot;that beauty with which you have captivated my husband.&quot; Down fell Callisto on her hands and knees; she tried to stretch out her arms in supplication,-- they were already beginning to be covered with black hair.  Her hands grew rounded, became armed with crooked claws, and served for feet; her mouth, which Jove used to praise for its beauty, became a horrid pair of jaws; her voice, which if unchanged would have moved the heart to pity, became a growl, more fit to inspire terror.  Yet her former disposition remained, and, with continued groaning, she bemoaned her fate, and stood upright as well as she could, lifting up her paws to beg for mercy; and felt that Jove was unkind, though she could not tell him so.  Ah, how often, afraid to stay in the woods all night alone, she wandered about the neighborhood of her former haunts; how often, frightened by the dogs, did she, so lately a huntress, fly in terror from the hunters!  Often she fled from the wild beasts, forgetting that she was now a wild beast herself; and, bear as she was, was afraid of the bears. One day a youth espied her as he was hunting.  She saw him and recognized him as her own son, now grown a young man.  She stopped, and felt inclined to embrace him.  As she was about to approach, he, alarmed, raised his hunting spear, and was on the point of transfixing her, when Jupiter, beholding, arrested the crime, and, snatching away both of them, placed them in the heavens as the Great and Little Bear. Juno was in a rage to see her rival so set in honor, and hastened to ancient Tethys and Oceanus, the powers of ocean, and, in answer to their inquiries, thus told the cause of her coming; &quot;Do you ask why I, the queen of the gods, have left the heavenly plains and sought your depths.  Learn that I am supplanted in heaven,-- my place is given to another.  You will hardly believe me; but look when night darkens the world, and you shall see the two, of whom I have so much reason to complain, exalted to the heavens, in that part where the circle is the smallest, in the neighborhood of the pole.  Why should any one hereafter tremble at the thought of offending Juno, when such rewards are the consequence of my displeasure!  See what I have been able to effect!  I forbade her to wear the human form,-- she is placed among the stars!  So do my punishments result,-- such is the extent of my power!  Better that she should have resumed her former shape, as I permitted Io to do.  Perhaps he means to marry her, and put me away!  But you, my foster parents, if you feel for me, and see with displeasure this unworthy treatment of me, show it, I beseech you, by forbidding this guilty couple from coming into your waters.&quot;  The powers of the ocean assented, and consequently the two constellations of the Great and Little Bear move round and round in heaven, but never sink, as the other stars do, beneath the ocean. Milton alludes to the fact that the constellation of the Bear never sets, when he says, &quot;Let my lamp at midnight hour Be seen in some high lonely tower, Where I may oft outwatch the Bear.&quot; Il Penseroso And Prometheus, in James Russell Lowell&#x27;s poem, says, &quot;One after one the stars have risen and set, Sparkling upon the hoar-frost of my chain; The Bear that prowled all night about the fold Of the North Star, hath shrunk into his den, Scared by the blithsome footsteps of the dawn.&quot; The last star in the tail of the Little Bear is the Pole star, called also the Cynosure.  Milton says, &quot;Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures While the landscape round it measures.                                              *    *    *    *    *    *    *    * Towers and battlements it sees Bosomed high in tufted trees, Where perhaps some beauty lies The Cynosure of neighboring eyes.&quot; L&#x27;Allegro. The reference here is both to the Pole-star as the guide of mariners, and to the magnetic attraction of the North.  He calls it also the &quot;Star of Aready,&quot; because Callisto&#x27;s boy was named Arcas, and they lived in Arcadia.  In Milton&#x27;s Comus, the elder brother, benighted in the woods, says, &quot;Some gentle taper! Through a rush candle, from the wicker hole Of some clay habitation, visit us With thy long levelled rule of streaming light, And thou shalt be our star of Aready, Or Tyrian Chynsure.&quot; DIANA AND ACTAEON It was midday, and the sun stood equally distant from either goal, when young Actaeon, son of King Cadmus, thus addressed the youths who with him were hunting the stag in the mountains:-- &quot;Friends, our nets and our weapons are wet with the blood of our victims; we have had sport enough for one day, and tomorrow we can renew our labors.  Now, while Phoebus parches the earth, let us put by our instruments and indulge ourselves with rest.&quot; There was a valley thickly enclosed with cypresses and pines, sacred to the huntress-queen, Diana.  In the extremity of the valley was a cave, not adorned with art, but nature had counterfeited art in its construction, for she had turned the arch of its roof with stones as delicately fitted as if by the hand of man.  A fountain burst out from one side, whose open basin was bounded by a grassy rim.  Here the goddess of the woods used to come when weary with hunting and lave her virgin limbs in the sparkling water. One day, having repaired thither with her nymphs, she handed her javelin, her quiver, and her bow to one, her robe to another, while a third unbound the sandals from her feet.  Then Crocale, the most skilful of them, arranged her hair, and Nephele, Hyale, and the rest drew water in capacious urns.  While the goddess was thus employed in the labors of the toilet, behold, Actaeon, having quitted his companions, and rambling without any especial object, came to the place, led thither by his destiny.  As he presented himself at the entrance of the cave, the nymphs, seeing a man, screamed and rushed towards the goddess to hide her with their bodies.  But she was taller than the rest, and overtopped them all by a head.  Such a color as tinges the clouds at sunset or at dawn came over the countenance of Diana thus taken by surprise.  Surrounded as she was by her nymphs, she yet turned half away, and sought with a sudden impulse for her arrows.  As they were not at hand, she dashed the water into the face of the intruder, adding these words: &quot;Now go and tell, if you can, that you have seen Diana unapparelled.&quot;  Immediately a pair of branching stag&#x27;s horns grew out of his head, his neck gained in length, his ears grew sharp-pointed, his hands became feet, his arms long legs, his body was covered with a hairy spotted hide. Fear took the place of his former boldness, and the hero fled. He could not but admire his own speed; but when he saw his horns in the water, &quot;Ah, wretched me!: he would have said, but no sound followed the effort.  He groaned, and tears flowed down the face that had taken the place of his own.  Yet his consciousness remained.  What shall he do?   Go home to seek the palace, or lie hid in the woods?  The latter he was afraid, the former he was ashamed, to do.  While he hesitated the dogs saw him.  First Melampus, a Spartan dog, gave the signal with his bark, then Pamphagus, Dorceus, Lelaps, Theron, Nape, Tigris, and all the rest, rushed after him swifter than the wind.  Over rocks and cliffs, through mountain gorges that seemed impracticable, he fled, and they followed.  Where he had often chased the stag and cheered on his pack, his pack now chased him, cheered on by his own huntsmen.  He longed to cry out, &quot;I am Actaeon; recognize your master!&quot;  But the words came not at his will.  The air resounded with the bark of the dogs.  Presently one fastened on his back, another seized his shoulder.  While they held their master, the rest of the pack came up and buried their teeth in his flesh.  He groaned,   not in a human voice, yet certainly not in a stag&#x27;s,   and, falling on his knees, raised his eyes, and would have raised his arms in supplication, if he had had them. His friends and fellow-huntsmen cheered on the dogs, and looked every where for Actaeon, calling on him to join the sport.  At the sound of his name, he turned his head, and heard them regret that he should be away.  He earnestly wished he was.  He would have been well pleased to see the exploits of his dogs, but to feel them was too much.  They were all around him, rending and tearing; and it was not till they had torn his life out that the anger of Diana was satisfied. In the &quot;Epic of Hades&quot; there is a description of Actaeon and his change of form.  Perhaps the most beautiful lines in it are when Actaeon, changed to a stag, first hears his own hounds and flees. &quot;But as I gazed, and careless turned and passed Through the thick wood, forgetting what had been, And thinking thoughts no longer, swift there came A mortal terror; voices that I knew. My own hounds&#x27; bayings that I loved before, As with them often o&#x27;er the purple hills I chased the flying hart from slope to slope, Before the slow sun climbed the eastern peaks, Until the swift sun smote the western plain; Whom often I had cheered by voice and glance, Whom often I had checked with hand and thong; Grim followers, like the passions, firing me, True servants, like the strong nerves, urging me On many a fruitless chase, to find and take Some too swift-fleeting beauty, faithful feet And tongues, obedient always: these I knew Clothed with a new-born force and vaster grown, And stronger than their master; and I thought, What if they tore me with their jaws, nor knew That once I ruled them,   brute pursuing brute, And I the quarry?  Then I turned and fled If it was I indeed that feared and fled Down the long glades, and through the tangled brakes, Where scarce the sunlight pierced; fled on and on, And panted, self-pursued.  But evermore The dissonant music which I knew so sweet, When by the windy hills, the echoing vales And whispering pines it rang; now far, now near As from my rushing steed I leant and cheered With voice and horn the chase; this brought to me Fear of I knew not what, which bade me fly, Fly always, fly; but when my heart stood still, And all my limbs were stiffened as I fled, Just as the white moon ghost-like climbed the sky, Nearer they came and nearer, baying loud, With bloodshot eyes and red jaws dripping foam; And when I strove to check their savagery, Speaking with words; no voice articulate came, Only a dumb, low bleat.  Then all the throng Leapt swift upon me and tore me as I lay, And left me man again.&quot; In Shelley&#x27;s poem Adonais is the following allusion to the story of Actaeon:-- &quot;Midst others of less note came one frail form, A phantom among men; companionless As the last cloud of an expiring storm, Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess, Had gazed on Nature&#x27;s naked loveliness, Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray With feeble steps o&#x27;er the world&#x27;s wilderness; And his own Thoughts, along that rugged way, Pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey.&quot; Adonais, stanza 31. The allusion is probably to Shelley himself. LATONA AND THE RUSTICS Some thought the goddess in this instance more severe than was just, while others praised her conduct as strictly consistent with her virgin dignity.  As usual, the recent event brought older ones to mind, and one of the bystanders told this story. &quot;Some countrymen of Lycia once insulted the goddess Latona, but not with impunity.  When I was young, my father, who had grown too old for active labors, sent me to Lycia to drive thence some choice oxen, and there I saw the very pond and marsh where the wonder happened.  Near by stood an ancient altar, black with the smoke of sacrifice and almost buried among the reeds.  I inquired whose altar it might be, whether of Faunus or the Naiads or some god of the neighboring mountain, and one of the country people replied, &#x27;No mountain or river god possesses this altar, but she whom royal Juno in her jealousy drove from land to land, denying her any spot of earth whereon to rear her twins.  Bearing in her arms the infant deities, Latona reached this land, weary with her burden and parched with thirst.  By chance she espied in the bottom of the valley this pond of clear water, where the country people were at work gathering willows and osiers.  The goddess approached, and kneeling on the bank would have slaked her thirst in the cool stream, but the rustics forbade her.  &#x27;Why do you refuse me water?&#x27; said she; &#x27;water is free to all.  Nature allows no one to claim as property the sunshine, the air, or the water. I come to take my share of the common blessing.  Yet I ask it of you as a favor.  I have no intention of washing my limbs in it, weary though they be, but only to quench my thirst.  My mouth is so dry that I can hardly speak.  A draught of water would be nectar to me; it would revive me, and I would own myself indebted to you for life itself.  Let these infants move your pity, who stretch out their little arms as if to plead for me&#x27;; and the children, as it happened, were stretching out their arms. &quot;Who would not have been moved with these gentle words of the goddess?  But these clowns persisted in their rudeness; they even added jeers and threats of violence if she did not leave the place.  Nor was this all.  They waded into the pond and stirred up the mud with their feet, so as to make the water unfit to drink.  Latona was so angry that she ceased to feel her thirst. She no longer supplicated the clowns, but lifting her hands to heaven exclaimed, &#x27;May they never quit that pool, but pass their lives there!&#x27;  And it came to pass accordingly.  They now live in the water, sometimes totally submerged, then raising their heads above the surface, or swimming upon it.  Sometimes they come out upon the bank, but soon leap back again into the water.  They still use their base voices in railing, and though they have the water all to themselves, are not ashamed to croak in the midst of it.  Their voices are harsh, their throats bloated, their mouths have become stretched by constant railing, their necks have shrunk up and disappeared, and their heads are joined to their bodies.  Their backs are green, their disproportioned bellies white, and in short they are now frogs, and dwell in the slimy pool.&quot; This story explains the allusion in one of Milton&#x27;s sonnets, &quot;On the detraction which followed upon his writing certain treatises.&quot; &quot;I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs By the known laws of ancient liberty,. When straight a barbarous noise environs me Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes and dogs. As when those hinds that were transformed to frogs Railed at Latona&#x27;s twin-born progeny, Which after held the sun and moon in fee.&quot; The persecution which Latona experienced from Juno is alluded to in the story.  The tradition was that the future mother of Apollo and Diana, flying from the wrath of Juno, besought all the islands of the Aegean to afford her a place of rest, but all feared too much the potent queen of heaven to assist her rival. Delos alone consented to become the birthplace of the future deities.  Delos was then a floating island; but when Latona arrived there, Jupiter fastened it with adamantine chains to the bottom of the sea, that it might be a secure resting place for his beloved.  Byron alludes to Delos in his Don Juan:-- &quot;The isles of Greece!  The isles of Greece! Where burning Sappho loved and sung, Where grew the arts of war and peace, Where Delos rose and Phoebus sprung!&quot; PHAETON Epaphus was the son of Jupiter and Io.  Phaeton, child of the Sun, was one day boasting to him of his high descent and of his father Phoebus.  Epaphus could not bear it.  &quot;Foolish fellow,&quot; said he &quot;you believe your mother in all things, and you are puffed up by your pride in a false father.&quot;  Phaeton went in rage and shame and reported this to his mother, Clymene.  &quot;If,&quot; said he, &quot;I am indeed of heavenly birth, give me, mother, some proof of it, and establish my claim to the honor.&quot;  Clymene stretched forth her hands towards the skies, and said, &quot;I call to witness the Sun which looks down upon us, that I have told you the truth. If I speak falsely, let this be the last time I behold his light. But it needs not much labor to go and inquire for yourself; the land whence the sun rises lies next to ours.  Go and demand of him whether he will own you as a son&quot; Phaeton heard with delight. He travelled to India, which lies directly in the regions of sunrise; and, full of hope and pride, approached the goal whence the Sun begins his course. The palace of the Sun stood reared aloft on columns, glittering with gold and precious stones, while polished ivory formed the ceilings, and silver the doors.  The workmanship surpassed the material; for upon the walls Vulcan had represented earth, sea and skies, with their inhabitants.  In the sea were the nymphs, some sporting in the waves, some riding on the backs of fishes, while others sat upon the rocks and dried their sea-green hair. Their faces were not all alike, nor yet unlike,   but such as sisters&#x27; ought to be.  The earth had its towns and forests and rivers and rustic divinities.  Over all was carved the likeness of the glorious heaven; and on the silver doors the twelve signs of the zodiac, six on each side. Clymene&#x27;s son advanced up the steep ascent, and entered the halls of his disputed father.  He approached the paternal presence, but stopped at a distance, for the light was more than he could bear. Phoebus, arrayed in a purple vesture, sat on a throne which glittered as with diamonds.  On his right hand and his left stood the Day, the Month, and the Year, and, at regular intervals, the Hours.  Spring stood with her head crowned with flowers, and Summer, with garment cast aside, and a garland formed of spears of ripened grain, and Autumn, with his feet stained with grape juice, and icy Winter, with his hair stiffened with hoar frost. Surrounded by these attendants, the Sun, with the eye that sees every thing, beheld the youth dazzled with the novelty and splendor of the scene, and inquired the purpose of his errand. The youth replied, &quot;Oh, light of the boundless world, Phoebus, my father,   if you permit me to use that name,   give me some proof, I beseech you, by which I may be known as yours.&quot;  He ceased; and his father, laying aside the beams that shone all around his head, bade him approach, and embracing him, said, &quot;My son, you deserve not to be disowned, and I confirm what your mother has told you.  To put an end to your doubts, ask what you will, the gift shall be yours.  I call to witness that dreadful lake, which I never saw, but which we gods swear by in our most solemn engagements.&quot;  Phaeton immediately asked to be permitted for one day to drive the chariot of the sun.  The father repented of his promise; thrice and four times he shook his radiant head in warning.  &quot;I have spoken rashly,&quot; said he; &quot;only this request I would fain deny.  I beg you to withdraw it.  It is not a safe boon, nor one, my Phaeton, suited to your youth and strength. Your lot is mortal, and you ask what is beyond a mortal&#x27;s power. In your ignorance you aspire to do that which not even the gods themselves may do.  None but myself may drive the flaming car of day; not even Jupiter, whose terrible right arm hurls the thunder bolts.  The first part of the way is steep, and such as the horses when fresh in the morning can hardly climb; the middle is high up in the heavens, whence I myself can scarcely, without alarm, look down and behold the earth and sea stretched beneath me.  The last part of the road descends rapidly, and requires most careful driving.  Tethys, who is waiting to receive me, often trembles for me lest I should fall headlong.  Add to all this, the heaven is all the time turning round and carrying the stars with it.  I have to be perpetually on my guard lest that movement, which sweeps everything else along, should hurry me also away.  Suppose I should lend you the chariot, what would you do?  Could you keep your course while the sphere was revolving under you?  Perhaps you think that there are forests and cities, the abodes of gods, and palaces and temples on the way.  On the contrary, the road is through the midst of frightful monsters. You pass by the horns of the Bull, in front of the Archer, and near the Lion&#x27;s jaws, and where the Scorpion stretches its arms in one direction and the Crab in another.  Nor will you find it easy to guide those horses, with their breasts full of fire which they breathe forth from their mouths and nostrils.  I can scarcely govern them myself, when they are unruly and resist the reins.  Beware, my son, lest I should give you a fatal gift; recall your request while yet you may.  Do you ask me for proof that you are sprung from my blood?  I give you a proof in my fears for you.  Look at my face,-- I would that you could look into my breast, you would there see all a father&#x27;s anxiety. Finally,&quot; he continued, &quot;look round the world and choose whatever you will of what earth or sea contains most precious,   ask it and fear no refusal.  This only I pray you not to urge.  It is not honor, but destruction you seek.  Why do you hang round my neck and still entreat me?  You shall have it if you persist, the oath is sworn and must be kept,   but I beg you to choose more wisely.&quot; He ended; but the youth rejected all admonition, and held to his demand.  So, having resisted as long as he could, Phoebus at last led the way to where stood the lofty chariot. It was of gold, the gift of Vulcan; the axle was of gold, the pole and wheels of gold, the spokes of silver.  Along the seat were rows of chrysolites and diamonds, which reflected all around the brightness of the sun.  While the daring youth gazed in admiration, the early Dawn threw open the purple doors of the east, and showed the pathway strewn with roses.  The stars withdrew, marshalled by the Daystar, which last of all retired also.  The father, when he saw the earth beginning to glow, and the Moon preparing to retire, ordered the Hours to harness up the horses.  They obeyed, and led forth from the lofty stalls the steeds full fed with ambrosia, and attached the reins.  Then the father bathed the face of his son with a powerful unguent, and made him capable of enduring the brightness of the flame.  He set the rays on his head, and, with a foreboding sigh, said, &quot;If, my son, you will in this at least heed my advice, spare the whip and hold tight the reins.  They go fast enough of their own accord; the labor is to hold them in.  You are not to take the straight road directly between the five circles, but turn off to the left. Keep within the limit of the middle zone, and avoid the northern and the southern alike.  You will see the marks of the wheels, and they will serve to guide you.  And, that the skies and the earth may each receive their due share of heat, go not too high, or you will burn the heavenly dwellings, nor too low, or you will set the earth on fire; the middle course is safest and best.  And now I leave you to your chance, which I hope will plan better for you than you have done for yourself.  Night is passing out of the western gates and we can delay no longer.  Take the reins; but if at last your heart fails you, and you will benefit by my advice, stay where you are in safety, and suffer me to light and warm the earth.&quot;  The agile youth sprang into the chariot, stood erect and grasped the reins with delight, pouring out thanks to his reluctant parent. Meanwhile the horses fill the air with their snortings and fiery breath, and stamp the ground impatient.  Now the bars are let down, and the boundless plain of the universe lies open before them.  They dart forward and cleave the opposing clouds, and outrun the morning breezes which started from the same eastern goal.  The steeds soon perceived that the load they drew was lighter than usual; and as a ship without ballast is tossed hither and thither on the sea, so the chariot, without its accustomed weight, was dashed about as if empty.  They rush headlong and leave the travelled road.  He is alarmed, and knows not how to guide them; nor, if he knew, has he the power.  Then, for the first time, the Great and Little Bear were scorched with heat, and would fain, if it were possible, have plunged into the water; and the Serpent which lies coiled up round the north pole, torpid and harmless, grew warm, and with warmth felt its rage revive.  Bootes, they say, fled away, though encumbered with his plough, and all unused to rapid motion. When hapless Phaeton looked down upon the earth, now spreading in vast extent beneath him, he grew pale and his knees shook with terror.  In spite of the glare all around him, the sight of his eyes grew dim.  He wished he had never touched his father&#x27;s horses, never learned his parentage, never prevailed in his request.  He is borne along like a vessel that flies before a tempest, when the pilot can do no more and betakes himself to his prayers.  What shall he do?  Much of the heavenly road is left behind, but more remains before.  He turns his eyes from one direction to the other; now to the goal whence he began his course, now to the realms of sunset which he is not destined to reach.  He loses his self-command, and knows not what to do, whether to draw tight the reins or throw them loose; he forgets the names of the horses.  He sees with terror the monstrous forms scattered over the surface of heaven.  Here the Scorpion extended his two great arms, with his tail and crooked claws stretching over two signs of the zodiac.  When the boy beheld him, reeking with poison and menacing with his fangs, his courage failed, and the reins fell from his hands.  The horses, feeling the reins loose on their backs, dashed headlong, and unrestrained went off into unknown regions of the sky, in among the stars, hurling the chariot over pathless places, now up in high heaven, now down almost to the earth.  The moon saw with astonishment her brother&#x27;s chariot running beneath her own.  The clouds begin to smoke, and the mountain tops take fire; the fields are parched with heat, the plants wither, the trees with their leafy branches burn, the harvest is ablaze!  But these are small things.  Great cities perished, with their walls and towers; whole nations with their people were consumed to ashes!  The forest-clad mountains burned, Athos and Taurus and Tmolus and OEte; Ida, once celebrated for fountains, but now all dry; the Muses&#x27; mountain Helicon, and Haemus; AEtna, with fires within and without, and Parnassus, with his two peaks, and Rhodope, forced at last to part with his snowy crown.  Her cold climate was no protection to Scythia, Caucasus burned, and Ossa and Pindus, and, greater than both, Olympus; the Alps high in air, and the Apennines crowned with clouds. Then Phaeton beheld the world on fire, and felt the heat intolerable.  The air he breathed was like the air of a furnace and full of burning ashes, and the smoke was of a pitchy darkness.  He dashed forward he knew not whither.  Then, it is believed, the people of AEthiopia became black by the blood being forced so suddenly to the surface, and the Libyan desert was dried up to the condition in which it remains to this day.  The Nymphs of the fountains, with dishevelled hair, mourned their waters, nor were the rivers safe beneath their banks; Tanais smoked, and Caicus, Xanthus and Meander.  Babylonian Euphrates and Ganges, Tagus with golden sands, and Caijster where the swans resort.  Nile fled away and hid his head in the desert, and there it still remains concealed.  Where he used to discharge his waters through seven mouths into the sea, there seven dry channels alone remained.  The earth cracked open, and through the chinks light broke into Tartarus, and frightened the king of shadows and his queen.  The sea shrank up.  Where before was water, it became a dry plain; and the mountains that lie beneath the waves lifted up their heads and became islands.  The fishes sought the lowest depths, and the dolphins no longer ventured as usual to sport on the surface.  Even Nereus, and his wife Doris, with the Nereids, their daughters, sought the deepest caves for refuge.  Thrice Neptune essayed to raise his head above the surface and thrice was driven back by the heat.  Earth, surrounded as she was by waters, yet with head and shoulders bare, screening her face with her hand, looked up to heaven, and with a husky voice called on Jupiter. &quot;O ruler of the gods, if I have deserved this treatment, and it is your will that I perish with fire, why withhold your thunderbolts?  Let me at least fall by your hand.  Is this the reward of my fertility, of my obedient service?  Is it for this that I have supplied herbage for cattle, and fruits for men, and frankincense for your altars?  But if I am unworthy of regard, what has my brother Ocean done to deserve such a fate?  If neither of us can excite your pity, think, I pray you, of your own heaven, and behold how both the poles are smoking which sustain your palace, which must fall if they be destroyed.  Atlas faints, and scarce holds up his burden.  If sea, earth, and heaven perish, we fall into ancient Chaos.  Save what yet remains to us from the devouring flame.  Oh, take thought for our deliverance in this awful moment!&quot; Thus spoke Earth, and overcome with heat and thirst, could say no more.  Then Jupiter Omnipotent, calling to witness all the gods, including him who had lent the chariot, and showing them that all was lost unless some speedy remedy were applied, mounted the lofty tower from whence he diffuses clouds over the earth, and hurls the forked lightnings.  But at that time not a cloud was to be found to interpose for a screen to earth, nor was a shower remaining unexhausted.  He thundered, and brandishing a lightning-bolt in his right hand launched it against the charioteer, and struck him at the same moment from his seat and from existence!  Phaeton, with his hair on fire, fell headlong, like a shooting star which marks the heavens with its brightness as it falls, and Eridanus, the great river, received him and cooled his burning frame.  The Italian Naiads reared a tomb for him, and inscribed these words upon the stone: &quot;Driver of Phoebus&#x27; chariot, Phaeton, Struck by Jove&#x27;s thunder, rests beneath this stone. He could not rule his father&#x27;s car of fire, Yet was it much so nobly to aspire.&quot; His sisters, the Heliades, as they lamented his fate were turned into poplar trees, on the banks of the river, and their tears, which continued to flow, became amber as they dropped into the stream, One of Prior&#x27;s best remembered poems is that on the Female Phaeton, from which we quote the last verse. Kitty has been imploring her mother to allow her to go out into the world as her friends have done, if only for once. &quot;Fondness prevailed, mamma gave way; Kitty, at heart&#x27;s desire, Obtained the chariot for a day, And set the world on fire.&quot; Milman, in his poem of Samor, makes the following allusion to Phaeton&#x27;s story:-- &quot;As when the palsied universe aghast Lay .... mute and still, When drove, so poets sing, the sun-born youth Devious through Heaven&#x27;s affrighted signs his sire&#x27;s Ill-granted chariot.  Him the Thunderer hurled &gt;From th&#x27;empyrean headlong to the gulf Of the half-parched Eridanus, where weep Even now the sister trees their amber tears O&#x27;er Phaeton untimely dead.&quot; In the beautiful lines of Walter Savage Lando describing the sea- shell, there is an allusion to the sun&#x27;s palace and chariot.  The water-nymph says, &quot;  I have sinuous shells of pearly hue Within, and things that lustre have imbibed In the sun&#x27;s palace porch, where when unyoked His chariot-wheel stands midway in the wave. Shake one and it awakens; then apply Its polished lip to your attentive car, And it remembers its August abodes, And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there.&quot; Gebir, Book 1 Chapter IV Midas. Baucis and Philemon. Pluto and Proserpine. Bacchus, on a certain occasion, found his old school master and foster father, Silenus, missing.  The old man had been drinking, and in that state had wandered away, and was found by some peasants, who carried him to their king, Midas.  Midas recognized him, and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with an unceasing round of jollity.  On the eleventh day he brought Silenus back, and restored him in safety to his pupil.  Whereupon Bacchus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he might wish.  He asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into GOLD.  Bacchus consented, though sorry that he had not made a better choice.  Midas went his way, rejoicing in his newly acquired power, which he hastened to put to the test.  He could scarce believe his eyes when he found that a twig of an oak, which he plucked from the branch, became gold in his hand.  He took up a stone   it changed to gold.  He touched a sod   it did the same.  He took an apple from the tree   you would have thought he had robbed the garden of the Hesperides.  His joy knew no bounds, and as soon as he got home, he ordered the servants to set a splendid repast on the table. Then he found to his dismay that whether he touched bread, it hardened in his hand; or put a morsel to his lips, it defied his teeth.  He took a glass of wine, but it flowed down his throat like melted gold. In consternation at the unprecedented affliction, he strove to divest himself of his power; he hated the gift he had lately coveted.  But all in vain; starvation seemed to await him.  He raised his arms, all shining with gold, in prayer to Bacchus, begging to be delivered from his glittering destruction. Bacchus, merciful deity, heard and consented.  &quot;Go,&quot; said he, &quot;to the river Pactolus, trace the stream to its fountain-head, there plunge in your head and body and wash away your fault and its punishment.&quot;  He did so, and scarce had he touched the waters before the gold-creating power passed into them, and the river sands became changed into GOLD, as they remain to this day. Thenceforth Midas, hating wealth and splendor, dwelt in the country, and became a worshipper of Pan, the god of the fields. On a certain occasion Pan had the temerity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge the god of the lyre to a trial of skill.  The challenge was accepted, and Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen umpire.  Tmolus took his seat and cleared away the trees from his ears to listen.  At a given signal Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present.  Then Tmolus turned his head toward the sun-god, and all his trees turned with him.  Apollo rose, his brow wreathed with Parnassian laurel, while his robe of Tyrian purple swept the ground.  In his left hand he held the lyre, and with his right hand struck the strings.  Ravished with the harmony, Tmolus at once awarded the victory to the god of the lyre, and all but Midas acquiesced in the judgment.  He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.  Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer to wear the human form, but caused them to increase in length, grow hairy, within and without, and to become movable, on their roots; in short, to be on the perfect pattern of those of an ass. Mortified enough was King Midas at this mishap; but he consoled himself with the thought that it was possible to hide his misfortune, which he attempted to do by means of an ample turban or headdress.  But his hairdresser of course knew the secret.  He was charged not to mention it, and threatened with dire punishment if he presumed to disobey.  But he found it too much for his discretion to keep such a secret; so he went out into the meadow, dug a hole in the ground, and stooping down, whispered the story, and covered it up. Before long a thick bed of reeds sprang up in the meadow, and as soon as it had gained its growth, began whispering the story, and has continued to do so, from that day to this, with every breeze which passes over the place. The story of King Midas has been told by others with some variations.  Dryden, in the Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale, makes Midas&#x27; queen the betrayer of the secret. &quot;This Midas knew, and durst communicate To none but to his wife his ears of state.&quot; Midas was king of Phrygia.  He was the son of Gordius, a poor countryman, who was taken by the people and made king, in obedience to the command of the oracle, which had said that their future king should come in a wagon.  While the people were deliberating, Gordius with his wife and son came driving his wagon into the public square. Gordius, being made king, dedicated his wagon to the deity of the oracle, and tied it up in its place with a fast knot.  This was the celebrated GORDIAN KNOT, of which, in after times it was said, that whoever should untie it should become lord of all Asia.  Many tried to untie it, but none succeeded, till Alexander the Great, in his career of conquest, came to Phrygia.  He tried his skill with as ill success as the others, till growing impatient he drew his sword and cut the knot.  When he afterwards succeeded in subjecting all Asia to his sway, people began to think that he had complied with the terms of the oracle according to its true meaning. BAUCIS AND PHILEMON On a certain hill in Phrygia stand a linden tree and an oak, enclosed by a low wall.  Not far from the spot is a marsh, formerly good habitable land, but now indented with pools, the resort of fen-birds and cormorants.  Once on a time, Jupiter, in human shape, visited this country, and with him his son Mercury (he of the caduceus), without his wings.  They presented themselves at many a door as weary travellers, seeking rest and shelter, but found all closed, for it was late, and the inhospitable inhabitants would not rouse themselves to open for their reception.  At last a humble mansion received them, a small thatched cottage, where Baucis, a pious old dame, and her husband Philemon, united when young, had grown old together.  Not ashamed of their poverty, they made it endurable by moderate desires and kind dispositions.  One need not look there for master or for servant; they two were the whole household, master and servant alike.  When the two heavenly guests crossed the humble threshold, and bowed their heads to pass under the low door, the old man placed a seat, on which Baucis, bustling and attentive, spread a cloth, and begged them to sit down.  Then she raked out the coals from the ashes, kindled up a fire, and fed it with leaves and dry bark, and with her scanty breath blew it into a flame.  She brought out of a corner split sticks and dry branches, broke them up, and placed them under the small kettle. Her husband collected some pot-herbs in the garden, and she shred them from the stalks, and prepared them for the pot He reached down with a forked stick a flitch of bacon hanging in the chimney, cut a small piece, and put it in the pot to boil with the herbs, setting away the rest for another time.  A beechen bowl was filled with warm water that their guests might wash. While all was doing they beguiled the time with conversation. On the bench designed for the guests was laid a cushion stuffed with sea-weed; and a cloth, only produced on great occasions, but old and coarse enough, was spread over that.  The old woman, with her apron on, with trembling hand set the table.  One leg was shorter than the rest, but a shell put under restored the level. When fixed, she rubbed the table down with some sweet-smelling herbs.  Upon it she set some olives, Minerva&#x27;s-fruit, some cornel-berries preserved in vinegar, and added radishes and cheese, with eggs lightly cooked in the ashes.  All were served in earthen dishes, and an earthenware pitcher, with wooden cups, stood beside them.  When all was ready, the stew, smoking hot, was set on the table.  Some wine, not of the oldest, was added; and for dessert, apples and wild honey; and over and above all, friendly faces, and simple but hearty welcome. Now while the repast proceeded, the old folks were astonished to see that the wine, as fast as it was poured out, renewed itself in the pitcher, of its own accord.  Struck with terror, Baucis and Philemon recognized their heavenly guests, fell on their knees, and with clasped hands implored forgiveness for their poor entertainment.  There was an old goose, which they kept as the guardian of their humble cottage; and they bethought them to make this a sacrifice in honor of their guests.  But the goose, too nimble for the old folks, eluded their pursuit with the aid of feet and wings, and at last took shelter between the gods themselves.  They forbade it to be slain; and spoke in these words: &quot;We are gods.  This inhospitable village shall pay the penalty of its impiety; you alone shall go free from the chastisement.  Quit your house, and come with us to the top of yonder hill.&quot;  They hastened to obey, and staff in hand, labored up the steep ascent. They had come within an arrow&#x27;s flight of the top, when turning their eyes below, they beheld all the country sunk in a lake, only their own house left standing. While they gazed with wonder at the sight, and lamented the fate of their neighbors, that old house of theirs was changed into a TEMPLE.  Columns took the place of the corner-posts, the thatch grew yellow and appeared a gilded roof, the floors became marble, the doors were enriched with carving and ornaments of gold.  Then spoke Jupiter in benignant accents: &quot;Excellent old man, and woman worthy of such a husband, speak, tell us your wishes; what favor have you to ask of us?&quot;  Philemon took counsel with Baucis a few moments; then declared to the gods their united wish.  &quot;We ask to be priests and guardians of this your temple; and since here we have passed our lives in love and concord, we wish that one and the same hour may take us both from life, that I may not live to see her grave, nor be laid in my own by her.&quot;  Their prayer was granted.  They were the keepers of the temple as long as they lived.  When grown very old, as they stood one day before the steps of the sacred edifice, and were telling the story of the place, Baucis saw Philemon begin to put forth leaves, and old Philemon saw Baucis changing in like manner.  And now a leafy crown had grown over their heads, while exchanging parting words, as long as they could speak.  &quot;Farewell, dear spouse,&quot; they said, together, and at the same moment the bark closed over their mouths.  The Tyanean shepherd long showed the two trees, standing side by side, made out of the two good old people. The story of Baucis and Philemon has been imitated by Swift, in a burlesque style, the actors in the change being two wandering saints and the house being changed into a church, of which Philemon is made the parson The following may serve as a specimen:-- &quot;They scarce had spoke when, fair and soft, The roof began to mount aloft; Aloft rose every beam and rafter; The heavy wall climbed slowly after. The chimney widened and grew higher, Became a steeple with a spire. The kettle to the top was hoist, And there stood fastened to a joist, But with the upside down, to show Its inclination for below; In vain, for a superior force, Applied at bottom, stops its course; Doomed ever in suspense to dwell, &#x27;Tis now no kettle, but a bell. A wooden jack, which had almost Lost by disuse the art to roast, A sudden alteration feels, Increased by new intestine wheels; And, what exalts the wonder more, The number made the motion slower; The flier, though &#x27;t had leaden feet, Turned round so quick you scarce could see &#x27;t: But slackened by some secret power, Now hardly moves an inch an hour. The jack and chimney, near allied, Had never left each other&#x27;s side. The chimney to a steeple grown, The jack would not be left alone; But up against the steeple reared, Became a clock, and still adhered; And still its love to household cares By a shrill voice at noon declares. Warning the cook-maid not to burn That roast meat which it cannot turn. The groaning chair began to crawl, Like a huge snail, along the wall; There stuck aloft in public view, And, with small change, a pulpit grew. A bedstead of the antique mode, Compact of timber many a load, Such as our ancestors did use, Was metamorphosed into pews, Which still their ancient nature keep By lodging folks disposed to sleep.&quot; PROSERPINE Under the island of Aetna lies Typhoeus the Titan, in punishment for his share in the rebellion of the giants against Jupiter. Two mountains press down   the one his right and the other his left hand   while Aetna lies over his head.  As Typhoeus moves, the earth shakes; as he breathes, smoke and ashes come up from Aetna.  Pluto is terrified at the rocking of the earth, and fears that his kingdom will be laid open to the light of day.  He mounts his chariot with the four black horses and comes up to earth and looks around.  While he is thus engaged, Venus, sitting on Mount Eryx playing with her boy Cupid, sees him and says: &quot;My son, take your darts with which you conquer all, even Jove himself, and send one into the breast of yonder dark monarch, who rules the realm of Tartarus.  Why should he alone escape?  Seize the opportunity to extend your empire and mine.  Do you not see that even in heaven some despise our power?  Minerva the wise, and Diana the huntress, defy us; and there is that daughter of Ceres, who threatens to follow their example.  Now do you, if you have any regard for your own interest or mine, join these two in one.&quot;  The boy unbound his quiver, and selected his sharpest and truest arrow; then, straining the bow against his knee, he attached the string, and, having made ready, shot the arrow with its barbed point right into the heart of Pluto. In the vale of Enna there is a lake embowered in woods, which screen it from the fervid rays of the sun, while the moist ground is covered with flowers, and spring reigns perpetual.  Here Proserpine was playing with her companions, gathering lilies and violets, and filling her basket and her apron with them, when Pluto saw her from his chariot, loved her, and carried her off. She screamed for help to her mother and her companions; and when in her fright she dropped the corners of her apron and let the flowers fall, childlike, she felt the loss of them as an addition to her grief.  The ravisher urged on his steeds, calling them each by name, and throwing loose over their heads and necks his iron-colored reins.  When he reached the River Cyane, and it opposed his passage, he struck the river bank with his trident, and the earth opened and gave him a passage to Tartarus. Ceres sought her daughter all the world over.  Bright-haired Aurora, when she came forth in the morning, and Hesperus, when he led out the stars in the evening, found her still busy in the search.  But it was all unavailing.  At length, weary and sad, she sat down upon a stone and continued sitting nine days and nights, in the open air, under the sunlight and moonlight and falling showers.  It was where now stands the city of Eleusis, then the home of an old man named Celeus.  He was out in the field, gathering acorns and blackberries, and sticks for his fire.  His little girl was driving home their two goats, and as she passed the goddess, who appeared in the guise of an old woman, she said to her, &quot;Mother,&quot; and the name was sweet to the ears of Ceres, &quot;why do you sit here alone upon the rocks?&quot;  The old man also stopped, though his load was heavy, and begged her to come into his cottage, such as it was.  She declined, and he urged her.  &quot;Go in peace,&quot; she replied, &quot;and be happy in your daughter; I have lost mine.&quot;  As she spoke, tears   or something like tears, for the gods never weep   fell down her cheeks upon her bosom.  The compassionate old man and his child wept with her.  Then said he, &quot;Come with us, and despise not our humble roof; so may your daughter be restored to you in safety.&quot;  &quot;Lead on,&quot; said she, &quot;I cannot resist that appeal!&quot;  So she rose from the stone and went with them.  As they walked he told her that his only son, a little boy, lay very sick, feverish and sleepless.  She stooped and gathered some poppies.  As they entered the cottage they found all in great distress, for the boy seemed past hope of recovery.  Metanira, his mother, received her kindly, and the goddess stooped and kissed the lips of the sick child.  Instantly the paleness left his face, and healthy vigor returned to his body.  The whole family were delighted   that is, the father, mother, and little girl, for they were all; they had no servants. They spread the table, and put upon it curds and cream, apples, and honey in the comb.  While they ate, Ceres mingled poppy juice in the milk of the boy.  When night came and all was still, she arose, and taking the sleeping boy, moulded his limbs with her hands, and uttered over him three times a solemn charm, then went and laid him in the ashes.  His mother, who had been watching what her guest was doing, sprang forward with a cry and snatched the child from the fire.  Then Ceres assumed her own form, and a divine splendor shone all around. While they were overcome with astonishment, she said, &quot;Mother, you have been cruel in your fondness to your son.  I would have made him immortal, but you have frustrated my attempt. Nevertheless, he shall be great and useful.  He shall teach men the use of the plough, and the rewards which labor can win from the cultivated soil.&quot;  So saying, she wrapped a cloud about her, and mounting her chariot rode away. Ceres continued her search for her daughter, passing from land to land, and across seas and rivers, till at length she returned to Sicily, whence she at first set out, and stood by the banks of the River Cyane, where Pluto made himself a passage with his prize to his own dominions. The river-nymph would have told the goddess all she had witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto; so she only ventured to take up the girdle which Proserpine had dropped in her flight, and waft it to the feet of the mother.  Ceres, seeing this, was no longer in doubt of her loss, but she did not yet know the cause, and laid the blame on the innocent land.  &quot;Ungrateful soil,&quot; said she, &quot;which I have endowed with fertility and clothed with herbage and nourishing grain, No more shall you enjoy my favors&quot; Then the cattle died, the plough broke in the furrow, the seed failed to come up; there was too much sun, there was too much rain; the birds stole the seeds,   thistles and brambles were the only growth.  Seeing this, the fountain Arethusa interceded for the land.  &quot;Goddess,&quot; said she, &quot;blame not the land; it opened unwillingly to yield a passage to your daughter. I can tell you of her fate, for I have seen her.  This is not my native country; I came hither from Elis.  I was a woodland nymph, and delighted in the chase.  They praised my beauty, but I cared nothing for it, and rather boasted of my hunting exploits.  One day I was returning from the wood, heated with exercise, when I came to a stream silently flowing, so clear that you might count the pebbles on the bottom.  The willows shaded it, and the grassy bank sloped down to the water&#x27;s edge.  I approached, I touched the water with my foot.  I stepped in knee-deep, and not content with that, I laid my garments on the willows and went in.  While I sported in the water, I heard an indistinct murmur coming up as out of the depths of the stream; and made haste to escape to the nearest bank.  The voice said, &#x27;Why do you fly, Arethusa?  I am Alpheus, the god of this stream.&#x27;  I ran, he pursued; he was not more swift than I, but he was stronger, and gained upon me, as my strength failed.  At last, exhausted, I cried for help to Diana. &#x27;Help me, goddess!  Help your votary!&#x27;  The goddess heard, and wrapped me suddenly in a thick cloud.  The river-god looked now this way and now that, and twice came close to me, but could not find me.  &#x27;Arethusa!  Arethusa!&#x27; he cried.  Oh, how I trembled, like a lamb that hears the wolf growling outside the fold.  A cold sweat came over me, my hair flowed down in streams; where my foot stood there was a pool.  In short, in less time than it takes to tell it I became a fountain.  But in this form Alpheus knew me, and attempted to mingle his stream with mine.  Diana cleft the ground, and I, endeavoring to escape him, plunged into the cavern, and through the bowels of the earth came out here in Sicily.  While I passed through the lower parts of the earth, I saw your Proserpine.  She was sad, but no longer showing alarm in her countenance.  Her look was such as became a queen,   the queen of Erebus; the powerful bride of the monarch of the realms of the dead.&quot; When Ceres heard this, she stood for a while like one stupefied; then turned her chariot towards heaven, and hastened to present herself before the throne of Jove.  She told the story of her bereavement, and implored Jupiter to interfere to procure the restitution of her daughter.  Jupiter consented on one condition, namely, that Proserpine should not during her stay in the lower world have taken any food; otherwise, the Fates forbade her release.  Accordingly, Mercury was sent, accompanied by Spring, to demand Proserpine of Pluto.  The wily monarch consented; but alas! the maiden had taken a pomegranate which Pluto offered her, and had sucked the sweet pulp from a few of the seeds.  This was enough to prevent her complete release; but a compromise was made, by which she was to pass half the time with her mother, and the rest with her husband Pluto. Ceres allowed herself to be pacified with this arrangement, and restored the earth to her favor.  Now she remembered Celeus and his family, and her promise to his infant son Triptolemus.  When the boy grew up, she taught him the use of the plough, and how to sow the seed.  She took him in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, through all the countries of the earth, imparting to mankind valuable grains, and the knowledge of agriculture.  After his return, Triptolemus build a magnificent temple to Ceres in Eleusis, and established the worship of the goddess, under the name of the Eleusinian mysteries, which, in the splendor and solemnity of their observance, surpassed all other religious celebrations among the Greeks. There can be little doubt but that this story of Ceres and Proserpine is an allegory.  Proserpine signifies the seed-corn, which, when cast into the ground, lies there concealed,   that is, she is carried off by the god of the underworld; it reappears,   that is, Proserpine is restored to her mother. Spring leads her back to the light of day. Milton alludes to the story of Proserpine in Paradise lost, Book IV.: &quot;Not that fair field Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers, Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis (a name for Pluto) Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world, . . . . might with this Paradise Of Eden strive.&quot; Hood, in his Ode to Melancholy, uses the same allusion very beautifully: &quot;Forgive, if somewhile I forget, In woe to come the present bliss; As frightened Proserpine let fall Her flowers at the sight of Dis.&quot; The River Alpheus does in fact disappear under ground, in part of its course, finding its way through subterranean channels, till it again appears on the surface.  It was said that the Sicilian fountain Arethusa was the same stream, which, after passing under the sea, came up again in Sicily.  Hence the story ran that a cup thrown into the Alpheus appeared again in Arethusa.  It is this fable of the underground course of Alpheus that Coleridge alludes to in his poem of Kubla Khan: &quot;In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree, Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man, Down to a sunless sea.&quot; In one of Moore&#x27;s juvenile poems he alludes to the same story, and to the practice of throwing garlands, or other light objects on the stream to be carried downward by it, and afterwards thrown out when the river comes again to light. &quot;Oh, my beloved, how divinely sweet Is the pure joy when kindred spirits meet! Like him the river-god, whose waters flow, With love their only light, through caves below, Wafting in triumph all the flowery braids And festal rings, with which Olympic maids Have decked his current, as an offering meet To lay at Arethusa&#x27;s shining feet. Think, when he meets at last his fountain bride, What perfect love must thrill the blended tide! Each lost in each, till mingling into one, Their lot the same for shadow or for sun, A type of true love, to the deep they run.&quot; The following extract from Moore&#x27;s Rhymes on the Road gives an account of a celebrated picture by Albano at Milan, called a Dance of Loves: &quot;&#x27;Tis for the theft of Enna&#x27;s flower from earth These urchins celebrate their dance of mirth, Round the green tree, like fays upon a heath, Those that are nearest linked in order bright, Cheek after cheek, like rosebuds in a wreath; And those more distant showing from beneath The others&#x27; wings their little eyes of light. While see! Among the clouds, their eldest brother, But just flown up, tells with a smile of bliss, This prank of Pluto to his charmed mother, Who turns to greet the tidings with a kiss.&quot; GLAUCUS AND SCYLLA Glaucus was a fisherman.  One day he had drawn his nets to land, and had taken a great many fishes of various kinds.  So he emptied his net, and proceeded to sort the fishes on the grass. The place where he stood was a beautiful island in the river, a solitary spot, uninhabited, and not used for pasturage of cattle, nor ever visited by any but himself.  On a sudden, the fishes, which had been laid on the grass, began to revive and move their fins as if they were in the water; and while he looked on astonished, they one and all moved off to the water, plunged in and swam away.  He did not know what to make of this, whether some god had done it, or some secret power in the herbage.  &quot;What herb has such a power?&quot; he exclaimed; and gathering some, he tasted it.  Scarce had the juices of the plant reached his palate when he found himself agitated with a longing desire for the water.  He could no longer restrain himself, but bidding farewell to earth, he plunged into the stream.  The gods of the water received him graciously, and admitted him to the honor of their society.  They obtained the consent of Oceanus and Tethys, the sovereigns of the sea, that all that was mortal in him should be washed away.  A hundred rivers poured their waters over him . Then he lost all sense of his former nature and all consciousness.  When he recovered, he found himself changed in form and mind.  His hair was sea-green, and trailed behind him on the water; his shoulders grew broad, and what had been thighs and legs assumed the form of a fish&#x27;s tail.  The sea-gods complimented him on the change of his appearance, and he himself was pleased with his looks. One day Glaucus saw the beautiful maiden Scylla, the favorite of the water-nymphs, rambling on the shore, and when she had found a sheltered nook, laving her limbs in the clear water.  He fell in love with her, and showing himself on the surface, spoke to her, saying such things as he thought most likely to win her to stay; for she turned to run immediately on sight of him and ran till she had gained a cliff overlooking the sea.  Here she stopped and turned round to see whether it was a god or a sea-animal, and observed with wonder his shape and color.  Glaucus, partly emerging from the water, and supporting himself against a rock, said, &quot;Maiden, I am no monster, nor a sea-animal, but a god; and neither Proteus nor Triton ranks higher than I.  Once I was a mortal, and followed the sea for a living; but now I belong wholly to it.&quot;  Then he told the story of his metamorphosis and how he had been promoted to his present dignity, and added, &quot;But what avails all this if it fails to move your heart?&quot;  He was going on in this strain, but Scylla turned and hastened away. Glaucus was in despair, but it occurred to him to consult the enchantress, Circe.  Accordingly he repaired to her island,   the same where afterwards Ulysses landed, as we shall see in another story.  After mutual salutations, he said, &quot;Goddess, I entreat your pity; you alone can relieve the pain I suffer.  The power of herbs I know as well as any one, for it is to them I owe my change of form I love Scylla.  I am ashamed to tell you how I have sued and promised to her, and how scornfully she has treated me.  I beseech you to use your incantations, or potent herbs, if they are more prevailing, not to cure me of my love,   for that I do not wish,   but to make her share it and yield me a like return.&quot;  To which Circe replied, for she was not insensible to the attractions of the sea-green deity, &quot;You had better pursue a willing object; you are worthy to be sought, instead of having to seek in vain.  Be not diffident, know your own worth.  I protest to you that even I, goddess though I be, and learned in the virtues of plants and spells, should not know how to refuse you If she scorns you, scorn her; meet one who is ready to meet you half way, and thus make a due return to both at once.&quot;  To these words Glaucus replied, &quot;Sooner shall trees grow at the bottom of the ocean, and seaweed on the top of the mountains, than I will cease to love Scylla, and her alone.&quot; The goddess was indignant, but she could not punish him, neither did she wish to do so, for she liked him too well; so she turned all her wrath against her rival, poor Scylla.  She took plants of poisonous powers and mixed them together, with incantations and charms.  Then she passed through the crowd of gambolling beasts, the victims of her art, and proceeded to the coast of Sicily, where Scylla lived.  There was a little bay on the shore to which Scylla used to resort, in the heat of the day, to breathe the air of the sea, and to bathe in its waters.  Here the goddess poured her poisonous mixture, and muttered over it incantations of mighty power.  Scylla came as usual and plunged into the water up to her waist.  What was her horror to perceive a brood of serpents and barking monsters surrounding her!  At first she could not imagine they were a part of herself, and tried to run from them, and to drive them away; but as she ran she carried them with her, and when she tried to touch her limbs, she found her hands touch only the yawning jaws of monsters.  Scylla remained rooted to the spot.  Her temper grew as ugly as her form, and she took pleasure in devouring hapless mariners who came within her grasp.  Thus she destroyed six of the companions of Ulysses, and tried to wreck the ships of Aeneas, till at last she was turned into a rock, and as such still continues to be a terror to mariners. The following is Glaucus&#x27;s account of his feelings after his &quot;sea-change:&quot; &quot;I plunged for life or death.  To interknit One&#x27;s senses with so dense a breathing stuff Might seem a work of pain; so not enough Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt, And buoyant round my limbs.  At first I dwelt Whole days and days in sheer astonishment; Forgetful utterly of self-9ntent, Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow. Then like a new-fledged bird that first doth show His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill, I tried in fear the pinions of my well. &quot;Twas freedom!  And at once I visited The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.&quot; Keats. Chapter V Pygmalion.   Dryope.   Venus and Adonis.   Apollo and Hyacinthus.   Ceyx and Halcyone. Pygmalion saw so much to blame in women that he came at last to abhor the sex, and resolved to live unmarried.  He was a sculptor, and had made with wonderful skill a statue of ivory, so beautiful that no living woman could be compared to it in beauty. It was indeed the perfect semblance of a maiden that seemed to be alive, and only prevented from moving by modesty.  His art was so perfect that it concealed itself, and its product looked like the workmanship of nature.  Pygmalion admired his own work, and at last fell in love with the counterfeit creation.  Oftentimes he laid his hand upon it, as if to assure himself whether it were living or not, and could not even then believe that it was only ivory.  He caressed it, and gave it presents such as young girls love,   bright shells and polished stones, little birds and flowers of various hues, beads and amber.  He put raiment on its limbs, and jewels on its fingers, and a necklace about its neck. To the ears he hung earrings and strings of pearls upon the breast.  Her dress became her, and she looked not less charming than when unattired.  He laid her on a couch spread with cloths of Tyrian dye, and called her his wife, and put her head upon a pillow of the softest feathers, as if she could enjoy their softness. The festival of Venus was at hand,   a festival celebrated with great pomp at Cyprus.  Victims were offered, the altars smoked, and the odor of incense filled the air.  When Pygmalion had performed his part in the solemnities, he stood before the altar and timidly said, &quot;Ye gods, who can do all things, give me, I pray you, for my wife&quot;   he dared not say &quot;my ivory virgin,&quot; but said instead   &quot;one like my ivory virgin.&quot;  Venus, who was present at the festival, heard him and knew the thought he would have uttered; and, as an omen of her favor, caused the flame on the altar to shoot up thrice in a fiery point into the air.  When he returned home, he went to see his statue, and, leaning over the couch, gave a kiss to the mouth.  It seemed to be warm.  He pressed its lips again, he laid his hand upon the limbs; the ivory felt soft to his touch, and yielded to his fingers like the wax of Hymettus.  While he stands astonished and glad, though doubting, and fears he may be mistaken, again and again with a lover&#x27;s ardor he touches the object of his hopes.  It was indeed alive!  The veins when pressed yielded to the finger and then resumed their roundness.  Then at last the votary of Venus found words to thank the goddess, and pressed his lips upon lips as real as his own.  The virgin felt the kisses and blushed, and, opening her timid eyes to the light, fixed them at the same moment on her lover.  Venus blessed the nuptials she had formed, and from this union Paphos was born, from whom the city, sacred to Venus, received its name. Schiller, in his poem, the Ideals, applies this tale of Pygmalion to the love of nature in a youthful heart.  In Schiller&#x27;s version, as in William Morris&#x27;s, the statue is of marble. &quot;As once with prayers in passion flowing, Pygmalion embraced the stone, Till from the frozen marble glowing, The light of feeling o&#x27;er him shone, So did I clasp with young devotion Bright Nature to a poet&#x27;s heart; Till breath and warmth and vital motion Seemed through the statue form to dart. &quot;And then in all my ardor sharing, The silent form expression found; Returned my kiss of youthful daring, And understood my heart&#x27;s quick sound. Then lived for me the bright creation. The silver rill with song was rife; The trees, the roses shared sensation, An echo of my boundless life.&quot; Rev. A. G. Bulfinch (brother of the author). Morris tells the story of Pygmalion and the Image in some of the most beautiful verses of the Earthly Paradise. This is Galatea&#x27;s description of her metamorphosis: &quot;&#x27;My sweet,&#x27; she said, &#x27;as yet I am not wise, Or stored with words aright the tale to tell, But listen: when I opened first mine eyes I stood within the niche thou knowest well, And from my hand a heavy thing there fell Carved like these flowers, nor could I see things clear, But with a strange confused noise could hear. &quot;&#x27;At last mine eyes could see a woman fair, But awful as this round white moon o&#x27;erhead, So that I trembled when I saw her there, For with my life was born some touch of dread, And therewithal I heard her voice that said, &quot;Come down and learn to love and be alive, For thee, a well-prized gift, today I give.&quot;&#x27;&quot; DRYOPE Dryope and Iole were sisters.  The former was the wife of Andraemon, beloved by her husband, and happy in the birth of her first child.  One day the sisters strolled to the bank of a stream that sloped gradually down to the water&#x27;s edge, while the upland was overgrown with myrtles.  They were intending to gather flowers for forming garlands for the altars of the nymphs, and Dryope carried her child at her bosom, a precious burden, and nursed him as she walked.  Near the water grew a lotus plant, full of purple flowers.  Dryope gathered some and offered them to the baby, and Iole was about to do the same, when she perceived blood dropping from the places where her sister had broken them off the stem.  The plant was no other than the Nymph Lotis, who, running from a base pursuer, had been changed into this form. This they learned from the country people when it was too late. Dryope, horror-struck when she perceived what she had done, would gladly have hastened from the spot, but found her feet rooted to the ground.  She tried to pull them away, but moved nothing but her arms.  The woodiness crept upward, and by degrees invested her body.  In anguish she attempted to tear her hair, but found her hands filled with leaves.  The infant felt his mother&#x27;s bosom begin to harden, and the milk cease to flow.  Iole looked on at the sad fate of her sister, and could render no assistance.  She embraced the growing trunk, as if she would hold back the advancing wood, and would gladly have been enveloped in the same bark.  At this moment Andraemon, the husband of Dryope, with her father, approached; and when they asked for Dryope, Iole pointed them to the new-formed lotus.  They embraced the trunk of the yet warm tree, and showered their kisses on its leaves. Now there was nothing left of Dryope but her face.  Her tears still flowed and fell on her leaves, and while she could she spoke.  &quot;I am not guilty.  I deserve not this fate.  I have injured no one.  If I speak falsely, may my foliage perish with drought and my trunk be cut down and burned.  Take this infant and give him to a nurse.  Let him often be brought and nursed under my branches, and play in my shade; and when he is old enough to talk, let him be taught to call me mother, and to say with sadness, &#x27;My mother lies hid under this bark&#x27; But bid him be careful of river banks, and beware how he plucks flowers, remembering that every bush he sees may be a goddess in disguise. Farewell, dear husband, and sister, and father.  If you retain any love for me, let not the axe wound me, nor the flocks bite and tear my branches.  Since I cannot stoop to you, climb up hither and kiss me; and while my lips continue to feel, lift up my child that I may kiss him.  I can speak no more, for already the bark advances up my neck, and will soon shoot over me.  You need not close my eyes; the bark will close them without your aid.&quot;  Then the lips ceased to move, and life was extinct; but the branches retained, for some time longer the vital heat. Keats, in Endymion, alludes to Dryope thus: &quot;She took a lute from which there pulsing came A lively prelude, fashioning the way In which her voice should wander.  &#x27;Twas a lay More subtle-cadenced, more forest-wild Than Dryope&#x27;s lone lulling of her child.&quot; VENUS AND ADONIS Venus, playing one day with her boy Cupid, wounded her bosom with one of his arrows.  She pushed him away, but the wound was deeper than she thought.  Before it healed she beheld Adonis, and was captivated with him.  She no longer took any interest in her favorite resorts,   Paphos, and Cnidos, and Amathos, rich in metals.  She absented herself even from Olympus, for Adonis was dearer to her than heaven.  Him she followed and bore him company.  She who used to love to recline in the shade, with no care but to cultivate her charms, now rambled through the woods and over the hills, dressed like the huntress Diana.  She called her dogs, and chased hares and stags, or other game that it is safe to hunt, but kept clear of the wolves and bears, reeking with the slaughter of the herd.  She charged Adonis, too, to beware of such dangerous animals.  &quot;Be brave towards the timid,&quot; said she; &quot;courage against the courageous is not safe.  Beware how you expose yourself to danger, and put my happiness to risk. Attack not the beasts that Nature has armed with weapons.  I do not value your glory so highly as to consent to purchase it by such exposure.  Your youth, and the beauty that charms Venus, will not touch the hearts of lions and bristly boars.  Think of their terrible claws and prodigious strength!  I hate the whole race of them.  Do you ask why?&quot;  Then she told him the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes, who were changed into lions for their ingratitude to her. Having given him this warning, she mounted her chariot drawn by swans, and drove away through the air.  But Adonis was too noble to heed such counsels.  The dogs had roused a wild boar from his lair, and the youth threw his spear and wounded the animal with a sidelong stroke.  The beast drew out the weapon with his jaws, and rushed after Adonis, who turned and ran; but the boar overtook him, and buried his tusks in his side, and stretched him dying upon the plain. Venus, in her swan-drawn chariot, had not yet reached Cyprus, when she heard coming up through mid air the groans of her beloved, and turned her white-winged coursers back to earth.  As she drew near and saw from on high his lifeless body bathed in blood, she alighted, and bending over it beat her breast and tore her hair.  Reproaching the Fates, she said, &quot;Yet theirs shall be but a partial triumph; memorials of my grief shall endure, and the spectacle of your death, my Adonis, and of my lamentation shall be annually renewed.  Your blood shall be changed into a flower; that consolation none can envy me.&quot;  Thus speaking, she sprinkled nectar on the blood; and as they mingled, bubbles rose as in a pool on which raindrops fall, and in an hour&#x27;s time there sprang up a flower of bloody hue like that of a pomegranate.  But it is short-lived.  It is said the wind blows the blossoms open, and afterwards blows the petals away; so it is called Anemone, or wind Flower, from the cause which assists equally in its production and its decay. Milton alludes to the story of Venus and Adonis in his Comus: &quot;Beds of hyacinth and roses Where young Adonis oft reposes, Waxing well of his deep wound In slumber soft, and on the ground Sadly sits th&#x27;Assyrian queen.&quot; And Morris also in Atalanta&#x27;s Race: &quot;There by his horn the Dryads well might know His thrust against the bear&#x27;s heart had been true, And there Adonis bane his javelin slew&quot; APOLLO AND HYACINTHUS Apollo was passionately fond of a youth named Hyacinthus.  He accompanied him in his sports, carried the nets when he went fishing, led the dogs when he went to hunt, followed him in his excursions in the mountains, and neglected for him his lyre and his arrows.  One day they played a game of quoits together, and Apollo, heaving aloft the discus, with strength mingled with skill, sent it high and far.  Hyacinthus watched it as it flew, and excited with the sport ran forward to seize it, eager to make his throw, when the quoit bounded from the earth and struck him in the forehead.  He fainted and fell.  The god, as pale as himself, raised him and tried all his art to stanch the wound and retain the flitting life, but all in vain; the hurt was past the power of medicine.  As, when one has broken the stem of a lily in the garden, it hangs its head and turns its flowers to the earth, so the head of the dying boy, as if too heavy for his neck, fell over on his shoulder.  &quot;Thou diest, Hyacinth,&quot; so spoke Phoebus, &quot;robbed of thy youth by me.  Thine is the suffering, mine the crime.  Would that I could die for thee!  But since that may not be thou shalt live with me in memory and in song.  My lyre shall celebrate thee, my song shall tell thy fate, and thou shalt become a flower inscribed with my regrets.&quot;  While Apollo spoke, behold the blood which had flowed on the ground and stained the herbage, ceased to be blood; but a flower of hue more beautiful than the Tyrian sprang up, resembling the lily, if it were not that this is purple and that silvery white (it is evidently not our modern hyacinth that is here described.  It is perhaps some species of iris, or perhaps of larkspur, or of pansy.)  And this was not enough for Phoebus; but to confer still grater honor, he marked the petals with his sorrow, and inscribed &quot;Ah!  Ah!&quot; upon them, as we see to this day.  The flower bears the name of Hyacinthus, and with every returning spring revives the memory of his fate. It was said that Zephyrus (the West-wind), who was also fond of Hyacinthus and jealous of his preference of Apollo, blew the quoit out of its course to make it strike Hyacinthus.  Keats alludes to this in his Endymion, where he describes the lookers- on at the game of quoits: &quot;Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent On either side, pitying the sad death Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath Of Zephyr slew him; Zephyr penitent, Who now ere Phoebus mounts the firmament, Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.&quot; An allusion to Hyacinthus will also be recognized in Milton&#x27;s Lycidas: &quot;Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.&quot; CEYX AND HALCYONE: OR, THE HALCYON BIRDS Ceyx was King of Thessaly, where he reigned in peace without violence or wrong.  He was son of Hesperus, the Day-star, and the glow of his beauty reminded one of his father.  Halcyone, the daughter of Aeolus, was his wife, and devotedly attached to him. Now Ceyx was in deep affliction for the loss of his brother, and direful prodigies following his brother&#x27;s death made him feel as if the gods were hostile to him.  He thought best therefore to make a voyage to Claros in Ionia, to consult the oracle of Apollo.  But as soon as he disclosed his intention to his wife Halcyone, a shudder ran through her frame, and her face grew deadly pale.  &quot;What fault of mine, dearest husband, has turned your affection from me?  Where is that love of me that used to be uppermost in your thoughts?  Have you learned to feel easy in the absence of Halcyone?  Would you rather have me away?&quot;  She also endeavored to discourage him, by describing the violence of the winds, which she had known familiarly when she lived at home in her father&#x27;s house, Aeolus being the god of the winds, and having as much as he could do to restrain them.  &quot;They rush together,&quot; said she, &quot;with such fury that fire flashes from the conflict. But if you must go,&quot; she added, &quot;dear husband, let me go with you, Otherwise I shall suffer, not only the real evils which you must encounter, but those also which my fears suggest.&quot; These words weighed heavily on the mind of king Ceyx, and it was no less his own wish than hers to take her with him, but he could not bear to expose her to the dangers of the sea.  He answered, therefore, consoling her as well as he could, and finished with these words: &quot;I promise, by the rays of my father the Day-star, that if fate permits I will return before the moon shall have twice rounded her orb.&quot;  When he had thus spoken he ordered the vessel to be drawn out of the ship-house, and the oars and sails to be put aboard.  When Halcyone saw these preparations she shuddered, as if with a presentiment of evil.  With tears and sobs she said farewell, and then fell senseless to the ground. Ceyx would still have lingered, but now the young men grasped their oars and pulled vigorously through the waves, with long and measured strokes.  Halcyone raised her streaming eyes, and saw her husband standing on the deck, waving his hand to her.  She answered his signal till the vessel had receded so far that she could no longer distinguish his form from the rest.  When the vessel itself could no more be seen, she strained her eyes to catch the last glimmer of the sail, till that too disappeared. Then, retiring to her chamber, she threw herself on her solitary couch. Meanwhile they glide out of the harbor, and the breeze plays among the ropes.  The seamen draw in their oars, and hoist their sails.  When half or less of their course was passed, as night drew on, the sea began to whiten with swelling waves, and the east wind to blow a gale.  The master gives the word to take in sail, but the storm forbids obedience, for such is the roar of the winds and waves that his orders are unheard.  The men, of their own accord, busy themselves to secure the oars, to strengthen the ship, to reef the sail.  While they thus do what to each one seems best, the storm increases.  The shouting of the men, the rattling of the shrouds, and the dashing of the waves, mingle with the roar of the thunder.  The swelling sea seems lifted up to the heavens, to scatter its foam among the clouds; then sinking away to the bottom assumes the color of the shoal, a Stygian blackness. The vessel obeys all these changes.  It seems like a wild beast that rushes on the spears of the hunters.  Rain falls in torrents, as if the skies were coming down to unite with the sea. When the lightning ceases for a moment, the night seems to add its own darkness to that of the storm; then comes the flash, rending the darkness asunder, and lighting up all with a glare. Skill fails, courage sinks, and death seems to come on every wave.  The men are stupefied with terror.  The thought of parents, and kindred, and pledges left at home, comes over their minds.  Ceyx thinks of Halcyone.  No name but hers is on his lips, and while he yearns for her, he yet rejoices in her absence.  Presently the mast is shattered by a stroke of lightning, the rudder broken, and the triumphant surge curling over looks down upon the wreck, then falls, and crushes it to fragments.  Some of the seamen, stunned by the stroke, sink, and rise no more; others cling to fragments of the wreck.  Ceyx, with the hand that used to grasp the sceptre, holds fast to a plank, calling for help,   alas, in vain,   upon his father and his father-in-law.  But oftenest on his lips was the name of Halcyone.  His thoughts cling to her.  He prays that the waves may bear his body to her sight, and that it may receive burial at her hands.  At length the waters overwhelm him, and he sinks. The Day-star looked dim that night.  Since it could not leave the heavens, it shrouded its face with clouds. In the mean while Halcyone, ignorant of all these horrors, counted the days till her husband&#x27;s promised return.  Now she gets ready the garments which he shall put on, and now what she shall wear when he arrives.  To all the gods she offers frequent incense but more than all to Juno.  For her husband, who was no more, she prayed incessantly; that he might be safe; that he might come home; that he might not, in his absence, see any one that he would love better than her.  But of all these prayers, the last was the only one destined to be granted.  The goddess, at length, could not bear any longer to be pleaded with for one already dead, and to have hands raised to her altars, that ought rather to be offering funeral rites.  So, calling Iris, she said, &quot;Iris, my faithful messenger, go to the drowsy dwelling of Somnus, and tell him to send a vision to Halcyone, in the form of Ceyx, to make known to her the event.&quot; Iris puts on her robe of many colors, and tingeing the sky with her bow, seeks the palace of the King of Sleep. Near the Cimmerian country, a mountain cave is the abode of the dull god, Somnus,  Here Phoebus dares not come, either rising, or at midday, or setting.  Clouds and shadows are exhaled from the ground, and the light glimmers faintly.  The bird of dawn, with crested head, never calls aloud there to Aurora, nor watchful dog, nor more sagacious goose disturbs the silence.  (This comparison of the dog and the goose is a reference by Ovid to a passage in Roman history.)  No wild beast, nor cattle, nor branch moved with the wind, nor sound of human conversation, breaks the stillness.  Silence reigns there; and from the bottom of the rock the River Lethe flows, and by its murmur invites to sleep. Poppies grow abundantly before the door of the cave, and other herbs, from whose juices Night collects slumbers, which she scatters over the darkened earth.  There is no gate to the mansion, to creak on its hinges, nor any watchman; but in the midst, a couch of black ebony, adorned with black plumes and black curtains.  There the god reclines, his limbs relaxed with sleep.  Around him lie dreams, resembling all various forms, as many as the harvest bears stalks, or the forest leaves, or the seashore grains of sand. As soon as the goddess entered and brushed away the dreams that hovered around her, her brightness lit up all the cave.  The god, scarce opening his eyes, and ever and anon dropping his beard upon his breast, at last shook himself free from himself, and leaning on his arm, inquired her errand,   for he knew who she was.  She answered, &quot;Somnus, gentlest of the gods, tranquillizer of minds and soother of careworn hearts, Juno sends you her commands that you dispatch a dream to Halcyone, in the city of Trachinae, representing her lost husband and all the events of the wreck.&quot; Having delivered her message, Iris hasted away, for she could not longer endure the stagnant air, and as she felt drowsiness creeping over her, she made her escape, and returned by her bow the way she came.  Then Somnus called one of his numerous sons, Morpheus,   the most expert at counterfeiting forms, and in imitating the walk, the countenance, and mode of speaking, even the clothes and attitudes most characteristic of each.  But he only imitates men, leaving it to another to personate birds, beasts, and serpents.  Him they call Icelos; and Phantasos is a third, who turns himself into rocks, waters, woods, and other things without life.  These wait upon kings and great personages in their sleeping hours, while others move among the common people.  Somnus chose, from all the brothers, Morpheus, to perform the command of Iris; then laid his head on his pillow and yielded himself to grateful repose. Morpheus flew, making no noise with his wings, and soon came to the Haemonian city, where, laying aside his wings, he assumed the form of Ceyx.  Under that form, but pale like a dead man, naked, he stood before the couch of the wretched wife.  His beard seemed soaked with water, and water trickled from his drowned locks. Leaning over the bed, tears streaming from his eyes, he said, &quot;Do you recognize your Ceyx, unhappy wife, or has death too much changed my visage?  Behold me, know me, your husband&#x27;s shade, instead of himself.  Your prayers, Halcyone, availed me nothing. I am dead.  No more deceive yourself with vain hopes of my return.  The stormy winds sunk my ship in the Aegean Sea; waves filled my mouth while it called aloud on you.  No uncertain messenger tells you this, no vague rumor brings it to your ears. I come in person, a shipwrecked man, to tell you my fate.  Arise! Give me tears, give me lamentations, let me not go down to Tartarus unwept.&quot;  To these words Morpheus added the voice which seemed to be that of her husband; he seemed to pour forth genuine tears; his hands had the gestures of Ceyx. Halcyone, weeping, groaned, and stretched out her arms in her sleep, striving to embrace his body, but grasping only the air. &quot;Stay!&quot; she cried; &quot;whither do you fly?  Let us go together.&quot; Her own voice awakened her.  Starting up, she gazed eagerly around, to see if he was still present, for the servants, alarmed by her cries, had brought a light.  When she found him not, she smote her breast and rent her garments.  She cares not to unbind her hair, but tears it wildly.  Her nurse asks what is the cause of her grief.  &quot;Halcyone is no more,&quot; she answers; &quot;she perished with her Ceyx.  Utter not words of comfort, he is shipwrecked and dead.  I have seen him.  I have recognized him.  I stretched out my hands to seize him and detain him.  His shade vanished, but it was the true shade of my husband.  Not with the accustomed features, not with the beauty that was his, but pale, naked, and with his hair wet with sea-water, he appeared to wretched me. Here, in this very spot, the sad vision stood,&quot;   and she looked to find the mark of his footsteps.  &quot;This it was, this that my presaging mind foreboded, when I implored him not to leave me to trust himself to the waves.  O, how I wish, since thou wouldst go, that thou hadst taken me with thee!  It would have been far better.  Then I should have had no remnant of life to spend without thee, nor a separate death to die.  If I could bear to live and struggle to endure, I should be more cruel to myself than the sea has been to me.  But I will not struggle.  I will not be separated from thee, unhappy husband.  This time, at least I will keep thee company.  In death, if one tomb may not include us, one epitaph shall; if I may not lay my ashes with thine, my name, at least, shall not be separated.&quot;  Her grief forbade more words, and these were broken with tears and sobs. It was now morning.  She went to the sea-shore, and sought the spot where she last saw him, on his departure.  &quot;Here he lingered and cast off his tacklings and gave me his last kiss.&quot;  While she reviews every moment, and strives to recall every incident, looking out over the sea, she descries an indistinct object floating in the water.  At first she was in doubt what it was, but by degrees the waves bore it nearer, and it was plainly the body of a man.  Though unknowing of whom, yet, as it was of some shipwrecked one, she was deeply moved, and gave it her tears, saying, &quot;Alas!  Unhappy one, and unhappy, if such there be, thy wife!&quot;  Borne by the waves, it came nearer.  As she more and more nearly views it, she trembles more and more.  Now, now it approaches the shore.  Now marks that she recognizes appear.  It is her husband!  Stretching out her trembling hands towards it, she exclaims, &quot;O, dearest husband, is it thus you return to me?&quot; There was built out from the shore a mole, constructed to break the assaults of the sea, and stem its violent ingress.  She leaped upon this barrier and (it was wonderful she could do so) she flew, and striking the air with wings produced on the instant, skimmed along the surface of the water, an unhappy bird. As she flew, her throat poured forth sounds full of grief, and like the voice of one lamenting.  When she touched the mute and bloodless body, she enfolded its beloved limbs with her new- formed wings, and tried to give kisses with her horny beak. Whether Ceyx felt it, or whether it was only the action of the waves, those who looked on doubted, but the body seemed to raise its head.  But indeed he did feel it, and by the pitying gods both of them were changed into birds.  They mate and have their young ones.  For seven placid days, in winter time, Halcyone broods over her nest, which floats upon the sea.  Then the way is safe to seamen.  Aeolus guards the winds, and keeps them from disturbing the deep.  The sea is given up, for the time, to his grandchildren. The following lines from Byron&#x27;s Bride of Abydos might seem borrowed from the concluding part of this description, if it were not stated that the author derived the suggestion from observing the motion of a floating corpse. &quot;As shaken on his restless pillow, His head heaves with the heaving billow; That hand, whose motion is not life, Yet feebly seems to menace strife, Flung by the tossing tide on high,. Then levelled with the wave  &quot; Milton, in his Hymn for the Nativity, thus alludes to the fable of the Halcyon: &quot;But peaceful was the night Wherein the Prince of light His reign of peace upon the earth began; The winds with wonder whist, Smoothly the waters kist, Whispering new joys to the mild ocean Who now hath quite forgot to rave While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.&quot; Keats, also, in Endymion, says: &quot;O magic sleep!  O comfortable bird That broodest o&#x27;er the troubled sea of the mind Till it is hushed and smooth.&quot; Chapter VI Vertumnus and Pomona.   Cupid and Psyche The Hamadryads were Wood-nymphs.  Among them was Pomona, and no one excelled her in love of the garden and the culture of fruit. She cared not for forests and rivers, but loved the cultivated country and trees that bear delicious apples.  Her right hand bore for its weapon not a javelin, but a pruning knife.  Armed with this, she worked at one time, to repress the too luxuriant growths, and curtail the branches that straggled out of place; at another, to split the twig and insert therein a graft, making the branch adopt a nursling not its own.  She took care, too, that her favorites should not suffer from drought, and led streams of water by them that the thirsty roots might drink.  This occupation was her pursuit, her passion; and she was free from that which Venus inspires.  She was not without fear of the country people, and kept her orchard locked, and allowed not men to enter.  The Fauns and Satyrs would have given all they possessed to win her, and so would old Sylvanus, who looks young for his years, and Pan, who wears a garland of pine leaves around his head.  But Vertumnus loved her best of all; yet he sped no better than the rest.  Oh, how often, in the disguise of a reaper, did he bring her corn in a basket, and looked the very image of a reaper!  With a hay-band tied round him, one would think he had just come from turning over the grass.  Sometimes he would have an ox-goad in his hand, and you would have said he had just unyoked his weary oxen.  Now he bore a pruning-hook, and personated a vine-dresser; and again with a ladder on his shoulder, he seemed as if he was going to gather apples. Sometimes he trudged along as a discharged soldier, and again he bore a fishing-rod as if going to fish.  In this way, he gained admission to her, again and again, and fed his passion with the sight of her. One day he came in the guise of an old woman, her gray hair surmounted with a cap, and a staff in her hand.  She entered the garden and admired the fruit.  &quot;It does you credit, my dear,&quot; she said, and kissed Pomona, not exactly with an old woman&#x27;s kiss. She sat down on a bank, and looked up at the branches laden with fruit which hung over her.  Opposite was an elm entwined with a vine loaded with swelling grapes.  She praised the tree and its associated vine, equally.  &quot;But,&quot; said Vertumnus, &quot;if the tree stood alone, and had no vine clinging to it, it would lie prostrate on the ground.  Why will you not take a lesson from the tree and the vine, and consent to unite yourself with some one? I wish you would.  Helen herself had not more numerous suitors, nor Penelope, the wife of shrewd Ulysses.  Even while you spurn them, they court you  rural deities and others of every kind that frequent these mountains.  But if you are prudent and want to make a good alliance, and will let an old woman advise you,   who loves you better than you have any idea of,   dismiss all the rest and accept Vertumnus, on my recommendation.  I know him as well as he knows himself.  He is not a wandering deity, but belongs to these mountains.  Nor is he like too many of the lovers nowadays, who love any one they happen to see; he loves you, and you only.  Add to this, he is young and handsome, and has the art of assuming any shape he pleases, and can make himself just what you command him.  Moreover, he loves the same things that you do, delights in gardening, and handles your apples with admiration.  But NOW he cares nothing for fruits, nor flowers, nor anything else, but only yourself.  Take pity on him, and fancy him speaking now with my mouth.  Remember that the gods punish cruelty, and that Venus hates a hard heart, and will visit such offenses sooner or later.  To prove this, let me tell you a story, which is well known in Cyprus to be a fact; and I hope it will have the effect to make you more merciful. &quot;Iphis was a young man of humble parentage, who saw and loved Anaxarete, a noble lady of the ancient family of Teucer.  He struggled long with his passion, but when he found he could not subdue it, he came a suppliant to her mansion.  First he told his passion to her nurse, and begged her as she loved her foster- child to favor his suit.  And then he tried to win her domestics to his side.  Sometimes he committed his vows to written tablets, and often hung at her door garlands which he had moistened with his tears.  He stretched himself on her threshold, and uttered his complaints to the cruel bolts and bars.  She was deafer than the surges which rise in the November gale; harder than steel from the German forges, or a rock that still clings to its native cliff.  She mocked and laughed at him, adding cruel words to her ungentle treatment, and gave not the slightest gleam of hope. &quot;Iphis could not any longer endure the torments of hopeless love, and standing before her doors, he spake these last words: &#x27;Anaxarete, you have conquered, and shall no longer have to bear my importunities.  Enjoy your triumph!  Sing songs of joy, and bind your forehead with laurel,   you have conquered!  I die; stony heart, rejoice!  This at least I can do to gratify you, and force you to praise me; and thus shall I prove that the love of you left me but with life.  Nor will I leave it to rumor to tell you of my death.  I will come myself, and you shall see me die, and feast your eyes on the spectacle.  Yet, Oh, ye gods, who look down on mortal woes, observe my fate!  I ask but this!  Let me be remembered in coming ages, and add those years to my name which you have reft from my life.&#x27;  Thus he said, and, turning his pale face and weeping eyes towards her mansion, he fastened a rope to the gate-post, on which he had hung garlands, and putting his head into the noose, he murmured, &#x27;This garland at least will please you, cruel girl!&#x27;  And falling, hung suspended with his neck broken.  As he fell he struck against the gate, and the sound was as the sound of a groan.  The servants opened the door and found him dead, and with exclamations of pity raised him and carried him home to his mother, for his father was not living. She received the dead body of her son, and folded the cold form to her bosom; while she poured forth the sad words which bereaved mothers utter.  The mournful funeral passed through the town, and the pale corpse was borne on a bier to the place of the funeral pile.  By chance the home of Anaxarete was on the street where the procession passed, and the lamentations of the mourners met the ears of her whom the avenging deity had already marked for punishment. &quot;&#x27;Let us see this sad procession,&#x27; said she, and mounted to a turret, whence through an open window she looked upon the funeral.  Scarce had her eyes rested upon the form of Iphis stretched on the bier, when they began to stiffen, and the warm blood in her body to become cold.  Endeavoring to step back, she found she could not move her feet; trying to turn away her face, she tried in vain; and by degrees all her limbs became stony like her heart.  That you may not doubt the fact, the statue still remains, and stands in the temple of Venus at Salamis, in the exact form of the lady.  Now think of these things, my dear, and lay aside your scorn and your delays, and accept a lover.  So may neither the vernal frosts blight your young fruits, nor furious winds scatter your blossoms!&quot; When Vertumnus had spoken thus, he dropped the disguise of an old woman, and stood before her in his proper person, as a comely youth.  It appeared to her like the sun bursting through a cloud. He would have renewed his entreaties, but there was no need; his arguments and the sight of his true form prevailed, and the Nymph no longer resisted, but owned a mutual flame. Pomona was the especial patroness of the apple-orchard, and as such she was invoked by Phillips, the author of a poem on Cider, in blank verse, in the following lines: &quot;What soil the apple loves, what care is due To orchats, timeliest when to press the fruits, Thy gift, Pomona, in Miltonian verse Adventurous I presume to sing.&quot; Thomson, in the Seasons, alludes to Phillips: &quot;Phillips, Pomona&#x27;s bard, the second thou Who nobly durst, in rhyme-unfettered verse, With British freedom, sing the British song.&quot; It will be seen that Thomson refers to the poet&#x27;s reference to Milton, but it is not true that Phillips is only the second writer of English blank verse.  Many other poets beside Milton had used it long before Phillips&#x27; time. But Pomona was also regarded as presiding over other fruits, and, as such, is invoked by Thomson: &quot;Bear me, Pomona, to thy citron groves, To where the lemon and the piercing lime, With the deep orange, glowing through the green, Their lighter glories blend.  Lay me reclined Beneath the spreading tamarind, that shakes, Fanned by the breeze, its fever-cooling fruit.&quot; CUPID AND PSYCHE A certain king had three daughters.  (This seems to be one of the latest fables of the Greek mythology.  It has not been found earlier than the close of the second century of the Christian era.  It bears marks of the higher religious notions of that time.)  The two elder were charming girls, but the beauty of the youngest was so wonderful that language is too poor to express its due praise.  The fame of her beauty was so great that strangers from neighboring countries came in crowds to enjoy the sight, and looked on her with amazement, paying her that homage which is due only to Venus herself.  In fact, Venus found her altars deserted, while men turned their devotion to this young virgin.  As she passed along, the people sang her praises, and strewed her way with chaplets and flowers. This perversion to a mortal of the homage due only to the immortal powers gave great offence to the real Venus.  Shaking her ambrosial locks with indignation, she exclaimed, &quot;Am I then to be eclipsed in my honors by a mortal girl?  In vain then did that royal shepherd, whose judgment was approved by Jove himself, give me the palm of beauty over my illustrious rivals, Pallas and June.  But she shall not so quietly usurp my honors.  I will give her cause to repent of so unlawful a beauty.&quot; Thereupon she calls her winged son Cupid, mischievous enough in his own nature, and rouses and provokes him yet more by her complaints.  She points out Psyche to him, and says, &quot;My dear son, punish that contumacious beauty; give thy mother a revenge as sweet as her injuries are great; infuse into the bosom of that haughty girl a passion for some low, mean, unworthy being, so that she may reap a mortification as great as her present exultation and triumph.&quot; Cupid prepared to obey the commands of his mother.  There are two fountains in Venus&#x27;s garden, one of sweet waters, the other of bitter.  Cupid filled two amber vases, one from each fountain, and suspending them from the top of his quiver, hastened to the chamber of Psyche, whom he found asleep.  He shed a few drops from the bitter fountain over her lips, though the sight of her almost moved him to pity; then touched her side with the point of his arrow.  At the touch she awoke, and opened eyes upon Cupid (himself invisible) which so startled him that in his confusion he wounded himself with his own arrow.  Heedless of his wound his whole thought now was to repair the mischief he had done, and he poured the balmy drops of joy over all her silken ringlets. Psyche, henceforth frowned upon by Venus, derived no benefit from all her charms.  True, all eyes were cast eagerly upon her, and every mouth spoke her praises; but neither king, royal youth, nor plebeian presented himself to demand her in marriage.  Her two elder sisters of moderate charms had now long been married to two royal princes; but Psyche, in her lonely apartment, deplored her solitude, sick of that beauty, which, while it procured abundance of flattery, had failed to awaken love. Her parents, afraid that they had unwittingly incurred the anger of the gods, consulted the oracle of Apollo, and received this answer: &quot;The virgin is destined for the bride of no mortal lover. Her future husband awaits her on the top of the mountain.  He is a monster whom neither gods nor men can resist.&quot; This dreadful decree of the oracle filled all the people with dismay, and her parents abandoned themselves to grief.  But Psyche said, &quot;Why, my dear parents, do you now lament me?  You should rather have grieved when the people showered upon me undeserved honors, and with one voice called me a Venus.  I now perceive that I am a victim to that name.  I submit.  Lead me to that rock to which my unhappy fate has destined me.&quot; Accordingly, all things being prepared, the royal maid took her place in the procession, which more resembled a funeral than a nuptial pomp, and with her parents, amid the lamentations of the people, ascended the mountain, on the summit of which they left her alone, and with sorrowful hearts returned home. While Psyche stood on the ridge of the mountain, panting with fear and with eyes full of tears, the gentle Zephyr raised her from the earth and bore her with an easy motion into a flowery dale.  By degrees her mind became composed, and she laid herself down on the grassy bank to sleep.  When she awoke, refreshed with sleep, she looked round and beheld nearby a pleasant grove of tall and stately trees.  She entered it, and in the midst discovered a fountain, sending forth clear and crystal waters, and hard by, a magnificent palace whose August front impressed the spectator that it was not the work of mortal hands, but the happy retreat of some god.  Drawn by admiration and wonder, she approached the building and ventured to enter.  Every object she met filled her with pleasure and amazement.  Golden pillars supported the vaulted roof, and the walls were enriched with carvings and paintings representing beasts of the chase and rural scenes, adapted to delight the eye of the beholder.  Proceeding onward she perceived that besides the apartments of state there were others, filled with all manner of treasures, and beautiful and precious productions of nature and art. While her eyes were thus occupied, a voice addressed her, though she saw no one, uttering these words: &quot;Sovereign lady, all that you see is yours.  We whose voices you hear are your servants, and shall obey all your commands with our utmost care and diligence.  Retire therefore to your chamber and repose on your bed of down, and when you see fit repair to the bath.  Supper will await you in the adjoining alcove when it pleases you to take your seat there.&quot; Psyche gave ear to the admonitions of her vocal attendants, and after repose and the refreshment of the bath, seated herself in the alcove, where a table immediately presented itself, without any visible aid from waiters or servants, and covered with the greatest delicacies of food and the most nectareous wines.  Her ears too were feasted with music from invisible performers; of whom one sang, another played on the lute, and all closed in the wonderful harmony of a full chorus. She had not yet seen her destined husband.  He came only in the hours of darkness, and fled before the dawn of morning, but his accents were full of love, and inspired a like passion in her. She often begged him to stay and let her behold him, but he would not consent.  On the contrary, he charged her to make no attempt to see him, for it was his pleasure, for the best of reasons, to keep concealed.  &quot;Why should you wish to behold me?&quot; he said. &quot;Have you any doubt of my love?  Have you any wish ungratified? If you saw me, perhaps you would fear me, perhaps adore me, but all I ask of you is to love me.  I would rather you would love me as an equal than adore me as a god.&quot; This reasoning somewhat quieted Psyche for a time, and while the novelty lasted she felt quite happy.  But at length the thought of her parents, left in ignorance of her fate, and of her sisters, precluded from sharing with her the delights of her situation, preyed on her mind and made her begin to feel her palace as but a splendid prison.  When her husband came one night, she told him her distress, and at last drew from him an unwilling consent that her sisters should be brought to see her. So calling Zephyr, she acquainted him with her husband&#x27;s commands, and he, promptly obedient, soon brought them across the mountain down to their sister&#x27;s valley.  They embraced her and she returned their caresses.  &quot;Come,&quot; said Psyche, &quot;enter with me my house and refresh yourselves with whatever your sister has to offer.&quot;  Then taking their hands she led them into her golden palace, and committed them to the care of her numerous train of attendant voices, to refresh them in her baths and at her table, and to show them all her treasures.  The view of these celestial delights caused envy to enter their bosoms, at seeing their young sister possessed of such state and splendor, so much exceeding their own. They asked her numberless questions, among others what sort of a person her husband was.  Psyche replied that he was a beautiful youth, who generally spent the daytime in hunting upon the mountains.  The sisters, not satisfied with this reply, soon made her confess that she had never seen him.  Then they proceeded to fill her bosom with dark suspicions.  &quot;Call to mind,&quot; they said, &quot;the Pythian oracle that declared you destined to marry a direful and tremendous monster.  The inhabitants of this valley say that your husband is a terrible and monstrous serpent, who nourishes you for a while with dainties that he may by and by devour you. Take our advice.  Provide yourself with a lamp and a sharp knife; put them in concealment that your husband may not discover them, and when he is sound asleep, slip out of bed bring forth your lamp and see for yourself whether what they say is true or not. If it is, hesitate not to cut off the monster&#x27;s head, and thereby recover your liberty.&quot; Psyche resisted these persuasions as well as she could, but they did not fail to have their effect on her mind, and when her sisters were gone, their words and her own curiosity were too strong for her to resist.  So she prepared her lamp and a sharp knife, and hid them out of sight of her husband.  When he had fallen into his first sleep, she silently rose and uncovering her lamp beheld not a hideous monster, but the most beautiful and charming of the gods, with his golden ringlets wandering over his snowy neck and crimson cheek, with two dewy wings on his shoulders, whiter than snow, and with shining feathers like the tender blossoms of spring.  As she leaned the lamp over to have a nearer view of his face a drop of burning oil fell on the shoulder of the god, startled with which he opened his eyes and fixed them full upon her; then, without saying one word, he spread his white wings and flew out of the window.  Psyche, in vain endeavoring to follow him, fell from the window to the ground.  Cupid, beholding her as she lay in the dust, stopped his flight for an instant and said, &quot;O foolish Psyche, is it thus you repay my love?  After having disobeyed my mother&#x27;s commands and made you my wife, will you think me a monster and cut off my head?  But go; return to your sisters, whose advice you seem to think preferable to mine.  I inflict no other punishment on you than to leave you forever.  Love cannot dwell with suspicion.&quot; So saying he fled away, leaving poor Psyche prostrate on the ground, filling the place with mournful lamentations. When she had recovered some degree of composure she looked around her, but the palace and gardens had vanished, and she found herself in the open field not far from the city where her sisters dwelt.  She repaired thither and told them the whole story of her misfortunes, at which, pretending to grieve, those spiteful creatures inwardly rejoiced; &quot;for now,&quot; said they, &quot;he will perhaps choose one of us.&quot;  With this idea, without saying a word of her intentions, each of them rose early the next morning and ascended the mountain, and having reached the top, called upon Zephyr to receive her and bear her to his lord; then leaping up, and not being sustained by Zephyr, fell down the precipice and was dashed to pieces. Psyche meanwhile wandered day and night, without food or repose, in search of her husband.  Casting her eyes on a lofty mountain having on its brow a magnificent temple, she sighed and said to herself, &quot;Perhaps my love, my lord, inhabits there,&quot; and directed her steps thither. She had no sooner entered than she saw heaps of corn, some in loose ears and some in sheaves, with mingled ears of barley. Scattered about lay sickles and rakes, and all the instruments of harvest, without order, as if thrown carelessly out of the weary reapers&#x27; hands in the sultry hours of the day. This unseemly confusion the pious Psyche put an end to, by separating and sorting every thing to its proper place and kind, believing that she ought to neglect none of the gods, but endeavor by her piety to engage them all in her behalf.  The holy Ceres, whose temple it was, finding her so religiously employed, thus spoke to her: &quot;O Psyche, truly worthy of our pity, though I cannot shield you from the frowns of Venus, yet I can teach you how best to allay her displeasure.  Go then, voluntarily surrender yourself to your lady and sovereign, and try by modesty and submission to win her forgiveness; perhaps her favor will restore you the husband you have lost.&quot; Psyche obeyed the commands of Ceres and took her way to the temple of Venus, endeavoring to fortify her mind and thinking of what she should say and how she should best propitiate the angry goddess, feeling that the issue was doubtful and perhaps fatal. Venus received her with angry countenance.  &quot;Most undutiful and faithless of servants,&quot; said she, &quot;do you at last remember that you really have a mistress?  Or have you rather come to see your sick husband, yet suffering from the wound given him by his loving wife?  You are so ill-favored and disagreeable that the only way you can merit your lover must be by dint of industry and diligence.  I will make trial of your housewifery.&quot;  Then she ordered Psyche to be led to the storehouse of her temple, where was laid up a great quantity of wheat, barley, millet, vetches, beans, and lentils prepared for food for her doves, and said, &quot;Take and separate all these grains, putting all of the same kind in a parcel by themselves, and see that you get it done before evening.&quot;  Then Venus departed and left her to her task. But Psyche, in perfect consternation at the enormous work, sat stupid and silent, without moving a finger to the inextricable heap. While she sat despairing, Cupid stirred up the little ant, a native of the fields, to take compassion on her.  The leader of the ant-hill, followed by whole hosts of his six-legged subjects, approached the heap, and with the utmost diligence taking grain by grain, they separated the pile, sorting each kind to its parcel; and when it was all done, they vanished out of sight in a moment. Venus at the approach of twilight returned from the banquet of the gods, breathing odors and crowned with roses.  Seeing the task done she exclaimed, &quot;This is no work of yours wicked one, but his, whom to your own and his misfortune you have enticed.&quot; So saying, she threw her a piece of black bread for her supper and went away. Next morning Venus ordered Psyche to be called, and said to her, &quot;Behold yonder grove which stretches along the margin of the water.  There you will find sheep feeding without a shepherd, with golden-shining fleeces on their backs.  Go, fetch me a sample of that precious wool gathered from every one of their fleeces. Psyche obediently went to the river-side, prepared to do her best to execute the command.  But the river-god inspired the reeds with harmonious murmurs, which seemed to say, &quot;O maiden, severely tried, tempt not the dangerous flood, nor venture among the formidable rams on the other side, for as long as they are under the influence of the rising sun, they burn with a cruel rage to destroy mortals with their sharp horns or rude teeth.  But when the noontide sun has driven the flock to the shade, and the serene spirit of the flood has lulled them to rest, you may then cross in safety, and you will find the woolly gold sticking to the bushes and the trunks of the trees.&quot; Thus the compassionate river-god gave Psyche instructions how to accomplish her task, and by observing his directions she soon returned to Venus with her arms full of the golden fleece; but she received not the approbation of her implacable mistress, who said, &quot;I know very well it is by none of your own doings that you have succeeded in this task, and I am not satisfied yet that you have any capacity to make yourself useful.  But I have another task for you.  Here, take this box, and go your way to the infernal shades, and give this box to Proserpine, and say, &#x27;My mistress Venus desires you to send her a little of your beauty, for in tending her sick son she has lost come of her own.&#x27;  Be not too long on your errand, for I must paint myself with it to appear at the circle of the gods and goddesses this evening.&quot; Psyche was now satisfied that her destruction was at hand, being obliged to go with her own feet directly down to Erebus. Wherefore, to make no delay of what was not to be avoided, she goes to the top of a high tower to precipitate herself headlong, thus to descend the shortest way to the shades below.  But a voice from the tower said to her, &quot;Why, poor unlucky girl, dost thou design to put an end to thy days in so dreadful a manner? And what cowardice makes thee sink under this last danger, who hast been so miraculously supported in all thy former?&quot;  Then the voice told her how by a certain cave she might reach the realms of Pluto, and how to avoid all the dangers of the road, to pass by Cerberus, the three-headed dog, and prevail on Charon, the ferryman, to take her across the black river and bring her back again.  But the voice added, &quot;When Proserpine has given you the box, filled with her beauty, of all things this is chiefly to be observed by you, that you never once open or look into the box nor allow your curiosity to pry into the treasure of the beauty of the goddesses. Psyche encouraged by this advice obeyed it in all things, and taking heed to her ways travelled safely to the kingdom of Pluto. She was admitted to the palace of Proserpine, and without accepting the delicate seat or delicious banquet that was offered her, but contented with coarse bread for her food, she delivered her message from Venus.  Presently the box was returned to her, shut and filled with the precious commodity.  Then she returned the way she came, and glad was she to come out once more into the light of day. But having got so far successfully through her dangerous task a longing desire seized her to examine the contents of the box. &quot;What,&quot; said she, &quot;shall I, the carrier of this divine beauty, not take the least bit to put on my cheeks to appear to more advantage in the eyes of my beloved husband!:&quot; So she carefully opened the box, but found nothing there of any beauty at all, but an infernal and truly Stygian sleep, which being thus set free from its prison, took possession of her, and she fell down in the midst of the road, a sleepy corpse without sense or motion. But Cupid being now recovered from his wound, and not able longer to bear the absence of his beloved Psyche, slipping through the smallest crack of the window of his chamber which happened to be left open, flew to the spot where Psyche lay, and gathering up the sleep from her body closed it again in the box, and waked Psyche with a light touch of one of his arrows.  &quot;Again,&quot; said he, &quot;hast thou almost perished by the same curiosity.  But now perform exactly the task imposed on you by my mother, and I will take care of the rest.&quot; Then Cupid, as swift as lightning penetrating the heights of heaven, presented himself before Jupiter with his supplication. Jupiter lent a favoring ear, and pleaded the cause of the lovers so earnestly with Venus that he won her consent.  On this he sent Mercury to bring Psyche up to the heavenly assembly, and when she arrived, handing her a cup of ambrosia, he said, &quot;Drink this, Psyche, and be immortal; nor shall Cupid ever break away from the knot in which he is tied, but these nuptials shall be perpetual.&quot; Thus Psyche became at last united to Cupid, and in due time they had a daughter born to them whose name was Pleasure. The fable of Cupid and Psyche is usually considered allegorical. The Greek name for a butterfly is Psyche, and the same word means the soul.  There is no illustration of the immortality of the soul so striking and beautiful as the butterfly, bursting on brilliant wings from the tomb in which it has lain, after a dull, grovelling caterpillar existence, to flutter in the blaze of day and feed on the most fragrant and delicate productions of the spring.  Psyche, then, is the human soul, which is purified by sufferings and misfortunes, and is thus prepared for the enjoyment of true and pure happiness. In works of art Psyche is represented as a maiden with the wings of a butterfly, alone or with Cupid, in the different situations described in the allegory. Milton alludes to the story of Cupid and Psyche in the conclusion of his Comus:-- &quot;Celestial Cupid, her famed son, advanced, Holds his dear Psyche sweet entranced, After her wandering labors long, Till free consent the gods among Make her his eternal bride; And from her fair unspotted side Two blissful twins are to be born, Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn.&quot; The allegory of the story of Cupid and Psyche is well presented in the beautiful lines of T. K. Hervey:-- &quot;They wove bright fables in the days of old When reason borrowed fancy&#x27;s painted wings; When truth&#x27;s clear river flowed o&#x27;er sands of gold, And told in song its high and mystic things! And such the sweet and solemn tale of her The pilgrim-heart, to whom a dream was given. That led her through the world,   Love&#x27;s worshipper, To seek on earth for him whose home was heaven! &quot;In the full city,   by the haunted fount, Through the dim grotto&#x27;s tracery of spars, &#x27;Mid the pine temples, on the moonlit mount, Where silence sits to listen to the stars; In the deep glade where dwells the brooding dove, The painted valley, and the scented air, She heard far echoes of the voice of Love, And found his footsteps&#x27; traces everywhere. &quot;But never more they met!  Since doubts and fears, Those phantom-shapes that haunt and blight the earth, Had come &#x27;twixt her, a child of sin and tears, And that bright spirit of immortal birth; Until her pining soul and weeping eyes Had learned to seek him only in the skies; Till wings unto the weary heart were given, And she became Love&#x27;s angel bride in heaven!&quot; The story of Cupid and Psyche first appears in the works of Apuleius, a writer of the second century of our era.  It is therefore of much more recent date than most of the legends of the Age of Fable.  It is this that Keats alludes to in his Ode to Psyche. &quot;O latest born and loveliest vision far Of all Olympus&#x27; faded hierarchy! Fairer than Phoebe&#x27;s sapphire-regioned star Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky; Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none, Nor altar heaped with flowers; Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan Upon the midnight hours; No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet, &gt;From chain-swung censer teeming; No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat Of Pale-mouthed prophet dreaming.&quot; In Moore&#x27;s Summer Fete, a fancy ball is described, in which one of the characters personated is Psyche. &quot;   not in dark disguise to-night Hath our young heroine veiled her light; For see, she walks the earth, Love&#x27;s own. His wedded bride, by holiest vow Pledged in Olympus, and made known To mortals by the type which now Hangs glittering on her snowy brow, That butterfly, mysterious trinket, Which means the soul (though few would think it), And sparkling thus on brow so white, Tells us we&#x27;ve Psyche here to-night.&quot; Chapter VII Cadmus.   The Myrmidons. Jupiter, under the disguise of a bull, had carried away to the island of Crete, Europa, the daughter of Agenor king of Phoenicia.  Agenor commanded his son Cadmus to go in search of his sister, and not to return without her.  Cadmus went and sought long and far for his sister, but could not find her, and not daring to return unsuccessful, consulted the oracle of Apollo to know what country he should settle in.  The oracle informed him that he should find a cow in the field, and should follow her wherever she might wander, and where she stopped, should build a city and call it Thebes.  Cadmus had hardly left the Castalian cave, from which the oracle was delivered, when he saw a young cow slowly walking before him.  He followed her close, offering at the same time his prayers to Phoebus.  The cow went on till she passed the shallow channel of Cephisus and came out into the plain of Panope.  There she stood still, and raising her broad forehead to the sky, filled the air with her lowings.  Cadmus gave thanks, and stooping down kissed the foreign soil, then lifting his eyes, greeted the surrounding mountains. Wishing to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter, he sent his servants to seek pure water for a libation.  Nearby there stood an ancient grove which had never been profaned by the axe, in the midst of which was a cave, thick covered with the growth of bushes, its roof forming a low arch, from beneath which burst forth a fountain of purest water.  In the cave lurked a horrid serpent with a crested head and scales glittering like gold.  His eyes shone like fire, his body was swollen with venom, he vibrated a triple tongue, and showed a triple row of teeth.  No sooner had the Tyrians (Cadmus and his companions came from Tyre, the chief city of Phoenicia) dipped their pitchers in the fountain, and the ingushing waters made a sound, than the glittering serpent raised his head out of the cave and uttered a fearful hiss.  The vessels fell from their hands, the blood left their cheeks, they trembled in every limb. The serpent, twisting his scaly body in a huge coil, raised his head so as to overtop the tallest trees, and while the Tyrians from terror could neither fight nor fly, slew some with his fangs, others in his folds, and others with his poisonous breath. Cadmus having waited for the return of his men till midday, went in search of them.  His covering was a lion&#x27;s hide, and besides his javelin he carried in his hand a lance, and in his breast a bold heart, a surer reliance than either.  When he entered the wood and saw the lifeless bodies of his men, and the monster with his bloody jaws, he exclaimed, &quot;O faithful friends, I will avenge you, or share your death.&quot;  So saying he lifted a huge stone and threw it with all his force at the serpent.  Such a block would have shaken the wall of a fortress, but it made no impression on the monster.   Cadmus next threw his javelin, which met with better success, for it penetrated the serpent&#x27;s scales, and pierced through to his entrails.  Fierce with pain the monster turned back his head to view the wound, and attempted to draw out the weapon with his mouth, but broke it off, leaving the iron point rankling in his flesh.  His neck swelled with rage, bloody foam covered his jaws, and the breath of his nostrils poisoned the air around.  Now he twisted himself into a circle, then stretched himself out on the ground like the trunk of a fallen tree.  As he moved onward, Cadmus retreated before him, holding his spear opposite to the monster&#x27;s opened jaws.  The serpent snapped at the weapon and attempted to bite its iron point.  At last Cadmus, watching his chance, thrust the spear at a moment when the animal&#x27;s thrown back came against the trunk of a tree, and so succeeded in pinning him to its side.  His weight bent the tree as he struggled in the agonies of death. While Cadmus stood over his conquered foe, contemplating its vast size, a voice was heard (from whence he knew not, but he heard it distinctly), commanding him to take the dragon&#x27;s teeth and sow them in the earth.  He obeyed.  He made a furrow in the ground, and planted the teeth, destined to produce a crop of men.  Scarce had he done so when the clods began to move, and the points of spears to appear above the surface.  Next helmets, with their nodding plumes, came up, and next, the shoulders and breasts and limbs of men with weapons, and in time a harvest of armed warriors.  Cadmus, alarmed, prepared to encounter a new enemy, but one of them said to him, &quot;Meddle not with our civil war.&quot; With that he who had spoken smote one of his earth-born brothers with a sword, and he himself fell pierced with an arrow from another.  The latter fell victim to a fourth, and in like manner the whole crowd dealt with each other till all fell slain with mutual wounds except five survivors.  One of these cast away his weapons and said, &quot;Brothers, let us live in peace!&quot;  These five joined with Cadmus in building his city, to which they gave the name of Thebes. Cadmus obtained in marriage Harmonia, the daughter of Venus.  The gods left Olympus to honor the occasion with their presence, and Vulcan presented the bride with a necklace of surpassing brilliancy, his own workmanship.  But a fatality hung over the family of Cadmus in consequence of his killing the serpent sacred to Mars.  Semele and Ino, his daughters, and Actaeon and Pentheius, his grandchildren, all perished unhappily; and Cadmus and Harmonia quitted Thebes, now grown odious to them, and emigrated to the country of the Enchelians, who received them with honor and made Cadmus their king.  But the misfortunes of their children still weighed upon their minds; and one day Cadmus exclaimed, &quot;If a serpent&#x27;s life is so dear to the gods, I would I were myself a serpent.&quot;  No sooner had he uttered the words than he began to change his form.  Harmonia beheld it, and prayed to the gods to let her share his fate.  Both became serpents.  They lie in the woods, but mindful of their origin they neither avoid the presence of man nor do they ever injure any one. There is a tradition that Cadmus introduced into Greece the letters of the alphabet which were invented by the Phoenicians. This is alluded to by Byron, where, addressing the modern Greeks, he says: &quot;You have the letters Cadmus gave, Think you he meant them for a slave?&quot; Milton, describing the serpent which tempted Eve, is reminded of the serpents of the classical stories, and says, &quot;-----pleasing was his shape, And lovely; never since of serpent kind Lovelier; not those that in Illyria changed Hermione and Cadmus, nor the god in Epidaurus.&quot; The &quot;god in Epidaurus&quot; was AEsculapius.  Serpents were held sacred to him. THE MYRMIDONS The Myrmidons were the soldiers of Achilles in the Trojan war. &gt;From them all zealous and unscrupulous followers of a political chief are called by that name down to this day.  But the origin of the Myrmidons would not give one the idea of a fierce and bloody race, but rather of a laborious and peaceful one. Cephalus, king of Athens, arrived in the island of AEgina to seek assistance of his old friend and ally AEacus, the king, in his wars with Minos, king of Crete.  Cephalus was kindly received, and the desired assistance readily promised.  &quot;I have people enough,&quot; said AEacus, &quot;to protect myself and spare you such a force as you need.&quot;  &quot;I rejoice to see it,&quot; replied Cephalus, &quot;and my wonder has been raised, I confess, to find such a host of youths as I see around me, all apparently of about the same age. Yet there are many individuals whom I previously knew that I look for now in vain.  What has become of them?&quot;  AEacus groaned, and replied with a voice of sadness, &quot;I have been intending to tell you, and will now do so without more delay, that you may see how from the saddest beginning a happy result sometimes flows.  Those whom you formerly knew are now dust and ashes!  A plague sent by angry Juno devastated the land.  She hated it because it bore the name of one of her husband&#x27;s female favorites.  While the disease appeared to spring from natural causes we resisted it as we best might by natural remedies; but it soon appeared that the pestilence was too powerful for our efforts, and we yielded.  At the beginning the sky seemed to settle down upon the earth, and thick clouds shut in the heated air.  For four months together a deadly south wind prevailed.  The disorder affected the wells and springs; thousands of snakes crept over the land and shed their poison in the fountains.  The force of the disease was first spent on the lower animals; dogs, cattle, sheep, and birds.  The luckless ploughman wondered to see his oxen fall in the midst of their work, and lie helpless in the unfinished furrow.  The wool fell from the bleating sheep, and their bodies pined away.  The horse, once foremost in the race, contested the palm no more, but groaned at his stall, and died an inglorious death.  The wild boar forgot his rage, the stag his swiftness, the bears no longer attacked the herds.  Everything languished; dead bodies lay in the roads, the fields, and the woods; the air was poisoned by them.  I tell you what is hardly credible, but neither dogs nor birds would touch them, nor starving wolves.  Their decay spread the infection.  Next the disease attacked the country people, and then the dwellers in the city.  At first the cheek was flushed, and the breath drawn with difficulty.  The tongue grew rough and swelled, and the dry mouth stood open with its veins enlarged and gasped for the air.  Men could not bear the heat of their clothes or their beds, but preferred to lie on the bare ground; and the ground did not cool them, but on the contrary, they heated the spot where they lay.  Nor could the physicians help, for the disease attacked them also, and the contact of the sick gave them infection, so that the most faithful were the first victims.  At last all hope of relief vanished and men learned to look upon death as the only deliverer from disease.  Then they gave way to every inclination, and cared not to ask what was expedient, for nothing was expedient.  All restraint laid aside, they crowded around the wells and fountains, and drank till they died, without quenching thirst.  Many had not strength to get away from the water, but died in the midst of the stream, and others would drink of it notwithstanding.  Such was their weariness of their sick-beds that some would creep forth, and if not strong enough to stand, would die on the ground.  They seemed to hate their friends, and got away from their homes, as if, not knowing the cause of their sickness, they charged it on the place of their abode.  Some were seen tottering along the road, as long as they could stand, while others sank on the earth, and turned their dying eyes around to take a last look, then closed them in death. &quot;What heart had I left me, during all this, or what ought I to have had, except to hate life and wish to be with my dead subjects?  On all sides lay my people strewn like over-ripened apples beneath the tree, or acorns under the storm-shaken oak. You see yonder s temple on the height.  It is sacred to Jupiter. Oh, how many offered prayers there; husbands for wives, fathers for sons, and died in the very act of supplication!  How often, while the priest made ready for sacrifice, the victim fell, struck down by disease without waiting for the blow.  At length all reverence for sacred things was lost.  Bodies were thrown out unburied, wood was wanting for funeral piles, men fought with one another for the possession of them.  Finally there were none left to mourn; sons and husbands, old men and youths, perished alike unlamented. &quot;Standing before the altar I raised my eyes to heaven.  &#x27;Oh, Jupiter,&#x27; I said, &#x27;if thou art indeed my father, and art not ashamed of thy offspring, give me back my people, or take me also away!&#x27;  At these words a clap of thunder was heard.  &#x27;I accept the omen,&#x27; I cried; &#x27;oh, may it be a sign of a favorable disposition towards me!&#x27;  By chance there grew by the place where I stood an oak with wide-spreading branches, sacred to Jupiter. I observed a troop of ants busy with their labor, carrying minute grains in their mouths and following one another in a line up the trunk of the tree.  Observing their numbers with admiration, I said, &#x27;Give me, oh father, citizens as numerous as these, and replenish my empty city.&#x27;  The tree shook and gave a rustling sound with its branches though no wind agitated them.  I trembled in every limb, yet I kissed the earth and the tree.  I would not confess to myself that I hoped, yet I did hope.  Night came on and sleep took possession of my frame oppressed with cares.  The tree stood before me in my dreams, with its numerous branches all covered with living, moving creatures.  It seemed to shake its limbs and throw down over the ground a multitude of those industrious grain-gathering animals, which appeared to gain in size, and grow larger, and by-and-by to stand erect, lay aside their superfluous legs and their black color, and finally to assume the human form.  Then I awoke, and my first impulse was to chide the gods who had robbed me of a sweet vision and given me no reality in its place.  Being still in the temple my attention was caught by the sound of many voices without; a sound of late unusual to my ears.  While I began to think I was yet dreaming, Telamon, my son, throwing open the temple-gates, exclaimed, &#x27;Father, approach, and behold things surpassing even your hopes!&#x27; I went forth; I saw a multitude of men, such as I had seen in my dream, and they were passing in procession in the same manner. While I gazed with wonder and delight they approached, and kneeling, hailed me as their king.  I paid my vows to Jove, and proceeded to allot the vacant city to the new-born race, and to parcel out the fields among them.  I called them Myrmidons from the ant (myrmex), from which they sprang.  You have seen these persons; their dispositions resemble those which they had in their former shape.  They are a diligent and industrious race, eager to gain, and tenacious of their gains.  Among them you may recruit your forces.  They will follow you to the war, young in years and bold in heart.&quot; This description of the plague is copied by Ovid from the account which Thucydides, the Greek historian, gives of the plague of Athens.  The historian drew from life, and all the poets and writers of fiction since his day, when they have had occasion to describe a similar scene, have borrowed their details from him. Chapter VIII Nisus and Scylla.   Echo and Narcissus.   Clytie.   Hero and Leander Minos, king of Crete, made war upon Megara.  Nisus was king of Megara, and Scylla was his daughter.  The siege had now lasted six months, and the city still held out, for it was decreed by fate that it should not be taken so long as a certain purple lock, which glittered among the hair of King Nisus, remained on his head.  There was a tower on the city walls, which overlooked the plain where Minos and his army were encamped.  To this tower Scylla used to repair, and look abroad over the tents of the hostile army.  The siege had lasted so long that she had learned to distinguish the persons of the leaders.  Minos, in particular, excited her admiration.  She admired his graceful deportment; if he threw his javelin, skill seemed combined with force in the discharge; if he drew his bow, Apollo himself could not have done it more gracefully.  But when he laid aside his helmet, and in his purple robes bestrode his white horse with its gay caparisons, and reined in its foaming mouth, the daughter of Nisus was hardly mistress of herself; she was almost frantic with admiration.  She envied the weapon that he grasped, the reins that he held.  She felt as if she could, if it were possible, go to him through the hostile ranks; she felt an impulse to cast herself down from the tower into the midst of his camp, or to open the gates to him, or do anything else, so only it might gratify Minos.  As she sat in the tower, she talked thus with herself: &quot;I know not whether to rejoice or grieve at this sad war.  I grieve that Minos is our enemy; but I rejoice at any cause that brings him to my sight.  Perhaps he would be willing to grant us peace, and receive me as a hostage.  I would fly down, if I could, and alight in his camp, and tell him that we yield ourselves to his mercy.  But, then, to betray my father! No!  Rather would I never see Minos again.  And yet no doubt it is sometimes the best thing for a city to be conquered when the conqueror is clement and generous.  Minos certainly has right on his side.  I think we shall be conquered; and if that must be the end of it, why should not love unbar the gates to him, instead of leaving it to be done by war?  Better spare delay and slaughter if we can.  And, oh, if any one should wound or kill Minos!  No one surely would have the heart to do it; yet ignorantly, not knowing him, one might.  I will, I will surrender myself to him, with my country as a dowry, and so put an end to the war.  But how?  The gates are guarded, and my father keeps the keys; he only stands in my way.  Oh, that it might please the gods to take him away! But why ask the gods to do it?  Another woman, loving as I do, would remove with her own hands whatever stood in the way of her love.  And can any other woman dare more than I?  I would encounter fire and sword to gain my object; but here there is no need of fire and sword.  I only need my father&#x27;s purple lock.  More precious than gold to me, that will give me all I wish.&quot; While she thus reasoned night came on, and soon the whole palace was buried in sleep.  She entered her father&#x27;s bedchamber and cut off the fatal lock; then passed out of the city and entered the enemy&#x27;s camp.  She demanded to be led to the king, and thus addressed him: &quot;I am Scylla, the daughter of Nisus.  I surrender to you my country and my father&#x27;s house.  I ask no reward but yourself; for love of you I have done it.  See here the purple lock!  With this I give you my father and his kingdom.&quot;  She held out her hand with the fatal spoil.  Minos shrunk back and refused to touch it.  &quot;The gods destroy thee, infamous woman,&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;disgrace of our time!  May neither earth nor sea yield thee a resting place!  Surely, my Crete, where Jove himself was cradled, shall not be polluted with such a monster!&quot;  Thus he said, and gave orders that equitable terms should be allowed to the conquered city, and that the fleet should immediately sail from the island. Scylla was frantic.  &quot;Ungrateful man,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;is it thus you leave me?   Me who have given you victory,   who have sacrificed for you parent and country!  I am guilty, I confess, and deserve to die, by not by your hand.&quot;  As the ships left the shore, she leaped into the water, and seizing the rudder of the one which carried Minos, she was borne along an unwelcome companion of their course.  A sea-eagle soaring aloft,   it was her father who had been changed into that form,   seeing her, pounced down upon her, and struck her with his beak and claws. In terror she let go the ship, and would have fallen into the water, but some pitying deity changed her into a bird.  The sea- eagle still cherishes the old animosity; and whenever he espies her in his lofty flight, you may see him dart down upon her, with beak and claws, to take vengeance for the ancient crime. ECHO AND NARCISSUS Echo was a beautiful nymph, fond of the woods and hills, where she devoted herself to woodland sports.  She was a favorite of Diana, and attended her in the chase.  But Echo had one failing; she was fond of talking, and whether in chat or argument would have the last word.  One day Juno was seeking her husband, who, she had reason to fear, was amusing himself among the nymphs. Echo by her talk contrived to detain the goddess till the nymphs made their escape.  When Juno discovered it, she passed sentence upon Echo in these words: &quot;You shall forfeit the use of that tongue with which you have cheated me, except for that one purpose you are so fond of   REPLY.  You shall still have the last word, but no power to speak first.&quot; This nymph saw Narcissus, a beautiful youth, as he pursued the chase upon the mountains.  She loved him, and followed his footsteps.  Oh, how she longed to address him in the softest accents, and win him to converse, but it was not in her power. She waited with impatience for him to speak first, and had her answer ready.  One day the youth, being separated from his companions, shouted aloud, &quot;Who&#x27;s here?&quot;  Echo replied, &quot;Here.&quot; Narcissus looked around, but seeing no one, called out, &quot;Come.&quot; Echo answered, &quot;Come.&quot;  As no one came, Narcissus called again, &quot;Why do you shun me?&quot;  Echo asked the same question.  &quot;Let us join one another,&quot; said the youth.  The maid answered with all her heart in the same words, and hastened to the spot, ready to throw her arms about his neck.  He started back, exclaiming, &quot;Hands off!  I would rather die than you should have me.&quot;  &quot;Have me,&quot; said she; but it was all in vain.  He left her, and she went to hide her blushes in the recesses of the woods.  From that time forth she lived in caves and among mountain cliffs.  Her form faded with grief, till at last all her flesh shrank away.  Her bones were changed into rocks, and there was nothing left of her but her voice.  With that she is still ready to reply to any one who calls her, and keeps up her old habit of having the last word. Narcissus was cruel not in this case alone.  He shunned all the rest of the nymphs as he had done poor Echo.  One day a maiden, who had in vain endeavored to attract him, uttered a prayer that he might some time or other feel what it was to love and meet no return of affection.  The avenging goddess heard and granted the prayer. There was a clear fountain, with water like silver, to which the shepherds never drove their flocks.  Nor did the mountain goats resort to it, nor any of the beasts of the forest; neither was it defaced with fallen leaves or branches; but the grass grew fresh around it, and the rocks sheltered it from the sun.  Hither came one day the youth fatigued with hunting, heated and thirsty.  He stooped down to drink, and saw his own image in the water; he thought it was some beautiful water=spirit living in the fountain.  He stood gazing with admiration at those bright eyes, those locks curled like the locks of Bacchus or Apollo, the rounded cheeks, the ivory neck, the parted lips, and the glow of health and exercise over all.  He fell in love with himself.  He brought his lips near to take a kiss; he plunged his arms in to embrace the beloved object.  It fled at the touch, but returned again after a moment and renewed the fascination.  He could not tear himself away; he lost all thought of food or rest, while he hovered over the brink of the fountain gazing upon his own image. He talked with the supposed spirit: &quot;Why, beautiful being, do you shun me?  Surely my face is not one to repel you.  The nymphs love me, and you yourself look not indifferent upon me.  When I stretch forth my arms you do the same; and you smile upon me and answer my beckonings with the like.&quot;  His tears fell into the water and disturbed the image.  As he saw it depart, he exclaimed, &quot;Stay, I entreat you! Let me at least gaze upon you, if I may not touch you.&quot;   With this, and much more of the same kind, he cherished the flame that consumed him, so that by degrees he lost his color, his vigor, and the beauty which formerly had so charmed the nymph Echo.  She kept near him, however, and when he exclaimed, &quot;Alas!  Alas!&quot; she answered him with the same words.  He pined away and died; and when his shade passed the Stygian river, it leaned over the boat to catch a look of itself in the waters.  The nymphs mourned for him, especially the water-nymphs; and when they smote their breasts, Echo smote hers also.  They prepared a funeral pile, and would have burned the body, but it was nowhere to be found; but in its place a flower, purple within, and surrounded with white leaves, which bears the name and preserves the memory of Narcissus. Milton alludes to the story of Echo and Narcissus in the Lady&#x27;s song in Comus.  She is seeking her brothers in the forest, and sings to attract their attention. &quot;Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv&#x27;st unseen Within thy aery shell By slow Meander&#x27;s margent green. And in the violet-embroidered vale, Where the love-lorn nightingale Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well; Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair That likes thy Narcissus are? Oh, if thou have Hid them in some flowery cave, Tell me but where, Sweet queen of parly, daughter of the sphere, So may&#x27;st thou be translated to the skies, And give resounding grace to all heaven&#x27;s harmonies.&quot; Milton has imitated the story of Narcissus in the account which he makes Eve give of the first sight of herself reflected in the fountain: &quot;That day I oft remember when from sleep I first awaked, and found myself reposed Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where And what I was, whence thither brought, and how Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issued from a cave, and spread Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved Pure as the expanse of heaven; I thither went With unexperienced thought, and laid me down On the green bank, to look into the clear Smooth lake that to me seemed another sky. As I bent down to look, just opposite A shape within the watery gleam appeared, Bending to look on me.  I started back; It started back; but pleased I soon returned, Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks Of sympathy and love.  There had I fixed Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire, Had not a voice thus warned me: &#x27;What thou seest, What there thou seest, fair creature, is thyself.&#x27;&quot; Paradise Lost, Book IV The fable of Narcissus is often alluded to by the poets.  Here are two epigrams which treat it in different ways.  The first is by Goldsmith: &quot;ON A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH STRUCK BLIND BY LIGHTNING: &quot;Sure &#x27;twas by Providence designed, Rather in pity than in hate, That he should be like Cupid blind, To save him from Narcissus&#x27; fate&quot; The other is by Cowper: &quot;ON AN UGLY FELLOW &quot;Beware, my friend, of crystal brook Or fountain, lest that hideous hook. Thy nose, thou chance to see; Narcissus&#x27; fate would then be thine, And self-detested thou would&#x27;st pine, As self-enamored he.&quot; CLYTIE Clytie was a water-nymph and in love with Apollo, who made her no return.  So she pined away, sitting all day long upon the cold ground, with her unbound tresses streaming over her shoulders. Nine days she sat and tasted neither food nor drink, her own tears and the chilly dew her only food.  She gazed on the sun when he rose, and as he passed through his daily course to his setting; she saw no other object, her face turned constantly on him.  At last, they say, her limbs rooted in the ground, her face became a sunflower, which turns on its stem so as always to face the sun throughout its daily course; for it retains to that extent the feeling of the nymph from whom it sprang. One of the best known of the marble busts discovered in our own time, generally bears the name of Clytie.  It has been very frequently copied in plaster.  It represents the head of a young girl looking down,   the neck and shoulders being supported in the cup of a large flower,   which by a little effort of imagination can be made into a giant sunflower.  The latest supposition, however, is that this bust represented not Clytie, but Isis. Hood in his Flowers thus alludes to Clytie: &quot;I will not have the mad Clytie, Whose head is turned by the sun; The tulip is a courtly quean, Whom therefore I will shun; The cowslip is a country wench, The violet is a nun; But I will woo the dainty rose, The queen of every one.&quot; The sunflower is a favorite emblem of constancy.  Thus Moore uses it: &quot;The heart that has truly loved never forgets, But as truly loves on to the close; As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets The same look that she turned when he rose.&quot; It is only for convenience that the modern poets translate the Latin word HELIOTROPIUM, by the English sunflower.  The sunflower, which was known to the ancients, was called in Greek, helianthos, from HELIOS, the sun; and ANTHOS a flower, and in Latin, helianthus.  It derives its name from its resemblance to the sun; but, as any one may see, at sunset, it does not &quot;turn to the God when he sets the same look that it turned when he rose.&quot; The Heliotrope of the fable of Clytie is called Turn-sole in old English books, and such a plant is known in England.  It is not the sweet heliotrope of modern gardens, which is a South American plant.  The true classical heliotrope is probably to be found in the heliotrope of southern France,   a weed not known in America. The reader who is curious may examine the careful account of it in Larousse&#x27;s large dictionary. HERO AND LEANDER Leander was a youth of Abydos, a town of the Asian side of the strait which separates Asia and Europe.  On the opposite shore in the town of Sestos lived the maiden Hero, a priestess of Venus. Leander loved her, and used to swim the strait nightly to enjoy the company of his mistress, guided by a torch which she reared upon the tower, for the purpose.  But one night a tempest arose and the sea was rough; his strength failed, and he was drowned. The waves bore his body to the European shore, where Hero became aware of his death, and in her despair cast herself down from the tower into the sea and perished. The following sonnet is by Keats: &quot;ON A PICTURE OF LEANDER &quot;Come hither, all sweet maidens, soberly, Down looking aye, and with a chasten&#x27;d light, Hid in the fringes of your eyelids white, And meekly let your fair hands joined be, As if so gentle that ye could not see, Untouch&#x27;d, a victim of your beauty bright, Sinking away to his young spirit&#x27;s night, Sinking bewilder&#x27;d &#x27;mid the dreary sea. &#x27;Tis young Leander toiling to his death. Nigh swooning, he doth purse his weary lips For Hero&#x27;s cheek, and smiles against her smile. Oh, horrid dream!  See how his body dips Dead-heavy; arms and shoulders gleam awhile; He&#x27;s gone; up bubbles all his amorous breath!&quot; The story of Leander&#x27;s swimming the Hellespont was looked upon as fabulous, and the feat considered impossible, till Lord Byron proved its possibility by performing it himself.  In the Bride of Abydos he says, &quot;These limbs that buoyant wave hath borne.&quot; The distance in the narrowest part is almost a mile, and there is a constant current setting out from the Sea of Marmora into the Archipelago.  Since Byron&#x27;s time the feat has been achieved by others; but it yet remains a test of strength and skill in the art of swimming sufficient to give a wide and lasting celebrity to any one of our readers who may dare to make the attempt and succeed in accomplishing it. In the beginning of the second canto of the same poem, Byron alludes to this story: &quot;The winds are high on Helle&#x27;s wave, As on that night of stormiest water, When Love, who sent, forgot to save The young, the beautiful, the brave, The lonely hope of Sestos&#x27; daughter. Oh, when alone along the sky The turret-torch was blazing high, Though rising gale and breaking foam, And shrieking sea-birds warned him home; And clouds aloft and tides below, With signs and sounds forbade to go, He could not see, he would not hear Or sound or sight foreboding fear. His eye but saw that light of love, The only star it hailed above; His ear but rang with Hero&#x27;s song, &#x27;Ye waves, divide not lovers long.&#x27; That tale is old, but love anew May nerve young hearts to prove as true.&quot; The subject has been a favorite one with sculptors. Schiller has made one of his finest ballads from the tragic fate of the two lovers.  The following verses are a translation from the latter part of the ballad: &quot;Upon Hellespont&#x27;s broad currents Night broods black, and rain in torrents &gt;From the cloud&#x27;s full bosom pours; Lightnings in the sky are flashing, All the storms below are dashing On the crag-piled shores. Awful chasms gaping widely, Separate the mountain waves; Ocean yawning as to open Downward e&#x27;en to Pluto&#x27;s caves.&quot; After the storm has arisen, Hero sees the danger, and cries, &quot;Woe, ah!  Woe; great Jove have pity, Listen to my sad entreaty, Yet for what can Hero pray? Should the gods in pity listen, He, e&#x27;en now the false abyss in, Struggles with the tempest&#x27;s spray. All the birds that skim the wave In hasty flight are hieing home; T the lee of safer haven All the storm-tossed vessels come. &quot;Ah!  I know he laughs at danger, Dares again the frequent venture, Lured by an almighty power; For he swore it when we parted, With the vow which binds true-hearted Lovers to the latest hour. Yes!  Even as this moment hastens Battles he the wave-crests rude, And to their unfathomed chasms Dags him down the angry flood. &quot;Pontus false!  Thy sunny smile Was the lying traitor&#x27;s guile, Like a mirror flashing there: All thy ripples gently playing Til they triumphed in betraying Him into thy lying snare. Now in thy mid-current yonder, Onward still his course he urges, Thou the false, on him the fated Pouring loose thy terror-surges. Waxes high the tempest&#x27;s danger, Waves to mountains rise in anger, Oceans swell, and breakers dash, Foaming, over cliffs of rock Where even navies, stiff with oak, Could not bear the crash. In the gale her torch is blasted, Beacon of the hoped-for strand; Horror broods above the waters, Horror broods above the land. Prays she Venus to assuage The hurricane&#x27;s increasing rage, And to sooth the billows&#x27; scorn. And as gale on gale arises, Vows to each   as sacrifices Spotless steer with gilded horn. To all the goddesses below, To &quot;all the gods in heaven that be,&quot; She prays that oil of peace may flow Softly on the storm-tossed sea. Blest Leucothea, befriend me! &gt;From cerulean halls attend me; Hear my prayer of agony. In the ocean desert&#x27;s raving, Storm-tossed seamen, succor craving, Find in thee their helper nigh. Wrap him in thy charmed veil, Secret spun and secret wove, Certain from the deepest wave To lift him to its crests above.&quot; Now the tempests wild are sleeping, And from the horizon creeping Rays of morning streak the skies, Peaceful as it lay before The placid sea reflects the shore, Skies kiss waves and waves the skies. Little ripples, lightly plashing, Break upon the rock-bound strand, And they trickle, lightly playing O&#x27;er a corpse upon the sand. Yes, &#x27;tis he!  Although he perished, Still his sacred troth he cherished, An instant&#x27;s glance tells all to her; Not a tear her eye lets slip Not a murmur leaves her lip; Down she looks in cold despair; Gazes round the desert sea, Trustless gazes round the sky, Flashes then of noble fire Through her pallid visage fly! &quot;Yes, I know, ye mighty powers, Ye have drawn the fated hours Pitiless and cruel on. Early full my course is over. Such a course with such a lover; Such a share of joy I&#x27;ve known. Venus, queen, within thy temple, Thou hast known me vowed as thine, Now accept thy willing priestess As an offering at thy shrine.&quot; Downward then, while all in vain her Fluttering robes would still sustain her, Springs she into Pontus&#x27; wave; Grasping him and her, the god Whirls them in his deepest flood, And, himself, becomes their grave. With his prizes then contented, Peaceful bids his waters glide, &gt;From the unexhausted vessels, Whence there streams an endless tide. Chapter IX Minerva and Arachne.   Niobe.   The Story of Perseus Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, was the daughter of Jupiter. She, they say, sprang forth from his brain full grown and clad in complete armor.  She presided over the useful and ornamental arts, both those of men,   such as agriculture and navigation, and those of women,   spinning, weaving, and needle-work.  She was also a warlike divinity; but a lover of defensive war only. She had no sympathy with Mars&#x27;s savage love of violence and bloodshed.  Athens was her chosen seat, her own city, awarded to her as the prize of a contest with Neptune, who also aspired to it.  The tale ran that in the reign of Cecrops, the first king of Athens, the two deities contended for the possession of the city. The gods decreed that it should be awarded to that one who produced the gift most useful to mortals.  Neptune gave the horse; Minerva produced the olive.  The gods gave judgment that the olive was the more useful of the two, and awarded the city to the goddess; and it was named after her, Athens, her name in Greek being Athene. In another contest, a mortal dared to come in competition with Minerva.  That mortal was Arachne, a maiden who had attained such skill in the arts of weaving and embroidery that the nymphs themselves would leave their groves and fountains to come and gaze upon her work.  It was not only beautiful when it was done, but beautiful also in the doing. To watch her, as she took the wool in its rude state and formed it into rolls, or separated it with her fingers and carded it till it looked as light and soft as a cloud, or twirled the spindle with skilful touch, or wove the web, or, when woven, adorned it with her needle, one would have said that Minerva herself had taught her.  But this she denied, and could not bear to be thought a pupil even of a goddess.  &quot;Let Minerva try her skill with mine,&quot; said she; &quot;if beaten, I will pay the penalty.&quot;  Minerva heard this and was displeased.  Assuming the form of an old woman, she went and gave Arachne some friendly advice.  &quot;I have had much experience,: said she, &quot;and I hope you will not despise my counsel.  Challenge your fellow-mortals as you will, but do not compete with a goddess. On the contrary, I advise you to ask her forgiveness for what you have said, and, as she is merciful, perhaps she will pardon you.&quot; Arachne stopped her spinning, and looked at the old dame with anger in her countenance.  &quot;Keep your counsel,&quot; said she, &quot;for your daughters or handmaids; for my part, I know what I say, and I stand to it.  I am not afraid of the goddess; let her try her skill, if she dare venture.&quot;  &quot;She comes,&quot; said Minerva; and dropping her disguise, stood confessed.  The nymphs bent low in homage, and all the bystanders paid reverence.  Arachne alone was unterrified.  She blushed, indeed; a sudden color dyed her cheek, and then she grew pale.  But she stood to her resolve, and with a foolish conceit of her own skill rushed on her fate.  Minerva forbore no longer, nor interposed any further advice.  They proceed to the contest.  Each takes her station and attaches the web to the beam.  Then the slender shuttle is passed in and out among the threads.  The reed with its fine teeth strikes up the woof into its place and compacts the web.  Both work with speed; their skilful hands move rapidly, and the excitement of the contest makes the labor light.  Wool of Tyrian dye is contrasted with that of other colors, shaded off into one another so adroitly that the joining deceives the eye.  Like the bow, whose long arch tinges the heavens, formed by sunbeams reflected from the shower (this description of the rainbow is literally translated rom Ovid), in which, where the colors meet they seem as one, but at a little distance from the point of contact are wholly different. Minerva wrought on her web the scene of her contest with Neptune. Twelve of the heavenly powers are represented, Jupiter, with August gravity, sitting in the midst.  Neptune, the ruler of the sea, holds his trident, and appears to have just smitten the earth, from which a horse has leaped forth.  Minerva depicted herself with helmed head, her AEgis covering her breast.  Such was the central circle; and in the four corners were represented incidents illustrating the displeasure of the gods at such presumptuous mortals as had dared to contend with them.  These were meant as warnings to her rival to give up the contest before it was too late. Arachne filled her web with subjects designedly chosen to exhibit the failings and errors of the gods.  One scene represented Leda caressing the swan, under which form Jupiter had disguised himself; and another, Danae, in the brazen tower in which her father had imprisoned her, but where the god effected his entrance in the form of a shower of gold.  Still another depicted Europa deceived by Jupiter under the disguise of a bull. Encouraged by the tameness of the animal, Europa ventured to mount his back, whereupon Jupiter advanced into the sea, and swam with her to Crete.  You would have thought it was a real bull so naturally was it wrought, and so natural was the water in which it swam.  She seemed to look with longing eyes back upon the shore she was leaving, and to call to her companions for help. She appeared to shudder with terror at the sight of the heaving waves, and to draw back her feet from the water. Arachne filled her canvas with these and like subjects, wonderfully well done, but strongly marking her presumption and impiety.  Minerva could not forbear to admire, yet felt indignant at the insult.  She struck the web with her shuttle, and rent it in pieces; she then touched the forehead of Arachne, and made her feel her guilt and shame.  She could not endure it, and went and hanged herself.  Minerva pitied her as she saw her hanging by a rope.  &quot;Live, guilty woman,&quot; said she; &quot; and that you may preserve the memory of this lesson, continue to hang, you and your descendants, to all future times.&quot;  She sprinkled her with the juices of aconite, and immediately her hair came off, and her nose and ears likewise.  Her form shrank up, and her head grew smaller yet; her fingers grew to her side, and served for legs. All the rest of her is body, out of which she spins her thread, often hanging suspended by it, in the same attitude as when Minerva touched her and transformed her into a spider. Spenser tells the story of Arachne in his Muiopotmos, adhering very closely to his master Ovid, but improving upon him in the conclusion of the story.  The two stanzas which follow tell what was done after the goddess had depicted her creation of the olive tree: &quot;Amongst these leaves she made a Butterfly, With excellent device and wondrous slight, Fluttering among the olives wantonly, That seemed to live, so like it was in sight; The velvet nap which on his wings doth lie, The silken down with which his back is dight, His broad outstretched horns, his hairy thighs, His glorious colors, and his glistening eyes.&quot; &quot;Which when Arachne saw, as overlaid And mastered with workmanship so rare. She stood astonished long, ne aught gainsaid; And with fast-fixed eyes on her did stare, And by her silence, sign of one dismayed, The victory did yield her as her share; Yet did she inly fret and felly burn, And all her blood to poisonous rancor turn.&quot; And so the metamorphosis is caused by Arachne&#x27;s own mortification and vexation, and not by any direct act of the goddess. The following specimen of old-fashioned gallantry is by Garrick: UPON A LADY&#x27;S EMBROIDERY &quot;Arachne once, as poets tell, A goddess at her art defied, And soon the daring mortal fell The hapless victim of her pride. &quot;Oh, then, beware Arachne&#x27;s fate; Be prudent, Chloe, and submit, For you&#x27;ll most surely meet her hate, Who rival both her art and wit.&quot; Tennyson, in his Palace of Art, describing the works of art with which the palace was adorned, thus alludes to Europa: &quot;------ sweet Europa&#x27;s mantle blew unclasped &gt;From off her shoulder, backward borne, &gt;From one hand drooped a crocus, one hand grasped The mild bull&#x27;s golden horn.&quot; In his Princess there is this allusion to Danae: &quot;Now lies the earth all Danae to the stars, And all thy heart lies open unto me.&quot; NIOBE The fate of Arachne was noised abroad through all the country, and served as a warning to all presumptuous mortals not to compare themselves with the divinities.  But one, and she a matron too, failed to learn the lesson of humility.  It was Niobe, the queen of Thebes.  She had indeed much to be proud of; but it was not her husband&#x27;s fame, nor her own beauty, nor their great descent, nor the power of their kingdom that elated her. It was her children; and truly the happiest of mothers would Niobe have been, if only she had not claimed to be so.  It was on occasion of the annual celebration in honor of Latona and her offspring,   Apollo and Diana,   when the people of Thebes were assembled, their brows crowned with laurel, bearing frankincense to the altars and paying their vows,   that Niobe appeared among the crowd.  Her attire was splendid with gold and gems, and her face as beautiful as the face of an angry woman can be.  She stood and surveyed the people with haughty looks.  &quot;What folly,&quot; said she, &quot;is this!   to prefer beings whom you never saw to those who stand before your eyes!  Why should Latona be honored with worship rather than I?  My father was Tantalus, who was received as a guest at the table of the gods; my mother was a goddess.  My husband built and rules this city, Thebes; and Phrygia is my paternal inheritance.  Wherever I turn my eyes I survey the elements of my power; nor is my form and presence unworthy of a goddess.  To all this let me add, I have seven sons and seven daughters, and look for sons-in-law and daughters-in- law of pretensions worthy of my alliance.  Have I not cause for pride?  Will you prefer to me this Latona, the Titan&#x27;s daughter, with her two children?  I have seven times as many.  Fortunate indeed am I, and fortunate I shall remain!  Will any one deny this?  My abundance is my security.  I feel myself too strong for Fortune to subdue.  She may take from me much; I shall still have much left.  Were I to lose some of my children, I should hardly be left as poor as Latona with her two only.  Away with you from these solemnities,   put off the laurel from your brows,   have done with this worship!&quot;  The people obeyed, and left the sacred services uncompleted. The goddess was indignant.  On top of Mount Cynthus where she dwelt, she thus addressed her son and daughter: &quot;My children, I who have been so proud of you both, and have been used to hold myself second to none of the goddesses except Juno alone, begin now to doubt whether I am indeed a goddess.  I shall be deprived of my worship altogether unless you protect me.&quot;  She was proceeding in this strain, but Apollo interrupted her.  &quot;Say no more,&quot; said he; &quot;speech only delays punishment.&quot;  So said Diana also.  Darting through the air, veiled in clouds, they alighted on the towers of the city.  Spread out before the gates was a broad plain, where the youth of the city pursued their warlike sports.  The sons of Niobe were there among the rest,   some mounted on spirited horses richly caparisoned, some driving gay chariots.  Ismenos, the first-born, as he guided his foaming steeds, struck with an arrow from above, cried out, &quot;Ah, me!&quot; dropped the reins and fell lifeless.  Another, hearing the sound of the bow,   like a boatman who sees the storm gathering and makes all sail for the port,   gave the rein to his horses and attempted to escape.  The inevitable arrow overtook him as he fled.  Two others, younger boys, just from their tasks, had gone to the playground to have a game of wrestling.  As they stood breast to breast, one arrow pierced them both.  They uttered a cry together, together cast a parting look around them, and together breathed their last.  Alphenor, an elder brother, seeing them fall, hastened to the spot to render them assistance, and fell stricken in the act of brotherly duty.  One only was left, Ilioneus.  He raised his arms to heaven to try whether prayer might not avail.  &quot;Spare me, ye gods!&quot; he cried, addressing all, in his ignorance that all needed not his intercession; and Apollo would have spared him, but the arrow had already left the string, and it was too late.</div></div></div><div class="loadMoreContainer_e0JO"><button class="loadMoreButton_XJEe">See
