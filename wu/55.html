ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle I have never known my friend to be in better form, both mental and physical, than in the year &#x27;95. His increasing fame had brought with it an immense practice, and I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I were even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in Baker Street. Holmes, however, like all great artists, lived for his art&#x27;s sake, and, save in the case of the Duke of Holdernesse, I have seldom known him claim any large reward for his inestimable services. So unworldly was he- or so capricious- that he frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the problem made no appeal to his sympathies, while he would devote weeks of most intense application to the affairs of some humble client whose case presented those strange and dramatic qualities which appealed to his imagination and challenged his ingenuity. In this memorable year &#x27;95, a curious and incongruous succession of cases had engaged his attention, ranging from his famous investigation of the sudden death of Cardinal Tosca- an inquiry which was carried out by him at the express desire of His Holiness the Pope- down to his arrest of Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which removed a plague-spot from the East End of London. Close on the heels of these two famous cases came the tragedy of Woodman&#x27;s Lee, and the very obscure circumstances which surrounded the death of Captain Peter Carey. No record of the doings of Mr. Sherlock Holmes would be complete which did not include some account of this very unusual affair. During the first week of July, my friend had been absent so often and so long from our lodgings that I knew he had something on hand. The fact that several rough-looking men called during that time and inquired for Captain Basil made me understand that Holmes was working somewhere under one of the numerous disguises and names with which he concealed his own formidable identity. He had at least five small refuges in different parts of London, in which he was able to change his personality. He said nothing of his business to me, and it was not my habit to force a confidence. The first positive sign which he gave me of the direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one. He had gone out before breakfast, and I had sat down to mine when he strode into the room, his hat upon his head and a huge barbed-headed spear tucked like an umbrella under his arm. &quot;Good gracious, Holmes!&quot; I cried. &quot;You don&#x27;t mean to say that you have been walking about London with that thing?&quot; &quot;I drove to the butcher&#x27;s and back.&quot; &quot;The butcher&#x27;s?&quot; &quot;And I return with an excellent appetite. There can be no question, my dear Watson, of the value of exercise before breakfast. But I am prepared to bet that you will not guess the form that my exercise has taken.&quot; &quot;I will not attempt it.&quot; He chuckled as he poured out the coffee. &quot;If you could have looked into Allardyce&#x27;s back shop, you would have seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling, and a gentleman in his shirt sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this weapon. I was that energetic person, and I have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my strength can I transfix the pig with a single blow. Perhaps you would care to try?&quot; &quot;Not for worlds. But why were you doing this?&quot; &quot;Because it seemed to me to have an indirect bearing upon the mystery of Woodman&#x27;s Lee. Ah, Hopkins, I got your wire last night, and I have been expecting you. Come and join us.&quot; Our visitor was an exceedingly alert man, thirty years of age, dressed in a quiet tweed suit, but retaining the erect bearing of one who was accustomed to official uniform. I recognized him at once as Stanley Hopkins, a young police inspector, for whose future Holmes had high hopes, while he in turn professed the admiration and respect of a pupil for the scientific methods of the famous amateur. Hopkins&#x27;s brow was clouded, and he sat down with an air of deep dejection. &quot;No, thank you, sir. I breakfasted before I came round. I spent the night in town, for I came up yesterday to report.&quot; &quot;And what had you to report?&quot; &quot;Failure, sir, absolute failure.&quot; &quot;You have made no progress?&quot; &quot;None.&quot; &quot;Dear me! I must have a look at the matter.&quot; &quot;I wish to heavens that you would, Mr. Holmes. It&#x27;s my first big chance, and I am at my wit&#x27;s end. For goodness&#x27; sake, come down and lend me a hand.&quot; &quot;Well, well, it just happens that I have already read all the available evidence, including the report of the inquest, with some care. By the way, what do you make of that tobacco pouch, found on the scene of the crime? Is there no clue there?&quot; Hopkins looked surprised. &quot;It was the man&#x27;s own pouch, sir. His initials were inside it. And it was of sealskin,- and he was an old sealer.&quot; &quot;But he had no pipe.&quot; &quot;No, sir, we could find no pipe. Indeed, he smoked very little, and yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends.&quot; &quot;No doubt. I only mention it because, if I had been handling the case, I should have been inclined to make that the starting-point of my investigation. However, my friend, Dr. Watson, knows nothing of this matter, and I should be none the worse for hearing the sequence of events once more. Just give us some short sketches of the essentials.&quot; Stanley Hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket. &quot;I have a few dates here which will give you the career of the dead man, Captain Peter Carey. He was born in &#x27;45- fifty years of age. He was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher. In 1883 he commanded the steam sealer Sea Unicorn, of Dundee. He had then had several successful voyages in succession, and in the following year, 1884, he retired. After that he travelled for some years, and finally he bought a small place called Woodman&#x27;s Lee, near Forest Row, in Sussex. There he has lived for six years, and there he died just a week ago to-day. &quot;There were some most singular points about the man. In ordinary life, he was a strict Puritan- a silent, gloomy fellow. His household consisted of his wife, his daughter, aged twenty, and two female servants. These last were continually changing, for it was never a very cheery situation, and sometimes it became past all bearing. The man was an intermittent drunkard, and when he had the fit on him he was a perfect fiend. He has been known to drive his wife and daughter out of doors in the middle of the night and flog them through the park until the whole village outside the gates was aroused by their screams. &quot;He was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar, who had called upon him to remonstrate with him upon his conduct. In short, Mr. Holmes, you would go far before you found a more dangerous man than Peter Carey, and I have heard that he bore the same character when he commanded his ship. He was known in the trade as Black Peter, and the name was given him, not only on account of his swarthy features and the colour of his huge beard, but for the humours which were the terror of all around him. I need not say that he was loathed and avoided by every one of his neighbours, and that I have not heard one single word of sorrow about his terrible end. &quot;You must have read in the account of the inquest about the man&#x27;s cabin, Mr. Holmes, but perhaps your friend here has not heard of it. He had built himself a wooden outhouse- he always called it the &#x27;cabin&#x27;- a few hundred yards from his house, and it was here that he slept every night. It was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet by ten. He kept the key in his pocket, made his own bed, cleaned it himself, and allowed no other foot to cross the threshold. There are small windows on each side, which were covered by curtains and never opened. One of these windows was turned towards the high road, and when the light burned in it at night the folk used to point it out to each other and wonder what Black Peter was doing in there. That&#x27;s the window, Mr. Holmes, which gave us one of the few bits of positive evidence that came out at the inquest. &quot;You remember that a stonemason, named Slater, walking from Forest Row about one o&#x27;clock in the morning- two days before the murder- stopped as he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining among the trees. He swears that the shadow of a man&#x27;s head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind, and that this shadow was certainly not that of Peter Carey, whom he knew well. It was that of a bearded man, but the beard was short and bristled forward in a way very different from that of the captain. So he says, but he had been two hours in the public-house, and it is some distance from the road to the window. Besides, this refers to the Monday, and the crime was done upon the Wednesday. &quot;On the Tuesday, Peter Carey was in one of his blackest moods, flushed with drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast. He roamed about the house, and the women ran for it when they heard him coming. Late in the evening, he went down to his own hut. About two o&#x27;clock the following morning, his daughter, who slept with her window open, heard a most fearful yell from that direction, but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl and shout when he was in drink, so no notice was taken. On rising at seven, one of the maids noticed that the door of the hut was open, but so great was the terror which the man caused that it was midday before anyone would venture down to see what had become of him. Peeping into the open door, they saw a sight which sent them flying, with white faces, into the village. Within an hour, I was on the spot and had taken over the case. &quot;Well, I have fairly steady nerves, as you know, Mr. Holmes, but I give you my word, that I got a shake when I put my head into that little house. It was droning like a harmonium with the flies and bluebottles, and the floor and walls were like a slaughter-house. He had called it a cabin, and a cabin it was, sure enough, for you would have thought that you were in a ship. There was a bunk at one end, a sea-chest, maps and charts, a picture of the Sea Unicorn, a line of logbooks on a shelf, all exactly as one would expect to find it in a captain&#x27;s room. And there, in the middle of it, was the man himself- his face twisted like a lost soul in torment, and his great brindled beard stuck upward in his agony. Right through his broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven, and it had sunk deep into the wood of the wall behind him. He was pinned like a beetle on a card. Of course, he was quite dead, and had been so from the instant that he had uttered that last yell of agony. &quot;I know your methods, sir, and I applied them. Before I permitted anything to be moved, I examined most carefully the ground outside, and also the floor of the room. There were no footmarks.&quot; &quot;Meaning that you saw none?&quot; &quot;I assure you, sir, that there were none.&quot; &quot;My good Hopkins, I have investigated many crimes, but I have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature. As long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation, some abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher. It is incredible that this blood-bespattered room contained no trace which could have aided us. I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?&quot; The young inspector winced at my companion&#x27;s ironical comments. &quot;I was a fool not to call you in at the time Mr. Holmes. However, that&#x27;s past praying for now. Yes, there were several objects in the room which called for special attention. One was the harpoon with which the deed was committed. It had been snatched down from a rack on the wall. Two others remained there, and there was a vacant place for the third. On the stock was engraved &#x27;SS. Sea Unicorn, Dundee.&#x27; This seemed to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury, and that the murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way. The fact that the crime was committed at two in the morning, and yet Peter Carey was fully dressed, suggested that he had an appointment with the murderer, which is home out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty glasses stood upon the table.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Holmes; &quot;I think that both inferences are permissible. Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?&quot; &quot;Yes, there was a tantalus containing brandy and whisky on the sea-chest. It is of no importance to us, however, since the decanters were full, and it had therefore not been used.&quot; &quot;For all that, its presence has some significance,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;However, let us hear some more about the objects which do seem to you to bear upon the case.&quot; &quot;There was this tobacco-pouch upon the table.&quot; &quot;What part of the table?&quot; &quot;It lay in the middle. It was of coarse sealskin- the straight-haired skin, with a leather thong to bind it. Inside was &#x27;P.C.&#x27; on the flap. There was half an ounce of strong ship&#x27;s tobacco in it.&quot; &quot;Excellent! What more?&quot; Stanley Hopkins drew from his pocket a drab-covered notebook. The outside was rough and worn, the leaves discoloured. On the first page were written the initials &quot;J.H.N.&quot; and the date &quot;1883.&quot; Holmes laid it on the table and examined it in his minute way, while Hopkins and I gazed over each shoulder. On the second page were the printed letters &quot;C.P.R.,&quot; and then came several sheets of numbers. Another heading was &quot;Argentine,&quot; another &quot;Costa Rica,&quot; and another &quot;San Paulo,&quot; each with pages of signs and figures after it. &quot;What do you make of these?&quot; asked Holmes. &quot;They appear to be lists of Stock Exchange securities. I thought that &#x27;J.H.N.&#x27; were the initials of a broker, and that &#x27;C.P.R.&#x27; may have been his client.&quot; &quot;Try Canadian Pacific Railway,&quot; said Holmes. Stanley Hopkins swore between his teeth, and struck his thigh with his clenched hand. &quot;What a fool I have been!&quot; he cried. &quot;Of course, it is as you say. Then &#x27;J.H.N.&#x27; are the only initials we have to solve. I have already examined the old Stock Exchange lists, and I can find no one in 1883, either in the house or among the outside brokers, whose initials correspond with these. Yet I feel that the clue is the most important one that I hold. You will admit, Mr. Holmes, that there is a possibility that these initials are those of the second person who was present- in other words, of the murderer. I would also urge that the introduction into the case of a document relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us for the first time some indication of a motive for the crime.&quot; Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s face showed that he was thoroughly taken aback by this new development. &quot;I must admit both your points,&quot; said he. &quot;I confess that this notebook, which did not appear at the inquest, modifies any views which I may have formed. I had come to a theory of the crime in which I can find no place for this. Have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned?&quot; &quot;Inquiries are now being made at the offices, but I fear that the complete register of the stockholders of these South American concerns is in South America, and that some weeks must elapse before we can trace the shares.&quot; Holmes had been examining the cover of the notebook with his magnifying lens. &quot;Surely there is some discolouration here,&quot; said he. &quot;Yes, sir, it is a blood-stain. I told you that I picked the book off the floor.&quot; &quot;Was the blood-stain above or below?&quot; &quot;On the side next the boards.&quot; &quot;Which proves, of course, that the book was dropped after the crime was committed.&quot; &quot;Exactly, Mr. Holmes. I appreciated that point, and I conjectured that it was dropped by the murderer in his hurried flight. It lay near the door.&quot; &quot;I suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man?&quot; &quot;No, sir.&quot; &quot;Have you any reason to suspect robbery?&quot; &quot;No, sir. Nothing seemed to have been touched.&quot; &quot;Dear me, it is certainly a very interesting case. Then there was a knife, was there not?&quot; &quot;A sheath-knife, still in its sheath. It lay at the feet of the dead man. Mrs. Carey has identified it as being her husband&#x27;s property.&quot; Holmes was lost in thought for some time. &quot;Well,&quot; said he, at last, &quot;I suppose I shall have to come out and have a look at it.&quot; Stanley Hopkins gave a cry of joy. &quot;Thank you, sir. That will, indeed, be a weight off my mind.&quot; Holmes shook his finger at the inspector. &quot;It would have been an easier task a week ago,&quot; said he. &quot;But even now my visit may not be entirely fruitless. Watson, if you can spare the time, I should be very glad of your company. If you will call a four-wheeler, Hopkins, we shall be ready to start for Forest Row in a quarter of an hour.&quot; Alighting at the small wayside station, we drove for some miles through the remains of widespread woods, which were once part of that great forest which for so long held the Saxon invaders at bay- the impenetrable &quot;weald,&quot; for sixty years the bulwark of Britain. Vast sections of it have been cleared, for this is the seat of the first iron-works of the country, and the trees have been felled to smelt the ore. Now the richer fields of the North have absorbed the trade, and nothing save these ravaged groves and great scars in the earth show the work of the past. Here, in a clearing upon the green slope of a hill, stood a long, low, stone house, approached by a curving drive running through the fields. Nearer the road, and surrounded on three sides by bushes, was a small outhouse, one window and the door facing in our direction. It was the scene of the murder. Stanley Hopkins led us first to the house, where he introduced us to a haggard, gray-haired woman, the widow of the murdered man, whose gaunt and deep-lined face, with the furtive look of terror in the depths of her red-rimmed eyes, told of the years of hardship and ill-usage which she had endured. With her was her daughter, a pale, fair-haired girl, whose eyes blazed defiantly at us as she told us that she was glad that her father was dead, and that she blessed the hand which had struck him down. It was a terrible household that Black Peter Carey had made for himself, and it was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves in the sunlight again and making our way along a path which had been worn across the fields by the feet of the dead man. The outhouse was the simplest of dwellings, wooden-walled, shingle-roofed, one window beside the door and one on the farther side. Stanley Hopkins drew the key from his pocket and had stooped to the lock, when he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon his face. Somone has been tampering with it,&quot; he said. There could be no doubt of the fact. The woodwork was cut, and the scratches showed white through the paint, as if they had been that instant done. Holmes had been examining the window. &quot;Someone has tried to force this also. Whoever it was has failed to make his way in. He must have been a very poor burglar.&quot; &quot;This is a most extraordinary thing,&quot; said the inspector, &quot;I could swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening.&quot; &quot;Some curious person from the village, perhaps,&quot; I suggested. &quot;Very unlikely. Few of them would dare to set foot in the grounds, far less try to force their way into the cabin. What do you think of it, Mr. Holmes?&quot; &quot;I think that fortune is very kind to us.&quot; &quot;You mean that the person will come again?&quot; &quot;It is very probable. He came expecting to find the door open. He tried to get in with the blade of a very small penknife. He could not manage it. What would he do?&quot; &quot;Come again next night with a more useful tool.&quot; &quot;So I should say. It will be our fault if we are not there to receive him. Meanwhile, let me see the inside of the cabin.&quot; The traces of the tragedy had been removed, but the furniture within the little room still stood as it had been on the night of the crime. For two hours, with most intense concentration, Holmes examined every object in turn, but his face showed that his quest was not a successful one. Once only he paused in his patient investigation. &quot;Have you taken anything off this shelf, Hopkins?&quot; &quot;No, I have moved nothing.&quot; &quot;Something has been taken. There is less dust in this corner of the shelf than elsewhere. It may have been a book lying on its side. It may have been a box. Well, well, I can do nothing more. Let us walk in these beautiful woods, Watson, and give a few hours to the birds and the flowers. We shall meet you here later, Hopkins, and see if we can come to closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit in the night.&quot; It was past eleven o&#x27;clock when we formed our little ambuscade. Hopkins was for leaving the door of the hut open, but Holmes was of the opinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger. The lock was a perfectly simple one, and only a strong blade was needed to push it back. Holmes also suggested that we should wait, not inside the hut, but outside it, among the bushes which grew round the farther window. In this way we should be able to watch our man if he struck a light, and see what his object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit. It was a long and melancholy vigil, and yet brought with it something of the thrill which the bunter feels when he lies beside the water-pool, and waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of prey. What savage creature was it which might steal upon us out of the darkness? Was it a fierce tiger of crime, which could only be taken fighting hard with flashing fang and claw, or would it prove to be some skulking jackal, dangerous only to the weak and unguarded? In absolute silence we crouched amongst the bushes, waiting for whatever might come. At first the steps of a few belated villagers, or the sound of voices from the village, lightened our vigil, but one by one these interruptions died away, and an absolute stillness fell upon us, save for the chimes of the distant church, which told us of the progress of the night, and for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid the foliage which roofed us in. Half-past two had chimed, and it was the darkest hour which precedes the dawn, when we all started as a low but sharp click came from the direction of the gate. Someone had entered the drive. Again there was a long silence, and I had begun to fear that it was a false alarm, when a stealthy step was heard upon the other side of the hut, and a moment later a metallic scraping and clinking. The man was trying to force the lock. This time his skill was greater or his tool was better, for there was a sudden snap and the creak of the hinges. Then a match was struck, and next instant the steady light from a candle filled the interior of the hut. Through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riveted upon the scene within. The nocturnal visitor was a young man, frail and thin, with a black moustache, which intensified the deadly pallor of his face. He could not have been much above twenty years of age. I have never seen any human being who appeared to be in such a pitiable fright, for his teeth were visibly chattering, and he was shaking in every limb. He was dressed like a gentleman, in Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers, with a cloth cap upon his head. We watched him staring round with frightened eyes. Then he laid the candle-end upon the table and disappeared from our view into one of the corners. He returned with a large book, one of the logbooks which formed a line upon the shelves. Leaning on the table, he rapidly turned over the leaves of this volume until he came to the entry which he sought. Then, with an angry gesture of his clenched hand, he closed the book, replaced it in the corner, and put out the light. He had hardly turned to leave the hut when Hopkins&#x27;s hand was on the fellow&#x27;s collar, and I heard his loud gasp of terror as he understood that he was taken. The candle was relit, and there was our wretched captive, shivering and cowering in the grasp of the detective. He sank down upon the sea-chest, and looked helplessly from one of us to the other. &quot;Now, my fine fellow,&quot; said Stanley Hopkins, &quot;who are you, and what do you want here?&quot; The man pulled himself together, and faced us with an effort at self-composure. &quot;You are detectives, I suppose?&quot; said he. &quot;You imagine I am connected with the death of Captain Peter Carey. I assure you that I am innocent.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ll see about that,&quot; said Hopkins. &quot;First of all, what is your name?&quot; &quot;It is John Hopley Neligan.&quot; I saw Holmes and Hopkins exchange a quick glance. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; &quot;Can I speak confidentially?&quot; &quot;No, certainly not.&quot; &quot;Why should I tell you?&quot; &quot;If you have no answer, it may go badly with you at the trial.&quot; The young man winced. &quot;Well, I will tell you,&quot; he said. &quot;Why should I not? And yet I hate to think of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life. Did you ever hear of Dawson and Neligan?&quot; I could see, from Hopkins&#x27;s face, that he never had, but Holmes was keenly interested. &quot;You mean the West Country bankers,&quot; said he. &quot;They failed for a million, ruined half the county families of Cornwall, and Neligan disappeared.&quot; &quot;Exactly. Neligan was my father.&quot; At last we were getting something positive, and yet it seemed a long gap between an absconding banker and Captain Peter Carey pinned against the wall with one of his own harpoons. We all listened intently to the young man&#x27;s words. &quot;It was my father who was really concerned. Dawson had retired. I was only ten years of age at the time, but I was old enough to feel the shame and horror of it all. It has always been said that my father stole all the securities and fled. It is not true. It was his belief that if he were given time in which to realize them, all would be well and every creditor paid in full. He started in his little yacht for Norway just before the warrant was issued for his arrest. I can remember that last night when he bade farewell to my mother. He left us a list of the securities he was taking, and he swore that he would come back with his honour cleared, and that none who had trusted him would suffer. Well, no word was ever heard from him again. Both the yacht and he vanished utterly. We believed, my mother and I, that he and it, with the securities that he had taken with him, were at the bottom of the sea. We had a faithful friend, however, who is a business man, and it was he who discovered some time ago that some of the securities which my father had with him had reappeared on the London market. You can imagine our amazement. I spent months in trying to trace them, and at last, after many doubtings and difficulties, I discovered that the original seller had been Captain Peter Carey, the owner of this hut. &quot;Naturally, I made some inquiries about the man. I found that he had been in command of a whaler which was due to return from the Arctic seas at the very time when my father was crossing to Norway. The autumn of that year was a stormy one, and there was a long succession of southerly gales. My father&#x27;s yacht may well have been blown to the north, and there met by Captain Peter Carey&#x27;s ship. If that were so, what had become of my father? In any case, if I could prove from Peter Carey&#x27;s evidence how these securities came on the market it would be a proof that my father had not sold them, and that he had no view to personal profit when he took them. &quot;I came down to Sussex with the intention of seeing the captain, but it was at this moment that his terrible death occurred. I read at the inquest a description of his cabin, in which it stated that the old logbooks of his vessel were preserved in it. It struck me that if I could see what occurred in the month of August, 1883, on board the Sea Unicorn, I might settle the mystery of my father&#x27;s fate. I tried last night to get at these logbooks, but was unable to open the door. To-night I tried again and succeeded, but I find that the pages which deal with that month have been torn from the book. It was at that moment I found myself a prisoner in your hands.&quot; &quot;Is that all?&quot; asked Hopkins. &quot;Yes, that is all.&quot; His eyes shifted as he said it. &quot;You have nothing else to tell us?&quot; He hesitated. &quot;No, there is nothing.&quot; &quot;You have not been here before last night?&quot; &quot;No. &quot;Then how do you account for that?&quot; cried Hopkins, as he held up the damning notebook, with the initials of our prisoner on the first leaf and the blood-stain on the cover. The wretched man collapsed. He sank his face in his hands, and trembled all over. &quot;Where did you get it?&quot; he groaned. &quot;I did not know. I thought I had lost it at the hotel.&quot; &quot;That is enough,&quot; said Hopkins, sternly. &quot;Whatever else you have to say, you must say in court. You will walk down with me now to the police-station. Well, Mr. Holmes, I am very much obliged to you and to your friend for coming down to help me. As it turns out your presence was unnecessary, and I would have brought the case to this successful issue without you, but, none the less, I am grateful. Rooms have been reserved for you at the Brambletye Hotel, so we can all walk down to the village together.&quot; &quot;Well, Watson, what do you think of it?&quot; asked Holmes, as we travelled back next morning. &quot;I can see that you are not satisfied.&quot; &quot;Oh, yes, my dear Watson, I am perfectly satisfied. At the same time, Stanley Hopkins&#x27;s methods do not commend themselves to me. I am disappointed in Stanley Hopkins. I had hoped for better things from him. One should always look for a possible alternative, and provide against it. It is the first rule of criminal investigation.&quot; &quot;What, then, is the alternative?&quot; &quot;The line of investigation which I have myself been pursuing. It may give us nothing. I cannot tell. But at least I shall follow it to the end.&quot; Several letters were waiting for Holmes at Baker Street. He snatched one of them up, opened it, and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of laughter. &quot;Excellent, Watson! The alternative develops. Have you telegraph forms? Just write a couple of messages for me: &#x27;Sumner, Shipping Agent, Ratcliff Highway. Send three men on, to arrive ten to-morrow morning.- Basil.&#x27; That&#x27;s my name in those parts. The other is: &#x27;Inspector Stanley Hopkins, 46 Lord Street, Brixton. Come breakfast to-morrow at nine-thirty. Important. Wire if unable to come.- Sherlock Holmes.&#x27; There, Watson, this infernal case has haunted me for ten days. I hereby banish it completely from my presence. To-morrow, I trust that we shall hear the last of it forever.&quot; Sharp at the hour named Inspector Stanley Hopkins appeared, and we sat down together to the excellent breakfast which Mrs. Hudson had prepared. The young detective was in high spirits at his success. &quot;You really think that your solution must be correct?&quot; asked Holmes. &quot;I could not imagine a more complete case.&quot; &quot;It did not seem to me conclusive.&quot; &quot;You astonish me, Mr. Holmes. What more could one ask for?&quot; &quot;Does your explanation cover every point?&quot; &quot;Undoubtedly. I find that young Neligan arrived at the Brambletye Hotel on the very day of the crime. He came on the pretence of playing golf. His room was on the ground-floor, and he could get out when he liked. That very night he went down to Woodman&#x27;s Lee, saw Peter Carey at the hut, quarrelled with him, and killed him with the harpoon. Then, horrified by what he had done, he fled out of the hut, dropping the notebook which he had brought with him in order to question Peter Carey about these different securities. You may have observed that some of them were marked with ticks, and the others- the great majority- were not. Those which are ticked have been traced on the London market, but the others, presumably, were still in the possession of Carey, and young Neligan, according to his own account, was anxious to recover them in order to do the right thing by his father&#x27;s creditors. After his flight he did not dare to approach the hut again for some time, but at last he forced himself to do so in order to obtain the information which he needed. Surely that is all simple and obvious?&quot; Holmes smiled and shook his head. &quot;It seems to me to have only one drawback, Hopkins, and that is that it is intrinsically impossible. Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body? No? Tut, tut my dear sir, you must really pay attention to these details. My friend Watson could tell you that I spent a whole morning in that exercise. It is no easy matter, and requires a strong and practised arm. But this blow was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep into the wall. Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault? Is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and water with Black Peter in the dead of the night? Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before? No, no, Hopkins, it is another and more formidable person for whom we must seek.&quot; The detective&#x27;s face had grown longer and longer during Holmes&#x27;s speech. His hopes and his ambitions were all crumbling about him. But he would not abandon his position without a struggle. &quot;You can&#x27;t deny that Neligan was present that night, Mr. Holmes. The book will prove that. I fancy that I have evidence enough to satisfy a jury, even if you are able to pick a hole in it. Besides, Mr. Holmes, I have laid my hand upon my man. As to this terrible person of yours, where is he?&quot; &quot;I rather fancy that he is on the stair,&quot; said Holmes, serenely. &quot;I think, Watson, that you would do well to put that revolver where you can reach it.&quot; He rose and laid a written paper upon a side-table. &quot;Now we are ready,&quot; said he. There had been some talking in gruff voices outside, and now Mrs. Hudson opened the door to say that there were three men inquiring for Captain Basil. &quot;Show them in one by one,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;The first who entered was a little Ribston pippin of a man, with ruddy cheeks and fluffy white side-whiskers. Holmes had drawn a letter from his pocket. &quot;What name?&quot; he asked. &quot;James Lancaster.&quot; &quot;I am sorry, Lancaster, but the berth is full. Here is half a sovereign for your trouble. Just step into this room and wait there for a few minutes.&quot; The second man was a long, dried-up creature, with lank hair and sallow cheeks. His name was Hugh Pattins. He also received his dismissal, his half-sovereign, and the order to wait. The third applicant was a man of remarkable appearance. A fierce bull-dog face was framed in a tangle of hair and beard, and two bold, dark eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick, tufted, overhung eyebrows. He saluted and stood sailor-fashion, turning his cap round in his hands. &quot;Your name?&quot; asked Holmes. &quot;Patrick Cairns.&quot; &quot;Harpooner?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir. Twenty-six voyages.&quot; &quot;Dundee, I suppose?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;And ready to start with an exploring ship?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;What wages?&quot; &quot;Eight pounds a month.&quot; &quot;Could you start at once?&quot; &quot;As soon as I get my kit.&quot; &quot;Have you your papers?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; He took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his pocket. Holmes glanced over them and returned them. &quot;You are just the man I want,&quot; said he. &quot;Here&#x27;s the agreement on the sidetable. If you sign it the whole matter will be settled.&quot; The seaman lurched across the room and took up the pen. &quot;Shall I sign here?&quot; he asked, stooping over the table. Holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his neck. &quot;This will do,&quot; said he. I heard a click of steel and a bellow like an enraged bull. The next instant Holmes and the seaman were rolling on the ground together. He was a man of such gigantic strength that, even with the handcuffs which Holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrists, he would have very quickly overpowered my friend had Hopkins and I not rushed to his rescue. Only when I pressed the cold muzzle of the revolver to his temple did he at last understand that resistance was vain. We lashed his ankles with cord, and rose breathless from the struggle. &quot;I must really apologize, Hopkins,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes. &quot;I fear that the scrambled eggs are cold. However, you will enjoy the rest of your breakfast all the better, will you not, for the thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant conclusion.&quot; Stanley Hopkins was speechless with amazement. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to say, Mr. Holmes,&quot; he blurted out at last, with a very red face. &quot;It seems to me that I have been making a fool of myself from the beginning. I understand now, what I should never have forgotten, that I am the pupil and you are the master. Even now I see what you have done, but I don&#x27;t know how you did it or what it signifies.&quot; &quot;Well, well,&quot; said Holmes, good-humouredly. &quot;We all learn by experience, and your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the alternative. You were so absorbed in young Neligan that you could not spare a thought to Patrick Cairns, the true murderer of Peter Carey.&quot; The hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation. &quot;See here, mister,&quot; said he, &quot;I make no complaint of being man-handled in this fashion, but I would have you call things by their right names. You say I murdered Peter Carey, I say I killed Peter Carey, and there&#x27;s all the difference. Maybe you don&#x27;t believe what I say. Maybe you think I am just slinging you a yarn.&quot; &quot;Not at all,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Let us hear what you have to say.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s soon told, and, by the Lord, every word of it is truth. I knew Black Peter, and when he pulled out his knife I whipped a harpoon through him sharp, for I knew that it was him or me. That&#x27;s how he died. You can call it murder. Anyhow, I&#x27;d as soon die with a rope round my neck as with Black Peter&#x27;s knife in my heart.&quot; &quot;How came you there?&quot; asked Holmes. &quot;I&#x27;ll tell it you from the beginning. just sit me up a little, so as I can speak easy. It was in &#x27;83 that it happened- August of that year. Peter Carey was master of the Sea Unicorn, and I was spare harpooner. We were coming out of the ice-pack on our way home, with head winds and a week&#x27;s southerly gale, when we picked up a little craft that had been blown north. There was one man on her- a landsman. The crew had thought she would founder and had made for the Norwegian coast in the dinghy. I guess they were all drowned. Well, we took him on board, this man, and he and the skipper had some long talks in the cabin. All the baggage we took off with him was one tin box. So far as I know, the man&#x27;s name was never mentioned, and on the second night he disappeared as if he had never been. It was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having. Only one man knew what had happened to him, and that was me, for, with my own eyes, I saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the rail in the middle watch of a dark night, two days before we sighted the Shetland Lights. &quot;Well, I kept my knowledge to myself, and waited to see what would come of it When we got back to Scotland it was easily hushed up, and nobody asked any questions. A stranger died by accident and it was nobody&#x27;s business to inquire. Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the sea, and it was long years before I could find where he was. I guessed that he had done the deed for the sake of what was in that tin box, and that he could afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth shut. &quot;I found out where he was through a sailor man that had met him in London, and down I went to squeeze him. The first night he was reasonable enough, and was ready to give me what would make me free of the sea for life. We were to fix it all two nights later. When I came, I found him three parts drunk and in a vile temper. We sat down and we drank and we yarned about old times, but the more he drank the less I liked the look on his face. I spotted that harpoon upon the wall, and I thought I might need it before I was through. Then at last he broke out at me, spitting and cursing, with murder in his eyes and a great clasp-knife in his hand. He had not time to get it from the sheath before I had the harpoon through him. Heavens! what a yell he gave! and his face gets between me and my sleep. I stood there, with his blood splashing round me, and I waited for a bit, but all was quiet, so I took heart once more. I looked round, and there was the tin box on the shelf. I had as much right to it as Peter Carey, anyhow, so I took it with me and left the hut. Like a fool I left my baccy-pouch upon the table. &quot;Now I&#x27;ll tell you the queerest part of the whole story. I had hardly got outside the hut when I heard someone coming, and I hid among the bushes. A man came slinking along, went into the hut, gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost, and legged it as hard as he could run until he was out of sight. Who he was or what he wanted is more than I can tell. For my part I walked ten miles, got a train at Tunbridge Wells, and so reached London, and no one the wiser. &quot;Well, when I came to examine the box I found there was no money in it, and nothing but papers that I would not dare to sell. I had lost my hold on Black Peter and was stranded in London without a shilling. There was only my trade left. I saw these advertisements about harpooners, and high wages, so I went to the shipping agents, and they sent me here. That&#x27;s all I know, and I say again that if I killed Black Peter, the law should give me thanks, for I saved them the rice of a hempen rope.&quot; &quot;A very clear statement said Holmes, rising and lighting his pipe. &quot;I think, Hopkins, that you should lose no time in conveying your prisoner to a place of safety. This room is not well adapted for a cell, and Mr. Patrick Cairns occupies too large a proportion of our carpet.&quot; &quot;Mr. Holmes,&quot; said Hopkins, &quot;I do not know how to express my gratitude. Even now I do not understand how you attained this result.&quot; &quot;Simply by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the beginning. It is very possible if I had known about this notebook it might have led away my thoughts, as it did yours. But all I heard pointed in the one direction. The amazing strength, the skill in the use of the harpoon, the rum and water, the sealskin tobacco-pouch with the coarse tobacco-all these pointed to a seaman, and one who had been a whaler. I was convinced that the initials &#x27;P.C.&#x27; upon the pouch were a coincidence, and not those of Peter Carey, since he seldom smoked, and no pipe was found in his cabin. You remember that I asked whether whisky and brandy were in the cabin. You said they were. How many landsmen are there who would drink rum when they could get these other spirits? Yes, I was certain it was a seaman.&quot; &quot;And how did you find him?&quot; &quot;My dear sir, the problem had become a very simple one. If it were a seaman, it could only be a seaman who had been with him on the Sea Unicorn. So far as I could learn he had sailed in no other ship. I spent three days in wiring to Dundee, and at the end of that time I had ascertained the names of the crew of the Sea Unicorn in 1883. When I found Patrick Cairns among the harpooners, my research was nearing its end. I argued that the man was probably in London, and that he would desire to leave the country for a time. I therefore spent some days in the East End, devised an Arctic expedition, put forth tempting terms for harpooners who would serve under Captain Basil- and behold the result!&quot; &quot;Wonderful!&quot; cried Hopkins. &quot;Wonderful!&quot; &quot;You must obtain the release of young Neligan as soon as possible,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I confess that I think you owe him some apology. The tin box must be returned to him, but, of course, the securities which Peter Carey has sold are lost forever. There&#x27;s the cab, Hopkins, and you can remove your man. If you want me for the trial, my address and that of Watson will be somewhere in Norway- I&#x27;ll send particulars later.&quot; -THE END- . 1904 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON It is years since the incidents of which I speak took place, and yet it is with diffidence that I allude to them. For a long time, even with the utmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make the facts public, but now the principal person concerned is beyond the reach of human law, and with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no one. It records an absolutely unique experience in the career both of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and of myself. The reader will excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by which he might trace the actual occurrence. We had been out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had returned about six o&#x27;clock on a cold, frosty winter&#x27;s evening. As Holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. He glanced at it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor. I picked it up and read: CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON, Appledore Towers, Hampstead. Agent. &quot;Who is he?&quot; I asked. &quot;The worst man in London,&quot; Holmes answered, as he sat down and stretched his legs before the fire. &quot;Is anything on the back of the card?&quot; I turned it over. &quot;Will call at 6:30- C.A.M.,&quot; I read. &quot;Hum! He&#x27;s about due. Do you feel a creeping, shrinking sensation, Watson, when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo, and see the slithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and wicked, flattened faces? Well, that&#x27;s how Milverton impresses me. I&#x27;ve had to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. And yet I can&#x27;t get out of doing business with him- indeed, he is here at my invitation.&quot; &quot;But who is he?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you, Watson. He is the king of all the blackmailers. Heaven help the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come into the power of Milverton! With a smiling face and a heart of marble, he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. The fellow is a genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury trade. His method is as follows: He allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth and position. He receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians, who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women. He deals with no niggard hand. I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was the result. Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton, and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. No one knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth. He will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning. I have said that he is the worst man in London, and I would ask you how could one compare the ruffian, who in hot blood bludgeons his mate, with this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?&quot; I had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling. &quot;But surely,&quot; said I, &quot;the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?&quot; &quot;Technically, no doubt, but practically not. What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months&#x27; imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow? His victims dare not hit back. If ever he blackmailed an innocent person, then indeed we should have him, but he is as cunning as the Evil One. No, no, we must find other ways to fight him.&quot; &quot;And why is he here?&quot; &quot;Because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands. It is the Lady Eva Blackwell, the most beautiful debutante of last season. She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of Dovercourt. This fiend has several imprudent letters- imprudent, Watson, nothing worse- which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country. They would suffice to break off the match. Milverton will send the letters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. I have been commissioned to meet him, and- to make the best terms I can.&quot; At that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below. Looking down I saw a stately carriage and pair, the brilliant lamps gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts. A footman opened the door, and a small, stout man in a shaggy astrakhan overcoat descended. A minute later he was in the room. Charles Augustus Milverton was a man of fifty, with a large, intellectual head, a round, plump, hairless face, a perpetual frozen smile, and two keen gray eyes, which gleamed brightly from behind broad, gold-rimmed glasses. There was something of Mr. Pickwick&#x27;s benevolence in his appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes. His voice was as smooth and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with a plump little hand extended, murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first visit. Holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite. Milverton&#x27;s smile broadened, he shrugged his shoulders removed his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over the back of a chair, and then took a seat. &quot;This gentleman?&quot; said he, with a wave in my direction. &quot;Is it discreet? Is it right?&quot; &quot;Dr. Watson is my friend and partner.&quot; &quot;Very good, Mr. Holmes. It is only in your client&#x27;s interests that I protested. The matter is so very delicate-&quot; &quot;Dr. Watson has already heard of it.&quot; &quot;Then we can proceed to business. You say that you are acting for Lady Eva. Has she empowered you to accept my terms?&quot; &quot;What are your terms?&quot; &quot;Seven thousand pounds.&quot; &quot;And the alternative?&quot; &quot;My dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it, but if the money is not paid on the 14th, there certainly will be no marriage on the 18th.&quot; His insufferable smile was more complacent than ever. Holmes thought for a little. &quot;You appear to me,&quot; he said, at last, &quot;to be taking matters too much for granted. I am, of course, familiar with the contents of these letters. My client will certainly do what I may advise. I shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity.&quot; Milverton chuckled. &quot;You evidently do not know the Earl,&quot; said he. From the baffled look upon Holmes&#x27;s face, I could see clearly that he did. &quot;What harm is there in the letters?&quot; he asked. &quot;They are sprightly- very sprightly,&quot; Milverton answered. &quot;The lady was a charming correspondent. But I can assure you that the Earl of Dovercourt would fail to appreciate them. However, since you think otherwise, we will let it rest at that. It is purely a matter of business. If you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the Earl, then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them.&quot; He rose and seized his astrakhan coat. Holmes was gray with anger and mortification. &quot;Wait a little,&quot; he said. &quot;You go too fast. We should certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter.&quot; Milverton relapsed into his chair. &quot;I was sure that you would see it in that light,&quot; he purred. &quot;At the same time,&quot; Holmes continued, &quot;Lady Eva is not a wealthy woman. I assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources, and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power. I beg, therefore, that you will moderate your demands, and that you will return the letters at the price I indicate, which is, I assure you, the highest that you can get.&quot; Milverton&#x27;s smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously. &quot;I am aware that what you say is true about the lady&#x27;s resources,&quot; said he. &quot;At the same time you must admit that the occasion of a lady&#x27;s marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf. They may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present. Let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter-dishes in London.&quot; &quot;It is impossible,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Dear me, dear me, how unfortunate!&quot; cried Milverton, taking out a bulky pocketbook. &quot;I cannot help thinking that ladies are ill-advised in not making an effort. Look at this!&quot; He held up a little note with a coat-of-arms upon the envelope. &quot;That belongs to- well, perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until to-morrow morning. But at that time it will be in the hands of the lady&#x27;s husband. And all because she will not find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds into paste. It is such a pity! Now, you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the Honourable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking? Only two days before the wedding, there was a paragraph in the Morning Post to say that it was all off. And why? It is almost incredible, but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question. Is it not pitiful? And here I find you, a man of sense, boggling about terms, when your client&#x27;s future and honour are at stake. You surprise me, Mr. Holmes.&quot; &quot;What I say is true,&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;The money cannot be found. Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman&#x27;s career, which can profit you in no way?&quot; &quot;There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva, I should find all of them much more open to reason. You see my point?&quot; Holmes sprang from his chair. &quot;Get behind him, Watson! Don&#x27;t let him out! Now, sir, let us see the contents of that notebook.&quot; Milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room and stood with his back against the wall. &quot;Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,&quot; he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. &quot;I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.&quot; He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head, and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle, Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away. Holmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman, with a goatee beard and a swagger, lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. &quot;I&#x27;ll be back some time, Watson,&quot; said he, and vanished into the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton, but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take. For some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, be returned from his last expedition, and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion. &quot;You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?&quot; &quot;No, indeed!&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll be interested to hear that I&#x27;m engaged.&quot; &quot;My dear fellow! I congrat-&quot; &quot;To Milverton&#x27;s housemaid.&quot; &quot;Good heavens, Holmes!&quot; &quot;I wanted information, Watson.&quot; &quot;Surely you have gone too far?&quot; &quot;It was a most necessary step. I am a plumber with a rising business, Escott, by name. I have walked out with her each evening, and I have talked with her. Good heavens, those talks! However, I have got all I wanted. I know Milverton&#x27;s house as I know the palm of my hand.&quot; &quot;But the girl, Holmes?&quot; He shrugged his shoulders. &quot;You can&#x27;t help it, my dear Watson. You must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table. However, I rejoice to say that I have a hated rival, who will certainly cut me out the instant that my back is turned. What a splendid night it is!&quot; &quot;You like this weather?&quot; &quot;It suits my purpose. Watson, I mean to burgle Milverton&#x27;s house to-night.&quot; I had a catching of the breath, and my skin went cold at the words, which were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution. As a flash of lightning in the night shows up in an instant every detail of a wild landscape, so at one glance I seemed to see every possible result of such an action- the detection, the capture, the honoured career ending in irreparable failure and disgrace, my friend himself lying at the mercy of the odious Milverton. &quot;For heaven&#x27;s sake, Holmes, think what you are doing,&quot; I cried. &quot;My dear fellow, I have given it every consideration. I am never precipitate in my actions, nor would I adopt so energetic and, indeed, so dangerous a course, if any other were possible. Let us look at the matter clearly and fairly. I suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable, though technically criminal. To burgle his house is no more than to forcibly take his pocketbook- an action in which you were prepared to aid me.&quot; I turned it over in my mind. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose.&quot; Exactly. Since it is morally justifiable, I have only to consider the question of personal risk. Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress upon this, when a lady is in most desperate need of his help?&quot; &quot;You will be in such a false position.&quot; &quot;Well, that is part of the risk. There is no other possible way of regaining these letters. The unfortunate lady has not the money, and there are none of her people in whom she could confide. To-morrow is the last day of grace, and unless we can get the letters to-night, this villain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin. I must, therefore, abandon my client to her fate or I must play this last card. Between ourselves, Watson, it&#x27;s a sporting duel between this fellow Milverton and me. He had, as you saw, the best of the first exchanges, but my self-respect and my reputation are concerned to fight it to a finish.&quot; &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t like it, but I suppose it must be,&quot; said I. &quot;When do we start?&quot; &quot;You are not coming.&quot; &quot;Then you are not going,&quot; said I. &quot;I give you my word of honour- and I never broke it in my life- that I will take a cab straight to the police-station and give you away, unless you let me share this adventure with you.&quot; &quot;You can&#x27;t help me.&quot; &quot;How do you know that? You can&#x27;t tell what may happen. Anyway, my resolution is taken. Other people besides you have self-respect, and even reputations.&quot; Holmes had looked annoyed, but his brow cleared, and he clapped me on the shoulder. &quot;Well, well, my dear fellow, be it so. We have shared this same room for some years, and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the same cell. You know, Watson, I don&#x27;t mind confessing to you that I have always had an idea that I would have made a highly efficient criminal. This is the chance of my lifetime in that direction. See here!&quot; He took a neat little leather case out of a drawer, and opening it he exhibited a number of shining instruments. &quot;This is a first-class, up-to-date burgling kit, with nickel-plated jemmy, diamond-tipped glass-cutter, adaptable keys, and every modern improvement which the march of civilization demands. Here, too, is my dark lantern. Everything is in order. Have you a pair of silent shoes?&quot; &quot;I have rubber-soled tennis shoes.&quot; &quot;Excellent! And a mask?&quot; &quot;I can make a couple out of black silk.&quot; &quot;I can see that you have a strong, natural turn for this sort of thing. Very good, do you make the masks. We shall have some cold supper before we start. It is now nine-thirty. At eleven we shall drive as far as Church Row. It is a quarter of an hour&#x27;s walk from there to Appledore Towers. We shall be at work before midnight. Milverton is a heavy sleeper, and retires punctually at ten-thirty. With any luck we should be back here by two, with the Lady Eva&#x27;s letters in my pocket.&quot; Holmes and I put on our dress-clothes, so that we might appear to be two theatre-goers homeward bound. In Oxford Street we picked up a hansom and drove to an address in Hampstead. Here we paid off our cab, and with our great coats buttoned up, for it was bitterly cold, and the wind seemed to blow through us, we walked along the edge of the heath. &quot;It&#x27;s a business that needs delicate treatment,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;These documents are contained in a safe in the fellow&#x27;s study, and the study is the ante-room of his bed-chamber. On the other hand, like all these stout, little men who do themselves well, he is a plethoric sleeper. Agatha- that&#x27;s my fiancee- says it is a joke in the servants&#x27; hall that it&#x27;s impossible to wake the master. He has a secretary who is devoted to his interests, and never budges from the study all day. That&#x27;s why we are going at night. Then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden. I met Agatha late the last two evenings, and she locks the brute up so as to give me a clear run. This is the house, this big one in its own grounds. Through the gate- now to the right among the laurels. We might put on our masks here, I think. You see, there is not a glimmer of light in any of the windows, and everything is working splendidly.&quot; With our black silk face-coverings, which turned us into two of the most truculent figures in London, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house. A sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it, lined by several windows and two doors. &quot;That&#x27;s his bedroom,&quot; Holmes whispered. &quot;This door opens straight into the study. It would suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked, and we should make too much noise getting in. Come round here. There&#x27;s a greenhouse which opens into the drawing-room.&quot; The place was locked, but Holmes removed a circle of glass and turned the key from the inside. An instant afterwards he had closed the door behind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of the law. The thick, warm air of the conservatory and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic plants took us by the throat. He seized my hand in the darkness and led me swiftly past banks of shrubs which brushed against our faces. Holmes had remarkable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in the dark. Still holding my hand in one of his, he opened a door, and I was vaguely conscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been smoked not long before. He felt his way among the furniture, opened another door, and closed it behind us. Putting out my hand I felt several coats hanging from the wall, and I understood that I was in a passage. We passed along it and Holmes very gently opened a door upon the right-hand side. Something rushed out at us and my heart sprang into my mouth, but I could have laughed when I realized that it was the cat. A fire was burning in this new room, and again the air was heavy with tobacco smoke. Holmes entered on tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and then very gently closed the door. We were in Milverton&#x27;s study, and a portiere at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom. It was a good fire, and the room was illuminated by it. Near the door I saw the gleam of an electric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it had been safe, to turn it on. At one side of the fireplace was a heavy curtain which covered the bay window we had seen from outside. On the other side was the door which communicated with the veranda. A desk stood in the centre, with a turning-chair of shining red leather. Opposite was a large bookcase, with a marble bust of Athene on the top. In the corner, between the bookcase and the wall, there stood a tall, green safe, the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs upon its face. Holmes stole across and looked at it. Then he crept to the door of the bedroom, and stood with slanting head listening intently. No sound came from within. Meanwhile it had struck me that it would be wise to secure our retreat through the outer door, so I examined it. To my amazement, it was neither locked nor bolted. I touched Holmes on the arm, and he turned his masked face in that direction. I saw him start, and he was evidently as surprised as I. &quot;I don&#x27;t like it,&quot; he whispered, putting his lips to my very ear. &quot;I can&#x27;t quite make it out. Anyhow, we have no time to lose.&quot; &quot;Can I do anything?&quot; &quot;Yes, stand by the door. If you hear anyone come, bolt it on the inside, and we can get away as we came. If they come the other way, we can get through the door if our job is done, or hide behind these window curtains if it is not. Do you understand?&quot; I nodded, and stood by the door. My first feeling of fear had passed away, and I thrilled now with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when we were the defenders of the law instead of its defiers. The high object of our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous, the villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting interest of the adventure. Far from feeling guilty, I rejoiced and exulted in our dangers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm, scientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. I knew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him, and I understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green and gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of many fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat- he had placed his overcoat on a chair- Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and several skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing at each of the others, ready for any emergency, though, indeed, my plans were somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were interrupted. For half an hour, Holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one tool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy of the trained mechanic. Finally I heard a click, the broad green door swung open, and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets, each tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes picked one out, but it was as hard to read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern, for it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the next room, to switch on the electric light. Suddenly I saw him halt, listen intently, and then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked up his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the window curtain, motioning me to do the same. It was only when I had joined him there that I heard what had alarmed his quicker senses. There was a noise somewhere within the house. A door slammed in the distance. Then a confused, dull murmur broke itself into the measured thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching. They were in the passage outside the room. They paused at the door. The door opened. There was a sharp snick as the electric light was turned on. The door closed once more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was home to our nostrils. Then the footsteps continued backward and forward, backward and forward, within a few yards of us. Finally there was a creak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased. Then a key clicked in a lock, and I heard the rustle of papers. So far I had not dared to look out, but now I gently parted the division of the curtains in front of me and peeped through. From the pressure of Holmes&#x27;s shoulder against mine, I knew that he was sharing my observations. Right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the broad, rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom, but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. His broad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the immediate foreground of our vision. He was leaning far back in the red leather chair, his legs outstretched, a long, black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking jacket, claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long, legal document which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable attitude. I felt Holmes&#x27;s hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring shake, as if to say that the situation was within his powers, and that he was easy in his mind. I was not sure whether he had seen what was only too obvious from my position, that the door of the safe was imperfectly closed, and that Milverton might at any moment observe it. In my own mind I had determined that if I were sure, from the rigidity of his gaze, that it had caught his eye, I would at once spring out, throw my great coat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest to Holmes. But Milverton never looked up. He was languidly interested by the papers in his hand, and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of the lawyer. At least, I thought, when he has finished the document and the cigar he will go to his room, but before he had reached the end of either, there came a remarkable development, which turned our thoughts into quite another channel. Several times I had observed that Milverton looked at his watch, and once he had risen and sat down again, with a gesture of impatience. The idea, however, that he might have an appointment at so strange an hour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from the veranda outside. Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his chair. The sound was repeated, and then there came a gentle tap at the door. Milverton rose and opened it. &quot;Well,&quot; said he, curtly, &quot;you are nearly half an hour late.&quot; So this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal vigil of Milverton. There was the gentle rustle of a woman&#x27;s dress. I had closed the slit between the curtains as Milverton&#x27;s face had turned in our direction, but now I ventured very carefully to open it once more. He had resumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an insolent angle from the corner of his mouth. In front of him, in the full glare of the electric light, there stood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over her face, a mantle drawn round her chin. Her breath came quick and fast, and every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion. &quot;Well,&quot; said Milverton, &quot;you made me lose a good night&#x27;s rest, my dear. I hope you&#x27;ll prove worth it. You couldn&#x27;t come any other time- eh?&quot; The woman shook her head. &quot;Well, if you couldn&#x27;t you couldn&#x27;t. If the Countess is a hard mistress, you have your chance to get level with her now. Bless the girl, what are you shivering about? That&#x27;s right. Pull yourself together. Now, let us get down to business.&quot; He took a notebook from the drawer of his desk. &quot;You say that you have five letters which compromise the Countess d&#x27;Albert. You want to sell them. I want to buy them. So far so good. It only remains to fix a price. I should want to inspect the letters, of course. If they are really good specimens- Great heavens, is it you?&quot; The woman, without a word, had raised her veil and dropped the mantle from her chin. It was a dark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted Milverton- a face with a curved nose, strong, dark eyebrows shading hard, glittering eyes, and a straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a dangerous smile. &quot;It is I,&quot; she said, &quot;the woman whose life you have ruined.&quot; Milverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his voice. &quot;You were so very obstinate,&quot; said he. &quot;Why did you drive me to such extremities? I assure you I wouldn&#x27;t hurt a fly of my own accord, but every man has his business, and what was I to do? I put the price well within your means. You would not pay.&quot; &quot;So you sent the letters to my husband, and he- the noblest gentleman that ever lived, a man whose boots I was never worthy to lace- he broke his gallant heart and died. You remember that last night, when I came through that door, I begged and prayed you for mercy, and you laughed in my face as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward heart cannot keep your lips from twitching. Yes, you never thought to see me here again, but it was that night which taught me how I could meet you face to face, and alone. Well, Charles Milverton, what have you to say?&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t imagine that you can bully me,&quot; said he, rising to his feet. &quot;I have only to raise my voice and I could call my servants and have you arrested. But I will make allowance for your natural anger. Leave the room at once as you came, and I will say no more.&quot; The woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom, and the same deadly smile on her thin lips. &quot;You will ruin no more lives as you have ruined mine. You will wring no more hearts as you wrung mine. I will free the world of a poisonous thing. Take that, you hound- and that!- and that!- and that!&quot; She had drawn a little gleaming revolver, and emptied barrel after barrel into Milverton&#x27;s body, the muzzle within two feet of his shirt front. He shrank away and then fell forward upon the table, coughing furiously and clawing among the papers. Then he staggered to his feet, received another shot, and rolled upon the floor. &quot;You&#x27;ve done me,&quot; he cried, and lay still. The woman looked at him intently, and ground her heel into his upturned face. She looked again, but there was no sound or movement. I heard a sharp rustle, the night air blew into the heated room, and the avenger was gone. No interference upon our part could have saved the man from his fate, but, as the woman poured bullet after bullet into Milverton&#x27;s shrinking body I was about to spring out, when I felt Holmes&#x27;s cold, strong grasp upon my wrist. I understood the whole argument of that firm, restraining grip- that it was no affair of ours, that justice had overtaken a villain, that we had our own duties and our own objects, which were not to be lost sight of. But hardly had the woman rushed from the room when Holmes, with swift, silent steps, was over at the other door. He turned the key in the lock. At the same instant we heard voices in the house and the sound of hurrying feet. The revolver shots had roused the household. With perfect coolness Holmes slipped across to the safe, filled his two arms with bundles of letters, and poured them all into the fire. Again and again he did it, until the safe was empty. Someone turned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door. Holmes looked swiftly round. The letter which had been the messenger of death for Milverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the table. Holmes tossed it in among the blazing papers. Then he drew the key from the outer door, passed through after me, and locked it on the outside. &quot;This way, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;we can scale the garden wall in this direction.&quot; I could not have believed that an alarm could have spread so swiftly. Looking back, the huge house was one blaze of light. The front door was open, and figures were rushing down the drive. The whole garden was alive with people, and one fellow raised a view-halloa as we emerged from the veranda and followed hard at our heels. Holmes seemed to know the grounds perfectly, and he threaded his way swiftly among a plantation of small trees, I close at his heels, and our foremost pursuer panting behind us. It was a six-foot wall which barred our path, but he sprang to the top and over. As I did the same I felt the hand of the man behind me grab at my ankle, but I kicked myself free and scrambled over a grass-strewn coping. I fell upon my face among some bushes, but Holmes had me on my feet in an instant, and together we dashed away across the huge expanse of Hampstead Heath. We had run two miles, I suppose, before Holmes at last halted and listened intently. All was absolute silence behind us. We had shaken off our pursuers and were safe. We had breakfasted and were smoking our morning pipe on the day after the remarkable experience which I have recorded, when Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, very solemn and impressive, was ushered into our modest sitting-room. &quot;Good-morning, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he; &quot;good-morning. May I ask if you are very busy just now?&quot; &quot;Not too busy to listen to you.&quot; &quot;I thought that, perhaps, if you had nothing particular on hand, you might care to assist us in a most remarkable case, which occurred only last night at Hampstead.&quot; &quot;Dear me!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;What was that?&quot; &quot;A murder- a most dramatic and remarkable murder. I know how keen you are upon these things, and I would take it as a great favour if you would step down to Appledore Towers, and give us the benefit of your advice. It is no ordinary crime. We have had our eyes upon this Mr. Milverton for some time, and, between ourselves, he was a bit of a villain. He is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing purposes. These papers have all been burned by the murderers. No article of value was taken, as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position, whose sole object was to prevent social exposure.&quot; &quot;Criminals?&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Plural?&quot; &quot;Yes, there were two of them. They were as nearly as possible captured redhanded. We have their footmarks, we have their description, it&#x27;s ten to one that we trace them. The first fellow was a bit too active, but the second was caught by the under-gardener, and only got away after a struggle. He was a middle-sized, strongly built man- square jaw, thick neck, moustache, a mask over his eyes.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s rather vague,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes. &quot;My, it might be a description of Watson!&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s true,&quot; said the inspector, with amusement. &quot;It might be a description of Watson.&quot; &quot;Well, I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t help you, Lestrade,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;The fact is that I knew this fellow Milverton, that I considered him one of the most dangerous men in London, and that I think there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge. No, it&#x27;s no use arguing. I have made up my mind. My sympathies are with the criminals rather than with the victim, and I will not handle this case.&quot; Holmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had witnessed, but I observed all the morning that he was in his most thoughtful mood, and he gave me the impression, from his vacant eyes and his abstracted manner, of a man who is striving to recall something to his memory. We were in the middle of our lunch, when he suddenly sprang to his feet. &quot;By Jove, Watson, I&#x27;ve got it!&quot; he cried. &quot;Take your hat! Come with me!&quot; He hurried at his top speed down Baker Street and along Oxford Street, until we had almost reached Regent Circus. Here, on the left hand, there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the celebrities and beauties of the day. Holmes&#x27;s eyes fixed themselves upon one of them, and following his gaze I saw the picture of a regal and stately lady in Court dress, with a high diamond tiara upon her noble head. I looked at that delicately curved nose, at the marked eyebrows, at the straight mouth, and the strong little chin beneath it. Then I caught my breath as I read the time-honoured title of the great nobleman and statesman whose wife she had been. My eyes met those of Holmes, and he put his finger to his lips as we turned away from the window. -THE END- . 1927 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF SHOSCOMBE OLD PLACE by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power microscope. Now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in triumph. &quot;It is glue, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;Unquestionably it is glue. Have a look at these scattered objects in the field!&quot; I stooped to the eyepiece and focussed for my vision. &quot;Those hairs are threads from a tweed coat. The irregular gray masses are dust. There are epithelial scales on the left. Those brown blobs in the centre are undoubtedly glue.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I said, laughing, &quot;I am prepared to take your word for it. Does anything depend upon it?&quot; &quot;It is a very fine demonstration,&quot; he answered. &quot;In the St. Pancras case you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead policeman. The accused man denies that it is his. But he is a picture-frame maker who, habitually handles glue.&quot; &quot;Is it one of your cases?&quot; &quot;No; my friend, Merivale, of the Yard, asked me to look into the case. Since I ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the microscope.&quot; He looked impatiently at his watch. &quot;I had a new client calling, but he is overdue. By the way, Watson, you know something of racing?&quot; &quot;I ought to. I pay for it with about half my wound pension.&quot; &quot;Then I&#x27;ll make you my &#x27;Handy Guide to the Turf.&#x27; What about Sir Robert Norberton? Does the name recall anything?&quot; &quot;Well, I should say so. He lives at Shoscombe Old Place, and I know it well, for my summer quarters were down there once. Norberton nearly, came within your province once.&quot; &quot;How was that?&quot; &quot;It was when he horsewhipped Sam Brewer, the well-known Curzon Street money-lender, on Newmarket Heath. He nearly killed the man.&quot; &quot;Ah, he sounds interesting! Does he often indulge in that way?&quot; &quot;Well, he has the name of being a dangerous man. He is about the most daredevil rider in England- second in the Grand National a few years back. He is one of those men who have overshot their true generation. He should have been a buck in the days of the Regency- a boxer, an athlete, a plunger on the turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by all account, so far down Queer Street that he may never find his way back again.&quot; &quot;Capital, Watson! A thumb-nail sketch. I seem to know the man. Now, can you give me some idea of Shoscombe Old Place?&quot; &quot;Only that it is in the centre of Shoscombe Park, and that the famous Shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there.&quot; &quot;And the head trainer,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;is John Mason. You need not look surprised at my knowledge, Watson, for this is a letter from him which I am unfolding. But let us have some more about Shoscombe. I seem to have struck a rich vein.&quot; &quot;There are the Shoscombe spaniels,&quot; said I. &quot;You hear of them at every dog show. The most exclusive breed in England. They are the special pride of the lady of Shoscombe Old Place.&quot; &quot;Sir Robert Norberton&#x27;s wife, I presume!&quot; &quot;Sir Robert has never married. Just as well, I think, considering his prospects. He lives with his widowed sister, Lady Beatrice Falder.&quot; &quot;You mean that she lives with him?&quot; &quot;No, no. The place belonged to her late husband, Sir James Norberton has no claim on it at all. It is only a life interest and reverts to her husband&#x27;s brother. Meantime, she draws the rents every year.&quot; &quot;And brother Robert, I suppose, spends the said rents?&quot; &quot;That is about the size of it. He is a devil of a fellow and must lead her a most uneasy life. Yet I have heard that she is devoted to him. But what is amiss at Shoscombe?&quot; &quot;Ah, that is just what I want to know. And here, I expect, is the man who can tell us.&quot; The door had opened and the page had shown in a tall, clean-shaven man with the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon those who have to control horses or boys. Mr. John Mason had many of both Linder his sway, and he looked equal to the task. He bowed with cold self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which Holmes had waved him. &quot;You had my note, Mr. Holmes?&quot; &quot;Yes, but it explained nothing.&quot; &quot;It was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper. And too complicated. It was only face to face I could do it.&quot; &quot;Well, we are at your disposal.&quot; &quot;First of all, Mr. Holmes, I think that my employer, Si Robert, has gone mad.&quot; Holmes raised his eyebrows. &quot;This is Baker Street, not Harley Street,&quot; said he. &quot;But why do you say so?&quot; &quot;Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things, there may be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is queer, then you begin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and the Derby have turned his brain.&quot; &quot;That is a colt you are running?&quot; &quot;Best in England, Mr. Holmes. I should know, if anyone does. Now, I&#x27;ll be plain with you, for I know you are gentlemen of honour and that it won&#x27;t go beyond the room. Sir Robert has got to win this Derby. He&#x27;s up to the neck, and it&#x27;s his last chance. Everything he could raise or borrow is on the horse- and at fine odds, too! You can get forties now, but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him.&quot; &quot;But how is that if the horse is so good?&quot; &quot;The public don&#x27;t know how good he is. Sir Robert has been too clever for the touts. He has the Prince&#x27;s half-brother out for spins. You can&#x27;t tell &#x27;em apart. But there are two lengths in a furlong between them when it comes to a gallop. He thinks of nothing but the horse and the race. His whole life is on it. He&#x27;s holding off the Jews till then. If the Prince falls him he is done.&quot; &quot;It seems a rather desperate gamble, but where does the madness come in?&quot; &quot;Well, first of all, you have only to look at him. I don&#x27;t believe he sleeps at night. He is down at the stables at all hours. His eyes are wild. It has all been too much for his nerves. Then there is his conduct to Lady Beatrice!&quot; &quot;Ah! What is that?&quot; &quot;They have always been the best of friends. They had the same tastes, the two of them, and she loved the horses as much as he did. Every day at the same hour she would drive down to see them- and, above all, she loved the Prince. He would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels on the gravel, and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to get his lump of sugar. But that&#x27;s all over now.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Well, she seems to have lost all interest in the horses. For a week now she has driven past the stables with never so much as &#x27;Good-morning&#x27;!&quot; &quot;You think there has been a quarrel?&quot; &quot;And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that. Why else would he give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child? He gave it a few days ago to old Barnes, what keeps the Green Dragon, three miles off, at Crendall.&quot; &quot;That certainly did seem strange.&quot; &quot;Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn&#x27;t expect that she could get about with him, but he spent two hours every evening in her room. He might well do what he could, for she has been a rare good friend to him. But that&#x27;s all over, too. He never goes near her. And she takes it to heart. She is brooding and sulky and drinking, Mr. Holmes- drinking like a fish.&quot; &quot;Did she drink before this estrangement?&quot; &quot;Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of an evening. So Stephens, the butler, told me. It&#x27;s all changed, Mr. Holmes, and there is something damned rotten about it. But then, again, what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night? And who is the man that meets him there?&quot; Holmes rubbed his hands. &quot;Go on, Mr. Mason. You get more and more interesting.&quot; &quot;It was the butler who saw him go. Twelve o&#x27;clock at night and raining hard. So next night I was up at the house and, sure enough, master was off again. Stephens and I went after him, but it was jumpy work, for it would have been a bad job if he had seen us. He&#x27;s a terrible man with his fists if he gets started, and no respecter of persons. So we were shy of getting too near, but we marked him down all right. It was the haunted crypt that he was making for, and there was a man waiting for him there.&quot; &quot;What is this haunted crypt?&quot; &quot;Well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the park. It is so old that nobody could fix its date. And under it there&#x27;s a crypt which has a bad name among us. It&#x27;s a dark, damp, lonely place by day, but there are few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at night. But master&#x27;s not afraid. He never feared anything in his life. But what is he doing there in the night-time?&quot; &quot;Wait a bit!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;You say there is another man there. It must be one of your own stablemen, or someone from the house! Surely you have only to spot who it is and question him?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s no one I know.&quot; &quot;How can you say that?&quot; &quot;Because I have seen him, Mr. Holmes. It was on that second night. Sir Robert turned and passed us- me and Stephens, quaking in the bushes like two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that night. But we could hear the other moving about behind. We were not afraid of him. So we up when Sir Robert was gone and pretended we were just having a walk like in the moonlight, and so we came right on him as casual and innocent as you please. &#x27;Hullo, mate! who may you be?&#x27; says I.&#x27;. I guess he had not heard us coming, so he looked over his shoulder with a face as if he had seen the devil coming out of hell. He let out a yell, and away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness. He could run!- I&#x27;ll give him that. In a minute he was out of sight and hearing, and who he was, or what he was, we never found.&quot; &quot;But you saw him clearly in the moonlight?&quot; &quot;Yes, I would swear to his yellow face- a mean dog, I should say. What could he have in common with Sir Robert?&quot; Holmes sat for some time lost in thought. &quot;Who keeps Lady Beatrice Falder company?&quot; he asked at last. &quot;There is her maid, Carrie Evans. She has been with her this five years.&quot; &quot;And is, no doubt, devoted?&quot; Mr. Mason shuffled uncomfortably. &quot;She&#x27;s devoted enough,&quot; he answered at last. &quot;But I won&#x27;t say to whom.&quot; &quot;Ah!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I can&#x27;t tell tales out of school.&quot; &quot;I quite understand, Mr. Mason. Of course, the situation is clear enough. From Dr. Watson&#x27;s description of Sir Robert I can realize that no woman is safe from him. Don&#x27;t you think the quarrel between brother and sister may lie there?&quot; Well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time.&quot; &quot;But she may not have seen it before. Let us suppose that she has suddenly found it out. She waits to get rid of the woman. Her brother will not permit it. The invalid, with her weak heart and inability to get about, has no means of enforcing her will. The hated maid is still tied to her. The lady refuses to speak, sulks, takes to drink. Sir Robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her. Does not all this hang together?&quot; &quot;Well, it might do- so far as it goes.&quot; &quot;Exactly! As far as it goes. How would all that bear upon the visits by night to the old crypt? We can&#x27;t fit that into our plot.&quot; &quot;No, sir, and there is something more that I can&#x27;t fit in. Why should Sir Robert want to dig up a dead body?&quot; Holmes sat up abruptly. &quot;We only found it out yesterday- after I had written to you. Yesterday Sir Robert had gone to London, so Stephens and I went down to the crypt. It was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was a bit of a human body.&quot; &quot;You informed the police, I suppose?&quot; Our visitor smiled grimly. &quot;Well, sir, I think it would hardly interest them. It was just the head and a few bones of a mummy. It may have been a thousand years old. But it wasn&#x27;t there before. That I&#x27;ll swear, and so will Stephens. It had been stowed away in a corner and covered over with a board, but that corner had always been empty before.&quot; &quot;What did you do with it?&quot; &quot;Well, we just left it there.&quot; &quot;That was wise. You say Sir Robert was away yesterday. Has he returned?&quot; &quot;We expect him back to-day.&quot; &quot;When did Sir Robert give away his sister&#x27;s dog?&quot; &quot;It was just a week ago to-day. The creature was howling outside the old well-house, and Sir Robert was in one of his tantrums that morning. He caught it up, and I thought he would have killed it. Then he gave it to Sandy Bain, the jockey, and told him to take the dog to old Barnes at the Green Dragon, for he never wished to see it again.&quot; Holmes sat for some time in silent thought. He had lit the oldest and foulest of his pipes. &quot;I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, Mr. Mason,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Can&#x27;t you make it more definite?&quot; &quot;Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said our visitor. He took a paper from his pocket, and, unwrapping it carefully, he exposed a charred fragment of bone. Holmes examined it with interest. &quot;Where did you get it?&quot; &quot;There is a central heating furnace in the cellar under Lady Beatrice&#x27;s room. It&#x27;s been off for some time, but Sir Robert complained of cold and had it on again, Harvey runs it- he&#x27;s one of my lads. This very morning he came to me with this which he found raking out the cinders. He didn&#x27;t like the look of it.&quot; &quot;Nor do I,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;What do you make of it, Watson?&quot; It was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to its anatomical significance. &quot;It&#x27;s the upper condyle of a human femur,&quot; said I. &quot;Exactly!&quot; Holmes had become very serious. &quot;When does this lad tend to the furnace?&quot; &quot;He makes it up every evening and then leaves it.&quot; &quot;Then anyone could visit it during the night?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;Can you enter it from outside?&quot; &quot;There is one door from the outside. There is another which leads up by a stair to the passage in which Lady Beatrice&#x27;s room is situated.&quot; &quot;These are deep waters, Mr. Mason; deep and rather dirty. You say that Sir Robert was not at home last night?&quot; &quot;No, sir.&quot; &quot;Then, whoever was burning bones, it was not he.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s true, sir.&quot; &quot;What is the name of that inn you spoke of?&quot; &quot;The Green Dragon.&quot; &quot;Is there good fishing in that part of Berkshire?&quot; The honest trainer showed very clearly upon his face that he was convinced that yet another lunatic had come into his harassed life. &quot;Well, sir, I&#x27;ve heard there are trout in the mill-stream and pike in the Hall lake.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s good enough. Watson and I are famous fishermen- are we not, Watson? You may address us in future at the Green Dragon. We should reach it to-night. I need not say that we don&#x27;t want to see you, Mr. Mason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt I could find you if I want you. When we have gone a little farther into the matter I will let you have a considered opinion.&quot; Thus it was that on a bright May evening Holmes and I found ourselves alone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little &quot;halt-on-demand&quot; station of Shoscombe. The rack above us was covered with a formidable litter of rods, reels, and baskets. On reaching our destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a sporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood. &quot;What about the Hall lake and the chance of a pike?&quot; said Holmes. The face of the innkeeper clouded. &quot;That wouldn&#x27;t do, sir. You might chance to find yourself in the lake before you were through.&quot; &quot;How&#x27;s that, then?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Sir Robert, sir. He&#x27;s terrible jealous of touts. If you two strangers were as near his training quarters as that he&#x27;d be after you as sure as fate. He ain&#x27;t taking no chances, Sir Robert ain&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve heard he has a horse entered for the Derby.&quot; &quot;Yes, and a good colt, too. He carries all our money for the race, and all Sir Robert&#x27;s into the Bargain. By the way&quot;- he looked at us with thoughtful eyes- &quot;I suppose you ain&#x27;t on the turf yourselves?&quot; &quot;No, indeed. just two weary Londoners who badly need some good Berkshire air.&quot; &quot;Well, you are in the right place for that. There is a deal of it lying about. But mind what I have told you about Sir Robert. He&#x27;s the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards. Keep clear of the park.&quot; &quot;Surely, Mr. Barnes! We certainly shall. By the way, that was a most beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall.&quot; &quot;I should say it was. That was the real Shoscombe breed. There ain&#x27;t a better in England.&quot; &quot;I am a dog-fancier myself,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Now, if it is a fair question, what would a prize dog like that cost?&quot; &quot;More than I could pay, sir. It was Sir Robert himself who gave me this one. That&#x27;s why I have to keep it on a lead. It would be off to the Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head.&quot; &quot;We are getting some cards in our hand, Watson,&quot; said Holmes when the landlord had left us. &quot;It&#x27;s not an easy one to play, but we may see our way in a day or two. By the way, Sir Robert is still in London, I hear. We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without fear of bodily assault. There are one or two points on which I should like reassurance.&quot; &quot;Have you any theory, Holmes?&quot; &quot;Only this, Watson, that something happened a week or so ago which has cut deep into the life of the Shoscombe household. What is that something? We can only guess at it from its effects. They seem to be of a curiously mixed character. But that should surely help us. It is only the colourless, uneventful case which is hopeless. &quot;Let us consider our data. The brother no longer visits the beloved invalid sister. He gives away her favourite dog. Her dog, Watson! Does that suggest nothing to you?&quot; &quot;Nothing but the brother&#x27;s spite.&quot; &quot;Well, it might be so. Or- well, there is an alternative. Now to continue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel, if there is a quarrel, began. The lady keeps her room, alters her habits, is not seen save when she drives out with her maid, refuses to stop at the stables to greet her favourite horse, and apparently takes to drink. That covers the case, does it not?&quot; &quot;Save for the business in the crypt.&quot; &quot;That is another line of thought. There are two, and I beg you will not tangle them. Line A, which concerns Lady Beatrice, has a vaguely sinister flavour, has it not?&quot; &quot;I can make nothing of it.&quot; &quot;Well, now, let us take up line B, which concerns Sir Robert. He is mad keen upon winning the Derby. He is in the hands of the Jews, and may at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his creditors. He is a daring and desperate man. He derives his income from his sister. His sister&#x27;s maid is his willing tool. So far we seem to be on fairly safe ground, do we not?&quot; &quot;But the crypt?&quot; &quot;Ah, yes, the crypt! Let us suppose, Watson- it is merely a scandalous supposition, a hypothesis put forward for argument&#x27;s sake- that Sir Robert has done away with his sister.&quot; &quot;My dear Holmes, it is out of the question.&quot; &quot;Very possibly, Watson. Sir Robert is a man of an honourable stock. But you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles. Let us for a moment argue upon this supposition. He could not fly the country until he had realized his fortune, and that fortune could only be realized by bringing off this coup with Shoscombe Prince. Therefore, he has still to stand his ground. To do this he would have to dispose of the body of his victim, and he would also have to find a substitute who would impersonate her. With the maid as his confidante that would not be impossible. The woman&#x27;s body might be conveyed to the crypt, which is a place so seldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed at night in the furnace, leaving behind it such evidence as we have already seen. What say you to that, Watson?&quot; &quot;Well, it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous supposition.&quot; &quot;I think that there is a small experiment which we may try to-morrow, Watson, in order to throw some light on the matter. Meanwhile, if we mean to keep up our characters, I suggest that we have our host in for a glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace, which seems to be the straight road to his affections. We may chance to come upon some useful local gossip in the process.&quot; In the morning Holmes discovered that we had come without our spoon-bait for jack, which absolved us from fishing for the day. About eleven o&#x27;clock we started for a walk, and he obtained leave to take the black spaniel with us. &quot;This is the place,&quot; said he as we came to two high park gates with heraldic griffins towering above them. &quot;About midday, Mr. Barnes informs me, the old lady takes a drive, and the carriage must slow down while the gates are opened. When it comes through, and before it gathers speed, I want you, Watson, to stop the coachman with some question. Never mind me. I shall stand behind this holly-bush and see what I can see.&quot; It was not a long vigil. Within a quarter of an hour we saw the big open yellow barouche coming down the long avenue, with two splendid, high-stepping gray carriage horses in the shafts. Holmes crouched behind his bush with the dog. I stood unconcernedly swinging a cane in the roadway. A keeper ran out and the gates swung open. The carriage had slowed to a walk, and I was able to get a good look at the occupants. A highly coloured young woman with flaxen hair and impudent eyes sat on the left. At her right was an elderly person with rounded back and a huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders which proclaimed the invalid. When the horses reached the highroad I held up my hand with an authoritative gesture, and as the coachman pulled up I inquired if Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place. At the same moment Holmes stepped out and released the spaniel. With a joyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step. Then in a moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage, and it snapped at the black skirt above it. &quot;Drive on! Drive on!&quot; shrieked a harsh voice. The coachman lashed the horses, and we were left standing in the roadway. &quot;Well, Watson, that&#x27;s done it,&quot; said Holmes as he fastened the lead to the neck of the excited spaniel. &quot;He thought it was his mistress, and he found it was a stranger. Dogs don&#x27;t make mistakes.&quot; &quot;But it was the voice of a man!&quot; I cried. &quot;Exactly! We have added one card to our hand, Watson, But it needs careful playing, all the same.&quot; My companion seemed to have no further plans for the day, and we did actually use our fishing tackle in the mill-stream, with the result that we had a dish of trout for our supper. It was only after that meal that Holmes showed signs of renewed activity. Once more we found ourselves upon the same road as in the morning, which led us to the park gates. A tall, dark figure was awaiting us there, who proved to be our London acquaintance, Mr. John Mason, the trainer. &quot;Good-evening, gentlemen,&quot; said he. &quot;I got your note, Mr. Holmes. Sir Robert has not returned yet, but I hear that he is expected to-night.&quot; &quot;How far is this crypt from the house?&quot; asked Holmes. &quot;A good quarter of a mile.&quot; &quot;Then I think we can disregard him altogether.&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t afford to do that, Mr. Holmes. The moment he arrives he will want to see me to get the last news of Shoscombe Prince.&quot; &quot;I see! In that case we must work without you, Mr. Mason. You can show us the crypt and then leave us.&quot; It was pitch-dark and without a moon, but Mason led us over the grasslands until a dark mass loomed tip in front of us which proved to be the ancient chapel. We entered the broken gap which was once the porch, and our guide, stumbling among heaps of loose masonry, picked his way to the corner of the building, where a steep stair led down into the crypt. Striking a match, he illuminated the Melancholy place- dismal and evil-smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of rough-hewn stone, and piles of coffins, some of lead and some of stone, extending upon one side right up to the arched and groined roof which lost itself in the shadows above our heads. Holmes had lit his lantern, which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the mournful scene. Its rays were reflected back from the coffin-plates, many of them adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old family which carried its honours even to the gate of Death. &quot;You spoke of some bones, Mr. Mason. Could you show them before you go?&quot; &quot;They are here in this corner.&quot; The trainer strode across and then stood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place. &quot;They are gone,&quot; said he. &quot;So I expected,&quot; said Holmes, chuckling. &quot;I fancy the ashes of them might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a part.&quot; &quot;But why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man who has been dead a thousand years?&quot; asked John Mason. &quot;That is what we are here to find out,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It may mean a long search, and we need not detain you. I fancy that we shall get our solution before morning.&quot; When John Mason had left us, Holmes set to work making a very careful examination of the graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which appeared to be Saxon, in the centre, through a long line of Norman Hugos and Odos, until we reached the Sir William and Sir Denis Falder of the eighteenth century. It was an hour or more before Holmes came to a leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault. I heard his little cry of satisfaction and was aware from his hurried but purposeful movements that he had reached a goal. With his lens he was eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid. Then he drew from his pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he thrust into a chink, levering back the whole front, which seemed to be secured by only a couple of clamps. There was a rending, tearing sound as it gave way, but it had hardly hinged back and partly revealed the contents before we had an unforeseen interruption. Someone was walking in the chapel above. It was the firm, rapid step of one who came with a definite purpose and knew, well the ground upon which he walked. A light streamed down the stairs, and an instant later the man who bore it was framed in the Gothic archway. He was a terrible figure, huge in stature and fierce in manner. A large stable-lantern which he field in front of him shone upward upon a strong, heavily moustached face and angry eyes, which glared round him into every recess of the vault, finally fixing themselves with a deadly stare upon my companion and myself. &quot;Who the, devil are you?&quot; he thundered. &quot;And what are you doing upon my property?&quot; Then, as Holmes returned no answer, he took a couple of steps forward and raised a heavy stick which he carried. &quot;Do you hear me?&quot; he cried. &quot;Who are you? What are you doing here?&quot; His cudgel quivered in the air. But instead of shrinking Holmes advanced to meet him. &quot;I also have a question to ask you, Sir Robert,&quot; he said in his sternest tone. &quot;Who is this? And what is it doing here?&quot; He turned and tore open the coffin-lid behind him. In the glare of the lantern I saw a body swathed in a sheet from head to foot, with dreadful, witchlike features, all nose and chin, projecting at one end, the dim, glazed eyes staring from a discoloured and crumbling face. The baronet had staggered back with a cry and supported himself against a stone sarcophagus. &quot;How came you to know of this?&quot; he cried. And then, with some return of his truculent mariner: &quot;What business is it of yours?&quot; &quot;My name is Sherlock Holmes,&quot; said my companion. &quot;Possibly it is familiar to you. In any case, my business is that of every other good citizen- to uphold the law. It seems to me that you have much to answer for.&quot; Sir Robert glared for a moment, but Holmes&#x27;s quiet voice and cool, assured manner had their effect. &quot;&#x27;Fore God, Mr. Holmes, it&#x27;s all right,&quot; said he. &quot;Appearances are against me, I&#x27;ll admit, but I could act no otherwise.&quot; &quot;I should be happy to think so, but I fear your explanations must be before the police.&quot; Sir Robert shrugged his broad shoulders. &quot;Well, if it must be, it must. Come up to the house and you can judge for yourself how the matter stands.&quot; A quarter of an hour later we found ourselves in what I judge, from the lines of polished barrels behind glass covers, to be the gun-room of the old house. It was comfortably furnished, and here Sir Robert left us for a few moments. When he returned he had two companions with him; the one, the florid young woman whom we had seen in the carriage; the other, a small rat-faced man with a disagreeably furtive manner. These two wore an appearance of utter bewilderment, which showed that the baronet had not yet had time to explain to them the turn events had taken. &quot;There,&quot; said Sir Robert with a wave of his hand, &quot;are Mr. and Mrs. Norlett. Mrs. Norlett, under her maiden name of Evans, has for some years been my sister&#x27;s confidential maid. I have brought them here because I feel that my best course is to explain the true position to you, and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what I say.&quot; &quot;Is this necessary, Sir Robert? Have you thought what you are doing?&quot; cried the woman. &quot;As to me, I entirely disclaim all responsibility,&quot; said her husband. Sir Robert gave him a glance of contempt. &quot;I will take all responsibility,&quot; said he. &quot;Now, Mr. Holmes, listen to a plain statement of the facts. &quot;You have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or I should not have found you where I did. Therefore, you know already, in all probability, that I am running a dark horse for the Derby and that everything depends upon my success. If I win, all is easy. If I lose- well, I dare not think of that!&quot; &quot;I understand the position,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I am dependent upon my sister, Lady Beatrice, for everything. But it is well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only. For myself, I am deeply in the hands of the Jews. I have always known that if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate like a flock of vultures. Everything would be seized- my stables, my horses- everything. Well, Mr. Holmes, my sister did die just a week ago.&quot; &quot;And you told no one!&quot; &quot;What could I do? Absolute ruin faced me. If I could stave things off for three weeks all would be well. Her maid&#x27;s husband- this man here- is an actor. It came into our heads- it came into my head- that he could for that short period personate my sister. It was but a case of appearing daily in the carriage, for no one need enter her room save the maid. It was not difficult to arrange. My sister died of the dropsy which had long afflicted her.&quot; &quot;That will be for a coroner to decide.&quot; &quot;Her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have threatened such an end.&quot; &quot;Well, what did you do?&quot; &quot;The body could not remain there. On the first night Norlett and I carried it out to the old well-house, which is now never used. We were followed, however, by her pet spaniel, which yapped continually at the door, so I felt some safer place was needed. I got rid of the spaniel, and we carried the body to the crypt of the church. There was no indignity or irreverence, Mr. Holmes. I do not feel that I have wronged the dead.&quot; &quot;Your conduct seems to me inexcusable, Sir Robert.&quot; The baronet shook his head impatiently. &quot;It is easy to preach,&quot; said he. &quot;Perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my position. One cannot see all one&#x27;s hopes and all one&#x27;s plans shattered at the last moment and make no effort to save them. It seemed to me that it would be no unworthy resting-place if we put her for the time in one of the coffins of her husband&#x27;s ancestors lying in what is still consecrated ground. We opened such a coffin, removed the contents, and placed her as you have seen her. As to the old relics which we took out, we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt. Norlett and I removed them, and he descended at night and burned them in the central furnace. There is my story, Mr. Holmes, though how you forced my hand so that I have to tell it is more than I can say.&quot; Holmes sat for some time lost in thought. &quot;There is one flaw in your narrative, Sir Robert,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Your bets on the race, and therefore your hopes for the future, would hold good even if your creditors seized your estate.&quot; &quot;The horse would be part of the estate. What do they care for my bets? As likely as not they would not run him at all. My chief crediter is, unhappily, my most bitter enemy- a rascally fellow, Sam Brewer, whom I was once compelled to horsewhip on Newmarket Heath. Do you suppose that he would try to save me?&quot; &quot;Well, Sir Robert,&quot; said Holmes, rising, &quot;this matter must, of course, be referred to the police. It was my duty to bring the facts to light, and there I must leave it. As to the morality or decency of your conduct, it is not for me to express an opinion. It is nearly midnight, Watson, and I think we may make our way back to our humble abode.&quot; It is generally known now that this singular episode ended upon a happier note than Sir Robert&#x27;s actions deserved. Shoscombe Prince did win the Derby, the sporting owner did net eighty thousand pounds in bets, and the creditors did hold their hand until the race was over, when they were paid in full, and enough was left to reestablish Sir Robert in a fair position in life. Both police and coroner took a lenient view, of the transaction, and beyond a mild censure for the delay in registering the lady&#x27;s decease, the lucky owner got away scatheless from this strange incident in a career which has now outlived its shadows and promises to end in an honoured old age. -THE END- . 1904 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle It was on a bitterly cold night and frosty morning, towards the end of the winter of &#x27;97, that I was awakened by a tugging at my shoulder. It was Holmes. The candle in his hand shone upon his eager, stooping face, and told me at a glance that something was amiss. &quot;Come, Watson, come!&quot; he cried. &quot;The game is afoot. Not a word! Into your clothes and come!&quot; Ten minutes later we were both in a cab, and rattling through the silent streets on our way to Charing Cross Station. The first faint winter&#x27;s dawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us, blurred and indistinct in the opalescent London reek. Holmes nestled in silence into his heavy coat, and I was glad to do the same, for the air was most bitter, and neither of us had broken our fast. It was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station and taken our places in the Kentish train that we were sufficiently thawed, he to speak and I to listen. Holmes drew a note from his pocket, and read aloud: &#x27;Abbey Grange, Marsham, Kent, &#x27;3:30 A.M. &#x27;MY DEAR MR. HOLMES: I should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to be a most remarkable case. It is something quite in your line. Except for releasing the lady I will see that everything is kept exactly as I have found it, but I beg you not to lose an instant, as it is difficult to leave Sir Eustace there. &#x27;Yours faithfully, &#x27;STANLEY HOPKINS. &quot;Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion his summons has been entirely justified,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I fancy that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and I must admit, Watson, that you have some power of selection, which atones for much which I deplore in your narratives. Your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even classical series of demonstrations. You slur over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy, in order to dwell upon sensational details which may excite, but cannot possibly instruct, the reader.&quot; &quot;Why do you not write them yourself?&quot; I said, with some bitterness. &quot;I will, my dear Watson, I will. At present I am, as you know, fairly busy, but I propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a textbook, which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume. Our present research appears to be a case of murder.&quot; &quot;You think this Sir Eustace is dead, then?&quot; &quot;I should say so. Hopkins&#x27;s writing shows considerable agitation, and he is not an emotional man. Yes, I gather there has been violence, and that the body is left for our inspection. A mere suicide would not have caused him to send for me. As to the release of the lady, it would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy. We are moving in high life, Watson, crackling paper, &#x27;E.B.&#x27; monogram, coat-of-arms, picturesque address. I think that friend Hopkins will live up to his reputation, and that we shall have an interesting morning. The crime was committed before twelve last night.&quot; &quot;How can you possibly tell?&quot; &quot;By an inspection of the trains, and by reckoning the time. The local police had to be called in, they had to communicate with Scotland Yard, Hopkins had to go out, and he in turn had to send for me. All that makes a fair night&#x27;s work. Well, here we are at Chiselhurst Station, and we shall soon set our doubts at rest.&quot; A drive of a couple of miles through narrow country lanes brought us to a park gate, which was opened for us by an old lodge-keeper, whose haggard face bore the reflection of some great disaster. The avenue ran through a noble park, between lines of ancient elms, and ended in a low, widespread house, pillared in front after the fashion of Palladio. The central part was evidently of a great age and shrouded in ivy, but the large windows showed that modern changes had been carried out, and one wing of the house appeared to be entirely new. The youthful figure and alert, eager face of Inspector Stanley Hopkins confronted us in the open doorway. &quot;I&#x27;m very glad you have come, Mr. Holmes. And you, too, Dr. Watson. But, indeed, if I had my time over again, I should not have troubled you, for since the lady has come to herself, she has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do. You remember that Lewisham gang of burglars?&quot; &quot;What, the three Randalls?&quot; &quot;Exactly; the father and two sons. It&#x27;s their work. I have not a doubt of it. They did a job at Sydenham a fortnight ago and were seen and described. Rather cool to do another so soon and so near, but it is they, beyond all doubt. It&#x27;s a hanging matter this time.&quot; &quot;Sir Eustace is dead, then?&quot; &quot;Yes, his head was knocked in with his own poker.&quot; &quot;Sir Eustace Brackenstall, the driver tells me.&quot; &quot;Exactly- one of the richest men in Kent- Lady Brackenstall is in the morning-room. Poor lady, she has had a most dreadful experience. She seemed half dead when I saw her first. I think you had best see her and hear her account of the facts. Then we will examine the dining-room together.&quot; Lady Brackenstall was no ordinary person. Seldom have I seen so graceful a figure, so womanly a presence, and so beautiful a face. She was a blonde, golden-haired, blue-eyed, and would no doubt have had the perfect complexion which goes with such colouring, had not her recent experience left her drawn and haggard. Her sufferings were physical as well as mental, for over one eye rose a hideous, plum-coloured swelling, which her maid, a tall, austere woman, was bathing assiduously with vinegar and water. The lady lay back exhausted upon a couch, but her quick, observant gaze, as we entered the room, and the alert expression of her beautiful features, showed that neither her wits nor her courage had been shaken by her terrible experience. She was enveloped in a loose dressing-gown of blue and silver, but a black sequin-covered dinner-dress lay upon the couch beside her. &quot;I have told you all that happened, Mr. Hopkins,&quot; she said, wearily. &quot;Could you not repeat it for me? Well, if you think it necessary, I will tell these gentlemen what occurred. Have they been in the dining-room yet?&quot; &quot;I thought they had better hear your ladyship&#x27;s story first.&quot; &quot;I shall be glad when you can arrange matters. It is horrible to me to think of him still lying there.&quot; She shuddered and buried her face in her hands. As she did so, the loose gown fell back from her forearms. Holmes uttered an exclamation. &quot;You have other injuries, madam! What is this?&quot; Two vivid red spots stood out on one of the white, round limbs. She hastily covered it. &quot;It is nothing. It has no connection with this hideous business to-night. If you and your friend will sit down, I will tell you all I can. &quot;I am the wife of Sir Eustace Brackenstall. I have been married about a year. I suppose that it is no use my attempting to conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one. I fear that all our neighbours would tell you that, even if I were to attempt to deny it. Perhaps the fault may be partly mine. I was brought up in the freer, less conventional atmosphere of South Australia, and this English life, with its proprieties and its primness, is not congenial to me. But the main reason lies in the one fact, which is notorious to everyone, and that is that Sir Eustace was a confirmed drunkard. To be with such a man for an hour is unpleasant. Can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and high-spirited woman to be tied to him for day and night? It is a sacrilege, a crime, a villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding. I say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the land- God will not let such wickedness endure.&quot; For an instant she sat up, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes blazing from under the terrible mark upon her brow. Then the strong, soothing hand of the austere maid drew her head down on to the cushion, and the wild anger died away into passionate sobbing. At last she continued: &quot;I will tell you about last night. You are aware, perhaps, that in this house all the servants sleep in the modern wing. This central block is made up of the dwelling-rooms, with the kitchen behind and our bedroom above. My maid, Theresa, sleeps above my room. There is no one else, and no sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing. This must have been well known to the robbers, or they would not have acted as they did. &quot;Sir Eustace retired about half-past ten. The servants had already gone to their quarters. Only my maid was up, and she had remained in her room at the top of the house until I needed her services. I sat until after eleven in this room, absorbed in a book. Then I walked round to see that all was right before I went upstairs. It was my custom to do this myself, for, as I have explained, Sir Eustace was not always to be trusted. I went into the kitchen, the butler&#x27;s pantry, the gun-room, the billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the dining-room. As I approached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open. I flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad-shouldered elderly man, who had just stepped into the room. The window is a long French one, which really forms a door leading to the lawn. I held my bedroom candle lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first man I saw two others, who were in the act of entering. I stepped back, but the fellow was on me in an instant. He caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat. I opened my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. I must have been unconscious for a few minutes, for when I came to myself, I found that they had torn down the bell-rope, and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-table. I was so firmly bound that I could not move, and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from uttering a sound. It was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room. He had evidently heard some suspicious sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as he found. He was dressed in nightshirt and trousers, with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand. He rushed at the burglars, but another- it was an elderly man- stooped, picked the poker out of the grate and struck him a horrible blow as he passed. He fell with a groan and never moved again. I fainted once more, but again it could only have been for a very few minutes during which I was insensible. When I opened my eyes I found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there. Each of them had a glass in his hand. I have already told you, have I not, that one was elderly, with a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. They might have been a father with his two sons. They talked together in whispers. Then they came over and made sure that I was securely bound. Finally they withdrew, closing the window after them. It was quite a quarter of an hour before I got my mouth free. When I did so, my screams brought the maid to my assistance. The other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent for the local police, who instantly communicated with London. That is really all that I can tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again.&quot; &quot;Any questions, Mr. Holmes?&quot; asked Hopkins. &quot;I will not impose any further tax upon Lady Brackenstall&#x27;s patience and time,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Before I go into the dining-room, I should like to hear your experience.&quot; He looked at the maid. &quot;I saw the men before ever they came into the house,&quot; said she. &quot;As I sat by my bedroom window I saw three men in the moonlight down by the lodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it at the time. It was more than an hour after that I heard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to find her, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the floor, with his blood and brains over the room. It was enough to drive a woman out of her wits, tied there, and her very dress spotted with him, but she never wanted courage, did Miss Mary Fraser of Adelaide and Lady Brackenstall of Abbey Grange hasn&#x27;t learned new ways. You&#x27;ve questioned her long enough, you gentlemen, and now she is coming to her own room, just with her old Theresa, to get the rest that she badly needs.&quot; With a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman put her arm round her mistress and led her from the room. &quot;She has been with her all her life,&quot; said Hopkins. &quot;Nursed her as a baby, and came with her to England when they first left Australia, eighteen months ago. Theresa Wright is her name, and the kind of maid you don&#x27;t pick up nowadays. This way, Mr. Holmes, if you please!&quot; The keen interest had passed out of Holmes&#x27;s expressive face, and I knew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed. There still remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them? An abstruse and learned specialist who finds that he has been called in for a case of measles would experience something of the annoyance which I read in my friend&#x27;s eyes. Yet the scene in the dining-room of the Abbey Grange was sufficiently strange to arrest his attention and to recall his waning interest. It was a very large and high chamber, with carved oak ceiling, oaken panelling, and a fine array of deer&#x27;s heads and ancient weapons around the walls. At the further end from the door was the high French window of which we had heard. Three smaller windows on the right-hand side filled the apartment with cold winter sunshine. On the left was a large, deep fireplace, with a massive, overhanging oak mantelpiece. Beside the fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and crossbars at the bottom. In and out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord, which was secured at each side to the crosspiece below. In releasing the lady, the cord had been slipped off her, but the knots with which it had been secured still remained. These details only struck our attention afterwards, for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible object which lay upon the tigerskin hearthrug in front of the fire. It was the body of a tall, well-made man, about forty years of age. He lay upon his back, his face upturned, with his white teeth grinning through his short, black beard. His two clenched hands were raised above his head, and a heavy, blackthorn stick lay across them. His dark, handsome, aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of vindictive hatred, which had set his dead face in a terribly fiendish expression. He had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out, for he wore a foppish, embroidered nightshirt, and his bare feet projected from his trousers. His head was horribly injured, and the whole room bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down. Beside him lay the heavy poker, bent into a curve by the concussion. Holmes examined both it and the indescribable wreck which it had wrought. &quot;He must be a powerful man, this elder Randall,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Hopkins. &quot;I have some record of the fellow, and he is a rough customer.&quot; &quot;You should have no difficulty in getting him.&quot; &quot;Not the slightest. We have been on the look-out for him, and there was some idea that he had got away to America. Now that we know that the gang are here, I don&#x27;t see how they can escape. We have the news at every seaport already, and a reward will be offered before evening. What beats me is how they could have done so mad a thing, knowing that the lady could describe them and that we could not fail to recognize the description.&quot; &quot;Exactly. One would have expected that they would silence Lady Brackenstall as well.&quot; &quot;They may not have realized,&quot; I suggested, &quot;that she had recovered from her faint.&quot; &quot;That is likely enough. If she seemed to be senseless, they would not take her life. What about this poor fellow, Hopkins? I seem to have heard some queer stories about him.&quot; &quot;He was a good-hearted man when he was sober, but a perfect fiend when he was drunk, or rather when he was half drunk, for he seldom really went the whole way. The devil seemed to be in him at such times, and he was capable of anything. From what I hear, in spite of all his wealth and his title, he very nearly came our way once or twice. There was a scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum and setting it on fire- her ladyship&#x27;s dog, to make the matter worse- and that was only hushed up with difficulty. Then he threw a decanter at that maid, Theresa Wright- there was trouble about that. On the whole, and between ourselves, it will be a brighter house without him. What are you looking at now?&quot; Holmes was down on his knees, examining with great attention the knots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured. Then he carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down. &quot;When this was pulled down, the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly,&quot; he remarked. &quot;No one could hear it. The kitchen stands right at the back of the house.&quot; &quot;How did the burglar know no one would hear it? How dared he pull at a bellrope in that reckless fashion?&quot; &quot;Exactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly. You put the very question which I have asked myself again and again. There can be no doubt that this fellow must have known the house and its habits. He must have perfectly understood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively early hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the kitchen. Therefore, he must have been in close league with one of the servants. Surely that is evident. But there are eight servants, and all of good character.&quot; &quot;Other things being equal,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;one would suspect the one at whose head the master threw a decanter. And yet that would involve treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted. Well, well, the point is a minor one, and when you have Randall you will probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice. The lady&#x27;s story certainly seems to be corroborated, if it needed corroboration, by every detail which we see before us.&quot; He walked to the French window and threw it open. &quot;There are no signs here, but the ground is iron hard, and one would not expect them. I see that these candles in the mantelpiece have been lighted.&quot; &quot;Yes, it was by their light and that of the lady&#x27;s bedroom candle, that the burglars saw their way about.&quot; &quot;And what did they take?&quot; &quot;Well, they did not take much- only half a dozen articles of plate off the sideboard. Lady Brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so disturbed by the death of Sir Eustace that they did not ransack the house, as they would otherwise have done.&quot; &quot;No doubt that is true, and yet they drank some wine, I understand.&quot; &quot;To steady their nerves.&quot; &quot;Exactly. These three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched, I suppose?&quot; &quot;Yes, and the bottle stands as they left it.&quot; &quot;Let us look at it. Halloa, halloa! What is this?&quot; The three glasses were grouped together, all of them tinged with wine, and one of them containing some dregs of beeswing. The bottle stood near them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long, deeply stained cork. Its appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers had enjoyed. A change had come over Holmes&#x27;s manner. He had lost his listless expression, and again I saw an alert light of interest in his keen, deep-set eyes. He raised the cork and examined it minutely. &quot;How did they draw it?&quot; he asked. Hopkins pointed to a half-opened drawer. In it lay some table linen and a large corkscrew. &quot;Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was used?&quot; &quot;No, you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened.&quot; &quot;Quite so. As a matter of fact, that screw was not used. This bottle was opened by a pocket screw, probably contained in a knife, and not more than an inch and a half long. If you will examine the top of the cork, you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extracted. It has never been transfixed. This long screw would have transfixed it and drawn it up with a single pull. When you catch this fellow, you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his possession.&quot; &quot;Excellent!&quot; said Hopkins. &quot;But these glasses do puzzle me, I confess. Lady Brackenstall actually saw the three men drinking, did she not?&quot; &quot;Yes; she was clear about that.&quot; &quot;Then there is an end of it. What more is to be said? And yet, you must admit, that the three glasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. What? You see nothing remarkable? Well, well, let it pass. Perhaps, when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own, it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand. Of course, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. Well, good-morning, Hopkins. I don&#x27;t see that I can be of any use to you, and you appear to have your case very clear. You will let me know when Randall is arrested, and any further developments which may occur. I trust that I shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion. Come, Watson, I fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home.&quot; During our return journey, I could see by Holmes&#x27;s face that he was much puzzled by something which he had observed. Every now and then, by an effort, he would throw off the impression, and talk as if the matter were clear, but then his doubts would settle down upon him again, and his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had gone back once more to the great diningroom of the Abbey Grange, in which this midnight tragedy had been enacted. At last, by a sudden impulse, just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station, he sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him. &quot;Excuse me, my dear fellow,&quot; said he, as we watched the rear carriages of our train disappearing round a curve, &quot;I am sorry to make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life, Watson, I simply can&#x27;t leave that case in this condition. Every instinct that I possess cries out against it. It&#x27;s wrong- it&#x27;s all wrong- I&#x27;ll swear that it&#x27;s wrong. And yet the lady&#x27;s story was complete, the maid&#x27;s corroboration was sufficient, the detail was fairly exact. What have I to put up against that? Three wine-glasses, that is all. But if I had not taken things for granted, if I had examined everything with care which I should have shown had we approached the case de novo and had no cut-and-dried story to warp my mind, should I not then have found something more definite to go upon? Of course I should. Sit down on this bench, Watson, until a train for Chiselhurst arrives, and allow me to lay the evidence before you, imploring you in the first instance to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or her mistress may have said must necessarily be true. The lady&#x27;s charming personality must not be permitted to warp our judgment. &quot;Surely there are details in her story which, if we looked at in cold blood, would excite our suspicion. These burglars made a considerable haul at Sydenham a fortnight ago. Some account of them and of their appearance was in the papers, and would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part. As a matter of fact, burglars who have done a good stroke of business are, as a rule, only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking. Again, it is unusual for burglars to operate at so early an hour, it is unusual for burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream, it is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man, it is unusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there was much more within their reach, and finally, I should say, that it was very unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty. How do all these unusuals strike you, Watson?&quot; &quot;Their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of them is quite possible in itself. The most unusual thing of all, as it seems to me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair.&quot; &quot;Well, I am not so clear about that, Watson, for it is evident that they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she could not give immediate notice of their escape. But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady&#x27;s story? And now, on the top of this, comes the incident of the wineglasses.&quot; &quot;What about the wineglasses?&quot; &quot;Can you see them in your mind&#x27;s eye?&quot; &quot;I see them clearly.&quot; &quot;We are told that three men drank from them. Does that strike you as likely?&quot; &quot;Why not? There was wine in each glass.&quot; &quot;Exactly, but there was beeswing only in one glass. You must have noticed that fact. What does that suggest to your mind?&quot; &quot;The last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing.&quot; &quot;Not at all. The bottle was full of it, and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it. There are two possible explanations, and only two. One is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the third glass received the beeswing. That does not appear probable. No, no, I am sure that I am right.&quot; &quot;What, then, do you suppose?&quot; &quot;That only two glasses were used, and that the dregs of both were poured into a third glass, so as to give the false impression that three people had been here. In that way all the beeswing would be in the last glass, would it not? Yes, I am convinced that this is so. But if I have hit upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon, then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable, for it can only mean that Lady Brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied to us, that not one word of their story is to be believed, that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal, and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them. That is the mission which now lies before us, and here, Watson, is the Sydenham train.&quot; The household at the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return, but Sherlock Holmes, finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone off to report to headquarters, took possession of the dining-room, locked the door upon the inside, and devoted himself for two hours to one of those minute and laborious investigations which form the solid basis on which his brilliant edifices of deduction were reared. Seated in a corner like an interested student who observes the demonstration of his professor, I followed every step of that remarkable research. The window, the curtains, the carpet, the chair, the rope- each in turn was minutely examined and duly pondered. The body of the unfortunate baronet had been removed, and all else remained as we had seen it in the morning. Finally, to my astonishment, Holmes climbed up on to the massive mantelpiece. Far above his head hung the few inches of red cord which were still attached to the wire. For a long time he gazed upward at it, and then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the wall. This brought his hand within a few inches of the broken end of the rope, but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which seemed to engage his attention. Finally, he sprang down with an ejaculation of satisfaction. &quot;It&#x27;s all right, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;We have got our case- one of the most remarkable in our collection. But, dear me, how slow-witted I have been, and how nearly I have committed the blunder of my lifetime! Now, I think that, with a few missing links, my chain is almost complete.&quot; &quot;You have got your men?&quot; &quot;Man, Watson, man. Only one, but a very formidable person. Strong as a lion- witness the blow that bent that poker! Six foot three in height, active as a squirrel, dexterous with his fingers, finally, remarkably quick-witted, for this whole ingenious story is of his concoction. Yes, Watson, we have come upon the handiwork of a very remarkable individual. And yet, in that bell-rope, he has given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt.&quot; &quot;Where was the clue?&quot; &quot;Well, if you were to pull down a bell-rope, Watson, where would you expect it to break? Surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire. Why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?&quot; &quot;Because it is frayed there?&quot; &quot;Exactly. This end, which we can examine, is frayed. He was cunning enough to do that with his knife. But the other end is not frayed. You could not observe that from here, but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever. You can reconstruct what occurred. The man needed the rope. He would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell. What did he do? He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put his knee on the bracket- you will see the impression in the dust- and so got his knife to bear upon the cord. I could not reach the place by at least three inches- from which I infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than I. Look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair! What is it?&quot; &quot;Blood.&quot; &quot;Undoubtedly it is blood. This alone puts the lady&#x27;s story out of court. If she were seated on the chair when the crime was done, how comes that mark? No, no, she was placed in the chair after the death of her husband. I&#x27;ll wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to this. We have not yet met our Waterloo, Watson, but this is our Marengo, for it begins in defeat and ends in victory. I should like now to have a few words with the nurse, Theresa. We must be wary for a while, if we are to get the information which we want.&quot; She was an interesting person, this stern Australian nurse- taciturn, suspicious, ungracious, it took some time before Holmes&#x27;s pleasant manner and frank acceptance of all that she said thawed her into a corresponding amiability. She did not attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer. &quot;Yes, sir, it is true that he threw the decanter at me. I heard him call my mistress a name, and I told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there. Then it was that he threw it at me. He might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone. He was forever ill-treating her, and she too proud to complain. She will not even tell me all that he has done to her. She never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning, but I know very well that they come from a stab with a hatpin. The sly devil- God forgive me that I should speak of him so, now that he is dead! But a devil he was, if ever one walked the earth. He was all honey when first we met him- only eighteen months ago, and we both feel as if it were eighteen years. She had only just arrived in London. Yes, it was her first voyage- she had never been from home before. He won her with his title and his money and his false London ways. If she made a mistake she has paid for it, if ever a woman did. What month did we meet him? Well, I tell you it was just after we arrived. We arrived in June, and it was July. They were married in January of last year. Yes, she is down in the morning-room again, and I have no doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too much of her, for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand.&quot; Lady Brackenstall was reclining on the same couch, but looked brighter than before. The maid had entered with us, and began once more to foment the bruise upon her mistress&#x27;s brow. &quot;I hope,&quot; said the lady, &quot;that you have not come to cross-examine me again?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Holmes answered, in his gentlest voice, &quot;I will not cause you any unnecessary trouble, Lady Brackenstall, and my whole desire is to make things easy for you, for I am convinced that you are a much-tried woman. If you will treat me as a friend and trust me, you may find that I will justify your trust.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; &quot;To tell me the truth.&quot; &quot;Mr. Holmes!&quot; &quot;No, no, Lady Brackenstall- it is no use. You may have heard of any little reputation which I possess. I will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute fabrication.&quot; Mistress and maid were both staring at Holmes with pale faces and frightened eyes. &quot;You are an impudent fellow!&quot; cried Theresa. &quot;Do you mean to say that my mistress has told a lie?&quot; Holmes rose from his chair. &quot;Have you nothing to tell me?&quot; &quot;I have told you everything.&quot; &quot;Think once more, Lady Brackenstall. Would it not be better to be frank?&quot; For an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face. Then some new strong thought caused it to set like a mask. &quot;I have told you all I know.&quot; Holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I am sorry,&quot; he said, and without another word we left the room and the house. There was a pond in the park, and to this my friend led the way. It was frozen over, but a single hole was left for the convenience of a solitary swan. Holmes gazed at it, and then passed on to the lodge gate. There he scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins, and left it with the lodge-keeper. &quot;It may be a hit, or it may be a miss, but we are bound to do something for friend Hopkins, just to justify this second visit,&quot; said he. &quot;I will not quite take him into my confidence yet. I think our next scene of operations must be the shipping office of the Adelaide-Southampton line, which stands at the end of Pall Mall, if I remember right. There is a second line of steamers which connect South Australia with England, but we will draw the larger cover first.&quot; Holmes&#x27;s card sent in to the manager ensured instant attention, and he was not long in acquiring all the information he needed. In June of &#x27;95, only one of their line had reached a home port. It was the Rock of Gibraltar, their largest and best boat. A reference to the passenger list showed that Miss Fraser, of Adelaide, with her maid had made the voyage in her. The boat was now somewhere south of the Suez Canal on her way to Australia. Her officers were the same as in &#x27;95, with one exception. The first officer, Mr. Jack Crocker, had been made a captain and was to take charge of their new ship, the Bass Rock, sailing in two days&#x27; time from Southampton. He lived at Sydenham, but he was likely to be in that morning for instructions, if we cared to wait for him. No, Mr. Holmes had no desire to see him, but would be glad to know more about his record and character. His record was magnificent. There was not an officer in the fleet to touch him. As to his character, he was reliable on duty, but a wild, desperate fellow off the deck of his ship- hot-headed, excitable, but loyal, honest, and kind-hearted. That was the pith of the information with which Holmes left the office of the Adelaide-Southampton company. Thence he drove to Scotland Yard, but, instead of entering, he sat in his cab with his brows drawn down, lost in profound thought. Finally he drove round to the Charing Cross telegraph office, sent off a message, and then, at last, we made for Baker Street once more. &quot;No, I couldn&#x27;t do it, Watson,&quot; said he, as we reentered our room. &quot;Once that warrant was made out, nothing on earth would save him. Once or twice in my career I feel that I have done more real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime. I have learned caution now, and I had rather play tricks with the law of England than with my own conscience. Let us know a little more before we act.&quot; Before evening, we had a visit from Inspector Stanley Hopkins. Things were not going very well with him. &quot;I believe that you are a wizard, Mr. Holmes. I really do sometimes think that you have powers that are not human. Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t know it.&quot; &quot;But you told me to examine it.&quot; &quot;You got it, then?&quot; &quot;Yes, I got it.&quot; &quot;I am very glad if I have helped you.&quot; &quot;But you haven&#x27;t helped me. You have made the affair far more difficult. What sort of burglars are they who steal silver and then throw it into the nearest pond?&quot; &quot;It was certainly rather eccentric behaviour. I was merely going on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not want it- who merely took it for a blind, as it were- then they would naturally be anxious to get rid of it.&quot; &quot;But why should such an idea cross your mind?&quot; &quot;Well, I thought it was possible. When they came out through the French window, there was the pond with one tempting little hole in the ice, right in front of their noses. Could there be a better hiding-place?&quot; &quot;Ah, a hiding-place- that is better!&quot; cried Stanley Hopkins. &quot;Yes, yes, I see it all now! It was early, there were folk upon the roads, they were afraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank it in the pond, intending to return for it when the coast was clear. Excellent, Mr. Holmes- that is better than your idea of a blind.&quot; &quot;Quite so, you have got an admirable theory. I have no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild, but you must admit that they have ended in discovering the silver.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir- yes. It was all your doing. But I have had a bad setback.&quot; &quot;A setback?&quot; &quot;Yes, Mr. Holmes. The Randall gang were arrested in New York this morning.&quot; &quot;Dear me, Hopkins! That is certainly rather against your theory that they committed a murder in Kent last night.&quot; &quot;It is fatal, Mr. Holmes- absolutely fatal. Still, there are other gangs of three besides the Randalls, or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard.&quot; &quot;Quite so, it is perfectly possible. What, are you off?&quot; Yes, Mr. Holmes, there is no rest for me until I have got to the bottom of the business. I suppose you have no hint to give me?&quot; &quot;I have given you one.&quot; &quot;Which?&quot; &quot;Well, I suggested a blind.&quot; &quot;But why, Mr. Holmes, why?&quot; &quot;Ah, that&#x27;s the question, of course. But I commend the idea to your mind. You might possibly find that there was something in it. You won&#x27;t stop for dinner? Well, good-bye, and let us know how you get on.&quot; Dinner was over, and the table cleared before Holmes alluded to the matter again. He had lit his pipe and held his slippered feet to the cheerful blaze of the fire. Suddenly he looked at his watch. &quot;I expect developments, Watson.&quot; &quot;When?&quot; &quot;Now- within a few minutes. I dare say you thought I acted rather badly to Stanley Hopkins just now?&quot; &quot;I trust your judgment.&quot; &quot;A very sensible reply, Watson. You must look at it this way: what I know is unofficial, what he knows is official. I have the right to private judgment, but he has none. He must disclose all, or he is a traitor to his service. In a doubtful case I would not put him in so painful a position, and so I reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter.&quot; &quot;But when will that be?&quot; &quot;The time has come. You will now be present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama.&quot; There was a sound upon the stairs, and our door was opened to admit as fine a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it. He was a very tall young man, golden-moustached, blue-eyed, with a skin which had been burned by tropical suns, and a springy step, which showed that the huge frame was as active as it was strong. He closed the door behind him, and then he stood with clenched hands and heaving breast, choking down some overmastering emotion. &quot;Sit down, Captain Crocker. You got my telegram?&quot; Our visitor sank into an armchair and looked from one to the other of us with questioning eyes. &quot;I got your telegram, and I came at the hour you said. I heard that you had been down to the office. There was no getting away from you. Let&#x27;s hear the worst. What are you going to do with me? Arrest me? Speak out, man! You can&#x27;t sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse.&quot; &quot;Give him a cigar,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Bite on that, Captain Crocker, and don&#x27;t let your nerves run away with you. I should not sit here smoking with you if I thought that you were a common criminal, you may be sure of that. Be frank with me and we may do some good. Play tricks with me, and I&#x27;ll crush you.&quot; &quot;What do you wish me to do?&quot; &quot;To give me a true account of all that happened at the Abbey Grange last night- a true account, mind you, with nothing added and nothing taken off. I know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight, I&#x27;ll blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of my hands forever.&quot; The sailor thought for a little. Then he struck his leg with his great sunburned hand. &quot;I&#x27;ll chance it,&quot; he cried. &quot;I believe you are a man of your word, and a white man, and I&#x27;ll tell you the whole story. But one thing I will say first. So far as I am concerned, I regret nothing and I fear nothing, and I would do it all again and be proud of the job. Damn the beast, if he had as many lives as a cat, he would owe them all to me! But it&#x27;s the lady, Mary- Mary Fraser- for never will I call her by that accursed name. When I think of getting her into trouble, I who would give my life just to bring one smile to her dear face, it&#x27;s that that turns my soul into water. And yet- and yet- what less could I do? I&#x27;ll tell you my story, gentlemen, and then I&#x27;ll ask you, as man to man, what less could I do? &quot;I must go back a bit. You seem to know everything, so I expect that you know that I met her when she was a passenger and I was first officer of the Rock of Gibraltar. From the first day I met her, she was the only woman to me. Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. I have no complaint to make. It was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man. &quot;Next time I came back from sea, I heard of her marriage. Well, why shouldn&#x27;t she marry whom she liked? Title and money- who could carry them better than she? She was born for all that is beautiful and dainty. I didn&#x27;t grieve over her marriage. I was not such a selfish hound as that. I just rejoiced that good luck had come her way, and that she had not thrown herself away on a penniless sailor. That&#x27;s how I loved Mary Fraser. &quot;Well, I never thought to see her again, but last voyage I was promoted, and the new boat was not yet launched, so I had to wait for a couple of months with my people at Sydenham. One day out in a country lane I met Theresa Wright, her old maid. She told me all about her, about him, about everything. I tell you, gentlemen, it nearly drove me mad. This drunken hound, that he should dare to raise his hand to her, whose boots he was not worthy to lick! I met Theresa again. Then I met Mary herself- and met her again. Then she would meet me no more. But the other day I had a notice that I was to start on my voyage within a week, and I determined that I would see her once before I left. Theresa was always my friend, for she loved Mary and hated this villain almost as much as I did. From her I learned the ways of the house. Mary used to sit up reading in her own little room downstairs. I crept round there last night and scratched at the window. At first she would not open to me, but in her heart I know that now she loves me, and she could not leave me in the frosty night. She whispered to me to come round to the big front window, and I found it open before me, so as to let me into the dining-room. Again I heard from her own lips things that made my blood boil, and again I cursed this brute who mishandled the woman I loved. Well, gentlemen, I was standing with her just inside the window, in all innocence, as God is my judge, when he rushed like a madman into the room, called her the vilest name that a man could use to a woman, and welted her across the face with the stick he had in his hand. I had sprung for the poker, and it was a fair fight between us. See here, on my arm, where his first blow fell. Then it was my turn, and I went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin. Do you think I was sorry? Not If It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman? That was how I killed him. Was I wrong? Well, then, what would either of you gentlemen have done, if you had been in my position?&quot; &quot;She had screamed when he struck her, and that brought old Theresa down from the room above. There was a bottle of wine on the sideboard, and I opened it and poured a little between Mary&#x27;s lips, for she was half dead with shock. Then I took a drop myself. Theresa was as cool as ice, and it was her plot as much as mine. We must make it appear that burglars had done the thing. Theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress, while I swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell. Then I lashed her in her chair, and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural, else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it. Then I gathered up a few plates and pots of silver, to carry out the idea of the robbery, and there I left them, with orders to give the alarm when I had a quarter of an hour&#x27;s start. I dropped the silver into the pond, and made off for Sydenham, feeling that for once in my life I had done a real good night&#x27;s work. And that&#x27;s the truth and the whole truth, Mr. Holmes, if it costs me my neck.&quot; Holmes smoked for some time in silence. Then he crossed the room, and shook our visitor by the hand. &quot;That&#x27;s what I think,&quot; said he. &quot;I know that every word is true, for you have hardly said a word which I did not know. No one but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bell-rope from the bracket, and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened to the chair. Only once had this lady been brought into contact with sailors, and that was on her voyage, and it was someone of her own class of life, since she was trying hard to shield him, and so showing that she loved him. You see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once I had started upon the right trail.&quot; &quot;I thought the police never could have seen through our dodge.&quot; &quot;And the police haven&#x27;t, nor will they, to the best of my belief. Now, look here, Captain Crocker, this is a very serious matter, though I am willing to admit that you acted under the most extreme provocation to which any man could be subjected. I am not sure that in defence of your own life your action will not be pronounced legitimate. However, that is for a British jury to decide. Meanwhile I have so much sympathy for you that, if you choose to disappear in the next twenty-four hours, I will promise you that no one will hinder you.&quot; &quot;And then it will all come out?&quot; &quot;Certainly it will come out.&quot; The sailor flushed with anger. &quot;What sort of proposal is that to make a man? I know enough of law to understand that Mary would be held as accomplice. Do you think I would leave her alone to face the music while I slunk away? No, sir, let them do their worst upon me, but for heaven&#x27;s sake, Mr. Holmes, find some way of keeping my poor Mary out of the courts.&quot; Holmes for a second time held out his hand to the sailor. &quot;I was only testing you, and you ring true every time. Well, it is a great responsibility that I take upon myself, but I have given Hopkins an excellent hint and if he can&#x27;t avail himself of it I can do no more. See here, Captain Crocker, we&#x27;ll do this in due form of law. You are the prisoner. Watson, you are a British jury, and I never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one. I am the judge. Now, gentleman of the jury, you have heard the evidence. Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?&quot; &quot;Not guilty, my lord,&quot; said I. &quot;Vox populi, vox dei. You are acquitted, Captain Crocker. So long as the law does not find some other victim you are safe from me. Come back to this lady in a year, and may her future and yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this night!&quot; -THE END- . 1892 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet. &quot;Holmes,&quot; said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, &quot;here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.&quot; My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The gray pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention. He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-gray trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions. &quot;What on earth can be the matter with him?&quot; I asked. &quot;He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.&quot; &quot;I believe that he is coming here,&quot; said Holmes, rubbing his hands. &quot;Here?&quot; &quot;Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognize the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?&quot; As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging. A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ. &quot;You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?&quot; said he. &quot;You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.&quot; The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us. &quot;No doubt you think me mad?&quot; said he. &quot;I see that you have had some great trouble,&quot; responded Holmes. &quot;God knows I have!-a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.&quot; &quot;Pray compose yourself, sir,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.&quot; &quot;My name,&quot; answered our visitor, &quot;is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &amp; Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.&quot; The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story. &quot;I feel that time is of value,&quot; said he; &quot;that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your cooperation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can. &quot;It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate. &quot;Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than-well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth-one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task. &quot;&#x27;Mr. Holder,&#x27; said he, &#x27;I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;The firm does so when the security is good,&#x27; I answered. &quot;&#x27;It is absolutely essential to me,&#x27; said he, &#x27;that I should have L50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one&#x27;s self under obligations.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?&#x27; I asked. &quot;&#x27;Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,&#x27; said I, &#x27;were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I should much prefer to have it so,&#x27; said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. &#x27;You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,&#x27; said I. &quot;&#x27;Precisely.&#x27; He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. &#x27;There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,&#x27; said he, &#x27;and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.&#x27; &quot;I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client. &quot;&#x27;You doubt its value?&#x27; he asked. &quot;&#x27;Not at all. I only doubt-&#x27; &quot;&#x27;The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Ample.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.&#x27; &quot;Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more; but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty L1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work. &quot;When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers&#x27; safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room. &quot;And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way. &quot;So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes-a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best. &quot;It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again. &quot;And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman&#x27;s quick insight into character. &quot;And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late-forever too late! &quot;Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story. &quot;When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it. &quot;&#x27;Where have you put it?&#x27; asked Arthur. &quot;&#x27;In my own bureau.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Well, I hope to goodness the house won&#x27;t be burgled during the night,&#x27; said he. &quot;&#x27;It is locked up,&#x27; I answered. &quot;&#x27;Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.&#x27; &quot;He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face. &quot;&#x27;Look here, dad,&#x27; said he with his eyes cast down, &#x27;can you let me have L200?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;No, I cannot!&#x27; I answered sharply. &#x27;I have been far too generous with you in money matters.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;You have been very kind,&#x27; said he, &#x27;but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;And a very good thing, too!&#x27; I cried. &quot;&#x27;Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,&#x27; said he. &#x27;I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.&#x27; &quot;I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. &#x27;You shall not have a farthing from me,&#x27; cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word. &quot;When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure-a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hail, which she closed and fastened as I approached. &quot;&#x27;Tell me, dad,&#x27; said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, &#x27;did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Certainly not.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Quite sure, dad.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Then, good-night.&#x27; I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep. &quot;I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.&quot; &quot;On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.&quot; &quot;I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, an palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door. &quot;&#x27;Arthur&#x27; I screamed, &#x27;you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?&#x27; &quot;The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing. &quot;&#x27;You blackguard!&#x27; I shouted, beside myself with rage. &#x27;You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Stolen!&#x27; he cried. &quot;&#x27;Yes, thief!&#x27; I roared, shaking him by the shoulder. &quot;&#x27;There are none missing. there cannot be any missing,&#x27; said he. &quot;&#x27;There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;You have called me names enough,&#x27; said he; &#x27;I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;You shall leave it in the hands of the police!&#x27; I cried, half-mad with grief and rage. &#x27;I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;You shall learn nothing from me,&#x27; said he with a passion such as I should not have thought you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.&quot; &quot;By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of and of Arthur&#x27;s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything. &quot;&#x27;At least,&#x27; said he, &#x27;you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen; said I. And then, realizing the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones. &quot;&#x27;You may as well face the matter,&#x27; said I; &#x27;you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,&#x27; he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of L1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!&quot; He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words. Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire. &quot;Do you receive much company?&quot; he asked. &quot;None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur&#x27;s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.&quot; &quot;Do you go out much in society?&quot; &quot;Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.&quot; &quot;That is unusual in a young girl.&quot; &quot;She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and twenty.&quot; &quot;This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.&quot; &quot;Terrible! She is even more affected than I.&quot; &quot;You have neither of you any doubt as to your son&#x27;s guilt?&quot; &quot;How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.&quot; &quot;I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?&quot; &quot;Yes, it was twisted.&quot; &quot;Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?&quot; &quot;God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?&quot; &quot;Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. there are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?&quot; &quot;They considered that it might be caused by Arthur&#x27;s closing his bedroom door.&quot; &quot;A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?&quot; &quot;They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.&quot; &quot;Have they thought of looking outside the house?&quot; &quot;Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.&quot; &quot;Now, my dear sir,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?&quot; &quot;But what other is there?&quot; cried the banker with a gesture of despair. &quot;If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?&quot; &quot;It is our task to find that out,&quot; replied Holmes; &quot;so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.&quot; My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker&#x27;s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes&#x27;s judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier. Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen&#x27;s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen&#x27;s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman&#x27;s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress. &quot;You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?&quot; she asked. &quot;No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.&quot; &quot;But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman&#x27;s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.&quot; &quot;Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?&quot; &quot;Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.&quot; &quot;How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?&quot; &quot;Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!&quot; &quot;I shall never let it drop until the gems are found-never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.&quot; &quot;This gentleman?&quot; she asked, facing round to me. &quot;No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.&quot; &quot;The stable lane?&quot; She raised her dark eyebrows. &quot;What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth. that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.&quot; &quot;I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,&quot; returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. &quot;I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?&quot; &quot;Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.&quot; &quot;You heard nothing yourself last night?&quot; &quot;Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.&quot; &quot;You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Were they all fastened this morning?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?&quot; &quot;Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle&#x27;s remarks about the coronet.&quot; &quot;I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.&quot; &quot;But what is the good of all these vague theories,&quot; cried the banker impatiently, &quot;When I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?&quot; &quot;Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?&quot; &quot;Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.&quot; &quot;Do you know him?&quot; &quot;Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.&quot; &quot;He stood,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;to the left of the door-that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?&quot; &quot;Yes, he did.&quot; &quot;And he is a man with a wooden leg?&quot; Something like fear sprang up in the young lady&#x27;s expressive black eyes. &quot;Why, you are like a magician,&quot; said she. &quot;How do you know that?&quot; She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes&#x27;s thin, eager face. &quot;I should be very glad now to go upstairs,&quot; said he. &quot;I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.&quot; He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. &quot;Now we shall go upstairs,&quot; said he at last. The banker&#x27;s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a gray carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock. &quot;Which key was used to open it?&quot; he asked. &quot;That which my son himself indicated-that of the cupboard of the lumber room.&quot; &quot;Have you it here?&quot; &quot;That is it on the dressing-table.&quot; Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau. &quot;It is a noiseless lock,&quot; said he. &quot;It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.&quot; He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller&#x27;s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away. &quot;Now, Mr. Holder,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.&quot; The banker recoiled in horror. &quot;I should not dream of trying,&quot; said he. &quot;Then I will.&quot; Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. &quot;I feel it give a little,&quot; said he; &quot;but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?&quot; &quot;I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.&quot; &quot;But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?&quot; &quot;I confess that I still share my uncle&#x27;s perplexity.&quot; &quot;Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?&quot; &quot;He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.&quot; &quot;Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.&quot; He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever. &quot;I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,&quot; said he; &quot;I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.&quot; &quot;But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?&quot; &quot;I cannot tell.&quot; The banker wrung his hands. &quot;I shall never see them again!&quot; he cried. &quot;And my son? You give me hopes?&quot; &quot;My opinion is in no way altered.&quot; &quot;Then, for God&#x27;s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?&quot; &quot;If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.&quot; &quot;I would give my fortune to have them back.&quot; &quot;Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.&quot; It was obvious to me that my companion&#x27;s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our room once more. He hurried to his chamber, and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class. &quot;I think that this should do,&quot; said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. &quot;I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won&#x27;t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.&quot; He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition. I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea. &quot;I only looked in as I passed,&quot; said he. &quot;I am going right on.&quot; &quot;Where to?&quot; &quot;Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don&#x27;t wait up for me in case I should be late.&quot; &quot;How are you getting on?&quot; &quot;Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.&quot; I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt. I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible. &quot;You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.&quot; &quot;Why, it is after nine now,&quot; answered. &quot;I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.&quot; It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him. &quot;I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,&quot; said he. &quot;Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.&quot; &quot;Deserted you?&quot; &quot;Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note: &#x27;MY DEAREST UNCLE: &#x27;I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever &quot;Your loving &quot;MARY. &quot;What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?&quot; &quot;No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.&quot; &quot;Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?&quot; &quot;You would not think L1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?&quot; &quot;I would pay ten.&quot; &quot;That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for L4000.&quot; With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table. With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up. &quot;You have it!&quot; he gasped. &quot;I am saved! I am saved!&quot; The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom. &quot;There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly. &quot;Owe!&quot; He caught up a pen. &quot;Name the sum, and I will pay it.&quot; &quot;No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.&quot; &quot;Then it was not Arthur who took them?&quot; &quot;I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.&quot; &quot;You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.&quot; &quot;He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.&quot; &quot;For heaven&#x27;s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!&quot; &quot;I will do so, and I will show the steps by which I reached it. And let me to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.&quot; &quot;My Mary? Impossible!&quot; &quot;It is unfortunately more than possible, it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England-a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.&quot; &quot;I cannot, and I will not, believe it!&quot; cried the banker with an ashen face. &quot;I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants&#x27; escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true. &quot;Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you, but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain. &quot;As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.&quot; &quot;Is it possible?&quot; gasped the banker. &quot;You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.&quot; &quot;And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,&quot; cried Mr. Holder. &quot;Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!&quot; &quot;When I arrived at the house,&quot; continued Holmes, &quot;I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen&#x27;s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me. &quot;There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue. &quot;On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief, had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet? &quot;It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret-the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty. &quot;And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family. &quot;Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George&#x27;s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.&quot; &quot;I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,&quot; said Mr. Holder. &quot;Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held-L1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. &#x27;Why, dash it all!&#x27; said he, &#x27;I&#x27;ve let them go at six hundred for the three!&#x27; I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at L1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o&#x27;clock, after what I may call a really hard day&#x27;s work.&quot; &quot;A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,&quot; said the banker, rising. &quot;Sir, I cannot find the words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologize to him for the wrong which I done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.&quot; &quot;I think that we may safely say,&quot; returned Holmes, &quot;that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.&quot; THE END . 1926 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLANCHED SOLDIER by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The ideas of my friend Watson, though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own. Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures. &quot;Try it yourself, Holmes!&quot; he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader. The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection, though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take this opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances. A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closed book, is indeed an ideal helpmate. I find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War, that I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I can recall in our association. I was alone. It is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them. Mr. James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview. I did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions. &quot;From South Africa, sir, I perceive.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; he answered, with some surprise. &quot;Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy.&quot; &quot;Exactly.&quot; &quot;Middlesex Corps, no doubt.&quot; &quot;That is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.&quot; I smiled at his bewildered expression. &quot;When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. You wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. You have the cut of a riding-man. As to Middlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street. What other regiment would you join?&quot; &quot;You see everything.&quot; &quot;I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park?&quot; &quot;Mr. Holmes-!&quot; &quot;My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred.&quot; &quot;Yes, indeed. But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since, then. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out-&quot; &quot;Kicked you out!&quot; &quot;Well that was what it amounted to. He is a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. I couldn&#x27;t have stuck the colonel if it had not been for Godfrey&#x27;s sake.&quot; I lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair. &quot;Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about.&quot; My client grinned mischievously. &quot;I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told,&quot; said he. &quot;But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean. I&#x27;ve been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible does it become. &quot;When I joined up in January, 1901- just two years ago- young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron. He was Colonel Emsworth&#x27;s only son- Emsworth, the Crimean V.C.- and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. There was not a finer lad in the regiment. We formed a friendship- the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. He was my mate- and that means a good deal in the Army. We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. I got one letter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from South Hampton. Since then not a word- not one word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal. &quot;Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back for a year. That was all. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was a good lad, and he would not drop a pal like that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter. It happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years&#x27; absence, and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey&#x27;s case again. But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through.&quot; Mr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke. &quot;Well, what have you done?&quot; I asked. &quot;My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother, therefore- I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father- and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. That was what took me down on Monday. &quot;Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible- five miles from anywhere. There was no trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suitcase, and it was nearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery. There was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house, and there was his wife, who might have been older. She had been Godfrey&#x27;s nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The mother I liked also- a gentle little white mouse of a woman. It was only the colonel himself whom I barred. &quot;We had a bit of barney right away, and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. I was shown straight into his study, and there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling gray beard, seated behind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture&#x27;s beak, and two fierce gray eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father. &quot;&#x27;Well, sir,&#x27; said he in a rasping voice, &#x27;I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit.&#x27; &quot;I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife. &quot;&#x27;Yes, yes, you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa. We have, of course, only your word for that.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I have his letters to me in my pocket.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Kindly let me see them.&#x27; &quot;He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back. &quot;&#x27;Well, what then?&#x27; he asked. &quot;&#x27;I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir. Many ties and memories united us. Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I have some recollections, sir, that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. He has gone upon a voyage round the world. His health was in a poor way after his African experiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Certainly,&#x27; I answered. &#x27;But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him.&#x27; &quot;My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. His great eyebrows came down over his eyes, and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it. &quot;&#x27;Many people, Mr. Dodd,&#x27; said he, &#x27;would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Exactly. I have already made every allowance upon that score. I must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however well-intentioned. My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey&#x27;s past which you are in a position to tell her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone, Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position.&#x27; &quot;So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There was no getting past it. I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend&#x27;s fate had been cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about one&#x27;s quarters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals. &quot;&#x27;I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold.&#x27; &quot;He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face. &quot;&#x27;Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner. You know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so I may say I am his foster-father. It&#x27;s natural we should take an interest. And you say he carried himself well, sir?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;There was never a braver man in the regiment. He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here.&#x27; &quot;The old butler rubbed his skinny hands. &quot;&#x27;Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over. He was always courageous. There&#x27;s not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. Nothing would stop him. He was a fine boy- and oh, sir, he was a fine man.&#x27; &quot;I sprang to my feet. &quot;&#x27;Look here!&#x27; I cried. &#x27;You say he was. You speak as if he were dead. What is all this mystery? What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?&#x27; &quot;I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away. &quot;&#x27;I don&#x27;t know what you mean, sir. Ask the master about Master Godfrey. He knows. It is not for me to interfere.&#x27; &quot;He was leaving the room, but I held his arm. &quot;&#x27;Listen,&#x27; I said. &#x27;You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night. Is Godfrey dead?&#x27; &quot;He could not face my eyes. He was like a man hypnotized. The answer was dragged from his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one. &quot;&#x27;I wish to God he was!&#x27; he cried, and, tearing himself free, he dashed from the room. &quot;You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. The old man&#x27;s words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or, at the least, disreputable transaction which touched the family honour. That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light. Godfrey was a reckless fellow. He was easily influenced by those around him. No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me.&quot; My client had paused as one in deep emotion. &quot;Pray continue,&quot; I said. &quot;Your problem presents some very unusual features.&quot; &quot;He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. I have told you that I looked out at the night. When I did so I left the curtains partly open. His figure was framed in this gap. The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. He was deadly pale- never have I seen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness. &quot;There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes. It wasn&#x27;t merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. It was more subtle than that- something slinking, something furtive, something guilty- something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known. It left a feeling of horror in my mind. &quot;But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window. There was an awkward catch, and I was some little time before I could throw it up. Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken. &quot;It was a long path and the light was not very good, but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. I ran on and called his name, but it was no use. When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away from me, and he had shut a door behind him. Of that I was certain. &quot;There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. Next day I found the colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved. &quot;The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. If the secret lay there it was difficult for me to penetrate it. But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house. I must explore the garden and see what I could find. There was no difficulty in the way, for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices. &quot;There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size- large enough for a gardener&#x27;s or a gamekeeper&#x27;s residence. Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? I approached it in a careless fashion as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat- not at all the gardener type- came out of the door. To my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face. &quot;&#x27;Are you a visitor here?&#x27; he asked. &quot;I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey&#x27;s. &quot;&#x27;What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me,&#x27; I continued. &quot;&#x27;Quite so. Exactly,&#x27; said he with a rather guilty air. &#x27;No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time.&#x27; He passed on, but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden. &quot;I had a good look at that little house as I passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. I might spoil my own game and even be ordered off the premises if I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched. Therefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry. When all was dark and quiet I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge. &quot;I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well. Some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this. I was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter, so that I could see the inside of the room. It was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning. He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper.&quot; &quot;What paper?&quot; I asked. My client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative. &quot;Can it matter?&quot; he asked. &quot;It is most essential&quot; &quot;I really took no notice.&quot; &quot;Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies.&quot; &quot;Now that you mention it, it was not large. It might have been the Spectator. However, I had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey. I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the fire. I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me. &quot;&#x27;This way, sir!&#x27; said he in a low voice. He walked in silence to the house, and I followed him into my own bedroom. He had picked up a time-table in the hall. &quot;&#x27;There is a train to London at 8:30,&#x27; said he. &#x27;The trap will be at the door at eight.&#x27; &quot;He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend. &quot;&#x27;The matter will not bear discussion,&#x27; said he abruptly. &#x27;You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. You were here as a guest and you have become a spy. I have nothing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.&#x27; &quot;At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth. &quot;&#x27;I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do.&#x27; &quot;The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to attack me. I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. For my part, I took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written.&quot; Such was the problem which my visitor laid before me. It presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions. &quot;The servants,&quot; I asked; &quot;how many were in the house?&quot; &quot;To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the simplest fashion.&quot; &quot;There was no servant, then, in the detached house?&quot; &quot;None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. He seemed, however, to be quite a superior person.&quot; &quot;That seems very suggestive. Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other?&quot; &quot;Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment.&quot; &quot;Did you make any local inquiries?&quot; &quot;Yes, I did. I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, Godfrey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. He had come home and then had almost at once started off again. The story was evidently universally accepted.&quot; &quot;You said nothing of your suspicions?&quot; &quot;Nothing.&quot; &quot;That was very wise. The matter should certainly be inquired into. I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park.&quot; &quot;To-day?&quot; It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-gray aspect, with whom I had made the necessary arrangements. &quot;This is an old friend,&quot; said I to Dodd. &quot;It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter.&quot; The narratives of Watson, have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said, and the three of us continued our journey together. in the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear. &quot;You say that you saw your friend&#x27;s face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity?&quot; &quot;I have no doubt about it whatever. His nose was pressed against the glass. The lamplight shone full upon him.&quot; &quot;It could not have been someone resembling him?&quot; &quot;No, no, it was he.&quot; &quot;But you say he was changed?&quot; &quot;Only in colour. His face was- how shall I describe it?- it was of a fish-belly whiteness. It was bleached.&quot; &quot;Was it equally pale all over?&quot; &quot;I think not. It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window.&quot; &quot;Did you call to him?&quot; &quot;I was too startled and horrified for the moment. Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but without result.&quot; My case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. When, after considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. It seemed to centre on the hall-table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. I passed on into the study with my case complete. Alas, that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story! It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales. Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph&#x27;s message. We heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen. He held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments. &quot;Have I not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off the premises? Never dare to show your damned face here again. If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence. I&#x27;ll shoot you, sir! By God, I will! As to you, sir,&quot; turning upon me, &quot;I extend the same warning to you. I am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. There is no opening for them here.&quot; &quot;I cannot leave here,&quot; said my client firmly, &quot;until I hear from Godfrey&#x27;s own lips that he is under no restraint.&quot; Our involuntary host rang the bell. &quot;Ralph,&quot; he said, &quot;telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. Tell him there are burglars in the house.&quot; &quot;One moment,&quot; said I. &quot;You must be aware, Mr. Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. On the other hand, he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. I venture to hope that if I were allowed to have five minutes&#x27; conversation with Colonel Emsworth I could certainly alter his view of the matter.&quot; &quot;I am not so easily altered,&quot; said the old soldier. &quot;Ralph, do what I have told you. What the devil are you waiting for? Ring up the police!&quot; &quot;Nothing of the sort,&quot; I said, putting my back to the door. &quot;Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread.&quot; I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. &quot;That,&quot; said I as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, &quot;is what has brought us here.&quot; He stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished. &quot;How do you know?&quot; he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair. &quot;It is my business to know things. That is my trade.&quot; He sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. Then he made a gesture of resignation. &quot;Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall. It is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that in five minutes we shall be with them.&quot; At the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face. &quot;This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,&quot; said he. &quot;This will disarrange all our plans.&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t help it, Mr. Kent. Our hands have been forced. Can Mr. Godfrey see us?&quot; &quot;Yes, he is waiting inside.&quot; He turned and led us into a large, plainly furnished front room. A man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand. &quot;Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine!&quot; But the other waved him back. &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me, Jimmie. Keep your distance. Yes, you may well stare! I don&#x27;t quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do I?&quot; His appearance was certainly extraordinary. One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an African sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin. &quot;That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t court visitors,&quot; said he. &quot;I don&#x27;t mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done without your friend. I suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.&quot; &quot;I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey. I saw you that night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up.&quot; &quot;Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn&#x27;t help taking a peep at you. I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up.&quot; &quot;But what in heaven&#x27;s name is the matter?&quot; &quot;Well, it&#x27;s not a long story to tell,&quot; said he, lighting a cigarette. &quot;You remember that morning fight at Buffelsspruit, outside Pretoria, on the Eastern railway line? You heard I was hit?&quot; &quot;Yes, I heard that, but I never got particulars.&quot; &quot;Three of us got separated from the others. It was very broken country, you may remember. There was Simpson- the fellow we called Baldy Simpson- and Anderson, and I. We were clearing brother Boer, but he lay low and got the three of us. The other two were killed. I got an elephant bullet through my shoulder. I stuck on to my horse, however, and he galloped several miles before I fainted and rolled off the saddle. &quot;When I came to myself it was nightfall, and I raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. To my surprise there was a house close beside me, a fairly large house with a broad stoop and many windows. It was deadly cold. You remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening, a deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from a crisp healthy frost. Well I was chilled to the bone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house. I staggered to my feet and dragged myself along, hardly conscious of what I did. I have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps, entering a wide-opened door, passing into a large room which contained several beds, and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them. It was unmade, but that troubled me not at all. I drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment I was in a deep sleep. &quot;It was morning when I wakened, and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare. The out African sun flooded through the big, curtainless windows, and every detail of the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear. In front of me was standing a small, dwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head, who was jabbering excitedly in Dutch, waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges. Behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation, but a chill came over me as I looked at them. Not one of them was a normal human being. Every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way. The laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear. &quot;It seemed that none of them could speak English, but the situation wanted clearing up, for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry, and, uttering wild-beast cries, he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound. The little monster was as strong as a bull, and I don&#x27;t know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub. He said a few stern words in Dutch, and my persecutor shrank away. Then he turned upon me, gazing at me in the utmost amazement. &quot;&#x27;How in the world did you come here?&#x27; he asked in amazement. &#x27;Wait a bit! I see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after. I am a doctor, and I&#x27;ll soon have you tied up. But, man alive! you are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield. You are in the Leper Hospital, and you have slept in a leper&#x27;s bed.&#x27; &quot;Need I tell you more, Jimmie? It seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before. Then, as the British advanced, they had been brought back by this, their medical superintendent, who assured me that, though he believed he was immune to the disease, he would none the less never have dared to do what I had done. He put me in a private room, treated me kindly, and within a week or so I was removed to the general hospital at Pretoria. &quot;So there you have my tragedy. I hoped against hope, but it was not until I had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that I had not escaped. What was I to do? I was in this lonely house. We had two servants whom we could utterly trust. There was a house where I could live. Under pledge of secrecy, Mr. Kent, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay with me. It seemed simple enough on those lines. The alternative was a dreadful one- segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release. But absolute secrecy was necessary, or even in this quiet countryside there would have been an outcry, and I should have been dragged to my horrible doom. Even you, Jimmie- even you had to be kept in the dark. Why my father has relented I cannot imagine.&quot; Colonel Emsworth pointed to me. &quot;This is the gentleman who forced my hand.&quot; He unfolded the scrap of paper on which I had written the word &quot;Leprosy.&quot; &quot;It seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all.&quot; &quot;And so it was,&quot; said I. &quot;Who knows but good may come of it? I understand that only Mr. Kent has seen the patient. May I ask, sir, if you are an authority on such complaints, which are, I understand, tropical or semi-tropical in their nature?&quot; &quot;I have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man,&quot; he observed with some stiffness. &quot;I have no doubt, sir, that you are fully competent, but I am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable. You have avoided this, I understand, for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient.&quot; &quot;That is so,&quot; said Colonel Emsworth. &quot;I foresaw this situation,&quot; I explained, &quot;and I have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted. I was able once to do him a professional service, and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist. His name is Sir James Saunders.&quot; The prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of Mr. Kent. &quot;I shall indeed be proud,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Then I will ask Sir James to step this way. He is at present in the carriage outside the door. Meanwhile, Colonel Emsworth, we may perhaps assemble in your study, where I could give the necessary explanations.&quot; And here it is that I miss my Watson. By cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art, which is but systematized common sense, into a prodigy. When I tell my own story I have no such aid. And yet I will give my process of thought even as I gave it to my small audience, which included Godfrey&#x27;s mother in the study of Colonel Emsworth. &quot;That process,&quot; said I, &quot;starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. It may well be that several explanations remain, in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support. We will now apply this principle to the case in point. As it was first presented to me, there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father&#x27;s mansion. There was the explanation, that he was in hiding for a crime, or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he had some disease which caused his segregation. I could think of no other adequate solutions. These, then, had to be sifted and balanced against each other. &quot;The criminal solution would not bear inspection. No unsolved crime had been reported from that district. I was sure of that. If it were some crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home. I could see no explanation for such a line of conduct. &quot;Insanity was more plausible. The presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper. The fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint. On the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend. You, will remember, Mr. Dodd, that I felt round for points, asking you, for example, about the paper which Mr. Kent was reading. Had it been the Lancet or the British Medical Journal it would have helped me. It is not illegal, however, to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the authorities have been duly notified. Why, then, all this desperate desire for secrecy? Once again I could not get the theory to fit the facts. &quot;There remained the third possibility, into which, rare and unlikely as it was, everything seemed to fit. Leprosy is not uncommon in South Africa. By some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it. His people would be placed in a very dreadful position, since they would desire to save him from segregation. Great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities. A devoted medical man, if sufficiently paid, would easily be found to take chance of the sufferer. There would be no reason why the latter should not he allowed freedom after dark. Bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease. The case was a strong one- so strong that I determined to act as if it were actually proved. When on arriving here I noticed that Ralph, who carries out the meals, had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants, my last doubts were removed. A single word showed you, sir, that your secret was discovered, and if I wrote rather than said it, it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted.&quot; I was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in. But for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes. He strode up to Colonel Emsworth and shook him by the hand. &quot;It is often my lot to bring ill-tidings and seldom good,&quot; said he. &quot;This occasion is the more welcome. It is not leprosy.&quot; &quot;A well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis, a scale-like affection of the skin, unsightly, obstinate, but possibly curable, and certainly noninfective. Yes, Mr. Holmes, the coincidence is a remarkable one. But is it coincidence? Are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little? Are we assured that the apprehension from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears? At any rate, I pledge my professional reputation- But the lady has fainted! I think that Mr. Kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock.&quot; -THE END- . THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season.  He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand.  Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places.  A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination. &quot;You are engaged,&quot; said I; &quot;perhaps I interrupt you.&quot; &quot;Not at all.  I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results.  The matter is a perfectly trivial one&quot;--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--&quot;but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.&quot; I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.  &quot;I suppose,&quot; I remarked, &quot;that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.&quot; &quot;No, no.  No crime,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, laughing.  &quot;Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.  Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal.  We have already had experience of such.&quot; &quot;So much so,&quot; I remarked, &quot;that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.&quot; &quot;Precisely.  You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip.  Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.  You know Peterson, the commissionaire?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;It is to him that this trophy belongs.&quot; &quot;It is his hat.&quot; &quot;No, no; he found it.  Its owner is unknown.  I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.  And, first, as to how it came here.  It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson&#x27;s fire.  The facts are these: about four o&#x27;clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road.  In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder.  As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs.  One of the latter knocked off the man&#x27;s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.  Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small sheets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.  The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.&quot; &quot;Which surely he restored to their owner?&quot; &quot;My dear fellow, there lies the problem.  It is true that `For Mrs. Henry Baker&#x27; was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird&#x27;s left leg, and it is also true that the initials `H. B.&#x27; are legible upon the lining of this hat; but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.&quot; &quot;What, then, did Peterson do?&quot; &quot;He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.  The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay.  Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.&quot; &quot;Did he not advertise?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?&quot; &quot;Only as much as we can deduce.&quot; &quot;From his hat?&quot; &quot;Precisely.&quot; &quot;But you are joking.  What can you gather from this old battered felt?&quot; &quot;Here is my lens.  You know my methods.  What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?&quot; I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully.  It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear.  The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.  There was no maker&#x27;s name; but, as Holmes had remarkcd, the initials &quot;H. B.&quot; were scrawled upon one side.  It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing.  For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink. &quot;I can see nothing,&quot; said I, handing it back to my friend. &quot;On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything.  You fail, however, to reason from what you see.  You are too timid in drawing your inferences.&quot; &quot;Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?&quot; He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him.  &quot;It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,&quot; he remarked, &quot;and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability.  That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days.  He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him.  This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.&quot; &quot;My dear Holmes!&quot; &quot;He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,&quot; he continued, disregarding my remonstrance.  &quot;He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.  These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat.  Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.&quot; &quot;You are certainly joking, Holmes.&quot; &quot;Not in the least.  Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?&quot; &quot;I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you.  For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?&quot; For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head.  It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. &quot;It is a question of cubic capacity,&quot; said he; &quot;a man with so large a brain must have something in it.&quot; &quot;The decline of his fortunes, then?&quot; &quot;This hat is three years old.  These flat brims curled at the edge came in then.  It is a hat of the very best quality.  Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.  If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.&quot; &quot;Well, that is clear enough, certainly.  But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?&quot; Sherlock Holmes laughed.  &quot;Here is the foresight,&quot; said he, putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.  &quot;They are never sold upon hats.  If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind.  But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature.  On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.&quot; &quot;Your reasoning is certainly plausible.&quot; &quot;The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.  The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.  They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.  This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, gray dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time; while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.&quot; &quot;But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him.&quot; &quot;This hat has not been brushed for weeks.  When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week&#x27;s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife&#x27;s affection.&quot; &quot;But he might be a bachelor.&quot; &quot;Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.  Remember the card upon the bird&#x27;s leg.&quot; &quot;You have an answer to everything.  But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?&quot; &quot;One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.  Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet.  Are you satisfied?&quot; &quot;Well, it is very ingenious,&quot; said I, laughing; &quot;but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.&quot; Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment. &quot;The goose, Mr. Holmes!  The goose, sir!&quot; he gasped. &quot;Eh?  What of it, then?  Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?&quot;  Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man&#x27;s excited face. &quot;See here, sir!  See what my wife found in its crop!&quot;  He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand. Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle.  &quot;By Jove, Peterson!&quot; said he, &quot;this is treasure trove indeed.  I suppose you know what you have got?&quot; &quot;A diamond, sir?  A precious stone.  It cuts into glass as though it were putty.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s more than a precious stone.  It is the precious stone.&quot; &quot;Not the Countess of Morcar&#x27;s blue carbuncle!&quot; I ejaculated. &quot;Precisely so.  I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately.  It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.&quot; &quot;A thousand pounds!  Great Lord of mercy!&quot;  The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us. &quot;That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.&quot; &quot;It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,&quot; I remarked. &quot;Precisely so, on December 22d, just five days ago.  John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady&#x27;s jewel-case.  The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes.  I have some account of the matter here, I believe.&quot;  He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph: &quot;Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery.  John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22d inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle.  James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Homer up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away.  On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table.  Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Homer was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder&#x27;s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness.  Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Homer, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms.  Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes.  Homer, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court. &quot;Hum!  So much for the police-court,&quot; said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper.  &quot;The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other.  You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you.  So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery.  To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers.  If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.&quot; &quot;What will you say?&quot; &quot;Give me a pencil and that slip of paper.  Now, then: &quot;Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat.  Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street. That is clear and concise.&quot; &quot;Very.  But will he see it?&quot; &quot;Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one.  He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird.  Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it.  Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.&quot; &quot;In which, sir?&quot; &quot;Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James&#x27;s, Evening News Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.&quot; &quot;Very well, sir.  And this stone?&quot; &quot;Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone.  Thank you.  And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.&quot; When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light.  &quot;It&#x27;s a bonny thing,&quot; said he.  &quot;Just see how it glints and sparkles.  Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.  Every good stone is.  They are the devil&#x27;s pet baits.  In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.  This stone is not yet twenty years old.  It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red.  In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.  There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.  Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purueyor to the gallows and the prison?  I&#x27;ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.&quot; &quot;Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?&quot; &quot;I cannot tell.&quot; &quot;Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?&quot; &quot;It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold.  That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.&quot; &quot;And you can do nothing until then?&quot; &quot;Nothing.&quot; &quot;In that case I shall continue my professional round.  But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.&quot; &quot;Very glad to see you.  I dine at seven.  There is a woodcock, I believe.  By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.&quot; I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more.  As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight.  Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes&#x27;s room. &quot;Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,&quot; said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume.  &quot;Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker.  It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter.  Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time.  Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.&quot; He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown.  A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes&#x27;s surmise as to his habits.  His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt.  He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune. &quot;We have retained these things for some days,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address.  I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.&quot; Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh.  &quot;Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,&quot; he remarked.  &quot;I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.  I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.&quot; &quot;Very naturally.  By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.&quot; &quot;To eat it!&quot;  Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement. &quot;Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.  But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?&quot; &quot;Oh, certainly, certainly,&quot; answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief. &quot;Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--&quot; The man burst into a hearty laugh.  &quot;They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,&quot; said he, &quot;but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me.  No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.&quot; Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders. &quot;There is your hat, then, and there your bird,&quot; said he.  &quot;By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?  I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.&quot; &quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm.  &quot;There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand.  This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas.  My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you.  I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.&quot;  With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way. &quot;So much for Mr. Henry Baker,&quot; said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him.  &quot;It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter.  Are you hungry, Watson?&quot; &quot;Not particularly.&quot; &quot;Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.&quot; &quot;By all means.&quot; It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats.  Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots.  Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors&#x27; quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street.  In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn.  Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord. &quot;Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,&quot; said he. &quot;My geese!&quot;  The man seemed surprised. &quot;Yes.  I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.&quot; &quot;Ah! yes, I see.  But you see, sir, them&#x27;s not our geese.&quot; &quot;Indeed!  Whose, then?&quot; &quot;Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.&quot; &quot;Indeed?  I know some of them.  Which was it?&quot; &quot;Breckinridge is his name.&quot; &quot;Ah!  I don&#x27;t know him.  Well, here&#x27;s your good health, landlord, and prosperity to your house.  Good-night.&quot; &quot;Now for Mr. Breckinridge,&quot; he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air.  &quot;Remember, Watson, that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years&#x27; penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence.  It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end.  Faces to the south, then, and quick march!&quot; We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market.  One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsy-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up the shutters. &quot;Good-evening.  It&#x27;s a cold night&quot;&#x27; said Holmes. The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion. &quot;Sold out of geese, I see,&quot; continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble. &quot;Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.&quot; &quot;Thats no good.&quot; &quot;Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.&quot; &quot;Ah, but I was recommended to you.&quot; &quot;Who by?&quot; &quot;The landlord of the Alpha.&quot; &quot;Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.&quot; &quot;Fine birds they were, too.  Now where did you get them from?&quot; To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman. &quot;Now, then, mister,&quot; said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, &quot;what are you driving at?  Let&#x27;s have it straight, now.&quot; &quot;It is straight enough.  I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.&quot; &quot;Well, then, I shan&#x27;t tell you.  So now!&quot; &quot;Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don&#x27;t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.&quot; &quot;Warm!  You&#x27;d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.  When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it&#x27;s `Where are the geese?&#x27; and `Who did you sell the geese to?&#x27; and `What will you take for the geese?&#x27; One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.&quot; &quot;Well,  I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,&quot; said Holmes carelessly.  &quot;If you won&#x27;t tell us the bet is off, that is all.  But I&#x27;m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.&quot; &quot;Well, then, you&#x27;ve lost your fiver, for it&#x27;s town bred,&quot; snapped the salesman. &quot;It&#x27;s nothing of the kind.&quot; &quot;I say it is.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it.&quot; &quot;D&#x27;you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper?  I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll never persuade me to believe that.&quot; &quot;Will you bet, then?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I&#x27;ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.&quot; The salesman chuckled grimly.  &quot;Bring me the books, Bill,&quot; said he. The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp. &quot;Now then, Mr. Cocksure,&quot; said the salesman, &quot;I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you&#x27;ll find that there is still one left in my shop.  You see this little book?&quot; &quot;Well?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s the list of the folk from whom I buy.  D&#x27;you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.  Now, then!  You see this other page in red ink?  Well, that is a list of my town suppliers.  Now, look at that third name.  Just read it out to me.&quot; &quot;Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249,&quot; read Holmes. &quot;Quite so.  Now turn that up in the ledger.&quot; Holmes turned to the page indicated.  &quot;Here you are, `Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Now, then, what&#x27;s the last entry?&quot; &quot;`December 22d.  Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Quite so.  There you are.  And underneath?&quot; &quot;`Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.&#x27;&quot; &quot;What have you to say now?&quot; Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined.  He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words.  A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him. &quot;When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the `Pink &#x27;un&#x27; protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,&quot; said he.  &quot;I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow.  It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should--&quot; His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left.  Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure. &quot;I&#x27;ve had enough of you and your geese,&quot; he shouted.  &quot;I wish you were all at the devil together.  If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I&#x27;ll set the dog at you.  You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I&#x27;ll answer her, but what have you to do with it?  Did I buy the geese off you?&quot; &quot;No; but one of them was mine all the same,&quot; whined the little man. &quot;Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.&quot; &quot;She told me to ask you.&quot; &quot;Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care.  I&#x27;ve had enough of it.  Get out of this!&quot;  He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness. &quot;Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,&quot; whispered Holmes.  &quot;Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.&quot;  Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder.  He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face. &quot;Who are you, then?  What do you want?&quot; he asked in a quavering voice. &quot;You will excuse me,&quot; said Holmes blandly, &quot;but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.  I think that I could be of assistance to you.&quot; &quot;You?  Who are you?  How could you know anything of the matter?&quot; &quot;My name is Sherlock Holmes.  It is my business to know what other people don&#x27;t know.&quot; &quot;But you can know nothing of this?&quot; &quot;Excuse me, I know everything of it.  You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.&quot; &quot;Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,&quot; cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.  &quot;I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.&quot; Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing.  &quot;In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,&quot; said he.  &quot;But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.&quot; The man hesitated for an instant.  &quot;My name is John Robinson,&quot; he answered with a sidelong glance. &quot;No, no; the real name,&quot; said Holmes sweetly.  &quot;It is always awkward doing business with an alias.&quot; A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger.  &quot;Well, then,&quot; said he, &quot;my real name is James Ryder.&quot; &quot;Precisely so.  Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.&quot; The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.  Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street.  Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him. &quot;Here we are!&quot; said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. &quot;The fire looks very seasonable in this weather.  You look cold, Mr. Ryder.  Pray take the basket-chair.  I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours.  Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;Or rather, I fancy, of that goose.  It was one bird, I imagine, in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail.&quot; Ryder quivered with emotion.  &quot;Oh, sir,&quot; he cried, &quot;can you tell me where it went to?&quot; &quot;It came here.&quot; &quot;Here?&quot; &quot;Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved.  I don&#x27;t wonder that you should take an interest in it.  It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.  I have it here in my museum.&quot; Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand.  Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance.  Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it. &quot;The game&#x27;s up, Ryder,&quot; said Holmes quietly.  &quot;Hold up, man, or you&#x27;ll be into the fire!  Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson.  He&#x27;s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity.  Give him a dash of brandy.  So!  Now he looks a little more human.  What a shrimp it is, to be sure!&quot; For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser. &quot;I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.  Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete.  You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar&#x27;s?&quot; &quot;It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,&quot; said he in a crackling voice. &quot;I see--her ladyship&#x27;s waiting-maid.  Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used.  It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you.  You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then?  You made some small job in my lady&#x27;s room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for.  Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested.  You then--&quot; Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion&#x27;s knees.  &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, have mercy!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;Think of my father!  of my mother!  It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before!  I never will again.  I swear it.  I&#x27;ll swear it on a Bible.  Oh, don&#x27;t bring it into court!  For Christ&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t!&quot; &quot;Get back into your chair!&quot; said Holmes sternly.  &quot;It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.&quot; &quot;I will fly, Mr. Holmes.  I will leave the country, sir.  Then the charge against him will break down.&quot; &quot;Hum!  We will talk about that.  And now let us hear a true account of the next act.  How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market?  Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.&quot; Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips.  &quot;I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,&quot; said he.  &quot;When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room.  There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister&#x27;s house.  She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.  All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road.  My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel.  Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do. &quot;I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in PentonvilIe.  One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole.  I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence.  He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety?  I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel.  I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket.  I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived. &quot;My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word.  I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn.  There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail.  I caught it, and, prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach.  The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop.  But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter.  As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others. &quot;`Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?&#x27; says she. &quot;`Well,&#x27; said I, `you said you&#x27;d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.&#x27; &quot;`Oh,&#x27; says she, `we&#x27;ve set yours aside for you--Jem&#x27;s bird, we call it.  It&#x27;s the big white one over yonder.  There&#x27;s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.&#x27; &quot;`Thank you, Maggie,&#x27; says I; `but if it is all the same to you, I&#x27;d rather have that one I was handling just now.&#x27; &quot;`The other is a good three pound heavier,&#x27; said she, `and we fattened it expressly for you.&#x27; &quot;`Never mind.  I&#x27;ll have the other, and I&#x27;ll take it now,&#x27; said I. &quot;`Oh, just as you like,&#x27; said she, a little huffed.  `Which is it you want, then?&#x27; &quot;`That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.&#x27; `Oh, very well.  Kill it and take it with you.&#x27; &quot;Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn.  I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to.  He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose.  My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred.  I left the bird, rushed back to my sister&#x27;s, and hurried into the back yard.  There was not a bird to be seen there. &quot;`Where are they all, Maggie?&#x27; I cried. &quot;`Gone to the dealer&#x27;s, Jem.&#x27; &quot;`Which dealer&#x27;s?&#x27; &quot;`Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.&#x27; &quot;`But was there another with a barred tail?&#x27; I asked, `the same as the one I chose?&#x27; &quot;`Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.&#x27; &quot;Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.  You heard him yourselves to-night.  Well, he has always answered me like that.  My sister thinks that I am going mad.  Sometimes I think that I am myself.  And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character.  God help me!  God help me!&quot;  He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands. There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing, and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s finger-tips upon the edge of the table.  Then my friend rose and threw open the door. &quot;Get out!&quot; said he. &quot;What, sir!  Oh, Heaven bless you!&quot; &quot;No more words.  Get out!&quot; And no more words were needed.  There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street. &quot;After all, Watson,&quot; said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, &quot;I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.  If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse.  I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.  This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.  Send him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life.  Besides, it is the season of forgiveness.  Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.  If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.&quot; . 1908 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLAN by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle In the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog settled down upon London. From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt whether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see the loom of the opposite houses. The first day Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his hobby- the music of the Middle Ages. But when, for the fourth time, after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon the window-panes, my comrade&#x27;s impatient and active nature could endure this drab existence no longer. He paced restlessly about our sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping the furniture, and chafing against inaction. &quot;Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?&quot; he said. I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of criminal interest. There was the news of a revolution, of a possible war, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come within the horizon of my companion. I could see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile. Holmes groaned and resumed his restless meanderings. &quot;The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,&quot; said he in the querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. &quot;Look out of this window, Watson. See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and then blend once more into the cloud-bank. The thief or the murderer could roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen until he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.&quot; &quot;There have,&quot; said I, &quot;been numerous petty thefts.&quot; Holmes snorted his contempt. &quot;This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than that,&quot; said he. &quot;It is fortunate for this community that I am not a criminal.&quot; &quot;It is, indeed!&quot; said I heartily. &quot;Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who have good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against my own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. It is well they don&#x27;t have days of fog in the Latin countries- the countries of assassination. By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead monotony.&quot; It was the maid with a telegram. Holmes tore it open and burst out laughing. &quot;Well, well! What next?&quot; said he. &quot;Brother Mycroft is coming round.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; I asked. &quot;Why not? It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane. Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them. His Pall Mall lodgings, the Diogenes Club, Whitehall- that is his cycle. Once, and only once, he has been here. What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?&quot; &quot;Does he not explain?&quot; Holmes handed me his brother&#x27;s telegram. Must see you over Cadogan West. Coming at once. MYCROFT. &quot;Cadogan West? I have heard the name.&quot; &quot;It recalls nothing to my mind. But that Mycroft should break out in this erratic fashion! A planet might as well leave its orbit. By the way, do you know what Mycroft is?&quot; I had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the Adventure of the Greek Interpreter. &quot;You told me that he had some small office under the British government.&quot; Holmes chuckled. &quot;I did not know you quite so well in those days. One has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of state. You are right in thinking that he is under the British government. You would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally he is the British government.&quot; &quot;My dear Holmes!&quot; &quot;I thought I might surprise you. Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind, will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most indispensable man in the country.&quot; &quot;But how?&quot; &quot;Well, his position is unique. He has made it for himself. There has never been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man living. The same great powers which I have turned to the detection of crime he has used for this particular business. The conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearing-house, which makes out the balance. All other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience. We will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the other. They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself an essential. In that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant. Again and again his word has decided the national policy. He lives in it. He thinks of nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems. But Jupiter is descending to-day. What on earth can it mean? Who is Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?&quot; &quot;I have it,&quot; I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the sofa. &quot;Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough! Cadogan West was the young man who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.&quot; Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips. &quot;This must be serious, Watson. A death which has caused my brother to alter his habits can be no ordinary one. What in the world can he have to do with it? The case was featureless as I remember it. The young man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself. He had not been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect violence. Is that not so?&quot; &quot;There has been an inquest&quot; said I, &quot;and a good many fresh facts have come out. Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a curious case.&quot; &quot;Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a most extraordinary one.&quot; He snuggled down in his armchair. &quot;Now, Watson, let us have the facts.&quot; &quot;The man&#x27;s name was Arthur Cadogan West. He was twenty-seven years of age, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.&quot; &quot;Government employ. Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!&quot; &quot;He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night. Was last seen by his fiancee, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about 7:30 that evening. There was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action. The next thing heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside Aldgate Station on the Underground system in London.&quot; &quot;When?&quot; &quot;The body was found at six on the Tuesday morning. It was lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs. The head was badly crushed- an injury which might well have been caused by a fall from the train. The body could only have come on the line in that way. Had it been carried down from any neighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a collector is always standing. This point seems absolutely certain.&quot; &quot;Very good. The case is definite enough. The man, dead or alive, either fell or was precipitated from a train. So much is clear to me. Continue.&quot; &quot;The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was found are those which run from west to east, some being purely Metropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions. It can be stated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at what point he entered the train it is impossible to state.&quot; &quot;His ticket, of course, would show that.&quot; &quot;There was no ticket in his pockets.&quot; &quot;No ticket! Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According to my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a Metropolitan train without exhibiting one&#x27;s ticket. Presumably, then, the young man had one. Was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came? It is possible. Or did he drop it in the carriage? That also is possible. But the point is of curious interest. I understand that there was no sign of robbery?&quot; &quot;Apparently not. There is a list here of his possessions. His purse contained two pounds fifteen. He had also a check-book on the Woolwich branch of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through this his identity was established. There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for that very evening. Also a small packet of technical papers.&quot; Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction. &quot;There we have it at last, Watson! British government- Woolwich. Arsenal- technical papers- Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete. But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.&quot; A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered into the room. Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind. At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard- thin and austere. The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest. The detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair. &quot;A most annoying business, Sherlock,&quot; said he. &quot;I extremely dislike altering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial. In the present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from the office. But it is a real crisis. I have never seen the Prime Minister so upset. As to the Admiralty- it is buzzing like an overturned bee-hive. Have you read up the case?&quot; &quot;We have just done so. What were the technical papers?&quot; &quot;Ah, there&#x27;s the point! Fortunately, it has not come out. The press would be furious if it did. The papers which this wretched youth had in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.&quot; Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the importance of the subject. His brother and I sat expectant. &quot;Surely you have heard of it? I thought everyone had heard of it.&quot; &quot;Only as a name.&quot; &quot;Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. It has been the most jealously guarded of all government secrets. You may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a Bruce-Partington&#x27;s operation. Two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention. Every effort has been made to keep the secret. The plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with burglar-proof doors and windows. Under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office. If the chief constructor of the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the Woolwich office for the purpose. And yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London. From an official point of view it&#x27;s simply awful.&quot; &quot;But you have recovered them?&quot; &quot;No, Sherlock, no! That&#x27;s the pinch. We have not. Ten papers were taken from Woolwich. There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West. The three most essential are gone- stolen, vanished. You must drop everything, Sherlock. Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police-court. It&#x27;s a vital international problem that you have to solve. Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing ones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the evil be set right? Find an answer to all these questions, and you will have done good service for your country.&quot; &quot;Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft? You can see as far as I.&quot; &quot;Possibly, Sherlock. But it is a question of getting details. Give me your details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent expert opinion. But to run here and run there, to cross-question railway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye- it is not my metier. No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up. If you have a fancy to see your name in the next honours list-&quot; My friend smiled and shook his head. &quot;I play the game for the game&#x27;s own sake,&quot; said he. &quot;But the problem certainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased to look into it. Some more facts, please.&quot; &quot;I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper, together with a few addresses which you will find of service. The actual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert, Sir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a book of reference. He has grown gray in the service, is a gentleman, a favoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose patriotism is beyond suspicion. He is one of two who have a key of the safe. I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during working hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three o&#x27;clock taking his key with him. He was at the house of Admiral Sinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this incident occurred.&quot; &quot;Has the fact been verified?&quot; &quot;Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his departure from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London; so Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.&quot; &quot;Who was the other man with a key?&quot; &quot;The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson. He is a man of forty, married, with five children. He is a silent, morose man, but he has, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service. He is unpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker. According to his own account, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the whole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left the watch-chain upon which it hangs.&quot; &quot;Tell us about Cadogan West.&quot; &quot;He has been ten years in the service and has done good work. He has the reputation of being hot-headed and impetuous, but a straight, honest man. We have nothing against him. He was next Sidney Johnson in the office. His duties brought him into daily, personal contact with the plans. No one else had the handling of them.&quot; &quot;Who locked the plans up that night?&quot; &quot;Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.&quot; &quot;Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away. They are actually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West. That seems final, does it not?&quot; &quot;It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained. In the first place, why did he take them?&quot; &quot;I presume they were of value?&quot; &quot;He could have got several thousands for them very easily.&quot; &quot;Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London except to sell them?&quot; &quot;No, I cannot.&quot; &quot;Then we must take that as our working hypothesis. Young West took the papers. Now this could only be done by having a false key-&quot; &quot;Several false keys. He had to open the building and the room.&quot; &quot;He had, then, several false keys. He took the papers to London to sell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back in the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on this treasonable mission he met his end.&quot; &quot;How?&quot; &quot;We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was killed and thrown out of the compartment.&quot; &quot;Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station for London Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.&quot; &quot;Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London Bridge. There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he was having an absorbing interview. This interview led to a violent scene in which he lost his life. Possibly he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end. The other closed the door. There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.&quot; &quot;No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet consider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched. We will suppose, for argument&#x27;s sake, that young Cadogan West had determined to convey these papers to London. He would naturally have made an appointment with the foreign agent and kept his evening clear. Instead of that he took two tickets for the theatre, escorted his fiance halfway there, and then suddenly disappeared.&quot; &quot;A blind,&quot; said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to the conversation. &quot;A very singular one. That is objection No. 1. Objection No. 2.: We will suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent. He must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered. He took away ten. Only seven were in his pocket. What had become of the other three? He certainly would not leave them of his own free will. Then, again, where is the price of his treason? One would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.&quot; &quot;It seems to me perfectly clear,&quot; said Lestrade. &quot;I have no doubt at all as to what occurred. He took the papers to sell them. He saw the agent. They could not agree as to price. He started home again, but the agent went with him. In the train the agent murdered him, took the more essential papers, and threw his body from, the carriage. That would account for everything, would it not?&quot; &quot;Why had he no ticket?&quot; &quot;The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent&#x27;s house. Therefore he took it from the murdered man&#x27;s pocket.&quot; &quot;Good, Lestrade, very good,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Your theory holds together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end. On the one hand, the traitor is dead. On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably already on the Continent. What is there for us to do?&quot; &quot;To act, Sherlock- to act!&quot; cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. &quot;All my instincts are against this explanation. Use your powers! Go to the scene of the crime! See the people concerned! Leave no stone unturned! In all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your country.&quot; &quot;Well, well!&quot; said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;Come, Watson! And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or two? We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station. Good-bye, Mycroft. I shall let you have a report before evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect.&quot; An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately before Aldgate Station. A courteous red-faced old gentleman represented the railway company. &quot;This is where the young man&#x27;s body lay,&quot; said he, indicating a spot about three feet from the metals. &quot;It could not have fallen from above, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could only have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it, must have passed about midnight on Monday.&quot; &quot;Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?&quot; &quot;There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.&quot; &quot;No record of a door being found open?&quot; &quot;None.&quot; &quot;We have had some fresh evidence this morning,&quot; said Lestrade. &quot;A passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about 11:40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body striking the line, just before the train reached the station. There was dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen. He made no report of it at the time. Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?&quot; My friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon his face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the tunnel. Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points. On these his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I knew so well. &quot;Points,&quot; he muttered; &quot;the points.&quot; &quot;What of it? What do you mean?&quot; &quot;I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as this?&quot; &quot;No; there are very few.&quot; &quot;And a curve, too. Points, and a curve. By Jove! if it were only so.&quot; &quot;What is it, Mr. Holmes? Have you a clue?&quot; &quot;An idea- an indication, no more. But the case certainly grows in interest. Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not? I do not see any indications of bleeding on the line.&quot; &quot;There were hardly any.&quot; &quot;But I understand that there was a considerable wound.&quot; &quot;The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.&quot; &quot;And yet one would have expected some bleeding. Would it be possible for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the thud of a fall in the fog?&quot; &quot;I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been broken up before now, and the carriages redistributed.&quot; &quot;I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said Lestrade, &quot;that every carriage has been carefully examined. I saw to it myself.&quot; It was one of my friend&#x27;s most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient with less alert intelligences than his own. &quot;Very likely,&quot; said he, turning away. &quot;As it happens, it was not the carriages which I desired to examine. Watson, we have done all we can here. We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade. I think our investigations must now carry us to Woolwich.&quot; At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he handed to me before dispatching it. It ran thus: See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out. Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be in England, with full address. SHERLOCK. &quot;That should be helpful, Watson,&quot; he remarked as we took our seats in the Woolwich train. &quot;We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable case.&quot; His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung energy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had opened up a stimulating line of thought. See the foxhound with hanging cars and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it with the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it runs upon a breast-high scent- such was the change in Holmes since the morning. He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a few hours before round the fog-girt room. &quot;There is material here. There is scope,&quot; said he. &quot;I am dull indeed not to have understood its possibilities.&quot; &quot;Even now they are dark to me.&quot; &quot;The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead us far. The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the roof of a carriage.&quot; &quot;On the roof!&quot; &quot;Remarkable, is it not? But consider the facts. Is it a coincidence that it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as it comes round on the points? Is not that the place where an object upon the roof might be expected to fall off? The points would affect no object inside the train. Either the body fell from the roof, or a very curious coincidence has occurred. But now consider the question of the blood. Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body had bled elsewhere. Each fact is suggestive in itself. Together they have a cumulative force.&quot; &quot;And the ticket, too!&quot; I cried. &quot;Exactly. We could not explain the absence of a ticket. This would explain it. Everything fits together.&quot; &quot;But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling the mystery of his death. Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.&quot; &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Holmes thoughtfully, &quot;perhaps.&quot; He relapsed into a silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in Woolwich Station. There he called a cab and drew Mycroft&#x27;s paper from his pocket. &quot;We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,&quot; said he. &quot;I think that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.&quot; The house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns stretching down to the Thames. As we reached it the fog was lifting, and a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through. A butler answered our ring. &quot;Sir James, sir!&quot; said he with solemn face. &quot;Sir James died this morning.&quot; &quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Holmes in amazement. &quot;How did he die?&quot; &quot;Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel Valentine?&quot; &quot;Yes, we had best do so.&quot; We were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we were joined by a very tall, handsome, light-bearded man of fifty, the younger brother of the dead scientist. His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household. He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it. &quot;It was this horrible scandal,&quot; said he. &quot;My brother, Sir James, was a man of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair. It broke his heart. He was always so proud of the efficiency of his department, and this was a crushing blow.&quot; &quot;We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would have helped us to clear the matter up.&quot; &quot;I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all of us. He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police. Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty. But all the rest was inconceivable.&quot; &quot;You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?&quot; &quot;I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard. I have no desire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we are much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview to an end.&quot; &quot;This is indeed an unexpected development,&quot; said my friend when we had regained the cab. &quot;I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the poor old fellow killed himself! If the latter, may it be taken as some sign of self-reproach for duty neglected? We must leave that question to the future. Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.&quot; A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the bereaved mother. The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancee of the dead man, and the last to see him upon that fatal night. &quot;I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,&quot; she said. &quot;I have not shut an eye since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what the true meaning of it can be. Arthur was the most single-minded, chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth. He would have cut his right hand off before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping. It is absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.&quot; &quot;But the facts, Miss Westbury?&quot; &quot;Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.&quot; &quot;Was he in any want of money?&quot; &quot;No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample. He had saved a few hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.&quot; &quot;No signs of any mental excitement? Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely frank with us.&quot; The quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner. She coloured and hesitated. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said at last, &quot;I had a feeling that there was something on his mind.&quot; &quot;For long?&quot; &quot;Only for the last week or so. He was thoughtful and worried. Once I pressed him about it. He admitted that there was something, and that it was concerned with his official life. &#x27;It is too serious for me to speak about, even to you,&#x27; said he. I could get nothing more.&quot; Holmes looked grave. &quot;Go on, Miss Westbury. Even if it seems to tell against him, go on. We cannot say what it may lead to,&quot; &quot;Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. Once or twice it seemed to me that he was on the point of telling me something. He spoke one evening of the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.&quot; My friend&#x27;s face grew graver still. &quot;Anything else?&quot; &quot;He said that we were slack about such matters- that it would be easy for a traitor to get the plans.&quot; &quot;Was it only recently that he made such remarks?&quot; &quot;Yes, quite recently.&quot; &quot;Now tell us of that last evening.&quot; &quot;We were to go to the theatre. The fog was so thick that a cab was useless. We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly he darted away into the fog.&quot; &quot;Without a word?&quot; &quot;He gave an exclamation; that was all. I waited but he never returned. Then I walked home. Next morning, after the office opened, they came to inquire. About twelve o&#x27;clock we heard the terrible news. Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour! It was so much to him.&quot; Holmes shook his head sadly. &quot;Come, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;our ways lie elsewhere. Our next station must be the office from which the papers were taken. &quot;It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries make it blacker,&quot; he remarked as the cab lumbered off. &quot;His coming marriage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally wanted money. The idea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl an accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans. It is all very bad.&quot; &quot;But surely, Holmes, character goes for something? Then, again, why should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a felony?&quot; &quot;Exactly! There are certainly objections. But it is a formidable case which they have to meet.&quot; Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received us with that respect which my companion&#x27;s card always commanded. He was a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard, and his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been subjected. &quot;It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad! Have you heard of the death of the chief?&quot; &quot;We have just come from his house.&quot; &quot;The place is disorganized. The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our papers stolen. And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we were as efficient an office as any in the government service. Good God, it&#x27;s dreadful to think off That West, of all men, should have done such a thing!&quot; &quot;You are sure of his guilt, then?&quot; &quot;I can see no other way out of it. And yet I would have trusted him as I trust myself.&quot; &quot;At what hour was the office closed on Monday?&quot; &quot;At five.&quot; &quot;Did you close it?&quot; &quot;I am always the last man out.&quot; &quot;Where were the plans?&quot; &quot;In that safe. I put them there myself.&quot; &quot;Is there no watchman to the building?&quot; &quot;There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an old soldier and a most trustworthy man. He saw nothing that evening. Of course the fog was very thick.&quot; &quot;Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building after hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could reach the papers?&quot; &quot;Yes, he would. The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and the key of the safe.&quot; &quot;Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?&quot; &quot;I had no keys of the doors- only of the safe.&quot; &quot;Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?&quot; &quot;Yes, I think he was. I know that so far as those three keys are concerned he kept them on the same ring. I have often seen them there.&quot; &quot;And that ring went with him to London?&quot; &quot;He said so.&quot; &quot;And your key never left your possession?&quot; &quot;Never.&quot; &quot;Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate. And yet none were found upon his body. One other point: if a clerk in this office desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the plans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?&quot; &quot;It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an effective way.&quot; &quot;But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West had that technical knowledge?&quot; &quot;No doubt we had, but I beg you won&#x27;t try to drag me into the matter, Mr. Holmes. What is the use of our speculating in this way when the original plans were actually found on West?&quot; &quot;Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking originals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have equally served his turn.&quot; &quot;Singular, no doubt- and yet he did so.&quot; &quot;Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable. Now there are three papers still missing. They are, as I understand, the vital ones.&quot; &quot;Yes, that is so.&quot; &quot;Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without the seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?&quot; &quot;I reported to that effect to the Admiralty. But to-day I have been over the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it. The double valves with the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers which have been returned. Until the foreigners had invented that for themselves they could not make the boat. Of course they might soon get over the difficulty.&quot; &quot;But the three missing drawings are the most important?&quot; &quot;Undoubtedly.&quot; &quot;I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the premises. I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.&quot; He examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the iron shutters of the window. It was only when we were on the lawn outside that his interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush outside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having been twisted or snapped. He examined them carefully with his lens, and then some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath. Finally he asked the chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me that they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for anyone outside to see what was going on within the room. &quot;The indications are ruined by the three days&#x27; delay. They may mean something or nothing. Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can help us further. It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see if we can do better in London.&quot; Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich Station. The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with confidence that he saw Cadogan West- whom he knew well by sight- upon the Monday night, and that he went to London by the 8:15 to London Bridge. He was alone and took a single third-class ticket. The clerk was struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner. So shaky was he that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped him with it. A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the first train which it was possible for West to take after he had left the lady about 7:30. &quot;Let us reconstruct, Watson,&quot; said Holmes after half an hour of silence. &quot;I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever had a case which was more difficult to get at. Every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely made some appreciable progress. &quot;The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against young Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend themselves to a more favourable hypothesis. Let us suppose, for example, that he had been approached by some foreign agent. It might have been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from speaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the direction indicated by his remarks to his fiancee. Very good. We will now suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he suddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the direction of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his decisions. Everything gave way to his duty. He followed the man, reached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued the thief. In this way we get over the objection that no one would take originals when he could make copies. This outsider had to take originals. So far it holds together.&quot; &quot;What is the next step?&quot; &quot;Then we come into difficulties. One would imagine that under such circumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the villain and raise the alarm. Why did he not do so? Could it have been an official superior who took the papers? That would explain West&#x27;s conduct. Or could the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and West started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms, presuming that he knew where the rooms were? The call must have been very pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no effort to communicate with her. Our scent runs cold here, and there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West&#x27;s body, with seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train. My instinct now is to work from the other end. If Mycroft has given us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two tracks instead of one.&quot; Surely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street. A government messenger had brought it post-haste. Holmes glanced at it and threw it over to me. &quot;There are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an affair. The only men worth considering are Adolph Meyer, of 13 Great George Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothiere, of Campden Mansions, Notting Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield Gardens, Kensington. The latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as having left. Glad to hear you have seen some light. The Cabinet awaits your final report with the utmost anxiety. Urgent representations have arrived from the very highest quarter. The whole force of the State is at your back if you should need it. MYCROFT. &quot;I&#x27;m afraid,&quot; said Holmes, smiling, &quot;that all the queen&#x27;s horses and all the queen&#x27;s men cannot avail in this matter.&quot; He had spread out his big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. &quot;Well, well,&quot; said he presently with an exclamation of satisfaction, &quot;things are turning a little in our direction at last. Why, Watson, I do honestly believe that we are going to pull it off, after all.&quot; He slapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity, &quot;I am going out now. It is only a reconnaissance. I will do nothing serious without my trusted comrade and biographer at my elbow. Do you stay here, and the odds are that you will see me again in an hour or two. If time hangs heavy get foolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved the State.&quot; I felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well that he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour unless there was good cause for exultation. All the long November evening I waited, filled with impatience for his return. At last, shortly after nine o&#x27;clock, there arrived a messenger with a note: Am dining at Goldini&#x27;s Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please come at once and join me there. Bring with you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a chisel, and a revolver. S. H. It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the dim, fog-draped streets. I stowed them all discreetly away in my overcoat and drove straight to the address given. There sat my friend at a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant. &quot;Have you had something to eat? Then join me in a coffee and curacao. Try one of the proprietor&#x27;s cigars. They are less poisonous than one would expect. Have you the tools?&quot; &quot;They are here, in my overcoat.&quot; &quot;Excellent. Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with some indication of what we are about to do. Now it must be evident to you, Watson, that this young man&#x27;s body was placed on the roof of the train. That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that it was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.&quot; &quot;Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?&quot; &quot;I should say it was impossible. If you examine the roofs you will find that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round them. Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was placed on it.&quot; &quot;How could he be placed there?&quot; &quot;That was the question which we had to answer. There is only one possible way. You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels at some points in the West End. I had a vague memory that as I have travelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head. Now, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be any difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?&quot; &quot;It seems most improbable.&quot; &quot;We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Here all other contingencies have failed. When I found that the leading international agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses which abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a little astonished at my sudden frivolity.&quot; &quot;Oh, that was it, was it?&quot; &quot;Yes, that was it. Mr. Hugo Oberstein, Of 13 Caulfield Gardens, had become my objective. I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station, where a very helpful official walked with me along the track and allowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back-stair windows of Caulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact that, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the Underground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at that very spot.&quot; &quot;Splendid, Holmes! You have got it!&quot; &quot;So far- so far, Watson. We advance, but the goal is afar. Well, having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown. It is a considerable house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms. Oberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a confederate entirely in his confidence. We must bear in mind that Oberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his booty, but not with any idea of flight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to him. Yet that is precisely what we are about to make.&quot; &quot;Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?&quot; &quot;Hardly on the evidence.&quot; &quot;What can we hope to do?&quot; &quot;We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t like it, Holmes.&quot; &quot;My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street. I&#x27;ll do the criminal part. It&#x27;s not a time to stick at trifles. Think of Mycroft&#x27;s note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who waits for news. We are bound to go.&quot; My answer was to rise from the table. &quot;You are right, Holmes. We are bound to go.&quot; He sprang up and shook me by the hand. &quot;I knew you would not shrink at the last,&quot; said he, and for a moment I saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had ever seen. The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once more. &quot;It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry. Let us walk,&quot; said he. &quot;Don&#x27;t drop the instruments, I beg. Your arrest as a suspicious character would be a most unfortunate complication.&quot; Caulfield Gardens was on of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and porticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle Victorian epoch in the West End of London. Next door there appeared to be a children&#x27;s party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the clatter of a piano resounded through the night. The fog still hung about and screened us with its friendly shade. Holmes had lit his lantern and flashed it upon the massive door. &quot;This is a serious proposition,&quot; said he. &quot;It is certainly bolted as well as locked. We would do better in the area. There is an excellent archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude. Give me a hand, Watson, and I&#x27;ll do the same for you.&quot; A minute later we were both in the area. Hardly had we reached the dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog above. As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower door. I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew open. We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door behind us. Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair. His little fan of yellow light shone upon a low window. &quot;Here we are, Watson- this must be the one.&quot; He threw it open, and as he did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light along the window-sill. It was thickly coated with soot from the passing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places. &quot;You can see where they rested the body. Halloa, Watson! what is this? There can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.&quot; He was pointing to faint discolourations along the woodwork of the window. &quot;Here it is on the stone of the stair also. The demonstration is complete. Let us stay here until a train stops.&quot; We had not long to wait. The very next train roared from the tunnel as before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes, pulled up immediately beneath us. It was not four feet from the window-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the window. &quot;So far we are justified,&quot; said he. &quot;What do you think of it, Watson?&quot; &quot;A masterpiece. You have never risen to a greater height.&quot; &quot;I cannot agree with you there. From the moment that I conceived the idea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very abstruse one, all the rest was inevitable. If it were not for the grave interests involved the affair up to this point would be insignificant. Our difficulties are still before us. But perhaps we may find something here which may help us.&quot; We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon the first floor. One was a dining-room, severely furnished and containing nothing of interest. A second was a bedroom, which also drew blank. The remaining room appeared more promising and my companion settled down to a systematic examination. It was littered with books and papers, and was evidently used as a study. Swiftly and methodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his austere face. At the end of an hour he was no further than when he started. &quot;The cunning dog has covered his tracks,&quot; said he. &quot;He has left nothing to incriminate him. His dangerous correspondence has been destroyed or removed. This is our last chance.&quot; It was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes pried it open with his chisel. Several rolls of paper were within, covered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what they referred. The recurring words, &#x27;water pressure&#x27; and &#x27;pressure to the square inch&#x27; suggested some possible relation to a submarine. Holmes tossed them all impatiently aside. There only remained an envelope with some small newspaper slips inside it. He shook them out on the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had been raised. &quot;What&#x27;s this, Watson? Eh? What&#x27;s this? Record of a series of messages in the advertisements of a paper. Daily Telegraph agony column by the print and paper. Right-hand top corner of a page. No dates- but messages arrange themselves. This must be the first: &quot;Hoped to hear sooner. Terms agreed to. Write fully to address given on card.                                      &quot;PIERROT. &quot;Next comes: &quot;Too complex for description. Must have full report. Stuff awaits you when goods delivered.                     &quot;PIERROT. &quot;Then comes: &quot;Matter presses. Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make appointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement. &quot;PIERROT. &quot;Finally: &quot;Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered. &quot;PIERROT. &quot;A fairly complete record, Watson! If we could only get at the man at the other end!&quot; He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the table. Finally he sprang to his feet. &quot;Well, perhaps it won&#x27;t be so difficult, after all. There is nothing more to be done here, Watson. I think we might drive round to the offices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day&#x27;s work to a conclusion.&quot; Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after breakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our proceedings of the day before. The professional shook his head over our confessed burglary. &quot;We can&#x27;t do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he. &quot;No wonder you get results that are beyond us. But some of these days you&#x27;ll go too far, and you&#x27;ll find yourself and your friend in trouble.&quot; &quot;For England, home and beauty- eh, Watson? Martyrs on the altar of our country. But what do you think of it, Mycroft?&quot; &quot;Excellent, Sherlock! Admirable! But what use will you make of it?&quot; Holmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which lay upon the table. &quot;Have you seen Pierrot&#x27;s advertisement to-day?&quot; &quot;What? Another one?&quot; &quot;Yes, here it is: &quot;To-night. Same hour. Same place. Two taps. Most vitally important. Your own safety at stake. &quot;PIERROT. &quot;By George!&quot; cried Lestrade. &quot;If he answers that we&#x27;ve got him!&quot; &quot;That was my idea when I put it in. I think if you could both make it convenient to come with us about eight o&#x27;clock to Caulfield Gardens we might possibly get a little nearer to a solution.&quot; One of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his power of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he could no longer work to advantage. I remember that during the whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus. For my own part I had none of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared to be interminable. The great national importance of the issue, the suspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we were trying- all combined to work upon my nerve. It was a relief to me when at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition. Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester Road Station. The area door of Oberstein&#x27;s house had been left open the night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall door. By nine o&#x27;clock we were all seated in the study, waiting patiently for our man. An hour passed and yet another. When eleven struck, the measured beat of the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes. Lestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a minute at their watches. Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids half shut, but every sense on the alert. He raised his head with a sudden jerk. &quot;He is coming,&quot; said he. There had been a furtive step past the door. Now it returned. We heard a shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker. Holmes rose, motioning to us to remain seated. The gas in the hall was a mere point of light. He opened the outer door, and then as a dark figure slipped past him he closed and fastened it. &quot;This way!&quot; we heard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us. Holmes had followed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and alarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room. Before our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and Holmes standing with his back against it. The man glared round him, staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor. With the shock, his broad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his lips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome delicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter. Holmes gave a whistle of surprise. &quot;You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;This was not the bird that I was looking for.&quot; &quot;Who is he?&quot; asked Mycroft eagerly. &quot;The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the Submarine Department. Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is coming to. I think that you had best leave his examination to me.&quot; We had carried the prostrate body to the sofa. Now our prisoner sat up, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses. &quot;What is this?&quot; he asked. &quot;I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.&quot; &quot;Everything is known, Colonel Walter,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;How an English gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension. But your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within our knowledge. So also are the circumstances connected with the death of young Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small credit for repentance and confession, since there are still some details which we can only learn from your lips.&quot; The man groaned and sank his face in his hands. We waited, but he was silent. &quot;I can assure you,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;that every essential is already known. We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an impress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into a correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the advertisement columns of the Daily Telegraph. We are aware that you went down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were seen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous reason to suspect you. He saw your theft, but could not give the alarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at your heels until you reached this very house. There he intervened, and then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more terrible crime of murder.&quot; &quot;I did not! I did not! Before God I swear that I did not!&quot; cried our wretched prisoner. &quot;Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon the roof of a railway carriage.&quot; &quot;I will. I swear to you that I will. I did the rest. I confess it. It was just as you say. A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid. I needed the money badly. Oberstein offered me five thousand. It was to save myself from ruin. But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.&quot; &quot;What happened, then?&quot; &quot;He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe. I never knew it until I was at the very door. It was thick fog, and one could not see three yards. I had given two taps and Oberstein had come to the door. The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver. He always carried it with him. As West forced his way after us into the house Oberstein struck him on the head. The blow was a fatal one. He was dead within five minutes. There he lay in the hall, and we were at our wit&#x27;s end what to do. Then Oberstein had this idea about the trains which halted under his back window. But first he examined the papers which I had brought. He said that three of them were essential, and that he must keep them. &#x27;You cannot keep them,&#x27; said I. &#x27;There will be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.&#x27; &#x27;I must keep them,&#x27; said he, &#x27;for they are so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies.&#x27; &#x27;Then they must all go back together tonight,&#x27; said I. He thought for a little, and then he cried out that he had it. &#x27;Three I will keep,&#x27; said he. &#x27;The others we will stuff into the pocket of this young man. When he is found the whole business will assuredly be put to his account. I could see no other way out of it, so we did as he suggested. We waited half an hour at the window before a train stopped. It was so thick that nothing could be seen, and we had no difficulty in lowering West&#x27;s body on to the train. That was the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.&quot; &quot;And your brother?&quot; &quot;He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think that he suspected. I read in his eves that he suspected. As you know, he never held up his head again.&quot; There was silence in the room. It was broken by Mycroft Holmes. &quot;Can you not make reparation? It would ease your conscience, and possibly your punishment.&quot; &quot;What reparation can I make?&quot; &quot;Where is Oberstein with the papers?&quot; &quot;I do not know.&quot; &quot;Did he give you no address?&quot; &quot;He said that letters to the Hotel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually reach him.&quot; &quot;Then reparation is still within your power,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes. &quot;I will do anything I can. I owe this fellow no particular good-will. He has been my ruin and my downfall. &quot;Here are paper and pen. Sit at this desk and write to my dictation. Direct the envelope to the address given. That is right. Now the letter: Dear Sir: With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now that one essential detail is missing. I have a tracing which will make it complete. This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I must ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds. I will not trust it to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes. I would come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the country at present. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the smoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday. Remember that only English notes, or gold, will be taken. That will do very well. I shall be very much surprised if it does not fetch our man.&quot; And it did! It is a matter of history- that secret history of a nation which is often, so much more intimate and interesting than its public chronicles- that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime, came to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British prison. In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans, which he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe. Colonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his sentence. As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for private circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon the subject. Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my friend spent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably fine emerald tie-pin. When I asked him if he had bought it, he answered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission. He said no more; but I fancy that I could guess at that lady&#x27;s august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will forever recall to my friend&#x27;s memory the adventure of the Bruce-Partington plans. -THE END- . 1893 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents. It is, however, unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which chance, and not choice, has provided him with. With this short preface I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly terrible, chain of events. It was a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street was like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road was painful to the eye. It was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter. Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the morning post. For myself, my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship. But the morning paper was uninteresting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or the shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. He loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country. Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion&#x27;s voice broke in upon my thoughts: &quot;You are right, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;It does seem a most preposterous way of settling a dispute.&quot; &quot;Most preposterous!&quot; I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement. &quot;What is this, Holmes?&quot; I cried. &quot;This is beyond anything which I could have imagined.&quot; He laughed heartily at my perplexity. &quot;You remember,&quot; said he, &quot;that some little time ago when I read you the passage in one of Poe&#x27;s sketches in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere tour-de-force of the author. On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.&quot; &quot;Oh, no!&quot; &quot;Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your eyebrows. So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport with you.&quot; But I was still far from satisfied. &quot;In the example which you read to me,&quot; said I, &quot;the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so on. But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?&quot; &quot;You do yourself an injustice. The features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful servants.&quot; &quot;Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features?&quot; &quot;Your features and especially your eyes. Perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced?&quot; &quot;No, I cannot.&quot; &quot;Then I will tell you. After throwing down your paper, which was the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books. Then you glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and correspond with Gordon&#x27;s picture over there.&quot; &quot;You have followed me wonderfully!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;So far I could hardly have gone astray. But now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher&#x27;s career. I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. At this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct.&quot; &quot;Absolutely!&quot; said I. &quot;And now that you have explained it, I confess that I am as amazed as before.&quot; &quot;It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you. I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day. But I have in my hands here a little problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought reading. Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross Street Croydon?&quot; &quot;No, I saw nothing.&quot; &quot;Ah! then you must have overlooked it. Just toss it over to me. Here it is, under the financial column. Perhaps you would be good enough to read it aloud.&quot; I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the paragraph indicated. It was headed, &quot;A Gruesome Packet.&quot; &quot;Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to the incident. At two o&#x27;clock yesterday afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman. A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning before. There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post. Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits. The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss Cushing&#x27;s belief, from Belfast. In the meantime, the matter is being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.&quot; &quot;So much for the Daily Chronicle,&quot; said Holmes as I finished reading. &quot;Now for our friend Lestrade. I had a note from him this morning, in which he says: &quot;I think that this case is very much in your line. We have every hope of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon. We have, of course, wired to the Belfast post-office, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the sender. The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any way. The medical student theory still appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours to spare I should be very happy to see you out here. I shall be either at the house or in the police-station all day. What say you, Watson? Can you rise superior to the heat and run down to Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?&quot; &quot;I was longing for something to do.&quot; &quot;You shall have it then. Ring for our boots and tell them to order a cab. I&#x27;ll be back in a moment when I have changed my dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.&quot; A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far less oppressive in Croydon than in town. Holmes had sent on a wire, so that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever, was waiting for us at the station. A walk of five minutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided. It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim, with whitened stone steps, and little groups of aproned women gossiping at the doors. Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and tapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. Miss Cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were ushered. She was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. A worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her. &quot;They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,&quot; said she as Lestrade entered. I wish that you would take them away altogether.&quot; &quot;So I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them here until my friend, Mr. Holmes, should have seen them in your presence.&quot; &quot;Why in my presence, sir?&quot; &quot;In case he wished to ask any questions.&quot; &quot;What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know nothing whatever about it?&quot; &quot;Quite so, madam,&quot; said Holmes in his soothing way. &quot;I have no doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business.&quot; &quot;Indeed, I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life. It is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the police in my house. I won&#x27;t have those things in here, Mr. Lestrade. If you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse.&quot; It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house. Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece of brown paper and some string. There was a bench at the end of the path, and we all sat down while Holmes examined, one by one, the articles which Lestrade had handed to him. &quot;The string is exceedingly interesting,&quot; he remarked, holding it up to the light and sniffing at it. &quot;What do you make of this string, Lestrade?&quot; &quot;It has been tarred.&quot; &quot;Precisely. It is a piece of tarred twine. You have also, no doubt, remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be seen by the double fray on each side. This is of importance.&quot; &quot;I cannot see the importance,&quot; said Lestrade. &quot;The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and that this knot is of a peculiar character.&quot; &quot;It is very neatly tied. I had already made a note to that effect&quot; said Lestrade complacently. &quot;So much for the string, then,&quot; said Holmes, smiling, &quot;now for the box wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. What did you not observe it? I think there can be no doubt of it. Address printed in rather straggling characters: &#x27;Miss S. Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon.&#x27; Done with a broad-pointed pen, probably a J and with very inferior ink. The word &#x27;Croydon&#x27; has been originally spelled with an &#x27;i,&#x27; which has been changed to &#x27;y.&#x27; The parcel was directed, then, by a man- the printing is distinctly masculine- of limited education and unacquainted with the town of Croydon. So far, so good! The box is a yellow, half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb marks at the left bottom corner. It is filled with rough salt of the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser commercial purposes. And embedded in it are these very singular enclosures.&quot; He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward on each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of our companion. Finally he returned them to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation. &quot;You have observed, of course,&quot; said he at last, &quot;that the ears are not a pair.&quot; &quot;Yes, I have noticed that. But if this were the practical joke of some students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to send two odd ears as a pair. &quot;Precisely. But this is not a practical joke.&quot; &quot;You are sure of it?&quot; &quot;The presumption is strongly against it. Bodies in the dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid. These ears bear no signs of this. They are fresh, too. They have been cut off with a blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it. Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt. I repeat that there is no practical joke here, but that we are investigating a serious crime.&quot; A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion&#x27;s words and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background. Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is only half convinced. &quot;There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt&quot; said he, &quot;but there are much stronger reasons against the other. We know that this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for the last twenty years. She has hardly been away from her home for a day during that time. Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?&quot; &quot;That is the problem which we have to solve,&quot; Holmes answered, &quot;and for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct and that a double murder has been committed. One of these ears is a woman&#x27;s, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring. The other is a man&#x27;s, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring. These two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before now. To-day is Friday. The packet was posted on Thursday morning. The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday, or earlier. If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing? We may take it that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he must have some strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this packet. What reason then? It must have been to tell her that the deed was done! or to pain her, perhaps. But in that case she knows who it is. Does she know? I doubt it. If she knew, why should she call the police in? She might have buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. That is what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal. But if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name. There is a tangle here which needs straightening out.&quot; He had been talking in a high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house. &quot;I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,&quot; said he. &quot;In that case I may leave you here&quot; said Lestrade, &quot;for I have another small business on hand. I think that I have nothing further to learn from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the police-station.&quot; &quot;We shall look in on our way to the train,&quot; answered Holmes. A moment later he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady was still quietly working away at her antimacassar. She put it down on her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching blue eyes. &quot;I am convinced, sir,&quot; she said, &quot;that this matter is a mistake, and that the parcel was never meant for me at all. I have said this several times to the gentleman from Scotland Yard, but he simply laughs at me. I have not an enemy in the world, as far as I know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?&quot; &quot;I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,&quot; said Holmes, taking a seat beside her. &quot;I think that it is more than probable-&quot; he paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady&#x27;s profile. Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. I stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion&#x27;s evident excitement. &quot;There were one or two questions-&quot; &quot;Oh, I am weary of questions!&quot; cried Miss Cushing impatiently. &quot;You have two sisters, I believe.&quot; &quot;How could you know that?&quot; &quot;I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one of whom is undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship.&quot; &quot;Yes, you are quite right. Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.&quot; &quot;And here at my elbow is another portrait taken at Liverpool, of your younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by his uniform. I observe that she was unmarried at the time.&quot; &quot;You are very quick at observing.&quot; &quot;That is my trade.&quot; &quot;Well, you are quite right. But she was married to Mr. Browner a few days afterwards. He was on the South American line when that was taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn&#x27;t abide to leave her for so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London boats.&quot; &quot;Ah, the Conqueror, perhaps?&quot; &quot;No, the May Day, when last I heard. Jim came down here to see me once. That was before he broke the pledge, but afterwards he would always take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink would send him stark, staring mad. Ah! it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in his hand again. First he dropped me, then he quarrelled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped writing we don&#x27;t know how things are going with them.&quot; It was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which she felt very deeply. Like most people who lead a lonely life, she was shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely communicative. She told us many details about her brother-in-law the steward, and then wandering off on the subject of her former lodgers, the medical students, she gave us a long account of their delinquencies, with their names and those of their hospitals. Holmes listened attentively to everything, throwing in a question from time to time. &quot;About your second sister, Sarah,&quot; said he. &quot;I wonder, since you are both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.&quot; &quot;Ah! you don&#x27;t know Sarah&#x27;s temper or you would wonder no more. I tried it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two months ago, when we had to part. I don&#x27;t want to say a word against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah.&quot; &quot;You say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.&quot; &quot;Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time. Why, she went up there to live in order to be near them. And now she has no word hard enough for Jim Browner. The last six months that she was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways. He had caught her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that was the start of it.&quot; &quot;Thank you, Miss Cushing,&quot; said Holmes, rising and bowing. &quot;Your sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington? Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you have been troubled over a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do.&quot; There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it. &quot;How far to Wallington?&quot; he asked. &quot;Only about a mile, sir.&quot; &quot;Very good. jump in, Watson. We must strike while the iron is hot. Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive details in connection with it. Just pull up at a telegraph office as you pass, cabby.&quot; Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his face. Our driver pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which we had just quitted. My companion ordered him to wait, and had his hand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young gentleman in black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step. &quot;Is Miss Cushing at home?&quot; asked Holmes. &quot;Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,&quot; said he. &quot;She has been suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call again in ten days.&quot; He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched off down the street. &quot;Well, if we can&#x27;t we can&#x27;t,&quot; said Holmes, cheerfully. &quot;Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.&quot; &quot;I did not wish her to tell me anything. I only wanted to look at her. However, I think that I have got all that I want. Drive us to some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and afterwards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the police-station.&quot; We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker&#x27;s in Tottenham Court Road for fifty-five shillings. This led him to Paganini, and we sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that extraordinary man. The afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the police-station. Lestrade was waiting for us at the door. &quot;A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he. &quot;Ha! It is the answer!&quot; He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it, and crumpled it into his pocket. &quot;That&#x27;s all right&quot; said he. &quot;Have you found out anything?&quot; &quot;I have found out everything!&quot; &quot;What!&quot; Lestrade stared at him in amazement. &quot;You are joking.&quot; &quot;I was never more serious in my life. A shocking crime has been committed, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.&quot; &quot;And the criminal?&quot; Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards and threw it over to Lestrade. &quot;That is the name,&quot; he said. &quot;You cannot effect an arrest until to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution. Come on, Watson.&quot; We strode off together to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him. &quot;The case,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars that night in our rooms at Baker Street, &quot;is one where, as in the investigations which you have chronicled under the names of &#x27;A Study in Scarlet&#x27; and of &#x27;The Sign of Four,&#x27; we have been compelled to reason backward from effects to causes. I have written to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details which are now wanting, and which he will only get after he has secured his man. That he may be safely trusted to do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and, indeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at Scotland Yard.&quot; &quot;Your case is not complete, then?&quot; I asked. &quot;It is fairly complete in essentials. We know who the author of the revolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us. Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.&quot; &quot;I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool boat, is the man whom you suspect?&quot; &quot;Oh! it is more than a suspicion.&quot; &quot;And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.&quot; &quot;On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear. Let me run over the principal steps. We approached the case, you remember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage. We had formed no theories. We were simply there to observe and to draw inferences from our observations. What did we see first? A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters. It instantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for one of these. I set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our leisure. Then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box. &quot;The string was of the quality which is used by sailmakers aboard ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our investigation. When I observed that the knot was one which is popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that an the actors in the tragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes. &quot;When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it was to Miss S. Cushing. Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was &#x27;S&#x27; it might belong to one of the others as well. In that case we should have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether. I therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up this point. I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been made when you may remember that I came suddenly to a stop. The fact was that I had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely. &quot;As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear. Each ear is as a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones. In last years Anthropological Journal you will find two short monographs from my pen upon the subject. I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my surprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just inspected. The matter was entirely beyond coincidence. There was the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage. In all essentials it was the same ear. &quot;Of course I at once saw the enormous importance of the observation. It was evident that the victim was a blood relation, and probably a very close one. I began to talk to her about her family, and you remember that she at once gave us some exceedingly valuable details. &quot;In the first place, her sisters name was Sarah, and her address had until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard of this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone up to Liverpool to be near the Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards divided them. This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address. &quot;And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully. We had learned of the existence of this steward, an impulsive man, of strong passions- you remember that he threw up what must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife- subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking. We had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and that a man- presumably a seafaring man- had been murdered at the same time. Jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the motive for the crime. And why should these proofs of the deed be sent to Miss Sarah Cushing? Probably because during her residence in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events which led to the tragedy. You will observe that this line of boats calls at Belfast Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that Browner had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer, the May Day, Belfast would be the first place at which he could post his terrible packet. &quot;A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and although I thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to elucidate it before going further. An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband. There were many grave objections to this theory, but it was conceivable. I therefore sent off a telegram to my friend Algar, of the Liverpool force, and asked him to find out if Mrs. Browner were at home, and if Browner had departed in the May Day. Then we went on to Wallington to visit Miss Sarah. &quot;I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had been reproduced in her. Then, of course, she might give us very important information, but I was not sanguine that she would. She must have heard of the business the day before, since all Croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have understood for whom the packet was meant. If she had been willing to help justice she would probably have communicated with the police already. However, it was clearly our duty to see her, so we went. We found that the news of the arrival of the packet- for her illness dated from that time- had such an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever. It was clearer than ever that she understood its full significance, but equally clear that we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her. &quot;However, we were really independent of her help. Our answers were waiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed Algar to send them. Nothing could be more conclusive. Mrs. Browner&#x27;s house had been closed for more than three days, and the neighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her relatives. It had been ascertained at the shipping offices that Browner had left aboard of the May Day, and I calculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow night. When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and I have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in.&quot; Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations. Two days later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from the detective, and a typewritten document which covered several pages of foolscap. &quot;Lestrade has got him all right,&quot; said Holmes, glancing up at me. &quot;Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says. My Dear Holmes: &quot;In accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our theories&quot; [&quot;the &#x27;we&#x27; is rather fine, Watson, is it not?&quot;] &quot;I went down to the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 P.M., and boarded the S.S. May Day, belonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet Company. On inquiry, I found that there was a steward on board of the name of James Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him of his duties. On descending to his berth, I found him seated upon a chest with his head sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro. He is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy- something like Aldridge, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair. He jumped up when he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to have no heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies. We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well for we thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble. However, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our shorthand man. We had three copies typewritten, one of which I enclose. The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be an extremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me in my investigation. With kind regards, &quot;Yours very truly, &quot;G. LESTRADE. &quot;Hum! The investigation really was a very simple one,&quot; remarked Holmes, &quot;but I don&#x27;t think it struck him in that light when he first called us in. However, let us see what Jim Browner has to say for himself. This is his statement as made before Inspector Montgomery at the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the advantage of being verbatim.&quot; &quot;&#x27;Have I anything to say? Yes, I have a deal to say. I have to make a clean breast of it all. You can hang me, or you can leave me alone. I don&#x27;t care a plug which you do. I tell you I&#x27;ve not shut an eye in sleep since I did it, and I don&#x27;t believe I ever will again until I get past all waking. Sometimes it&#x27;s his face, but most generally it&#x27;s hers. I&#x27;m never without one or the other before me. He looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind o&#x27; surprise upon her face. Ay, the white lamb, she might well be surprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked anything but love upon her before. &quot;&#x27;But it was Sarah&#x27;s fault and may the curse of a broken man put a blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins! It&#x27;s not that I want to clear myself. I know that I went back to drink, like the beast that I was. But she would have forgiven me; she would have stuck as close to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our door. For Sarah Cushing loved me- that&#x27;s the root of the business- she loved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that I thought more of my wife&#x27;s footmark in the mud than I did of her whole body and soul. &quot;&#x27;There were three sisters altogether. The old one was just a good woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my Mary. And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just one of ourselves. &quot;&#x27;I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little money by, and all was as bright as a new dollar. My God, whoever would have thought that it could have come to this? Whoever would have dreamed it? &quot;&#x27;I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if the ship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at a time, and in this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah. She was a fine tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a proud way of carrying her head, and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint. But when little Mary was there I had never a thought of her, and that I swear as I hope for God&#x27;s mercy. &quot;&#x27;It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me, or to coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never thought anything of that. But one evening my eyes were opened. I had come up from the ship and found my wife out, but Sarah at home. &quot;Where&#x27;s Mary?&quot; I asked. &quot;Oh, she has gone to pay some accounts.&quot; I was impatient and paced up and down the room. &quot;Can&#x27;t you be happy for five minutes without Mary, Jim?&quot; says she. &quot;It&#x27;s a bad compliment to me that you can&#x27;t be contented with my society for so short a time.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s all right, my lass,&quot; said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a fever. I looked into her eyes and I read it all there. There was no need for her to speak, nor for me either. I frowned and drew my hand away. Then she stood by my side in silence for a bit, and then put up her hand and patted me on the shoulder. &quot;Steady old Jim!&quot; said she, and with a kind o&#x27; mocking laugh, she run out of the room. &quot;Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul, and she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let her go on biding with us- a besotted fool- but I never said a word to Mary, for I knew it would grieve her. Things went on much as before, but after a time I began to find that there was a bit of a change in Mary herself. She had always been so trusting and so innocent, but now she became queer and suspicious, wanting to know where I had been and what I had been doing, and whom my letters were from, and what I had in my pockets, and a thousand such follies. Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable, and we had ceaseless rows about nothing. I was fairly puzzled by it all. Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just inseparable. I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and poisoning my wife&#x27;s mind against me, but I was such a blind beetle that I could not understand it at the time. Then I broke my blue ribbon and began to drink again, but I think I should not have done it if Mary had been the same as ever. She had some reason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began to be wider and wider. And then this Alec Fairbairn chipped in, and things became a thousand times blacker. &quot;&#x27;It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it was to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made friends wherever he went. He was a dashing, swaggering chap, smart and curled, who had seen half the world and could talk of what he had seen. He was good company, I won&#x27;t deny it, and he had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that I think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop than the forecastle. For a month he was in and out of my house, and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft tricky ways. And then at last something made me suspect and from that day my peace was gone forever. &quot;&#x27;It was only a little thing, too. I had come into the parlour unexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on my wife&#x27;s face. But as she saw who it was it faded again, and she turned away with a look of disappointment. That was enough for me. There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken for mine. If I could have seen him then I should have killed him, for I have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose. Mary saw the devil&#x27;s light in my eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve. &quot;Don&#x27;t Jim, don&#x27;t!&quot; says she. &quot;Where&#x27;s Sarah?&quot; I asked. &quot;In the kitchen,&quot; says she. &quot;Sarah,&quot; says I as I went in, &quot;this man Fairbairn is never to darken my door again.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; says she. &quot;Because I order it.&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot; says she, &quot;if my friends are not good enough for this house, then I am not good enough for it either.&quot; &quot;You can do what you like,&quot; says I, &quot;but if Fairbairn shows his face here again I&#x27;ll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.&quot; She was frightened by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the same evening she left my house. &quot;&#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave. Anyway, she took a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors. Fairbairn used to stay there, and Mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him. How often she went I don&#x27;t know, but I followed her one day, and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he was. I swore to my wife that I would kill her if I found her in his company again, and I led her back with me, sobbing and trembling, and as white as a piece of paper. There was no trace of love between us any longer. I could see that she hated me and feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she despised me as well. &quot;&#x27;Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool, so she went back, as I understand, to live with her sister in Croydon, and things jogged on much the same as ever at home. And then came this last week and all the misery and ruin. &quot;&#x27;It was in this way. We had gone on the May Day for a round voyage of seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates, so that we had to put back into port for twelve hours. I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon. The thought was in my head as I turned into my own street and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them from the footpath. &quot;&#x27;I tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that moment I was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when I look back on it. I had been drinking hard of late, and the two things together fairly turned my brain. There&#x27;s something throbbing in my head now, like a docker&#x27;s hammer, but that morning I seemed to have all Niagara whizzing and buzzing in my ears. &quot;&#x27;Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab. I had a heavy oak stick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the first, but as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see them without being seen. They pulled up soon at the railway station. There was a good crowd round the booking-office, so I got quite close to them without being seen. They took tickets for New Brighton. So did I, but I got in three carriages behind them. When we reached it they walked along the Parade, and I was never more than a hundred yards from them. At last I saw them hire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and they thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water. &quot;It was just as if they had been given into my hands. There was a bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred yards. I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them. I could see the blur of their craft, but they were going nearly as fast as I, and they must have been a long mile from the shore before I caught them up. The haze was like a curtain all round us, and there were we three in the middle of it. My God, shall I ever forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that was closing in upon them? She screamed out. He swore like a madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death in my eyes. I got past it and got one in with my stick that crushed his head like an egg. I would have spared her, perhaps, for all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out to him, and calling him &quot;Alec.&quot; I struck again, and she lay stretched beside him. I was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood. If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should have joined them. I pulled out my knife, and- well, there! I&#x27;ve said enough. It gave me a kind of savage joy when I thought how Sarah would feel when she had such sign of what her meddling had brought about. Then I tied the bodies into the boat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk. I knew very well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings and had drifted off out to sea. I cleaned myself up, got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of what had passed. That night I made up the packet for Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it from Belfast. &quot;&#x27;There you have the whole truth of it. You can hang me, or do what you like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been punished already. I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at me- staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze. I killed them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if I have another night of it I shall be either, mad or dead before morning. You won&#x27;t put me alone into a cell, sir? For pity&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t, and may you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.&quot; &quot;What is the meaning of it Watson?, said Holmes solemnly as he laid down the paper. &quot;What object is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. But what end? There is the great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from an answer as ever.&quot; -THE END- . 1892 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventure of the Copper Beeches &quot;To the man who loves art for its own sake,&quot; remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, &quot;it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.&quot; &quot;And yet,&quot; said I, smiling, &quot;I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.&quot; &quot;You have erred, perhaps,&quot; he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood-&quot;you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.&quot; &quot;It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,&quot; I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend&#x27;s singular character. &quot;No, it is not selfishness or conceit,&quot; said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. &quot;If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing-a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.&quot; It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings. &quot;At the same time,&quot; he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, &quot;you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.&quot; &quot;The end may have been so,&quot; I answered, &quot;but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.&quot; &quot;Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!&quot; He tossed a crumpled letter across to me. It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus: DEAR MR. HOLMES: I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully, VIOLET HUNTER. &quot;Do you know the young lady?&quot; I asked. &quot;Not I.&quot; &quot;It is half-past ten now.&quot; &quot;Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.&quot; &quot;It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.&quot; &quot;Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.&quot; As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover&#x27;s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world. &quot;You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,&quot; said she, as my companion rose to greet her, &quot;but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.&quot; &quot;Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.&quot; I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story. &quot;I have been a governess for five years,&quot; said she, &quot;in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit&#x27;s end as to what I should do. &quot;There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway&#x27;s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them. &quot;Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper. &quot;&#x27;That will do,&#x27; said he; &#x27;I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!&#x27; He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him. &quot;&#x27;You are looking for a situation, miss?&#x27; he asked. &quot;&#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;As governess?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;And what salary do you ask?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I had L4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Oh, tut, tut! sweating-rank sweating!&#x27; he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. &#x27;How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,&#x27; said I. &#x27;A little French, a little German, music, and drawing-&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Tut, tut!&#x27; he cried. &#x27;This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at L100 a year.&#x27; &quot;You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note. &quot;&#x27;It is also my custom,&#x27; said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, &#x27;to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.&#x27; &quot;It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and Yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself. &quot;&#x27;May I ask where you live, sir?&#x27; said I. &quot;&#x27;Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;One child-one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!&#x27; He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again. &quot;I was a little startled at the nature of the child&#x27;s amusement, but the father&#x27;s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking. &quot;&#x27;My sole duties, then,&#x27; I asked, &#x27;are to take charge of a single child?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,&#x27; he cried. &#x27;Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I should be happy to make myself useful.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know-faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;No,&#x27; said I, considerably astonished at his words. &quot;&#x27;Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Oh, no.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?&#x27; &quot;I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion. &quot;&#x27;I am afraid that that is quite impossible,&#x27; said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke. &quot;&#x27;I am afraid that it is quite essential,&#x27; said he. &#x27;It is a little fancy of my wife&#x27;s, and ladies&#x27; fancies, you know, madam, ladies&#x27; fancies must be consulted. And so you won&#x27;t cut your hair?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;No, sir, I really could not,&#x27; I answered firmly. &quot;&#x27;Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.&#x27; &quot;The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal. &quot;&#x27;Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?&#x27; she asked. &quot;&#x27;If you please, Miss Stoper.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Well really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,&#x27; said she sharply. &#x27;You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.&#x27; She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page. &quot;Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting L100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short, and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here, and I will read it to you: &quot;The Copper Beeches, near Winchester. &quot;DEAR MISS HUNTER: &quot;Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give L30 a quarter, or L120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. &quot;Yours faithfully, &quot;JEPHRO RUCASTLE.&quot; &quot;That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.&quot; &quot;Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,&quot; said Holmes, smiling. &quot;But you would not advise me to refuse?&quot; &quot;I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.&quot; &quot;What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?&quot; &quot;Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?&quot; &quot;Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?&quot; &quot;That is a possible solution-in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.&quot; &quot;But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!&quot; &quot;Well, yes, of course the pay is good-too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you L120 a year, when they could have their pick for L40? There must be some strong reason behind.&quot; &quot;I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.&quot; &quot;Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger-&quot; &quot;Danger! What danger do you foresee?&quot; Holmes shook his head gravely. &quot;It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,&quot; said he. &quot;But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.&quot; &quot;That is enough.&quot; She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. &quot;I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.&quot; With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way. &quot;At least,&quot; said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, &quot;she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.&quot; &quot;And she would need to be,&quot; said Holmes gravely. &quot;I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.&quot; It was not very long before my friend&#x27;s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. &quot;Data! data! data!&quot; he cried impatiently. &quot;I can&#x27;t make bricks without clay.&quot; And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation. The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me. &quot;Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,&quot; said he, and turned back to his chemical studies. The summons was a brief and urgent one. Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow [it said]. Do come! I am at my wit&#x27;s end. HUNTER. &quot;Will you come with me?&quot; asked Holmes, glancing up. &quot;I should wish to.&quot; &quot;Just look it up, then.&quot; &quot;There is a train at half-past nine,&quot; said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. &quot;It is due at Winchester at 11:3O.&quot; &quot;That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.&quot; By eleven o&#x27;clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man&#x27;s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and gray roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage. &quot;Are they not fresh and beautiful?&quot; I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street. But Holmes shook his head gravely. &quot;Do you know, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.&quot; &quot;Good heavens!&quot; I cried. &quot;Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?&quot; &quot;They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.&quot; &quot;You horrify me!&quot; &quot;But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard&#x27;s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.&quot; &quot;No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.&quot; &quot;Quite so. She has her freedom.&quot; &quot;What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?&quot; &quot;I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.&quot; The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table. &quot;I am so delighted that you have come,&quot; she said earnestly. &quot;It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.&quot; &quot;Pray tell us what has happened to you.&quot; &quot;I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.&quot; &quot;Let us have everything in its due order.&quot; Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen. &quot;In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.&quot; &quot;What can you not understand?&quot; &quot;Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton&#x27;s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place. &quot;I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father&#x27;s young wife. &quot;Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light gray eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.&quot; &quot;I am glad of all details,&quot; remarked my friend, &quot;whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.&quot; &quot;I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building. &quot;For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband. &quot;&#x27;Oh, yes,&#x27; said he, turning to me, &#x27;we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.&#x27; &quot;The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery. &quot;Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress. &quot;You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a gray suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once. &quot;&#x27;Jephro,&#x27; said she, &#x27;there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?&#x27; he asked. &quot;&#x27;No, I know no one in these parts.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Surely it would be better to take no notice.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.&#x27; &quot;I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.&quot; &quot;Pray continue,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.&quot; &quot;You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about. &quot;Look in here!&quot; said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. &quot;Is he not a beauty?&quot; &quot;I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness. &quot;Don&#x27;t be frightened,&quot; said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. &quot;It&#x27;s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness&#x27; sake don&#x27;t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it&#x27;s as much as your life is worth.&quot; &quot;The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o&#x27;clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done. &quot;And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair. &quot;I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked. &quot;I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look. &quot;This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever. &quot;&#x27;Ah!&#x27; said he, &#x27;you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.&#x27; &quot;I assured him that I was not offended. &#x27;By the way,&#x27; said I, &#x27;you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.&#x27; &quot;He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark. &quot;&#x27;Photography is one of my hobbies,&#x27; said he. &#x27;I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it?&#x27; He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest. &quot;Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty-a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman&#x27;s instinct; perhaps it was woman&#x27;s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door. &quot;It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through. &quot;There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran-ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside. &quot;&#x27;So,&#x27; said he, smiling, &#x27;it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Oh, I am so frightened!&#x27; I panted. &quot;&#x27;My dear young lady! my dear young lady!&#x27;-you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was-;&#x27;and what has frightened you, my dear lady?&#x27; &quot;But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him. &#x27;I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,&#x27; I answered. &#x27;But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Only that?&#x27; said he, looking at me keenly. &quot;&#x27;Why, what did you think?&#x27; I asked. &quot;&#x27;Why do you think that I lock this door?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I am sure that I do not know.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?&#x27; He was still smiling in the most amiable manner. &quot;&#x27;I am sure if I had known-&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again&#x27;-here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon-&#x27;I&#x27;ll throw you to the mastiff.&#x27; &quot;I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o&#x27;clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.&quot; Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face. &quot;Is Toller still drunk?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.&quot; &quot;That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?&quot; &quot;Yes, the wine-cellar.&quot; &quot;You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.&quot; &quot;I will try. What is it?&quot; &quot;We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o&#x27;clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.&quot; &quot;I will do it.&quot; &quot;Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers-possibly her fiance-and no doubt, as you wore the girl&#x27;s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.&quot; &quot;What on earth has that to do with it?&quot; I ejaculated. &quot;My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don&#x27;t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child&#x27;s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty&#x27;s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.&quot; &quot;I am sure that you are right Mr. Holmes,&quot; cried our client. &quot;A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.&quot; &quot;We must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o&#x27;clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.&quot; We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step. &quot;Have you managed it?&quot; asked Holmes. A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. &quot;That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,&quot; said she. &quot;Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle&#x27;s.&quot; &quot;You have done well indeed!&quot; cried Holmes with enthusiasm. &quot;Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.&quot; We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes&#x27;s face clouded over. &quot;I trust that we are not too late,&quot; said he. &quot;I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.&quot; It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone. &quot;There has been some villainy here,&quot; said Holmes; &quot;this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter&#x27;s intentions and has carried his victim off.&quot; &quot;But how?&quot; &quot;Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.&quot; He swung himself up onto the roof. &quot;Ah, yes,&quot; he cried, &quot;here&#x27;s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.&quot; &quot;But it is impossible,&quot; said Miss Hunter; &quot;the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away. &quot;He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.&quot; The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him. &quot;You villain!&quot; said he, &quot;where&#x27;s your daughter?&quot; The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight. &quot;It is for me to ask you that,&quot; he shrieked, &quot;you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I&#x27;ll serve you!&quot; He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go. &quot;He&#x27;s gone for the dog!&quot; cried Miss Hunter. &quot;I have my revolver,&quot; said I. &quot;Better close the front door,&quot; cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door. &quot;My God&quot; he cried. &quot;Someone has loosed the dog. He&#x27;s not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or we&#x27;ll be too late!&quot; Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle&#x27;s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room. &quot;Mrs. Toller!&quot; cried Miss Hunter. &quot;Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn&#x27;t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.&quot; &quot;Ha!&quot; said Holmes, looking keenly at her. &quot;It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.&quot; &quot;Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.&quot; &quot;I will soon make it clear to you,&quot; said she; &quot;and I&#x27;d have done so before now if I could ha&#x27; got out from the cellar. If there&#x27;s police-court business over this, you&#x27;ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice&#x27;s friend too. &quot;She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn&#x27;t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend&#x27;s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle&#x27;s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn&#x27;t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death&#x27;s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn&#x27;t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.&quot; &quot;That was it, sir.&quot; &quot;But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.&quot; &quot;Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,&quot; said Mrs. Toller serenely. &quot;And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.&quot; &quot;You have it, sir, just as it happened.&quot; &quot;I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.&quot; And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle&#x27;s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success. THE END . 1923 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE CREEPING MAN by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Mr. Sherlock Holmes was always of opinion that I should publish the singular facts connected with Professor Presbury, if only to dispel once for all the ugly rumours which some twenty years ago agitated the university and were echoed in the learned societies of London. There were, however, certain obstacles in the way, and the true history of this curious case remained entombed in the tin box which contains so many records of my friend&#x27;s adventures. Now we have at last obtained permission to ventilate the facts which formed one of the very last cases handled by Holmes before his retirement from practice. Even now a certain reticence and discretion have to be observed in laying the matter before the public. It was one Sunday evening early in September of the year 1903 that I received one of Holmes&#x27;s laconic messages: Come at once if convenient- if inconvenient come all the same. S.H. The relations between us in those latter days were peculiar. He was a man of habits, narrow and concentrated habits, and I had become one of them. As an institution I was like the violin, the shag tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books, and others perhaps less excusable. When it was a case of active work and a comrade was needed upon whose nerve he could place some reliance, my role was obvious. But apart from this I had uses. I was a whetstone for his mind. I stimulated him. He liked to think aloud in my presence. His remarks could hardly be said to be made to me- many of them would have been as appropriately addressed to his bedstead- but none the less, having formed the habit, it had become in some way helpful that I should register and interject. If I irritated him by a certain methodical slowness in my mentality, that irritation served only to make his own flame-like intuitions and impressions flash up the more vividly and swiftly. Such was my humble role in our alliance. When I arrived at Baker Street I found him huddled up in his armchair with updrawn knees, his pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with thought. It was clear that he was in the throes of some vexatious problem. With a wave of his hand he indicated my old armchair, but otherwise for half an hour he gave no sign that he was aware of my presence. Then with a start he seemed to come from his reverie, and with his usual whimsical smile he greeted me back to what had once been my home. &quot;You will excuse a certain abstraction of mind, my dear Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;Some curious facts have been submitted to me within the last twenty-four hours, and they in turn have given rise to some speculations of a more general character. I have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the detective.&quot; &quot;But surely, Holmes, this has been explored,&quot; said I. &quot;Bloodhounds- sleuthhounds-&quot; No, no, Watson, that side of the matter is, of course, obvious. But there is another which is far more subtle. You may recollect that in the case which you, in your sensational way, coupled with the Copper Beeches, I was able, by watching the mind of the child, to form a deduction as to the criminal habits of the very smug and respectable father.&quot; &quot;Yes, I remember it well.&quot; &quot;My line of thoughts about dogs is analogous. A dog reflects the family life. Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones. And their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others.&quot; I shook my head. &quot;Surely, Holmes, this is a little far-fetched,&quot; said I. He had refilled his pipe and resumed his seat, taking no notice of my comment. &quot;The practical application of what I have said is very close to the problem which I am investigating. It is a tangled skein, you understand, and I am looking for a loose end. One possible loose end lies in the question: Why does Professor Presbury&#x27;s wolfhound, Roy, endeavour to bite him?&quot; I sank back in my chair in some disappointment. Was it for so trivial a question as this that I had been summoned from my work? Holmes glanced across at me. &quot;The same old Watson!&quot; said he. &quot;You never learn that the gravest issues may depend upon the smallest things. But is it not on the face of it strange that a staid, elderly philosopher- you&#x27;ve heard of Presbury, of course, the famous Camford physiologist?- that such a man, whose friend has been his devoted wolfhound, should now have been twice attacked by his own dog? What do you make of it?&quot; &quot;The dog is ill.&quot; &quot;Well, that has to be considered. But he attacks no one else, nor does he apparently molest his master, save on very special occasions. Curious, Watson- very curious. But young Mr. Bennett is before his time if that is his ring. I had hoped to have a longer chat with you before he came.&quot; There was a quick step on the stairs, a sharp tap at the door, and a moment later the new client presented himself. He was a tall, handsome youth about thirty, well dressed and elegant, but with something in his bearing which suggested the shyness of the student rather than the self-possession of the man of the world. He shook hands with Holmes, and then looked with some surprise at me. &quot;This matter is very delicate, Mr. Holmes,&quot; he said. &quot;Consider the relation in which I stand to Professor Presbury both privately and publicly. I really can hardly justify myself if I speak before any third person.&quot; &quot;Have no fear, Mr. Bennett. Dr. Watson is the very soul of discretion, and I can assure you that this is a matter in which I am very likely to need an assistant.&quot; &quot;As you like, Mr. Holmes. You will, I am sure, understand my having some reserves in the matter.&quot; &quot;You will appreciate it, Watson, when I tell you that this gentleman, Mr. Trevor Bennett, is professional assistant to the great scientist, lives under his roof, and is engaged to his only daughter. Certainly we must agree that the professor has every claim upon his loyalty and devotion. But it may best be shown by taking the necessary steps to clear up this strange mystery.&quot; &quot;I hope so, Mr. Holmes. That is my one object. Does Dr. Watson know the situation?&quot; &quot;I have not had time to explain it.&quot; &quot;Then perhaps I had better go over the ground again before explaining some fresh developments.&quot; &quot;I will do so myself,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;in order to show that I have the events in their due order. The professor, Watson, is a man of European reputation. His life has been academic. There has never been a breath of scandal. He is a widower with one daughter, Edith. He is, I gather, a man of very virile and positive, one might almost say combative, character. So the matter stood until a very few months ago. &quot;Then the current of his life was broken. He is sixty-one years of age, but he became engaged to the daughter of Professor Morphy, his colleague in the chair of comparative anatomy. It was not, as I understand, the reasoned courting of an elderly man but rather the passionate frenzy of youth, for no one could have shown himself a more devoted lover. The lady, Alice Morphy, was a very perfect girl both in mind and body, so that there was every excuse for the professor&#x27;s infatuation. None the less, it did not meet with full approval in his own family.&quot; &quot;We thought it rather excessive,&quot; said our visitor. &quot;Exactly. Excessive and a little violent and unnatural. Professor Presbury was rich, however, and there was no objection upon the part of the father. The daughter, however, had other views, and there were already several candidates for her hand, who, if they were less eligible from a worldly point of view, were at least more of an age. The girl seemed to like the professor in spite of his eccentricities. It was only age which stood in the way. &quot;About this time a little mystery suddenly clouded the normal routine of the professor&#x27;s life. He did what he had never done before. He left home and gave no indication where he was going. He was away a fortnight and returned looking rather travel-worn. He made no allusion to where he had been, although he was usually the frankest of men. It chanced, however, that our client here, Mr. Bennett, received a letter from a fellow-student in Prague, who said that he was glad to have seen Professor Presbury there, although he had not been able to talk to him. Only in this way did his own household learn where he had been. &quot;Now comes the point. From that time onward a curious change came over the professor. He became furtive and sly. Those around him had always the feeling that he was not the man that they had known, but that he was under some shadow which had darkened his higher qualities. His intellect was not affected. His lectures were as brilliant as ever. But always there was something new, something sinister and unexpected. His daughter, who was devoted to him, tried again and again to resume the old relations and to penetrate this mask which her father seemed to have put on. You, sir, as I understand, did the same- but all was in vain. And now, Mr. Bennett, tell in your own words the incident of the letters.&quot; &quot;You must understand, Dr. Watson, that the professor had no secrets from me. If I were his son or his younger brother I could not have more completely enjoyed his confidence. As his secretary I handled every paper which came to him, and I opened and subdivided his letters. Shortly after his return all this was changed. He told me that certain letters might come to him from London which would be marked by a cross under the stamp. These were to be set aside for his own eyes only. I may say that several of these did pass through my hands, that they had the E.C. mark, and were in an illiterate handwriting. If he answered them at all the answers did not pass through my hands nor into the letter-basket in which our correspondence was collected.&quot; &quot;And the box,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Ah, yes, the box. The professor brought back a little wooden box from his travels. It was the one thing which suggested a Continental tour, for it was one of those quaint carved things which one associates with Germany. This he placed in this instrument cupboard. One day, in looking for a canula, I took up the box. To my surprise he was very angry, and reproved me in words which were quite savage for my curiosity. It was the first time such a thing had happened, and I was deeply hurt. I endeavoured to explain that it was a mere accident that I had touched the box, But all the evening I was conscious that he looked at me harshly and that the incident was rankling in his mind.&quot; Mr. Bennett drew a little diary book from his pocket. &quot;That was on July 2d,&quot; said he. &quot;You are certainly an admirable witness,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I may need some of these dates which you have noted.&quot; &quot;I learned method among other things from my great teacher. From the time that I observed abnormality in his behaviour I felt that it was my duty to study his case. Thus I have it here that it was on that very day, July 2d, that Roy attacked the professor as he came from his study into the hall. Again, on July 11th there was a scene of the same sort, and then I have a note of yet another upon July 20th. After that we bid to banish Roy to the stables. He was a dear, affectionate animal- but I fear I weary you.&quot; Mr. Bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it was very clear that Holmes was not listening. His face was rigid and his eyes gazed abstractedly at the ceiling. With an effort he recovered himself. &quot;Singular! Most singular!&quot; he murmured. &quot;These details were new to me, Mr. Bennett. I think we have now fairly gone over the old ground, have we not? But you spoke of some fresh developments.&quot; The pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded over, shadowed by some grim remembrance. &quot;What I speak of occurred the night before last,&quot; said he. &quot;I was lying awake about two in the morning, when I was aware of a dull muffled sound coming from the passage. I opened my door and peeped out. I should explain that the professor sleeps at the end of the passage-&quot; &quot;The date being-?&quot; asked Holmes. Our visitor was clearly annoyed it so irrelevant an interruption. &quot;I have said, sir, that it was the night before last- that is, September 4th.&quot; Holmes nodded and smiled. &quot;Pray continue,&quot; said he. &quot;He sleeps at the end of the passage and would have to pass my door in order to reach the staircase. It was a really terrifying experience, Mr. Holmes. I think that I am as strong-nerved as my neighbours, but I was shaken by what I saw. The passage was dark save that one window halfway along it threw a patch of light. I could see that something was coming along the passage, something dark and crouching. Then suddenly it emerged into the light, and I saw that it was he. He was crawling, Mr. Holmes- crawling! He was not quite on his hands and knees. I should rather say on his hands and feet, with his face sunk between his hands. Yet he seemed to move with case. I was so paralyzed by the sight that it was not until he had reached my door that I was able to step forward and ask if I could assist him. His answer was extraordinary. He sprang up, spat out some atrocious word at me, and hurried on past me, and down the staircase. I waited about for an hour, but he did not come back. It must have been daylight before he regained his room.&quot; &quot;Well, Watson, what make you of that?&quot; asked Holmes with the air of the pathologist who presents a rare specimen. &quot;Lumbago, possibly. I have known a severe attack make a man walk in just such a way, and nothing would be more trying to the temper.&quot; &quot;Good, Watson! You always keep us flat-footed on the ground. But we can hardly accept Lumbago, since he was able to stand erect in a moment.&quot; &quot;He was never better in health,&quot; said Bennett. &quot;In fact, he is stronger than I have known him for years. But there are the facts, Mr. Holmes. It is not a case in which we can consult the police, and yet we are utterly at our wit&#x27;s end as to what to do, and we feel in some strange way that we are drifting towards disaster. Edith- Miss Presbury- feels as I do, that we cannot wait passively any longer.&quot; &quot;It is certainly a very curious and suggestive case. What do you think Watson?&quot; &quot;Speaking as a medical man,&quot; said I, &quot;it appears to be a case for an alienist. The old gentleman&#x27;s cerebralo processes were disturbed by the love affair. He made a journey abroad in the hope of breaking himself of the passion. His letters and the box may be connected with some other private transaction- a loan, perhaps, or share certificates, which are in the box.&quot; &quot;And the wolfhound no doubt disapproved of the financial bargain. No, no, Watson, there is more in it than this. Now, I can only suggest-&quot; What Sherlock Holmes was about to suggest will never be known, for at this moment the door opened and a young lady was shown into the room. As she appeared Mr. Bennett sprang up with a cry and ran forward with his hands out to meet those which she had herself outstretched. &quot;Edith, dear! Nothing the matter, I hope?&quot; &quot;I felt I must follow you. Oh, Jack, I have been so dreadfully frightened! It is awful to be there alone.&quot; &quot;Mr. Holmes, this is the young lady I spoke of. This is my fiancee.&quot; &quot;We were gradually coming to that conclusion, were we not, Watson?&quot; Holmes answered with a smile. &quot;I take it, Miss Presbury, that there is some fresh development in the case, and that you thought we should know?&quot; Our new visitor, a bright, handsome girl of a conventional English type, smiled back at Holmes as she seated herself beside Mr. Bennett. &quot;When I found Mr. Bennett had left his hotel I thought I should probably find him here. Of course, he had told me that he would consult you. But, oh, Mr. Holmes, can you do nothing for my poor father?&quot; &quot;I have hopes, Miss Presbury, but the case is still obscure. Perhaps what you have to say may throw some fresh light upon it.&quot; &quot;It was last night, Mr. Holmes. He had been very strange all day. I am sure that there are times when he has no recollection of what he does. He lives as in a strange dream. Yesterday was such a day. It was not my father with whom I lived. His outward shell was there, but it was not really he.&quot; &quot;Tell me what happened.&quot; &quot;I was awakened in the night by the dog barking most furiously. Poor Roy, he is chained now near the stable. I may say that I always sleep with my door locked; for, as Jack- as Mr. Bennett- will tell you, we all have a feeling of impending danger. My room is on the second floor. It happened that the blind was up in my window, and there was bright moonlight outside. As I lay with my eyes fixed upon the square of light, listening to the frenzied barkings of the dog, I was amazed to see my father&#x27;s face looking in at me. Mr. Holmes, I nearly died of surprise and horror. There it was pressed against the window-pane, and one hand seemed to be raised as if to push up the window. If that window had opened, I think I should have gone mad. It was no delusion, Mr. Holmes. Don&#x27;t deceive yourself by thinking so. I dare say it was twenty seconds or so that I lay paralyzed and watched the face. Then it vanished, but I could not- I could not spring out of bed and look out after it. I lay cold and shivering till morning. At breakfast he was sharp and fierce in manner, and made no allusion to the adventure of the night. Neither did I, but I gave an excuse for coming to town- and here I am.&quot; Holmes looked thoroughly surprised at Miss Presbury&#x27;s narrative. &quot;My dear young lady, you say that your room is on the second floor. Is there a long ladder in the garden?&quot; &quot;No, Mr. Holmes, that is the amazing part of it. There is no possible way of reaching the window- and yet he was there.&quot; &quot;The date being September 5th,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;That certainly complicates matters.&quot; It was the young lady&#x27;s turn to look surprised. &quot;This is the second time that you have alluded to the date, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said Bennett. &quot;Is it possible that it has any bearing upon the case?&quot; &quot;It is possible- very possible- and yet I have not my full material at present.&quot; &quot;Possibly you are thinking of the connection between insanity and phases of the moon?&quot; &quot;No, I assure you. It was quite a different line of thought. Possibly you can leave your notebook with me, and I will check the dates. Now I think, Watson, that our line of action is perfectly clear. This young lady has informed us- and I have the greatest confidence in her intuition- that her father remembers little or nothing which occurs upon certain dates. We will therefore call upon him as if he had given us an appointment upon such a date. He will put it down to his own lack of memory. Thus we will open our campaign by having a good close view of him.&quot; &quot;That is excellent,&quot; said Mr. Bennett. &quot;I warn you, however, that the professor is irascible and violent at times.&quot; Holmes smiled. &quot;There are reasons why we should come at once- very cogent reasons if my theories hold good. To-morrow, Mr. Bennett, will certainly see us in Camford. There is, if I remember right, an inn called the Chequers where the port used to be above mediocrity and the linen was above reproached. I think, Watson, that our lot for the next few days might be in less pleasant places.&quot; Monday, morning found us on our way to the famous university town- an easy effort on the part of Holmes, who had no roots to pull up, but one which involved frantic planning and hurrying on my part, as my practice was by this time not inconsiderable. Holmes made no allusion to the case until after we had deposited our suitcases at the ancient hostel of which he had spoken. &quot;I think, Watson, that we can catch the professor just before lunch. He lectures at eleven and should have an interval at home.&quot; &quot;What possible excuse have we for calling?&quot; Holmes glanced at his notebook. &quot;There was a period of excitement upon August 26th. We will assume that he is a little hazy as to what he does at such times. If we insist that we are there by appointment I think he will hardly venture to contradict us. Have you the effrontery necessary to put it through?&quot; &quot;We can but try.&quot; &quot;Excellent, Watson! Compound of the Busy Bee and Excellsior. We can but try- the motto of the firm. A friendly native will surely guide us.&quot; Such a one on the back of a smart hansom swept us past a row of ancient colleges and, finally turning into a tree-lined drive, pulled up at the door of a charming house, girt round with lawns and covered with purple wistaria. Professor Presbury was certainly surrounded with every sign not only of comfort but of luxury. Even as we pulled up, a grizzled head appeared at the front window, and we were aware of a pair of keen eyes from under shaggy brows which surveyed us through large horn glasses. A moment later we were actually in his sanctum, and the mysterious scientist, whose vagaries had brought us from London, was standing before us. There was certainly no sign of eccentricity either in his manner or appearance, for he was a portly, large-featured man, grave, tall, and frock-coated, with the dignity of bearing which a lecturer needs. His eyes were his most remarkable feature, keen, observant, and clever to the verge of cunning. He looked at our cards. &quot;Pray sit down, gentlemen. What can I do for you?&quot; Mr. Holmes smiled amiably. &quot;It was the question which I was about to put to you, Professor.&quot; &quot;To me, sir!&quot; &quot;Possibly there is some mistake. I heard through a second person that Professor Presbury of Camford had need of my services.&quot; &quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; It seemed to me that there was a malicious sparkle in the intense gray eyes. &quot;You heard that, did you? May I ask the name of your informant?&quot; &quot;I am sorry, Professor, but the matter was rather confidential. If I have made a mistake there is no harm done. I can only express my regret.&quot; &quot;Not at all. I should wish to go further into this matter. It interests me. Have you any scrap of writing, any letter or telegram, to bear out your assertion?&quot; &quot;No, I have not.&quot; &quot;I presume that you do not go so far as to assert that I summoned you?&quot; &quot;I would rather answer no questions,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;No, I dare say not,&quot; said the professor with asperity. &quot;However, that particular one can be answered very easily without your aid.&quot; He walked across the room to the bell. Our London friend, Mr. Bennett, answered the call. &quot;Come in, Mr. Bennett. These two gentlemen have come from London under the impression that they have been summoned. You handle all my correspondence. Have you a note of anything going to a person named Holmes?&quot; &quot;No, sir,&quot; Bennett answered with a flush. &quot;That is conclusive,&quot; said the professor, glaring angrily at my companion. &quot;Now, sir&quot;- he leaned forward with his two hands upon the table- &quot;it seems to me that your position is a very questionable one.&quot; Holmes shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I can only repeat that I am sorry that we have made a needless intrusion.&quot; &quot;Hardly enough, Mr. Holmes!&quot; the old man cried in a high screaming voice, with extraordinary malignancy upon his face. He got between us and the door as he spoke, and he shook his two hands at us with furious passion. &quot;You can hardly get out of it so easily as that.&quot; His face was convulsed, and he grinned and gibbered at us in his senseless rage. I am convinced that we should have had to fight our way out of the room if Mr. Bennett had not intervened. &quot;My dear Professor,&quot; he cried, &quot;consider your position! Consider the scandal at the university! Mr. Holmes is a well-known man. You cannot possibly treat him with such discourtesy.&quot; Sulkily our host- if I may call him so- cleared the path to the door. We were glad to find ourselves outside the house and in the quiet of the tree-lined drive. Holmes seemed greatly amused by the episode. &quot;Our learned friend&#x27;s nerves are somewhat out of order,&quot; said he. &quot;Perhaps our intrusion was a little crude, and yet we have gained that personal contact which I desired. But, dear me, Watson, he is surely at our heels. The villain still pursues us.&quot; There were the sounds of running feet behind, but it was, to my relief, not the formidable professor but his assistant who appeared round the curve of the drive. He came panting up to us. &quot;I am so sorry, Mr. Holmes. I wished to apologize.&quot; &quot;My dear sir, there is no need. It is all in the way of professional experience.&quot; &quot;I have never seen him in a more dangerous mood. But he grows more sinister. You can understand now why his daughter and I are alarmed. And yet his mind is perfectly clear.&quot; &quot;Too clear!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;That was my miscalculation. It is evident that his memory is much more reliable than I had thought. By the way, can we, before we go, see the window of Miss Presbury&#x27;s room?&quot; Mr. Bennett pushed his way through some shrubs, and we had a view of the side of the house. &quot;It is there. The second on the left.&quot; &quot;Dear me, it seems hardly accessible. And yet you will observe that there is a creeper bellow and a water-pipe above which give some foothold.&quot; &quot;I could not climb it myself,&quot; said Mr. Bennett. &quot;Very likely. It would certainly be a dangerous exploit for any normal man.&quot; &quot;There was one other thing I wish to tell you, Mr. Holmes. I have the address of the man in London to whom the professor writes. He seems to have written this morning, and I got it from his blotting-paper. It is an ignoble position for a trusted secretary, but what else can I do?&quot; Holmes glanced at the paper and put it into his pocket. &quot;Dorak- a curious name. Slavonic, I imagine. Well, it is an important link in the chain. We return to London, this afternoon, Mr. Bennett. I see no good purpose to be served by our remaining. We cannot arrest the professor because he has done no crime, nor can we place him under constraint, for he cannot be proved to be mad. No action is is yet possible.&quot; &quot;Then what on earth are we to do?&quot; &quot;A little patience, Mr. Bennett. Things will soon develop. Unless I am mistaken, next Tuesday may mark a crisis. Certainly we shall be in Camford on that day. meanwhile, the general position is undeniably unpleasant, and if Miss Presbury can prolong her visit-&quot; That is easy.&quot; &quot;Then let her stay till we can assure her that all danger is past. Meanwhile, let him have his way and do not cross him. So long as he is in a good humour all is well.&quot; &quot;There he is!&quot; said Bennett in a startled whisper. Looking between the branches we saw the tall, great figure emerge from the hall door and look around him. He stood leaning forward, his hands swinging straight before him, his head turning from side to side. The secretary with a last wave slipped off among the trees, and we saw him presently rejoin his employer, the two entering the house together in what seemed to be animated and even excited conversation. &quot;I expect the old gentleman has been putting two and two together,&quot; said Holmes as we walked hotelward. &quot;He struck me as having a particularly clear and logical brain from the little I saw of him. Explosive, no doubt, but then from his point of view he has something to explode about if detectives are put on his track and he suspects his own household of doing it. I rather fancy that friend Bennett is in for an uncomfortable time.&quot; Holmes stopped at a post-office and sent off a telegram on our way. The answer reached us in the evening, and he tossed it across to me. Have visited the Commercial Road and seen Dorak. Suave person, Bohemian, elderly. Keeps large general store. MERCER. &quot;Mercer is since your time,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;He is my general utility man who looks up routine business. It was important to know something of the man with whom our professor was so secretly corresponding. His nationality connects up with the Prague visit.&quot; &quot;Thank goodness that something connects with something,&quot; said I. &quot;At present we seem to be faced by a long series of inexplicable incidents with no bearing upon each other. For example, what possible connection can there be between an angry wolfhound and a visit to Bohemia, or either of them with a man crawling down a passage at night? As to your dates, that is the biggest mystification of all.&quot; Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands, We were, I may say, seated in the old sitting-room of the ancient hotel, with a bottle of the famous vintage of which Holmes had spoken on the table between us. &quot;Well, now, let us take the dates first,&quot; said he, his finger-tips together and his manner as if he were addressing a class. &quot;This excellent young man&#x27;s diary shows that there was trouble upon July 2d, and from then onward it seems to have been at nine-day intervals, with, so far as I remember, only one exception. Thus the last outbreak upon Friday was on September 3rd, which also falls into the series, as did August 26th, which preceded it. The thing is beyond coincidence.&quot; I was forced to agree. &quot;Let us, then, form the provisional theory that every nine days the professor takes some strong drug which has a passing but highly poisonous effect. His naturally violent nature is intensified by it. He learned to take this drug while he was in Prague, and is now supplied with it by a Bohemian intermediary in London. This all hangs together, Watson!&quot; &quot;But the dog, the face at the window, the creeping man in the passage?&quot; &quot;Well, well, we have made a beginning. I should not expect any fresh developments until next Tuesday. In the meantime we can only keep in touch with friend Bennett and enjoy, the amnenities of this charming town.&quot; In the morning Mr. Bennett slipped round to bring us the latest report. As Holmes had imagined, times had not been easy with him. Without exactly accusing him of being responsible for our presence, the professor had been very rough and rude in his speech, and evidently felt some strong grievance. This morning he was quite himself again, However, and had delivered his usual brilliant lecture to a crowded class. &quot;Apart from his queer fits,&quot; said Bennett, &quot;he has actually more energy and vitality, than I can ever remember, nor was his brain ever clearer. But it&#x27;s not he- it&#x27;s never the man whom we have known.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t think you have anything to fear now for a week at least,&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;I am a busy man, and Dr. Watson has his patients to attend to. Let us agree that we meet here at this hour next Tuesday, and I shall be surprised if before we leave you again we are not able to explain, even if we cannot perhaps put an end to, your troubles. Meanwhile, keep us posted in what occurs.&quot; I saw nothing of my friend for the next few days, but on the following Monday evening I had a short note asking me to meet him next day at the train. From what he told me as we travelled up to Camford all was well, the peace of the professor&#x27;s house had been unruffled, and his own conduct perfectly normal. This also was the report which was given us by Mr. Bennett himself when he called upon us that evening at our old quarters in the Chequers. &quot;He heard from his London correspondent to-day. There was a letter and there was a small packet, each with the cross under the stamp which warned me not to touch them. There has been nothing else.&quot; That may prove quite enough,&quot; said Holmes grimly. &quot;Now, Mr. Bennett, we shall, I think, come to some conclusion to-night. If my deductions are correct we should have an opportunity of bringing matters to a head. In order to do so it is necessary to hold the professor under observation. I would suggest, therefore, that you remain awake and on the lookout. Should you hear him pass your door, do not interrupt him, but follow him as discreetly as you can. Dr. Watson and I will not be far off. By the way, where is the key of that little box of which you spoke?&quot; &quot;Upon his watch-chain.&quot; &quot;I fancy our researches must lie in that direction. At the worst the lock should not be very formidable. Have you any other able-bodied man on the premises?&quot; &quot;There is the coachman, Macphail.&quot; &quot;Where does he sleep?&quot; &quot;Over the stables.&quot; &quot;We might possibly want him. Well, we can do no more until we see how things develop. Good-bye- but I expect that we shall see you before morning.&quot; It was nearly midnight before we took our station among some bushes immediately opposite the hall door of the professor. It was a fine night, but chilly, and we were glad of our warm overcoats. There was a breeze, and clouds were scudding across the sky, obscuring from time to time the half-moon. It would have been a dismal vigil were it not for the expectation and excitement which carried us along, and the assurance of my comrade that we had probably reached the end of the strange sequence of events which had engaged our attention. &quot;If the circle of nine days holds good then we shall have the professor at his worst to-night,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;The fact that these strange symptoms began after his visit to Prague, that he is in secret correspondence with a Bohemian dealer in London, who presumably represents someone in Prague, and that he received a packet from him this very day, all point in one direction. What he takes and why he takes it are still beyond our ken, but that it emanates in some way from Prague is clear enough. He takes it under definite directions which regulate this ninth-day system, which was the first point which attracted my attention. But his symptoms are most remarkable. Did you observe his knuckles?&quot; I had to confess that I did not. &quot;Thick and horny in a way which is quite new in my experience. Always look at the hands first, Watson. Then cuffs, trouser-knees, and boots. Very curious knuckles which can only be explained by the mode of progression observed by-&quot; Holmes paused and suddenly clapped his hand to his forehead. &quot;Oh, Watson, Watson, what a fool I have been! It seems incredible, and yet it must be true. All points in one direction. How could I miss seeing the connection of ideas? Those knuckles- how could I have passed those knuckles? And the dog! And the ivy! It&#x27;s surely time that I disappeared into that little farm of my dreams. Look out, Watson! Here he is! We shall have the chance of seeing for ourselves.&quot; The hall door had slowly opened, and against the lamplit background we saw the tall figure of Professor Presbury. He was clad in his dressing-gown. As he stood outlined in the doorway he was great but leaning forward with dangling arms, as when we saw him last. Now he stepped forward into the drive, and an extraordinary change came over him. He sank down into a crouching position and moved along upon his hands and feet, skipping every now and then as if he were overflowing with energy and vitality. He moved along the face of the house and then round the corner. As he disappeared Bennett slipped through the hall door and softly followed him. &quot;Come, Watson, come!&quot; cried Holmes, and we stole as softly as we could through the bushes until we had gained a spot whence we could see the other side of the house, which was bathed in the light of the half-moon. The professor was clearly visible crouching at the foot of the ivy-covered wall. As we watched him he suddenly began with incredible agility to ascend it. From branch to branch he sprang, sure of foot and firm of grasp, climbing apparently in mere joy at his own powers, with no definite object in view. With his dressing-gown flapping on each side of him, he looked like some huge bat glued against the side of his own house, a great square dark patch upon the moonlit wall. Presently he tired of this amusement, and, dropping from branch to branch, he squatted down into the old attitude and moved towards the stables, creeping along in the same strange way as before. The wolfhound was out now, barking furiously, and more excited than ever when it actually caught sight of its master. It was straining on its chain and quivering with eagerness and rage. The professor squatted down very deliberately just out of reach of the bound and began to provoke it in every possible way. He took handfuls of pebbles from the drive and threw them in the dog&#x27;s face, prodded him with a stick which he had picked up, flicked his hands about only a few inches from the gaping mouth, and endeavoured in every way to increase the animal&#x27;s fury, which was already beyond all control. In all our adventures I do not know that I have ever seen a more strange sight than this impassive and still dignified figure crouching frog-like upon the ground and goading to a wilder exhibition of passion the maddened hound, which ramped and raged in front of him, by all manner of ingenious and calculated cruelty. And then in a moment it happened! It was not the chain that broke, but it was the collar that slipped, for it had been made for a thick-necked Newfoundland. We heard the rattle of falling metal, and the next instant dog and man were rolling on the ground together, the one roaring in rage, the other screaming in a strange shrill falsetto of terror. It was a very narrow thing for the professor&#x27;s life. The savage creature had him fairly by the throat, its fangs had bitten deep, and he was senseless before we could reach them and drag the two apart. It might have been a dangerous task for us, but Bennett&#x27;s voice and presence brought the great wolfhound instantly to reason. The uproar had brought the sleepy and astonished coachman from his room above the stables. &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised,&quot; said he, shaking his bead. &quot;I&#x27;ve seen him at it before. I knew the dog would get him sooner or later.&quot; The hound was secured, and together we carried the professor up to his room, where Bennett, who had a medical degree, helped me to dress his torn throat. The sharp teeth had passed dangerously near the carotid artery, and the haemorrhage was serious. In half an hour the danger was past, I had given the patient an injection of morphia, and he had sunk into deep sleep. Then, and only then, were we able to look at each other and to take stock of the situation. &quot;I think a first-class surgeon should see him,&quot; said I. &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, no!&quot; cried Bennett. &quot;At present the scandal is confined to our own household. It is safe with us. If it gets beyond these walls it will never stop. Consider his position at the university, his European reputation, the feelings of his daughter.&quot; &quot;Quite so,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I think it may be quite possible to keep the matter to ourselves, and also to prevent its recurrence now that we have a free hand. The key from the watch-chain, Mr. Bennett. Macphail will guard the patient and let us know if there is any change. Let us see what we can find in the professor&#x27;s mysterious box.&quot; There was not much, but there was enough- an empty phial, another nearly full, a hypodermic syringe, several letters in a crabbed, foreign hand. The marks on the envelopes showed that they were those which had disturbed the routine of the secretary, and each was dated from the Commercial Road and signed &quot;A. Dorak.&quot; They were mere invoices to say that a fresh bottle was being sent to Professor Presbury, or receipt to acknowledge money. There was one other envelope, however, in a more educated band and bearing the Austrian stamp with the postmark of Prague. &quot;Here we have our material!&quot; cried Holmes as he tore out the enclosure. HONOURED COLLEAGUE [it ran]: Since your esteemed visit I have thought much of your case, and though in your circumstances there are some special reasons for the treatment, I would none the less enjoin caution, as my results have shown that it is not without danger of a kind. It is possible that the serum of anthropoid would have been better. I have, as I explained to you, used black-faced langur because a specimen was accessible. Langur is, of course, a crawler and climber, while anthropoid walk erect and is in all ways nearer. I beg you to take every possible precaution that there be no premature revelation of the process. I have one other client in England, and Dorak is my agent for both. Weekly reports will oblige. Yours with high esteem, H. LOWENSTEIN. Lowenstein! The name brought back to me the memory of some snippet from a newspaper which, spoke of an obscure scientist who was striving in some unknown way for the secret of rejuvenescence and the elixir of life. Lowenstein of Prague! Lowenstein with the wondrous strength-giving serum, tabooed by the profession because he refused to reveal its source. In a few words I said what I remembered. Bennett had taken a manual of zoology from the shelves. &quot;&#x27;Langur,&#x27;&quot; he read, &quot;&#x27;the great black-faced monkey of the Himalayan slopes, biggest and most human of climbing monkeys.&#x27; Many details are added. Well, thanks to you, Mr. Holmes, it is very clear that we have traced the evil to its source.&quot; &quot;The real source,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;lies, of course, in that untimely love affair which gave our impetuous professor the idea that he could only gain his wish by turning himself into a younger man. When one tries to rise above nature one is liable to fall below it. The highest type of man may revert to the animal if he leaves tile straight road of destiny.&quot; He sat musing for a little with the phial in his hand, looking at the clear liquid within. &quot;When I have written to this man and told him that I hold him criminally responsible for the poisons which he circulates, we will have no more trouble. But it may recur. Others may find a better way. There is danger there- a very real danger to humanity. Consider, Watson, that the material, the sensual, the worldly would all prolong their worthless lives. The spiritual would not avoid the call to something higher. It would be the survival of the least fit. What sort of cesspool may not our poor world become?&quot; Suddenly the dreamer disappeared, and Holmes, the man of action, sprang from his chair. &quot;I think there is nothing more to be said, Mr. Bennett. The various incidents will how fit themselves easily into the general scheme. The dog, of course, was aware of the change far more quickly than you. His smell would insure that. It was the monkey, not the professor, whom Roy attacked, just as it was the monkey who teased Roy. Climbing was a joy to the creature, and it was a mere chance, I take it, that the pastime brought him to the young lady&#x27;s window. There is an early train to town, Watson, but I think we shall just have time for a cup of tea at the Chequers before we catch it.&quot; -THE END- . 1903 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN Holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long, thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a particularly malodorous product. His head was sunk upon his breast, and he looked from my point of view like a strange, lank bird, with dull gray plumage and a black top-knot. &quot;So, Watson,&quot; said he, suddenly, &quot;you do not propose to invest in South African securities?&quot; I gave a start of astonishment. Accustomed as I was to Holmes&#x27;s curious faculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable. &quot;How on earth do you know that?&quot; I asked. He wheeled round upon his stool, with a steaming test-tube in his hand, and a gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes. &quot;Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback,&quot; said he. &quot;I am.&quot; &quot;I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple.&quot; &quot;I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind.&quot; &quot;You see, my dear Watson&quot;- he propped his test-tube in the rack, and began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class- &quot;it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If, after doing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents one&#x27;s audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect. Now, it was not really difficult, by an inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did not propose to invest your small capital in the gold fields.&quot; &quot;I see no connection.&quot; &quot;Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a close connection. Here are the missing links of the very simple chain: 1. You had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night. 2. You put chalk there when you play billiards, to steady the cue. 3. You never play billiards except with Thurston. 4. You told me, four weeks ago, that Thurston had an option on some South African property which would expire in a month, and which he desired you to share with him. 5. Your check book is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked for the key. 6. You do not propose to invest your money in this manner.&quot; &quot;How absurdly simple!&quot; I cried. &quot;Quite so!&quot; said he, a little nettled. &quot;Every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you. Here is an unexplained one. See what you can make of that, friend Watson.&quot; He tossed a sheet of paper upon the table, and turned once more to his chemical analysis. I looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper. &quot;Why, Holmes, it is a child&#x27;s drawing,&quot; I cried. &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s your idea!&quot; &quot;What else should it be?&quot; &quot;That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Riding Thorpe Manor, Norfolk, is very anxious to know. This little conundrum came by the first post, and he was to follow by the next train. There&#x27;s a ring at the bell, Watson. I should not be very much surprised if this were he.&quot; A heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and an instant later there entered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gentleman, whose clear eyes and florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of Baker Street. He seemed to bring a whiff of his strong, fresh, bracing, east-coast air with him as he entered. Having shaken hands with each of us, he was about to sit down, when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious markings, which I had just examined and left upon the table. &quot;Well, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of these?&quot; he cried. &quot;They told me that you were fond of queer mysteries, and I don&#x27;t think you can find a queerer one than that. I sent the paper on ahead, so that you might have time to study it before I came.&quot; &quot;It is certainly rather a curious production,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;At first sight it would appear to be some childish prank. It consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn. Why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an object?&quot; &quot;I never should, Mr. Holmes. But my wife does. It is frightening her to death. She says nothing, but I can see terror in her eyes. That&#x27;s why I want to sift the matter to the bottom.&quot; Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. It was a page torn from a notebook. The markings were done in pencil, and ran in this way: (See illustration.) Holmes examined it for some time, and then, folding it carefully up, he placed it in his pocketbook. &quot;This promises to be a most interesting and unusual case,&quot; said he. &quot;You gave me a few particulars in your letter, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, but I should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend, Dr. Watson.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m not much of a story-teller,&quot; said our visitor, nervously clasping and unclasping his great, strong hands. &quot;You&#x27;ll just ask me anything that I don&#x27;t make clear. I&#x27;ll begin at the time of my marriage last year, but I want to say first of all that, though I&#x27;m not a rich man, my people have been at Riding Thorpe for a matter of five centuries, and there is no better known family in the County of Norfolk. Last year I came up to London for the Jubilee, and I stopped at a boardinghouse in Russell Square, because Parker, the vicar of our parish, was staying in it. There was an American young lady there- Patrick was the name- Elsie Patrick. In some way we became friends, until before my month was up I was as much in love as man could be. We were quietly married at a registry office, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded couple. You&#x27;ll think it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a man of a good old family should marry a wife in this fashion, knawing nothing of her past or of her people, but if you saw her and knew her, it would help you to understand. &quot;She was very straight about it, was Elsie. I can&#x27;t say that she did not give me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to do so. `I have had some very disagreeable associations in my life,&#x27; said she, `I wish to forget all about them. I would rather never allude to the past, for it is very painful to me. If you take me, Hilton, you will take a woman who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of, but you will have to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time when I became yours. If these conditions are too hard, then go back to Norfolk, and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me.&#x27; It was only the day before our wedding that she said those very words to me. I told her that I was content to take her on her own terms, and I have been as good as my word. &quot;Well we have been married now for a year, and very happy we have been. But about a month ago, at the end of June, I saw for the first time signs of trouble. One day my wife received a letter from America. I saw the American stamp. She turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw it into the fire. She made no allusion to it afterwards, and I made none, for a promise is a promise, but she has never known an easy hour from that moment. There is always a look of fear upon her face- a look as if she were waiting and expecting. She would do better to trust me. She would find that I was her best friend. But until she speaks, I can say nothing. Mind you, she is a truthful woman, Mr. Holmes, and whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of hers. I am only a simple Norfolk squire, but there is not a man in England who ranks his family honour more highly than I do. She knows it well, and she knew it well before she married me. She would never bring any stain upon it- of that I am sure. &quot;Well, now I come to the queer part of my story. About a week ago- it was the Tuesday of last week- I found on one of the window-sills a number of absurd little dancing figures like these upon the paper. They were scrawled with chalk. I thought that it was the stable-boy who had drawn them, but the lad swore he knew nothing about it. Anyhow, they had come there during the night. I had them washed out, and I only mentioned the matter to my wife afterwards. To my surprise, she took it very seriously, and begged me if any more came to let her see them. None did come for a week, and then yesterday morning I found this paper lying on the sundial in the garden. I showed it to Elsie, and down she dropped in a dead faint. Since then she has looked like a woman in a dream, half dazed, and with terror always lurking in her eyes. It was then that I wrote and sent the paper to you, Mr. Holmes. It was not a thing that I could take to the police, for they would have laughed at me, but you will tell me what to do. I am not a rich man, but if there is any danger threatening my little woman, I would spend my last copper to shield her.&quot; He was a fine creature, this man of the old English soil-simple, straight, and gentle, with his great, earnest blue eyes and broad, comely face. His love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his features. Holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention, and now he sat for some time in silent thought. &quot;Don&#x27;t you think, Mr. Cubitt,&quot; said he, at last, &quot;that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife, and to ask her to share her secret with you?&quot; Hilton Cubitt shook his massive head. &quot;A promise is a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie wished to tell me she would. If not, it is not for me to force her confidence. But I am justified in taking my own line- and I will.&quot; &quot;Then I will help you with all my heart. In the first place, have you heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;I presume that it is a very quiet place. Any fresh face would cause comment?&quot; &quot;In the immediate neighbourhood, yes. But we have several small watering places not very far away. And the farmers take in lodgers.&quot; &quot;These hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning. If it is a purely arbitrary one, it may be impossible for us to solve it. If, on the other hand, it is systematic, I have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it. But this particular sample is so short that I can do nothing, and the facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation. I would suggest that you return to Norfolk, that you keep a keen lookout, and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men which may appear. It is a thousand pities that we have not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the window-sill. Make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the neighbourhood. When you have collected some fresh evidence, come to me again. That is the best advice which I can give you, Mr. Hilton Cubitt. If there are any pressing fresh developments, I shall be always ready to run down and see you in your Norfolk home.&quot; The interview left Sherlock Holmes very thoughtful, and several times in the next few days I saw him take his slip of paper from his notebook and look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it. He made no allusion to the affair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight or so later. I was going out when he called me back. &quot;You had better stay here, Watson.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because I had a wire from Hilton Cubitt this morning. You remember Hilton Cubitt, of the dancing men? He was to reach Liverpool Street at one-twenty. He may be here at any moment. I gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of importance.&quot; We had not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire came straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him. He was looking worried and depressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead. &quot;It&#x27;s getting on my nerves, this business, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he, as he sank, like a wearied man, into an armchair. &quot;It&#x27;s bad enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of design upon you, but when, in addition to that, you know that it is just killing your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure. She&#x27;s wearing away under it- just wearing away before my eyes.&quot; &quot;Has she said anything yet?&quot; &quot;No, Mr. Holmes, she has not. And yet there have been times when the poor girl has wanted to speak, and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge. I have tried to help her, but I daresay I did it clumsily, and scared her from it. She has spoken about my old family, and our reputation in the county, and our pride in our unsullied honour, and I always felt it was leading to the point, but somehow it turned off before we got there.&quot; &quot;But you have found out something for yourself?&quot; &quot;A good deal, Mr. Holmes. I have several fresh dancing-men pictures for you to examine, and, what is more important, I have seen the fellow.&quot; &quot;What, the man who draws them?&quot; &quot;Yes, I saw him at his work. But I will tell you everything in order. When I got back after my visit to you, the very first thing I saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men. They had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool-house, which stands beside the lawn in full view of the front windows. I took an exact copy, and here it is.&quot; He unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table. Here is a copy of the hieroglyphics: (See illustration.) &quot;Excellent!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Excellent! Pray continue.&quot; &quot;When I had taken the copy, I rubbed out the marks, but, two mornings later, a fresh inscription had appeared. I have a copy of it here&quot;: (See illustration.) Holmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight. &quot;Our material is rapidly accumulating,&quot; said he. &quot;Three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper, and placed under a pebble upon the sundial. Here it is. The characters are, as you see, exactly the same as the last one. After that I determined to lie in wait, so I got out my revolver and I sat up in my study, which overlooks the lawn and garden. About two in the morning I was seated by the window, all being dark save for the moonlight outside, when I heard steps behind me, and there was my wife in her dressinggown. She implored me to come to bed. I told her frankly that I wished to see who it was who played such absurd tricks upon us. She answered that it was some senseless practical joke, and that I should not take any notice of it. &quot;`If it really annoys you, Hilton, we might go and travel, you and I, and so avoid this nuisance.&#x27; &quot;`What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?&#x27; said I. `Why, we should have the whole county laughing at us.&#x27; &quot;`Well, come to bed,&#x27; said she, `and we can discuss it in the morning.&#x27; &quot;Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight, and her hand tightened upon my shoulder. Something was moving in the shadow of the tool-house. I saw a dark, creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door. Seizing my pistol, I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength. I tried to throw her off, but she clung to me most desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone. He had left a trace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which I have copied on that paper. There was no other sign of the fellow anywhere, though I ran all over the grounds. And yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time, for when I examined the door again in the morning, he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which I had already seen.&quot; &quot;Have you that fresh drawing?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is very short, but I made a copy of it, and here it is.&quot; Again he produced a paper. The new dance was in this form: (See illustration.) &quot;Tell me,&quot; said Holmes- and I could see by his eyes that he was much excited- &quot;was this a mere addition to the first or did it appear to be entirely separate?&quot; &quot;It was on a different panel of the door.&quot; &quot;Excellent! This is far the most important of all for our purpose. It fills me with hopes. Now, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, please continue your most interesting statement.&quot; &quot;I have nothing more to say, Mr. Holmes, except that I was angry with my wife that night for having held me back when I might have caught the skulking rascal. She said that she feared that I might come to harm. For an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared was that he might come to harm, for I could not doubt that she knew who this man was, and what he meant by these strange signals. But there is a tone in my wife&#x27;s voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look in her eyes which forbid doubt, and I am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind. There&#x27;s the whole case, and now I want your advice as to what I ought to do. My own inclination is to put half a dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery, and when this fellow comes again to give him such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future.&quot; &quot;I fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;How long can you stay in London?&quot; &quot;I must go back to-day. I would not leave my wife alone all night for anything. She is very nervous, and begged me to come back.&quot; &quot;I daresay you are right. But if you could have stopped, I might possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two. Meanwhile you will leave me these papers, and I think that it is very likely that I shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case.&quot; Sherlock Holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor had left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so well, to see that he was profoundly excited. The moment that Hilton Cubitt&#x27;s broad back had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table, laid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him, and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For two hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making progress and whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together. Then he wrote a long telegram upon a cable form. &quot;If my answer to this is as I hope, you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;I expect that we shall be able to go down to Norfolk tomorrow, and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance.&quot; I confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes liked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way, so I waited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence. But there was a delay in that answering telegram, and two days of impatience followed, during which Holmes pricked up his ears at every ring of the bell. the evening of the second there came a letter from Hilton Cubitt. All was quiet with him, save that a long inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sundial. He inclosed a copy of it, which is here reproduced: (See illustration.) Holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay. His face was haggard with anxiety. &quot;We have let this affair go far enough,&quot; said he. &quot;Is there a train to North Walsham to-night?&quot; I turned up the time-table. The last had just gone. &quot;Then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Our presence is most urgently needed. Ah! here is our expected cablegram. One moment, Mrs. Hudson, there may be an answer. No, that is quite as I expected. This message makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in letting Hilton Cubitt know how matters stand, for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple Norfolk squire is entangled.&quot; So, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the dark conclusion of a story which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre, I experience once again the dismay and horror with which I was filled. Would that I had some brighter ending to communicate to my readers, but these are the chronicles of fact, and I must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for some days made Riding Thorpe Manor a household word through the length and breadth of England. We had hardly alighted at North Walsham, and mentioned the name of our destination, when the stationmaster hurried towards us. &quot;I suppose that you are the detectives from London?&quot; said he. A look of annoyance passed over Holmes&#x27;s face. &quot;What makes you think such a thing?&quot; &quot;Because Inspector Martin from Norwich has just passed through. But maybe you are the surgeons. She&#x27;s not dead- or wasn&#x27;t by last accounts. You may be in time to save her yet- though it be for the gallows.&quot; Holmes&#x27;s brow was dark with anxiety. &quot;We are going to Riding Thorpe Manor,&quot; said he, &quot;but we have heard nothing of what has passed there.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a terrible business,&quot; said the stationmaster. &quot;They are shot both Mr. Hilton Cubitt and his wife. She shot him and then herself- so the servants say. He&#x27;s dead and her life is despaired of. Dear, dear, one of the oldest families in the county of Norfolk, and one of the most honoured.&quot; Without a word Holmes hurried to a carriage, and during the long seven miles&#x27; drive he never opened his mouth. Seldom have I seen him so utterly despondent. He had been uneasy during all our journey from town, and I had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with anxious attention, but now this sudden realization of his worst fears left him in a blank melancholy. He leaned back in his seat, lost in gloomy speculation. Yet there was much around to interest us, for we were passing through as singular a countryside as any in England, where a few scattered cottages represented the population of to-day, while on every hand enormous square-towered churches bristled up from the flat green landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old East Anglia. At last the violet rim of the German Ocean appeared over the green edge of the Norfolk coast, and the driver pointed with his whip to two old brick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees. &quot;That&#x27;s Riding Thorpe Manor,&quot; said he. As we drove up to the porticoed front door, I observed in front of it, beside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the pedestalled sundial with which we had such strange associations. A dapper little man, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed moustache, had just descended from a high dog-cart. He introduced himself as Inspector Martin, of the Norfolk Constabulary, and he was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my companion. &quot;Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only committed at three this morning. How could you hear of it in London and get to the spot as soon as I?&quot; &quot;I anticipated it. I came in the hope of preventing it.&quot; &quot;Then you must have important evidence, of which we are ignorant, for they were said to be a most united couple.&quot; &quot;I have only the evidence of the dancing men,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I will explain the matter to you later. Meanwhile, since it is too late to prevent this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge which I possess in order to insure that justice be done. Will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act independently?&quot; &quot;I should be proud to feel that we were acting together, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said the inspector, earnestly. &quot;In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay.&quot; Inspector Martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things in his own fashion, and contented himself with carefully noting the results. The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had just come down from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt&#x27;s room, and he reported that her injuries were serious, but not necessarily fatal. The bullet had passed through the front of her brain, and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness. On the question of whether she had been shot or had shot herself, he would not venture to express any decided opinion. Certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters. There was only the one pistol found in the room, two barrels of which had been emptied. Mr. Hilton Cubitt had been shot through the heart. It was equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself, or that she had been the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them. &quot;Has he been moved?&quot; asked Holmes. &quot;We have moved nothing except the lady. We could not leave her lying wounded upon the floor.&quot; &quot;How long have you been here, Doctor?&quot; &quot;Since four o&#x27;clock.&quot; &quot;Anyone else?&quot; &quot;Yes, the constable here.&quot; &quot;And you have touched nothing?&quot; &quot;Nothing.&quot; &quot;You have acted with great discretion. Who sent for you?&quot; &quot;The housemaid, Saunders.&quot; &quot;Was it she who gave the alarm?&quot; &quot;She and Mrs. King, the cook.&quot; &quot;Where are they now?&quot; &quot;In the kitchen, I believe.&quot; &quot;Then I think we had better hear their story at once.&quot; The old hall, oak-panelled and high-windowed, had been turned into a court of investigation. Holmes sat in a great, old-fashioned chair, his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face. I could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he had failed to save should at last be avenged. The trim Inspector Martin, the old, gray-headed country doctor, myself, and a stolid village policeman made up the rest of that strange company. The two women told their story clearly enough. They had been aroused from their sleep by the sound of an explosion, which had been followed a minute later by a second one. They slept in adjoining rooms, and Mrs. King had rushed in to Saunders. Together they had descended the stairs. The door of the study was open, and a candle was burning upon the table. Their master lay upon his face in the centre of the room. He was quite dead. Near the window his wife was crouching, her head leaning against the wall. She was horribly wounded, and the side of her face was red with blood. She breathed heavily, but was incapable of saying anything. The passage, as well as the room, was full of smoke and the smell of powder. The window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside. Both women were positive upon the point. They had at once sent for the doctor and for the constable. Then, with the aid of the groom and the stable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room. Both she and her husband had occupied the bed. She was clad in her dress- he in his dressing-gown, over his night-clothes. Nothing had been moved in the study. So far as they knew, there had never been any quarrel between husband and wife. They had always looked upon them as a very united couple. These were the main points of the servants&#x27; evidence. In answer to Inspector Martin, they were clear that every door was fastened upon the inside, and that no one could have escaped from the house. In answer to Holmes, they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the top floor. &quot;I commend that fact very carefully to your attention,&quot; said Holmes to his professional colleague. &quot;And now I think that we are in a position to undertake a thorough examination of the room.&quot; The study proved to be a small chamber, lined on three sides with books, and with a writing-table facing an ordinary window, which looked out upon the garden. Our first attention was given to the body of the unfortunate squire, whose huge frame lay stretched across the room. His disordered dress showed that he had been hastily aroused from sleep. The bullet had been fired at him from the front, and had remained in his body, after penetrating the heart. His death had certainly been instantaneous and painless. There was no powder-marking either upon his dressing-gown or on his hands. According to the country surgeon, the lady had stains upon her face, but none upon her hand. &quot;The absence of the latter means nothing, though its presence may mean everything,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Unless the powder from a badly fitting cartridge happens to spurt backward, one may fire many shots without leaving a sign. I would suggest that Mr. Cubitt&#x27;s body may now be removed. I suppose, Doctor, you have not recovered the bullet which wounded the lady?&quot; &quot;A serious operation will be necessary before that can be done. But there are still four cartridges in the revolver. Two have been fired and two wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be accounted for.&quot; &quot;So it would seem,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?&quot; He had turned suddenly, and his long, thin finger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled right through the lower window-sash, about an inch above the bottom. &quot;By George!&quot; cried the inspector. &quot;How ever did you see that?&quot; &quot;Because I looked for it.&quot; &quot;Wonderful!&quot; said the country doctor. &quot;You are certainly right, sir. Then a third shot has been fired, and therefore a third person must have been present. But who could that have been, and how could he have got away?&quot; &quot;That is the problem which we are now about to solve,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes. &quot;You remember, Inspector Martin, when the servants said that on leaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder, I remarked that the point was an extremely important one?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir; but I confess I did not quite follow you.&quot; &quot;It suggested that at the time of the firing, the window as well as the door of the room had been open. Otherwise the fumes of powder could not have been blown so rapidly through the house. A draught in the room was necessary for that. Both door and window were only open for a very short time, however.&quot; &quot;How do you prove that?&quot; &quot;Because the candle was not guttered.&quot; &quot;Capital!&quot; cried the inspector. &quot;Capital! &quot;Feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy, I conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair, who stood outside this opening and fired through it. Any shot directed at this person might hit the sash. I looked, and there, sure enough, was the bullet mark!&quot; &quot;But how came the window to be shut and fastened?&quot; &quot;The woman&#x27;s first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window. But, halloa! What is this?&quot; It was a lady&#x27;s hand-bag which stood upon the study table- a trim little handbag of crocodile-skin and silver. Holmes opened it and turned the contents out. There were twenty fifty-pound notes of the Bank of England, held together by an india-rubber band- nothing else. &quot;This must be preserved, for it will figure in the trial&quot; said Holmes, as he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector. &quot;It is now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet, which has clearly, from the splintering of the wood, been fired from inside the room. I should like to see Mrs. King, the cook, again. You said, Mrs. King, that you were awakened by a loud explosion. When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?&quot; &quot;Well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, so it is hard to judge. But it did seem very loud.&quot; &quot;You don&#x27;t think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the same instant?&quot; &quot;I am sure I couldn&#x27;t say, sir.&quot; &quot;I believe that it was undoubtedly so. I rather think, Inspector Martin, that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us. If you will kindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer.&quot; A flower-bed extended up to the study window, and we all broke into an exclamation as we approached it. The flowers were trampled down, and the soft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks. Large, masculine feet they were, with peculiarly long, sharp toes. Holmes hunted about among the grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird. Then, with a cry of satisfaction, he bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylinder. &quot;I thought so,&quot; said he, &quot;the revolver had an ejector, and here is the third cartridge. I really think, Inspector Martin, that our case is almost complete.&quot; The country inspector&#x27;s face had shown his intense amazement at the rapid and masterful progress of Holmes&#x27;s investigation. At first he had shown some disposition to assert his own position, but now he was overcome with admiration, and ready to follow without question wherever Holmes led. &quot;Whom do you suspect?&quot; he asked. &quot;I&#x27;ll go into that later. There are several points in this problem which I have not been able to explain to you yet. Now that I have got so far, I had best proceed on my own lines, and then clear the whole matter up once and for all.&quot; &quot;Just as you wish, Mr. Holmes, so long as we get our man.&quot; &quot;I have no desire to make mysteries, but it is impossible at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations. I have the threads of this affair all in my hand. Even if this lady should never recover consciousness, we can still reconstruct the events of last night and insure that justice be done. First of all, I wish to know whether there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as `Elrige&#x27;s&#x27;?&quot; The servants were cross-questioned, but none of them had heard of such a place. The stable-boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that a farmer of that name lived some miles off, in the direction of East Ruston. &quot;Is it a lonely farm?&quot; &quot;Very lonely, sir.&quot; &quot;Perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the night?&quot; &quot;Maybe not, sir.&quot; Holmes thought for a little, and then a curious smile played over his face. &quot;Saddle a horse, my lad,&quot; said he. &quot;I shall wish you to take a note to Elrige&#x27;s Farm.&quot; He took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men. With these in front of him, he worked for some time at the study-table. Finally he handed a note to the boy, with directions to put it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed, and especially to answer no questions of any sort which might be put to him. I saw the outside of the note, addressed in straggling, irregular characters, very unlike Holmes&#x27;s usual precise hand. It was consigned to Mr. Abe Slaney, Elriges Farm, East Ruston, Norfolk. &quot;I think, Inspector,&quot; Holmes remarked, &quot;that you would do well to telegraph for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be correct, you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county jail. The boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram. If there is an afternoon train to town, Watson, I think we should do well to take it, as I have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish, and this investigation draws rapidly to a close.&quot; When the youth had been dispatched with the note, Sherlock Holmes gave his instructions to the servants. If any visitor were to call asking for Mrs. Hilton Cubitt, no information should be given as to her condition, but he was to be shown at once into the drawing-room. He impressed these points upon them with the utmost earnestness. Finally he led the way into the drawing-room, with the remark that the business was now out of our hands, and that we must while away the time as best we might until we could see what was in store for us. The doctor had departed to his patients, and only the inspector and myself remained. &quot;I think that I can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and profitable manner,&quot; said Holmes, drawing his chair up to the table, and spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were recorded the antics of the dancing men. &quot;As to you, friend Watson, I owe you every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied. To you, Inspector, the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable professional study. I must tell you, first of all, the interesting circumstances connected with the previous consultations which Mr. Hilton Cubitt has had with me in Baker Street.&quot; He then shortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded. &quot;I have here in front of me these singular productions, at which one might smile, had they not proved themselves to be the forerunners of so terrible a tragedy. I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writings, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers, but I confess that this is entirely new to me. The object of those who invented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters convey a message, and to give the idea that they are the mere random sketches of children. &quot;Having once recognized, however, that the symbols stood for letters, and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret writings, the solution was easy enough. The first message submitted to me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say, with some confidence, that the symbol [of the stickman with both arms extended up in the air] stood for E. As you are aware, E is the most common letter in the English alphabet, and it predominates to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most often. Out of fifteen symbols in the first message, four were the same, so it was reasonable to set this down as E. It is true that in some cases the figure was bearing a flag, and in some cases not but it was probable, from the way in which the flags were distributed, that they were used to break the sentence up into words. I accepted this as a hypothesis, and noted that E was represented by [the stickman with both arms extended up in the air] &quot;But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. The order of the English letters after E is by no means well marked, and any preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be reversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur, but T, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other, and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at I therefore waited for fresh material. In my second interview with Mr. Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one message, which appeared- since there was no flag- to be a single word. Here are the symbols. Now, in the single word I have already got the two E&#x27;s coming second and fourth in a word of five letters. It might be `sever,&#x27; or `lever,&#x27; or `never.&#x27; There can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady. Accepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols [of the stickman with right hand on his hip, left arm raised and knees bent, stickman with leg extended to the left, and stickman with both arms raised in the air and left leg extended.] stand respectively for N, V, and R. &quot;Even now I was in considerable difficulty, but a happy thought put me in possession of several other letters. It occurred to me that if these appeals came, as I expected, from someone who had been intimate with the lady in her early life, a combination which contained two E&#x27;s with three letters between might very well stand for the name `ELSIE.&#x27; On examination I found that such a combination formed the termination of the message which was three times repeated. It was certainly some appeal to `Elsie.&#x27; In this way I had got my L, S, and I. But what appeal could it be? There were only four letters in the word which preceded `Elsie,&#x27; and it ended in E. Surely the word must be `COME.&#x27; I tried all other four letters ending in E, but could find none to fit the case. So now I was in possession of C, O, and M, and I was in a position to attack the first message once more, dividing it into words and putting dots for each symbol which was still unknown. So treated, it worked out in this fashion: . M . ERE .. E SL . NE. &quot;Now the first letter can only be A, which is a most useful discovery, since it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence, and the H is also apparent in the second word. Now it becomes: AM HERE A . E SLANE. Or, filling in the obvious vacancies in the name: AM HERE ABE SLANEY. I had so many letters now that I could proceed with considerable confidence to the second message, which worked out in this fashion: A . ELRI . ES. Here I could only make sense by putting T and G for the missing letters, and supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the writer was staying.&quot; Inspector Martin and I had listened with the utmost interest to the full and clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to so complete a command over our difficulties. &quot;What did you do then, sir?&quot; asked the inspector. &quot;I had every reason to suppose that this Abe Slaney was an American, since Abe is an American contraction, and since a letter from America had been the starting-point of all the trouble. I had also every cause to think that there was some criminal secret in the matter. The lady&#x27;s allusions to her past, and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence, both pointed in that direction. I therefore cabled to my friend, Wilson Hargreave, of the New York Police Bureau, who has more than once made use of my knowledge of London crime. I asked him whether the name of Abe Slaney was known to him. Here is his reply: `The most dangerous crook in Chicago.&#x27; On the very evening upon which I had his answer, Hilton Cubitt sent me the last message from Slaney. Working with known letters, it took this form: ELSIE . RE . ARE TO MEET THY GO. The addition of a P and a D completed a message which showed me that the rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats, and my knowledge of the crooks of Chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly put his words into action. I at once came to Norfolk with my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, but, unhappily, only in time to find that the worst had already occurred.&quot; &quot;It is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case,&quot; said the inspector, warmly. &quot;You will excuse me, however, if I speak frankly to you. You are only answerable to yourself, but I have to answer to my superiors. If this Abe Slaney, living at Elrige&#x27;s, is indeed the murderer, and if he has made his escape while I am seated here, I should certainly get into serious trouble.&quot; &quot;You need not be uneasy. He will not try to escape.&quot; &quot;How do you know?&quot; &quot;To fly would be a confession of guilt.&quot; &quot;Then let us go arrest him.&quot; &quot;I expect him here every instant.&quot; &quot;But why should he come.&quot; &quot;Because I have written and asked him.&quot; &quot;But this is incredible, Mr. Holmes! Why should he come because you have asked him? Would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and cause him to fly?&quot; &quot;I think I have known how to frame the letter,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes. &quot;In fact, if I am not very much mistaken, here is the gentleman himself coming up the drive.&quot; A man striding up the path which led to the door. He was a tall, handsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of flannel, with a Panama hat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive hooked nose, and flourishing a cane as he walked. He swaggered up a path as if as if the place belonged to him, and we heard his loud, confident peal at the bell. &quot;I think, gentlemen,&quot; said Holmes, quietly, &quot;that we had best take up our position behind the door. Every precaution is necessary when dealing with such a fellow. You will need your handcuffs, Inspector. You can leave the talking to me.&quot; We waited in silence for a minute- one of those minutes which one can never forget. Then the door opened and the man stepped in. In an instant Holmes clapped a pistol to his head, and Martin slipped the handcuffs over his wrists. It was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow was helpless before he knew that he was attacked. He glared from one to the other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a bitter laugh. &quot;Well, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this time. I seem to have knocked up against something hard. But I came here in answer to a letter from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt. Don&#x27;t tell me that she is in this? Don&#x27;t tell me that she helped to set a trap for me?&quot; &quot;Mrs. Hilton Cubitt was seriously injured, and is at death&#x27;s door.&quot; The man gave a hoarse cry of grief, which rang through the house. &quot;You&#x27;re crazy!&quot; he cried, fiercely. &quot;It was he that was hurt, not she. Who would have hurt little Elsie? I may have threatened her- God forgive me!- but I would not have touched a hair of her pretty head. Take it back- you! Say that she is not hurt!&quot; &quot;She was found badly wounded, by the side of her dead husband.&quot; He sank with a deep groan on the settee and buried his face in his manacled hands. For five minutes he was silent. Then he raised his face once more, and spoke with the cold composure of despair. &quot;I have nothing to hide from you, gentlemen,&quot; said he. &quot;If I shot the man he had his shot at me, and there&#x27;s no murder in that. But if you think I could have hurt that woman, then you don&#x27;t know either me or her. I tell you, there was never a man in this world loved a woman more than I loved her. I had a right to her. She was pledged to me years ago. Who was this Englishman that he should come between us? I tell you that I had the first right to her, and that I was only claiming my own. &quot;She broke away from your influence when she found the man that you are,&quot; said Holmes, sternly. &quot;She fled from America to avoid you, and she married an honourable gentleman in England. You dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her, in order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you, whom she feared and hated. You have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and driving his wife to suicide. That is your record in this business, Mr. Abe Slaney, and you will answer for it to the law.&quot; &quot;If Elsie dies, I care nothing what becomes of me,&quot; said the American. He opened one of his hands, and looked at a note crumpled up in his palm. &quot;See here, mister! he cried, with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes, &quot;you&#x27;re not trying to scare me over this, are you? If the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?&quot; He tossed it forward on to the table. &quot;I wrote it, to bring you here.&quot; &quot;You wrote it? There was no one on earth outside the Joint who knew the secret of the dancing men. How came you to write it?&quot; &quot;What one man can invent another can discover,&quot; said Holmes. There is a cab coming to convey you to Norwich, Mr. Slaney. But meanwhile, you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought. Are you aware that Mrs. Hilton Cubitt has herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband, and that it was only my presence here, and the knowledge which I happened to possess, which has saved her from the accusation? The least that you owe her is to make it clear to the whole world that she was in no way, directly or indirectly, responsible for his tragic end.&quot; &quot;I ask nothing better,&quot; said the American. &quot;I guess the very best case I can make for myself is the absolute naked truth.&quot; &quot;It is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you,&quot; cried the inspector, with the magnificent fair play of the British criminal law. Slaney shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I&#x27;ll chance that,&quot; said he. &quot;First of all, I want you gentlemen to understand that I have known this lady since she was a child. There were seven of us in a gang in Chicago, and Elsie&#x27;s father was the boss of the Joint. He was a clever man, was old Patrick. It was he who invented that writing, which would pass as a child&#x27;s scrawl unless you just happened to have the key to it. Well, Elsie learned some of our ways, but she couldn&#x27;t stand the business, and she had a bit of honest money of her own, so she gave us all the slip and got away to London. She had been engaged to me, and she would have married me, I believe, if I had taken over another profession, but she would have nothing to do with anything on the cross. It was only after her marriage to this Englishman that I was able to find out where she was. I wrote to her, but got no answer. After that I came over, and, as letters were no use, I put my messages where she could read them. &quot;Well, I have been here a month now. I lived in that farm, where I had a room down below, and could get in and out every night, and no one the wiser. I tried all I could to coax Elsie away. I knew that she read the messages, for once she wrote an answer under one of them. Then my temper got the better of me, and I began to threaten her. She sent me a letter then, imploring me to go away, and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband. She said that she would come down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning, and speak with me through the end window, if I would go away afterwards and leave her in peace. She came down and brought money with her, trying to bribe me to go. This made me mad, and I caught her arm and tried to pull her through the window. At that moment in rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand. Elsie had sunk down upon the floor, and we were face to face. I was heeled also, and I held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away. He fired and missed me. I pulled off almost at the same instant, and down he dropped. I made away across the garden, and as I went I heard the window shut behind me. That&#x27;s God&#x27;s truth, gentlemen, every word of it, and I heard no more about it until that lad came riding up with a note which made me walk in here, like a jay, and give myself into your hands.&quot; A cab had driven up whilst the American had been talking. Two uniformed policemen sat inside. Inspector Martin rose and touched his prisoner on the shoulder. &quot;It is time for us to go.&quot; &quot;Can I see her first?&quot; &quot;No, she is not conscious. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I only hope that if ever again I have an important case, I shall have the good fortune to have you by my side.&quot; We stood at the window and watched the cab drive away. As I turned back, my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the table. It was the note with which Holmes had decoyed him. &quot;See if you can read it, Watson,&quot; said he, with a smile. It contained no word, but this little line of dancing men: (See illustration.) &quot;If you use the code which I have explained,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;you will find that it simply means `Come here at once.&#x27; I was convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady. And so, my dear Watson, we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of evil, and I think that I have fulfilled my promise of giving you something unusual for your notebook. Three-forty is our train, and I fancy we should be back in Baker Street for dinner.&quot; Only one word of epilogue. The American, Abe Slaney, was condemned to death at the winter assizes at Norwich, but his penalty was changed to penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances, and the certainty that Hilton Cubitt had fired the first shot. Of Mrs. Hilton Cubitt I only know that I have heard she recovered entirely, and that she still, remains a widow, devoting her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband&#x27;s estate. -THE END- . 1910 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL&#x27;S FOOT by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle In recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and interesting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by difficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity. To his sombre and cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and nothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand over the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with a mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation. It was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not any lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to lay very few of my records before the public. My participation in some of his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and reticence upon me. It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram from Holmes last Tuesday- he has never been known to write where a telegram would serve- in the following terms: Why not tell them of the Cornish horror-strangest case I have handled. I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers. It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes&#x27;s iron constitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional indiscretions of his own. In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of Harley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day recount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay aside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished to avert an absolute breakdown. The state of his health was not a matter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental detachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of being permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete change of scene and air. Thus it was that in the early spring of that year we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at the further extremity of the Cornish peninsula. It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim humour of my patient. From the windows of our little whitewashed house, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the whole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing vessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge swept reefs on which innumerable seamen have met their end. With a northerly breeze it lies placid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tick into it for rest and protection. Then come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blustering gale from the south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle in the creaming breakers. The wise mariner stands far out from that evil place. On the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was a country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-coloured, with an occasional church tower to mark the site of some old-world village. In every direction upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race which had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange monuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes of the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife. The glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of forgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he spent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the moor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and he had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the Chaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in tin. He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was settling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to his unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams, plunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more engrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had driven us from London. Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine were violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of a series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in Cornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers may retain some recollection of what was called at the time &quot;The Cornish Horror,&quot; though a most imperfect account of the matter reached the London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true details of this inconceivable affair to the public. I have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this part of Cornwall. The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown church. The vicar of the parish, Mr. Roundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had made his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a considerable fund of local lore. At his invitation we had taken tea at the vicarage and had come to know also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, an independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman&#x27;s scanty resources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house. The vicar, being a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he had little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled man, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical deformity. I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar garrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs. These were the two men who entered abruptly into our little sitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast hour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion upon the moors. &quot;Mr. Holmes,&quot; said the vicar in an agitated voice, &quot;the most extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is the most unheard-of business. We can only regard it as a special providence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all England you are the one man we need.&quot; I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes took his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound who hears the view-halloa. He waved his hand to the sofa, and our palpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon it. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman, but the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes showed that they shared a common emotion. &quot;Shall I speak or you?&quot; he asked of the vicar. &quot;Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and the vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the speaking,&quot; said Holmes. I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed lodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes&#x27;s simple deduction had brought to their faces. &quot;Perhaps I had best say a few words first,&quot; said the vicar, &quot;and then you can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or whether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious affair. I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening in the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister Brenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old stone cross upon the moor. He left them shortly after ten o&#x27;clock, playing cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and spirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that direction before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr. Richards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent call to Tredannick Wartha. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with him. When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary state of things. His two brothers and his sister were seated round the table exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of them and the candles burned down to their sockets. The sister lay back stone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her laughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them. All three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained upon their faces an expression of the utmost horror- a convulsion of terror which was dreadful to look upon. There was no sign of the presence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and housekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound during the night. Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is absolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has frightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses. There is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help us to clear it up you will have done a great work.&quot; I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the quiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his intense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the expectation. He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the strange drama which had broken in upon our peace. &quot;I will look into this matter,&quot; he said at last. &quot;On the face of it, it would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you been there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?&quot; &quot;No, Mr. Holmes. Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the vicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.&quot; &quot;How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?&quot; &quot;About a mile inland.&quot; &quot;Then we shall walk over together. But before we start I must ask you a few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.&quot; The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his more controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion of the clergyman. He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze fixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together. His pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which had befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something of the horror of the scene. &quot;Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he eagerly. &quot;It is a bad thing to speak of, but I will answer you the truth.&quot; &quot;Tell me about last night.&quot; &quot;Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards. We sat down about nine o&#x27;clock. It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go. I left them all round the table, as merry as could be.&quot; &quot;Who let you out?&quot; &quot;Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let himself out. I shut the hall door behind me. The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the blind was not drawn down. There was no change in door or window this morning, nor any reason to think that any stranger had been to the house. Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair. I&#x27;ll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as I live.&quot; &quot;The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!&quot; cried Mortimer Tregennis. &quot;It is not of this world. Something has come into that room which has dashed the light of reason from their minds. What human contrivance could do that?&quot; &quot;I fear,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me. Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this. As to yourself, Mr. Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family, since they lived together and you had rooms apart?&quot; &quot;That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We were a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold out our venture to a company, and so retired with enough to keep us. I won&#x27;t deny that there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we were the best of friends together.&quot; &quot;Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy? Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help me.&quot; &quot;There is nothing at all, sir.&quot; &quot;Your people were in their usual spirits?&quot; &quot;Never better.&quot; &quot;Were they nervous people? Did they ever show any apprehension of coming danger?&quot; &quot;Nothing of the kind.&quot; &quot;You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?&quot; Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment. &quot;There is one thing occurs to me,&quot; said he at last. &quot;As we sat at the table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my partner at cards, was facing it. I saw him once look hard over my shoulder, so I turned round and looked also. The blind was up and the window shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it seemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them. I couldn&#x27;t even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was something there. When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me that he had the same feeling. That is all that I can say.&quot; &quot;Did you not investigate?&quot; &quot;No; the matter passed as unimportant.&quot; &quot;You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?&quot; &quot;None at all.&quot; &quot;I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.&quot; &quot;I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me. He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent message. I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we looked into that dreadful room. The candles and the fire must have burned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark until dawn had broken. The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at least six hours. There were no signs of violence. She just lay across the arm of the chair with that look on her face. George and Owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes. Oh, it was awful to see! I couldn&#x27;t stand it, and the doctor was as white as a sheet. Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we nearly had him on our hands as well.&quot; &quot;Remarkable- most remarkable!&quot; said Holmes, rising and taking his hat. &quot;I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without further delay. I confess that I have seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem.&quot; Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the investigation. It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane, While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass. As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision. &quot;My brothers!&quot; cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. &quot;They are taking them to Helston.&quot; We looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way. Then we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they had met their strange fate. It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with a considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well filled with spring flowers. Towards this garden the window of the sitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single instant blasted their minds. Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully among the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch. So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the garden path. Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish housekeeper, Mrs, Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked after the wants of the family. She readily answered all Holmes&#x27;s questions. She had heard nothing in the night. Her employers had all been in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous. She had fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table. She had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning air in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for the doctor. The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her. It took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage. She would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting that very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives. We ascended the stairs and viewed the body. Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age. Her dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still lingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been her last human emotion. From her bedroom we descended to the sitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred. The charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate. On the table were the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered over its surface. The chairs had been moved back against the walls, but all else was as it had been the night before. Holmes paced with light, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs, drawing them up and reconstructing their positions. He tested how much of the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the fireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some gleam of light in this utter darkness. &quot;Why a fire?&quot; he asked once. &quot;Had they always a fire in this small room on a spring evening?&quot; Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit. &quot;What are you going to do now, Mr. Holmes?&quot; he asked. My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm. &quot;I think, Watson, that I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often and so justly condemned,&quot; said he. &quot;With your permission, gentlemen, we will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor is likely to come to our notice here. I will turn the facts over in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly communicate with you and the vicar. In the meantime I wish you both good-morning.&quot; It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes broke his complete and absorbed silence. He sat coiled in his armchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his eyes vacant and far away. Finally he laid down his pipe and sprang to his feet. &quot;It won&#x27;t do, Watson!&quot; said he with a laugh. &quot;Let us walk along the cliffs together and search for flint arrows. We are more likely to find them than clues to this problem. To let the brain work without sufficient material is like racing an engine. It racks itself to pieces. The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson- all else will come. &quot;Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,&quot; he continued as we skirted the cliffs together. &quot;Let us get a firm grip of the very little which we do know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready to fit them into their places. I take it, in the first place, that neither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of men. Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds. Very good. There remain three persons who have been grievously stricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency. That is firm ground. Now, where did this occur? Evidently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left the room. That is a very important point. The presumption is that it was within a few minutes afterwards. The cards still lay upon the table. It was already past their usual hour for bed. Yet they had not changed their position or pushed back their chairs. I repeat, then, that the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later than eleven o&#x27;clock last night. &quot;Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of Mortimer Tregennis after he left the room. In this there is no difficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as you do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot expedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might otherwise have been possible. The wet, sandy path took it admirably. Last night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not difficult- having obtained a sample print- to pick out his track among others and to follow his movements. He appears to have walked away swiftly in the direction of the vicarage. &quot;If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some outside person affected the cardplayers, how can we reconstruct that person, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed? Mrs. Porter may be eliminated. She is evidently harmless. Is there any evidence that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their senses? The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement in the garden. That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy, cloudy, and dark. Anyone who had the design to alarm these people would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could be seen. There is a three-foot flower-border outside this window, but no indication of a footmark. It is difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt. You perceive our difficulties, Watson?&quot; &quot;They are only too clear,&quot; I answered with conviction. &quot;And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not insurmountable,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I fancy that among your extensive archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure. Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are available, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of neolithic man.&quot; I may have commented upon my friend&#x27;s power of mental detachment, but never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in Cornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and shards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his solution. It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand. Neither of us needed to be told who that visitor was. The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the fierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our cottage ceiling, the beard- golden at the fringes and white near the lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar- all these were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be associated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the great lion-hunter and explorer. We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him, as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance. Here, amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life, attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours. It was a surprise to me, therefore, to hear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode. &quot;The county police are utterly at fault,&quot; said he, &quot;but perhaps your wider experience has suggested some conceivable explanation. My only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well- indeed, upon my Cornish mother&#x27;s side I could call them cousins- and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me. I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the inquiry.&quot; Holmes raised his eyebrows. &quot;Did you lose your boat through it?&quot; &quot;I will take the next.&quot; &quot;Dear me! that is friendship indeed.&quot; &quot;I tell you they were relatives.&quot; &quot;Quite so- cousins of your mother. Was your baggage aboard the ship?&quot; &quot;Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.&quot; &quot;I see. But surely this event could not have found its way into the Plymouth morning papers.&quot; &quot;No, sir; I had a telegram.&quot; &quot;Might I ask from whom?&quot; A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer. &quot;You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.&quot; &quot;It is my business.&quot; With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure. &quot;I have no objection to telling you,&quot; he said. &quot;It was Mr. Roundhay, the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.&quot; &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I may say in answer to your original question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion. It would be premature to say more.&quot; &quot;Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any particular direction?&quot; &quot;No, I can hardly answer that.&quot; &quot;Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.&quot; The famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within five minutes Holmes had followed him. I saw him no more until the evening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which assured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation. He glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate. &quot;From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,&quot; he said. &quot;I learned the name of it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale&#x27;s account was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last night there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation. What do you make of that, Watson?&quot; &quot;He is deeply interested.&quot; &quot;Deeply interested- yes. There is a thread where which we have not yet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle. Cheer up, Watson, for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand. When it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.&quot; Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up an entirely fresh line of investigation. I was shaving at my window in the morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a dog-cart coming at a gallop down the road. It pulled up at our door, and our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden path. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him. Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him. &quot;We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes! My poor parish is devil-ridden!&quot; he cried. &quot;Satan himself is loose in it! We are given over into his hands!&quot; He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it were not for his ashy face and startled eyes. Finally he shot out his terrible news. &quot;Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the same symptoms as the rest of his family.&quot; Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant. &quot;Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?&quot; &quot;Yes, I can.&quot; &quot;Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast. Mr. Roundhay, we are entirely at your disposal. Hurry- hurry, before things get disarranged.&quot; The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle by themselves, the one above the other. Below was a large sitting-room; above, his bedroom. They looked out upon a croquet lawn which came up to the windows. We had arrived before the doctor or the police, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed. Let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning. It left an impression which can never be effaced from my mind. The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness. The servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would have been even more intolerable. This might partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table. Beside it sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face turned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of terror which had marked the features of his dead sister. His limbs were convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very paroxysm of fear. He was fully clothed, though there were signs that his dressing had been done in a hurry. We had already learned that his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the early morning. One realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes&#x27;s phlegmatic exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the moment that he entered the fatal apartment. In an instant he was tense and alert, his eves shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with eager activity. He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round the room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a cover. In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around and ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some fresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud ejaculations of interest and delight. Then he rushed down the stairs, out through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn, sprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry. The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain measurements upon its bowl. He carefully scrutinized with his lens the tale shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some ashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an envelope, which he placed in his pocketbook. Finally, just as the doctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn. &quot;I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police, but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom window and to the sitting-room lamp. Each is suggestive, and together they are almost conclusive. If the police would desire further information I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage. And now, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed elsewhere.&quot; It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation; but it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two days. During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and dreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which he undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to where he had been. One experiment served to show me the line of his investigation. He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one which had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of the tragedy. This he filled with the same oil as that used at the vicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be exhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant nature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget. &quot;You will remember, Watson,&quot; he remarked one afternoon, &quot;that there is a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have reached us. This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in each case upon those who had first entered it. You will recollect that Mortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his brother&#x27;s house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair? You had forgotten? Well, I can answer for it that it was so. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards opened the window. In the second case- that of Mortimer Tregennis himself- you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window. That servant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed. You will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive. In each case there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere. In each case, also, there is combustion going on in the room- in the one case a fire, in the other a lamp. The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit- as a comparison of the oil consumed will show- long after it was broad daylight. Why? Surely because there is some connection between three things- the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of those unfortunate people. That is clear, is it not?&quot; &quot;It would appear so.&quot; &quot;At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis. We will suppose, then, that something was burned in each case which produced an atmosphere causing strange toxic effects. Very good. In the first instance- that of the Tregennis family- this substance was placed in the fire. Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry fumes to some extent up the chimney. Hence one would expect the effects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there was less escape for the vapour. The result seems to indicate that it was so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the more sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that temporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug. In the second case the result was complete. The facts, therefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion. &quot;With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in Mortimer Tregennis&#x27;s room to find some remains of this substance. The obvious place to look was the talc shield or smoke-guard of the lamp. There, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed. Half of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.&quot; &quot;Why half, Holmes?&quot; &quot;It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official police force. I leave them all the evidence which I found. The poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it. Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open our window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of society, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an armchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to do with the affair. Oh, you will see it out, will you? I thought I knew my Watson. This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may be the same distance from the poison and face to face. The door we will leave ajar. Each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming. Is that all clear? Well, then, I take our powder- or what remains of it- from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp. So! Now, Watson, let us sit down and await developments.&quot; They were not long in coming. I had hardly settled in my chair before I was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous. At the very first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all control. A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told me that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my appalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was monstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe. Vague shapes swirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning of something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul. A freezing horror took possession of me. I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes were protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather. The turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap. I tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was my own voice, but distant and detached from myself. At the same moment, in some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had a glimpse of Holmes&#x27;s face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror- the very look which I had seen upon the features of the dead. It was that vision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength. I dashed from my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched through the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the glorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the mists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with apprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific experience which we had undergone. &quot;Upon my word, Watson!&quot; said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, &quot;I owe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable experiment even for one&#x27;s self, and doubly so for a friend. I am really very sorry.&quot; &quot;You know,&quot; I answered with some emotion, for I had never seen so much of Holmes&#x27;s heart before, &quot;that it is my greatest joy and privilege to help you.&quot; He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was his habitual attitude to those about him. &quot;It would be superfluous to drive us mad, my dear Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;A candid observer would certainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so wild an experiment. I confess that I never imagined that the effect could be so sudden and so severe.&quot; He dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm&#x27;s length, he threw it among a bank of brambles. &quot;We must give the room a little time to clear. I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how these tragedies were produced?&quot; &quot;None whatever.&quot; &quot;But the cause remains as obscure as before. Come into the arbour here and let us discuss it together. That villainous stuff seems still to linger round my throat. I think we must admit that all the evidence points to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the first tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one. We must remember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family quarrel, followed by a reconciliation. How bitter that quarrel may have been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell. When I think of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd, beady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge to be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place, you will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which took our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy, emanated from him. He had a motive in misleading us. Finally, if he did not throw this substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room, who did do so? The affair happened immediately after his departure. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have risen from the table. Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors do not arrive after ten o&#x27;clock at night. We may take it then, that all the evidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.&quot; &quot;Then his own death was suicide!&quot; &quot;Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition. The man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate upon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon himself. There are, however, some cogent reasons against it. Fortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I have made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time. Perhaps you would kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducting a chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit for the reception of so distinguished a visitor.&quot; I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure of the great African explorer appeared upon the path. He turned in some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat. &quot;You sent for me, Mr. Holmes. I had your note about an hour ago, and I have come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.&quot; &quot;Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence. You will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend Watson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the papers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for the present. Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we should talk where there can be no eavesdropping.&quot; The explorer to his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my companion. &quot;I am at a loss to know, sir,&quot; he said, &quot;what you can have to speak about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.&quot; &quot;The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,&quot; said Holmes. For a moment I wished that I were armed. Sterndale&#x27;s fierce face turned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with clenched hands towards my companion. Then he stopped, and with a violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst. &quot;I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,&quot; said he, &quot;that I have got into the way of being a law to myself. You would do well, Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.&quot; &quot;Nor have I any desire to do you an injury Dr. Sterndale. Surely the clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you and not for the police.&quot; Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time in his adventurous life. There was a calm assurance of power in Holmes&#x27;s manner which could not be withstood. Our visitor stammered for a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked at last. &quot;If this is bluff upon your part, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us have no more beating about the bush. What do you mean?&quot; &quot;I will tell you,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;and the reason why I tell you is that I hope frankness may beget frankness. What the next step may be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.&quot; &quot;My defence?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;My defence against what?&quot; &quot;Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.&quot; Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. &quot;Upon my word, you are getting on,&quot; said he. &quot;Do all your successes depend upon this prodigious power of bluff?&quot; &quot;The bluff,&quot; said Holmes sternly, &quot;is upon your side, Dr. Leon Sterndale, and not upon mine. As a proof I will tell you some of the facts upon which my conclusions are based. Of your return from Plymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say nothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors which had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama-&quot; &quot;I came back-&quot; &quot;I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and inadequate. We will pass that. You came down here to ask me whom I suspected. I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage, waited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.&quot; &quot;How do you know that?&quot; &quot;I followed you.&quot; &quot;I saw no one.&quot; &quot;That is what you may expect to see when I follow you. You spent a restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your door just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.&quot; Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement. &quot;You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the vicarage. You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet. At the vicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out under the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the household was not yet stirring. You drew some of the gravel from your pocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.&quot; Sterndale sprang to his feet. &quot;I believe that you are the devil himself!&quot; he cried. Holmes smiled at the compliment. &quot;It took two, or possibly three, handfuls before the lodger came to the window. You beckoned him to come down. He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room. You entered by the window. There was an interview- a short one- during which you walked up and down the room. Then you passed out and closed the window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as you had come. Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and what are the motives for your actions? If you prevaricate or trifle with me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my hands forever.&quot; Our visitor&#x27;s face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the words of his accuser. Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in his hands. Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table before us. &quot;That is why I have done it,&quot; said he. It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman. Holmes stooped over it. &quot;Brenda Tregennis,&quot; said he. &quot;Yes, Brenda Tregennis,&quot; repeated our visitor. &quot;For years I have loved her. For years she has loved me. There is the secret of that Cornish seclusion which people have marvelled at. It has brought me close to the one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for I have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable laws of England, I could not divorce. For years Brenda waited. For years I waited. And this is what we have waited for.&quot; A terrible sob shook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled beard. Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on: &quot;The vicar knew. He was in our confidence. He would tell you that she was an angel upon earth. That was why he telegraphed to me and I returned. What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such a fate had come upon my darling? There you have the missing clue to my action, Mr. Holmes.&quot; &quot;Proceed,&quot; said my friend. Dr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the table. On the outside was written &quot;Radix pedis diaboli&quot; with a red poison label beneath it. He pushed it towards me. &quot;I understand that you are a doctor, sir. Have you ever heard of this preparation?&quot; &quot;Devil&#x27;s-foot root! No, I have never heard of it.&quot; &quot;It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,&quot; said he, &quot;for I believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no other specimen in Europe. It has not yet found its way either into the pharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology. The root is shaped like a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given by a botanical missionary. It is used as an ordeal poison by the medicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a secret among them. This particular specimen I obtained under very extraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.&quot; He opened the paper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like powder. &quot;Well, sir?&quot; asked Holmes sternly. &quot;I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for you already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you should know all. I have already explained the relationship in which I stood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was friendly with the brothers. There was a family quarrel about money which estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up, and I afterwards met him as I did the others. He was a sly, subtle, scheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of him, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel. &quot;One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I showed him some of my African curiosities. Among other things I exhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it stimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and how either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is subjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe. I told him also how powerless European science would be to detect it. How he took it I cannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he managed to abstract some of the devil&#x27;s-foot root. I well remember how he plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was needed for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a personal reason for asking. &quot;I thought no more of the matter until the vicar&#x27;s telegram reached me at Plymouth. This villain had thought that I would be at sea before the news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa. But I returned at once. Of course, I could not listen to the details without feeling assured that my poison had been used. I came round to see you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself to you. But there could be none. I was convinced that Mortimer Tregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the idea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane he would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the devil&#x27;s-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses, and killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever loved or who has ever loved me. There was his crime; what was to be his punishment? &quot;Should I appeal to the law? Where were my proofs? I knew that the facts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe so fantastic a story? I might or I might not. But I could not afford to fail. My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once before, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law, and that I have come at last to be a law to myself. So it was now. I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be shared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my own hand. In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon his own life than I do at the present moment. &quot;Now I have told you all. You have yourself supplied the rest. I did, as you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage. I foresaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from the pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his window. He came down and admitted me through the window of the sitting-room. I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had come both as judge and executioner. The wretch sank into a chair, paralyzed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder above it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to shoot him should he try to leave the room. In five minutes he died. My God! how he died! But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing which my innocent darling had not felt before him. There is my story, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much yourself. At any rate, I am in your hands. You can take what steps you like. As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear death less than I do.&quot; Holmes sat for some little time in silence. &quot;What were your plans?&quot; he asked at last. &quot;I had intended to bury myself in central Africa. My work there is but half finished.&quot; &quot;Go and do the other half,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I at least, am not prepared to prevent you.&quot; Dr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from the arbour. Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch. &quot;Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,&quot; said he. &quot;I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we are called upon to interfere. Our investigation has been independent, and our action shall be so also. You would not denounce the man?&quot; &quot;Certainly not,&quot; I answered. &quot;I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had met such an end, I might have done as our lawless lion-hunter has done. Who knows? Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by explaining what is obvious. The gravel upon the window sill was, of course, the starting-point of my research. It was unlike anything in the vicarage garden. Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr. Sterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart. The lamp shining in broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were successive links in a fairly obvious chain. And now, my dear Watson, I think we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear conscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be traced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.&quot; -THE END- . 1913 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering woman. Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made him the very worst tenant in London. On the other hand, his payments were princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I was with him. The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem. She was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was her regard for him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to which my poor friend was reduced. &quot;He&#x27;s dying, Dr. Watson,&quot; said she. &quot;For three days he has been sinking, and I doubt if he will last the day. He would not let me get a doctor. This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face and his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it. &#x27;With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very hour,&#x27; said I. &#x27;Let it be Watson, then,&#x27; said he. I wouldn&#x27;t waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive.&quot; I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness. I need not say that I rushed for my coat and my hat. As we drove back I asked for the details. &quot;There is little I can tell you, sir. He has been working at a case down at Rotherhithe, in an alley near the river, and he has brought this illness back with him. He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon and has never moved since. For these three days neither food nor drink has passed his lips.&quot; &quot;Good God! Why did you not call in a doctor?&quot; &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t have it, sir. You know how masterful he is. I didn&#x27;t dare to disobey him. But he&#x27;s not long for this world, as you&#x27;ll see for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him.&quot; He was indeed a deplorable spectacle. In the dim light of a foggy November day the sick room was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt, wasted face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill to my heart. His eyes had the brightness of fever, there was a hectic flush upon either cheek, and dark crusts clung to his lips; the thin hands upon the coverlet twitched incessantly, his voice was croaking and spasmodic. He lay listlessly as I entered the room, but the sight of me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes. &quot;Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days,&quot; said he in a feeble voice, but with something of his old carelessness of manner. &quot;My dear fellow!&quot; I cried, approaching him. &quot;Stand back! Stand right back!&quot; said he with the sharp imperiousness which I had associated only with moments of crisis. &quot;If you approach me, Watson, I shall order you out of the house.&quot; &quot;But why?&quot; &quot;Because it is my desire. Is that not enough?&quot; Yes, Mrs. Hudson was right. He was more masterful than ever. It was pitiful, however, to see his exhaustion. &quot;I only wished to help,&quot; I explained. &quot;Exactly! You will help best by doing what you are told.&quot; &quot;Certainly, Holmes.&quot; He relaxed the austerity of his manner. &quot;You are not angry?&quot; he asked, gasping for breath. Poor devil, how could I be angry when I saw him lying in such a plight before me? &quot;It&#x27;s for your own sake, Watson,&quot; he croaked. &quot;For my sake?&quot; &quot;I know what is the matter with me. It is a coolie disease from Sumatra- a thing that the Dutch know more about than we, though they have made little of it up to date. One thing only is certain. It is infallibly deadly, and it is horribly contagious.&quot; He spoke now with a feverish energy, the long hands twitching and jerking as he motioned me away. &quot;Contagious by touch, Watson- that&#x27;s it, by touch. Keep your distance and all is well.&quot; &quot;Good heavens, Holmes! Do you suppose that such a consideration weighs with me for an instant? It would not affect me in the case of a stranger. Do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so old a friend?&quot; Again I advanced, but he repulsed me with a look of furious anger. &quot;If you will stand there I will talk. If you do not you must leave the room.&quot; I have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes that I have always deferred to his wishes, even when I least understood them. But now all my professional instincts were aroused. Let him be my master elsewhere, I at least was his in a sick room. &quot;Holmes,&quot; said I, &quot;you are not yourself. A sick man is but a child, and so I will treat you. Whether you like it or not, I will examine your symptoms and treat you for them.&quot; He looked at me with venomous eyes. &quot;If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not, let me at least have someone in whom I have confidence,&quot; said he. &quot;Then you have none in me?&quot; &quot;In your friendship, certainly. But facts are facts, Watson, and, after all, you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience and mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to say these things, but you leave me no choice.&quot; I was bitterly hurt. &quot;Such a remark is unworthy of you, Holmes. It shows me very clearly the state of your own nerves. But if you have no confidence in me I would not intrude my services. Let me bring Sir Jasper Meek or Penrose Fisher, or any of the best men in London. But someone you must have, and that is final. If you think that I am going to stand here and see you die without either helping you myself or bringing anyone else to help you, then you have mistaken your man.&quot; &quot;You mean well, Watson,&quot; said the sick man with something between a sob and a groan. &quot;Shall I demonstrate your own ignorance? What do you know, pray, of Tapanuli fever? What do you know of the black Formosa corruption?&quot; &quot;I have never heard of either.&quot; &quot;There are many problems of disease, many strange pathological possibilities, in the East, Watson.&quot; He paused after each sentence to collect his failing strength. &quot;I have learned so much during some recent researches which have a medico-criminal aspect. It was in the course of them that I contracted this complaint. You can do nothing.&quot; &quot;Possibly not. But I happen to know that Dr. Ainstree, the greatest living authority upon tropical disease, is now in London. All remonstrance is useless, Holmes, I am going this instant to fetch him.&quot; I turned resolutely to the door. Never have I had such a shock! In an instant, with a tiger-spring, the dying man had intercepted me. I heard the sharp snap of a twisted key. The next moment he had staggered back to his bed, exhausted and panting after his one tremendous outflame of energy. &quot;You won&#x27;t take the key from me by force, Watson, I&#x27;ve got you, my friend. Here you are, and here you will stay until I will otherwise. But I&#x27;ll humour you.&quot; (All this in little gasps, with terrible struggles for breath between) &quot;You&#x27;ve only my own good at heart. Of course I know that very well. You shall have your way, but give me time to get my strength. Not now, Watson, not now. It&#x27;s four o&#x27;clock. At six you can go.&quot; &quot;This is insanity, Holmes.&quot; &quot;Only two hours, Watson. I promise you will go at six. Are you content to wait?&quot; &quot;I seem to have no choice.&quot; &quot;None in the world, Watson. Thank you, I need no help in arranging the clothes. You will please keep your distance. Now, Watson, there is one other condition that I would make. You will seek help, not from the man you mention, but from the one that I choose.&quot; &quot;By all means.&quot; &quot;The first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered this room, Watson. You will find some books over there. I am somewhat exhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a non-conductor? At six, Watson, we resume our conversation.&quot; But it was destined to be resumed long before that hour, and in circumstances which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his springing to the door. I had stood for some minutes looking at the silent figure in the bed. His face was almost covered by the clothes and he appeared to be asleep. Then, unable to settle down to reading, I walked slowly round the room, examining the pictures of celebrated criminals with which every wall was adorned. Finally, in my aimless perambulation, I came to the mantelpiece. A litter of pipes, tobacco-pouches, syringes, penknives, revolver-cartridges, and other debris was scattered over it. In the midst of these was a small black and white ivory box with a sliding lid. It was a neat little thing, and I had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely when- It was a dreadful cry that he gave- a yell which might have been heard down the street. My skin went cold and my hair bristled at that horrible scream. As I turned I caught a glimpse of a convulsed face and frantic eyes. I stood paralyzed, with the little box in my hand. &quot;Put it down! Down, this instant, Watson- this instant, I say!&quot; His head sank back upon the pillow and he gave a deep sigh of relief as I replaced the box upon the mantelpiece. &quot;I hate to have my things touched, Watson. You know that I hate it. You fidget me beyond endurance. You, a doctor- you are enough to drive a patient into an asylum. Sit down, man, and let me have my rest!&quot; The incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind. The violent and causeless excitement, followed by this brutality of speech, so far removed from his usual suavity, showed me how deep was the disorganization of his mind. Of all ruins, that of a noble mind is the most deplorable. I sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time had passed. He seemed to have been watching the clock as well as I, for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the same feverish animation as before. &quot;Now, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;Have you any change in your pocket?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Any silver?&quot; &quot;A good deal.&quot; &quot;How many half-crowns?&quot; &quot;I have five.&quot; &quot;Ah, too few! Too few! How very unfortunate, Watson! However, such as they are you can put them in your watchpocket. And all the rest of your money in your left trouserpocket. Thank you. It will balance you so much better like that.&quot; This was raving insanity. He shuddered, and again made a sound between a cough and a sob. &quot;You will now light the gas, Watson, but you will be very careful that not for one instant shall it be more than half on. I implore you to be careful, Watson. Thank you, that is excellent. No, you need not draw the blind. Now you will have the kindness to place some letters and papers upon this table within my reach, Thank you. Now some of that litter from the mantelpiece. Excellent, Watson! There is a sugar-tongs there. Kindly raise that small ivory box with its assistance. Place it here among the papers. Good! You can now go and fetch Mr. Culverton Smith, of 13 Lower Burke Street.&quot; To tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened, for poor Holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous to leave him. However, he was as eager now to consult the person named as he had been obstinate in refusing. &quot;I never heard the name,&quot; said I. &quot;Possibly not, my good Watson. It may surprise you to know that the man upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man, but a planter. Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of Sumatra, now visiting London. An outbreak of the disease upon his plantation, which was distant from medical aid, caused him to study it himself, with some rather far-reaching consequences. He is a very methodical person, and I did not desire you to start before six, because I was well aware that you would not find him in his study. If you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique experience of this disease, the investigation of which has been his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me.&quot; I give Holmes&#x27;s remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt to indicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those clutchings of his hands which indicated the pain from which he was suffering. His appearance had changed for the worse during the few hours that I had been with him. Those hectic spots were more pronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of darker hollows, and a cold sweat glimmered upon his brow. He still retained, however, the jaunty gallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would always be the master. &quot;You will tell him exactly how you have left me,&quot; said he. &quot;You will convey the very impression which is in your own mind- a dying man- a dying and delirious man. Indeed, I cannot think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures seem. Ah, I am wandering! Strange how the brain controls the brain! What was I saying, Watson?&quot; &quot;My directions for Mr. Culverton Smith.&quot; &quot;Ah, yes, I remember. My life depends upon it. Plead with him, Watson. There is no good feeling between us. His nephew, Watson- I had suspicions of foul play and I allowed him to see it. The boy died horribly. He has a grudge against me. You will soften him, Watson. Beg him, pray him, get him here by any means. He can save me- only he!&quot; &quot;I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it.&quot; &quot;You will do nothing of the sort. You will persuade him to come. And then you will return in front of him. Make any excuse so as not to come with him. Don&#x27;t forget, Watson. You won&#x27;t fail me. You never did fail me. No doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the creatures. You and I, Watson, we have done our part. Shall the world, then, be overrun by oysters? No, no; horrible! You&#x27;ll convey all that is in your mind.&quot; I left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling like a foolish child. He had handed me the key, and with a happy thought I took it with me lest he should lock himself in. Mrs. Hudson was waiting, trembling and weeping, in the passage. Behind me as I passed from the flat I heard Holmes&#x27;s high, thin voice in some delirious chant. Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man came on me through the fog. &quot;How is Mr. Holmes, sir?&quot; he asked. It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton, of Scotland Yard, dressed in unofficial tweeds. &quot;He is very ill,&quot; I answered. He looked at me in a most singular fashion. Had it not been too fiendish, I could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed exultation in his face. &quot;I heard some rumour of it,&quot; said he. The cab had driven up, and I left him. Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the vague borderland between Notting Hill and Kensington. The particular one at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure respectability in its old-fashioned iron railings, its massive folding-door, and its shining brasswork. All was in keeping with, a solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted electric light behind him. &quot;Yes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in, Dr. Watson! Very good, sir, I will take up your card.&quot; My humble name and title did not appear to impress Mr. Culverton Smith. Through the half-open door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating voice. &quot;Who is this person? What does he want? Dear me, Staples, how often have I said that I am, not to be disturbed in my hours of study?&quot; There came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the butler. &quot;Well, I won&#x27;t see him, Staples. I can&#x27;t have my work interrupted like this. I am not at home. Say so. tell him to come in the morning if he really must see me.&quot; Again the gentle murmur. &quot;Well, well, give him that message. He can come in the morning, or he can stay away. My work must not be hindered.&quot; I thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness and counting the minutes, perhaps, until I could bring help to him. It was not a time to stand upon ceremony. His life depended upon my promptness. Before the apologetic butler had delivered his message I had pushed past him and was in the room. With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside the fire. I saw a great yellow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with heavy, double-chin, and two sullen, menacing gray eyes which glared at me from under tufted and sandy brows. A high bald head had a small velvet smoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of its pink curve. The skull was of enormous capacity, and yet as I looked down I saw to my amazement that the figure of the man was small and frail, twisted in the shoulders and back like one who has suffered from rickets in his childhood. &quot;What&#x27;s this?&quot; he cried in a high, screaming voice. &quot;What is the meaning of this intrusion? Didn&#x27;t I send you word that I would see you to-morrow morning?&quot; &quot;I am sorry,&quot; said I, &quot;but the matter cannot be delayed. Mr. Sherlock Holmes-&quot; The mention of my friend&#x27;s name had an extraordinary effect upon the little man. The look of anger passed in an instant from his face. His features became tense and alert. &quot;Have you come from Holmes?&quot; he asked. &quot;I have just left him.&quot; &quot;What about Holmes? How is he?&quot; &quot;He is desperately ill. That is why I have come.&quot; The man motioned me to a chair, and turned to resume his own. As he did so I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece. I could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and abominable smile. Yet I persuaded myself that it must have been some nervous contraction which I had surprised, for he turned to me an instant later with genuine concern upon his features. &quot;I am sorry to hear this,&quot; said he. &quot;I only know Mr. Holmes through some business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect for his talents and his character. He is an amateur of crime, as I am of disease. For him the villain, for me the microbe. There are my prisons,&quot; he continued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which stood upon a side table. &quot;Among those gelatine cultivations some of the very worst offenders in the world are now doing time.&quot; &quot;It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr. Holmes desired to see you. He has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the one man in London who could help him.&quot; The little man started, and the jaunty smoking-cap slid to the floor. &quot;Why?&quot; he asked. &quot;Why should Mr. Holmes think that I could help him in his trouble?&quot; &quot;Because of your knowledge of Eastern diseases.&quot; &quot;But why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is Eastern?&quot; &quot;Because, in some professional inquiry, he has been working among Chinese sailors down in the docks.&quot; Mr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smoking-cap. &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s it- is it?&quot; said he. &quot;I trust the matter is not so grave as you suppose. How long has he been ill?&quot; &quot;About three days.&quot; &quot;Is he delirious?&quot; &quot;Occasionally.&quot; &quot;Tut, tut! This sounds serious. It would be inhuman not to answer his call. I very much resent any interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but this case is certainly exceptional. I will come with you at once.&quot; I remembered Holmes&#x27;s injunction. &quot;I have another appointment,&quot; said I. &quot;Very good. I will go alone. I have a note of Mr. Holmes&#x27;s address. You can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most.&quot; It was with a sinking heart that I reentered Holmes&#x27;s bedroom. For all that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. To my enormous relief, he had improved greatly in the interval. His appearance was as ghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in a feeble voice, it is true, but with even more than his usual crispness and lucidity. &quot;Well, did you see him, Watson?&quot; &quot;Yes; he is coming.&quot; &quot;Admirable, Watson! Admirable! You are the best of messengers.&quot; &quot;He wished to return with me.&quot; &quot;That would never do, Watson. That would be obviously impossible. Did he ask what ailed me?&quot; &quot;I told him about the Chinese in the East End.&quot; &quot;Exactly! Well, Watson, you have done all that a good friend could. You can now disappear from the scene.&quot; &quot;I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.&quot; &quot;Of course you must. But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are alone. There is just room behind the head of my bed, Watson.&quot; &quot;My dear Holmes!&quot; &quot;I fear there is no alternative, Watson. The room does not lend itself to concealment, which is as well, as it is the less likely to arouse suspicion. But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could be done.&quot; Suddenly he sat up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard face. &quot;There are the wheels, Watson. Quick, man, if you love me! And don&#x27;t budge, whatever happens- whatever happens, do you hear? Don&#x27;t speak! Don&#x27;t move! Just listen with all your ears.&quot; Then in an instant his sudden access of strength departed, and his masterful, purposeful talk droned away into the low, vague murmurings of a semi-delirious man. From the hiding-place into which I had been so swiftly hustled I heard the footfalls upon the stair, with the opening and the closing of the bedroom door. &quot;Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence, broken only by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man. I could imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and looking down at the sufferer. At last that strange hush was broken. &quot;Holmes!&quot; he cried. &quot;Holmes!&quot; in the insistent tone of one who awakens a sleeper. &quot;Can&#x27;t you hear me, Holmes?&quot; There was a rustling, as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder. &quot;Is that you, Mr. Smith?&quot; Holmes whispered. &quot;I hardly dared hope that you would come.&quot; The other laughed. &quot;I should imagine not,&quot; he said. &quot;And yet, you see, I am here. Coals of fire, Holmes- coals of fire!&quot; &quot;It is very good of you- very noble of you. I appreciate your special knowledge.&quot; Our visitor sniggered, &quot;You do. You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do you know what is the matter with you?&quot; &quot;The same,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Ah! You recognize the symptoms?&quot; &quot;Only too well.&quot; &quot;Well, I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised, Holmes. I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it were the same. A bad lookout for you if it is. Poor Victor was a dead man on the fourth day- a strong, hearty young fellow. It was certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of London- a disease, too, of which I had made such a very special study. Singular coincidence, Holmes. Very smart of you to notice it, but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect.&quot; &quot;I knew that you did it.&quot; &quot;Oh, you did, did you? Well, you couldn&#x27;t prove it, anyhow. But what do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that, and then crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble? What sort of a game is that- eh?&quot; I heard the rasping, laboured breathing of the sick man. &quot;Give me the water!&quot; he gasped. &quot;You&#x27;re precious near your end, my friend, but I don&#x27;t want you to go till I have had a word with you. That&#x27;s why I give you water. There, don&#x27;t slop it about! That&#x27;s right. Can you understand what I say?&quot; Holmes groaned. &quot;Do what you can for me. Let bygones be bygones,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I&#x27;ll put the words out of my head- I swear I will. Only cure me, and I&#x27;ll forget it.&quot; &quot;Forget what?&quot; &quot;Well, about Victor Savage&#x27;s death. You as good as admitted just now that you had done it. I&#x27;ll forget it.&quot; &quot;You can forget it or remember it, just as you like. I don&#x27;t see you in the witnessbox. Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure you. It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died. It&#x27;s not him we are talking about. It&#x27;s you.&quot; &quot;Yes, yes.&quot; &quot;The fellow who came for me- I&#x27;ve forgotten his name- said that you contracted it down in the East End among the sailors.&quot; &quot;I could only account for it so.&quot; &quot;You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you not? Think yourself smart, don&#x27;t you? You came across someone who was smarter this time. Now cast your mind back, Holmes. Can you think of no other way you could have got this thing?&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t think. My mind is gone. For heaven&#x27;s sake help me!&quot; &quot;Yes, I will help you. I&#x27;ll help you to understand just where you are and how you got there. I&#x27;d like you to know before you die.&quot; &quot;Give me something to ease my pain.&quot; &quot;Painful, is it? Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing towards the end. Takes you as cramp, I fancy.&quot; &quot;Yes, yes; it is cramp.&quot; &quot;Well, you can hear what I say, anyhow. Listen now! Can you remember any unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms began?&quot; &quot;No, no; nothing.&quot; &quot;Think again.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m too ill to think.&quot; &quot;Well, then, I&#x27;ll help you. Did anything come by post?&quot; &quot;By post?&quot; &quot;A box by chance?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m fainting- I&#x27;m gone!&quot; &quot;Listen, Holmes!&quot; There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying man, and it was all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place. &quot;You must hear me. You shall hear me. Do you remember a box- an ivory box? It came on Wednesday. You opened it- do you remember?&quot; &quot;Yes, yes, I opened it. There was a sharp spring inside it. Some joke-&quot; &quot;It was no joke, as you will find to your cost. You fool, you would have it and you have got it. Who asked you to cross my path? If you had left me alone I would not have hurt you.&quot; &quot;I remember,&quot; Holmes gasped. &quot;The spring! It drew blood. This box- this on the table.&quot; &quot;The very one, by George! And it may as well leave the room in my pocket. There goes your last shred of evidence. But you have the truth now, Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that I killed you. You knew too much of the fate of Victor Savage, so I have sent you to share it. You are very near your end, Holmes. I will sit here and I will watch you die.&quot; Holmes&#x27;s voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper. &quot;What is that?&quot; said Smith. &quot;Turn up the gas? Ah, the shadows begin to fall, do they? Yes, I will turn it up, that I may see you the better.&quot; He crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened. &quot;Is there any other little service that I can do you, my friend?&quot; &quot;A match and a cigarette.&quot; I nearly called out in my joy and my amazement. He was speaking in his natural voice- a little weak, perhaps, but the very voice I knew. There was a long pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing in silent amazement looking down at his companion. &quot;What&#x27;s the meaning of this?&quot; I heard him say at last in a dry, rasping tone. &quot;The best way of successfully acting a part is to be it,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither food nor drink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water. But it is the tobacco which I find most irksome. Ah, here are some cigarettes.&quot; I heard the striking of a match. That is very much better. Halloa! halloa! Do I hear the step of a friend?&quot; There were footfalls outside, the door opened, and Inspector Morton appeared. &quot;All is in order and this is your man,&quot; said Holmes. The officer gave the usual cautions. &quot;I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage,&quot; he concluded. &quot;And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes,&quot; remarked my friend with a chuckle. &quot;To save an invalid trouble, Inspector, Mr. Culverton Smith was good enough to give our signal by turning up the gas. By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the right-hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove. Thank you. I would handle it gingerly if I were you. Put it down here. It may play its part in the trial.&quot; There was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron and a cry of pain. &quot;You&#x27;ll only get yourself hurt,&quot; said the inspector. &quot;Stand still, will you?&quot; There was the click of the closing handcuffs. &quot;A nice trap!&quot; cried the high, snarling voice. &quot;It will bring you into the dock, Holmes, not me. He asked me to come here to cure him. I was sorry for him and I came. Now he will pretend, no doubt, that I have said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane suspicions. You can lie as you like, Holmes. My word is always as good as yours.&quot; &quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Holmes. &quot;I had totally forgotten him. My dear Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies. To think that I should have overlooked you! I need not introduce you to Mr. Culverton Smith, since I understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening. Have you the cab below? I will follow you when I am dressed, for I may be of some use at the station. &quot;I never needed it more,&quot; said Holmes as he refreshed himself with a glass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet. &quot;However, as you know, my habits are irregular, and such a feat means less to me than to most men. It was very essential that I should impress Mrs. Hudson with the reality of my condition, since she was to convey it to you, and you in turn to him. You won&#x27;t be offended, Watson? You will realize that among your many talents dissimulation finds no place, and that if you had shared my secret you would never have been able to impress Smith with the urgent necessity of his presence, which was the vital point of the whole scheme. Knowing his vindictive nature, I was perfectly certain that he would come to look upon his handiwork.&quot; &quot;But your appearance, Holmes- your ghastly face?&quot; &quot;Three days of absolute fast does not improve one&#x27;s beauty, Watson. For the rest, there is nothing which a sponge may not cure. With vaseline upon one&#x27;s forehead, belladonna in one&#x27;s eyes, rouge over the cheek-bones, and crusts of beeswax round one&#x27;s lips, a very satisfying effect can be produced. Malingering is a subject upon which I have sometimes thought of writing a monograph. A little occasional talk about half-crowns, oysters, or any other extraneous subject produces a pleasing effect of delirium.&quot; &quot;But why would you not let me near you, since there was in truth no infection?&quot; &quot;Can you ask, my dear Watson? Do you imagine that I have no respect for your medical talents? Could I fancy that your astute judgment would pass a dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or temperature? At four yards, I could deceive you. If I failed to do so, who would bring my Smith within my grasp? No, Watson, I would not touch that box. You can just see if you look at it sideways where the sharp spring like a viper&#x27;s tooth emerges as you open it. I dare say it was by some such device that poor Savage, who stood between this monster and a reversion, was done to death. My correspondence, however, is, as you know, a varied one, and I am somewhat upon my guard against any packages which reach me. It was clear to me, however, that my pretending that he had really succeeded in his design I might surprise a confession. That pretence I have carried out with the thoroughness of the true artist. Thank you, Watson, you must help me on with my coat. When we have finished at the police station I can think that something nutritious at Simpson&#x27;s would not be out of place.&quot; -THE END- . 1903 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested, and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances. The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation, but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life. Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. Let me say to that public, which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man, that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I should have considered it my first duty to do so, had I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month. It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public. And I even attempted, more than once, for my own private satisfaction, to employ his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success. There was none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald Adair. As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of willful murder against some person or persons unknown, I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes. There were points about this strange business which would, I was sure, have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe. All day, as I drove upon my round, I turned over the case in my mind and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate. At the risk of telling a twice-told tale, I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest. The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth, at that time governor of one of the Australian colonies. Adair&#x27;s mother had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together at 427 Park Lane. The youth moved in the best society- had, so far as was known, no enemies and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it. For the rest of the man&#x27;s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional. Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came, in most strange and unexpected form, between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty on the night of March 30, 1894. Ronald Adair was fond of cards- playing continually, but never for such stakes as would hurt him. He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs. It was shown that, after dinner on the day of his death, he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club. He had also played there in the afternoon. The evidence of those who had played with him- Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran- showed that the game was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards. Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more. His fortune was a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect him. He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious player, and usually rose a winner. It came out in evidence that, in partnership with Colonel Moran, he had actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting, some weeks before, from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral. So much for his recent history as it came out at the inquest. On the evening of the crime, he returned from the club exactly at ten. His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation. The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor, generally used as his sittingroom. She had lit a fire there, and as it smoked she had opened the window. No sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her daughter. Desiring to say good-night, she attempted to enter her son&#x27;s room. The door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking. Help was obtained, and the door forced. The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table. His head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room. On the table lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold, the money arranged in little piles of varying amount. There were some figures also upon a sheet of paper, with the names of some club friends opposite to them, from which it was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards. A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex. In the first place, no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside. There was the possibility that the murderer had done this, and had afterwards escaped by the window. The drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath. Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road. Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the door. But how did he come by his death? No one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces. Suppose a man had fired through the window, he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound. Again, Park lane is a frequented thoroughfare, there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house. No one had heard a shot. And yet there was the dead man and there the revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death. Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said, young Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room. All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the starting-point of every investigation. I confess that I made little progress. In the evening I strolled across the Park, and found myself about six o&#x27;clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane. A group of loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window, directed me to the house which I had come to see. A tall, thin man with coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected of being a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while the others crowded round to listen to what he said. I got as near him as I could, but his observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in some disgust. As I did so I struck against an elderly, deformed man, who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books which he was carrying. I remember that as I picked them up, I observed the title of one of them, The Origin of Tree Worship, and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile, who, either as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of obscure volumes. I endeavoured to apologize for the accident, but it was evident that these books which I had so unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner. With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I saw his curved back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng. My observations of No. 427 Park Lane did little to clear up the problem in which I was interested. The house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing, the whole not more than five feet high. It was perfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to get into the garden, but the window was entirely inaccessible, since there was no waterpipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it. More puzzled than ever, I retraced my steps to Kensington. I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me. To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under his right arm. &quot;You&#x27;re surprised to see me, sir,&quot; said he, in a strange, croaking voice. I acknowledged that I was. &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve a conscience, sir, and when I chanced to see you go into this house, as I came hobbling after you, I thought to myself, I&#x27;ll just step in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him that if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant, and that I am much obliged to him for picking up my books.&quot; &quot;You make too much of a trifle,&quot; said I. &quot;May I ask how you knew who I was?&quot; &quot;Well, sir, if it isn&#x27;t too great a liberty, I am a neighbour of yours, for you&#x27;ll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Street, and very happy to see you, I am sure. Maybe you collect yourself, sir. Here&#x27;s British Birds, and Catullus, and The Holy War- a bargain, every one of them. With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf. It looks untidy, does it not, sir?&quot; I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I turned again, Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table. I rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life. Certainly a gray mist swirled before my eyes, and when it cleared I found my collar-ends undone and the tingling after-taste of brandy upon my lips. Holmes was bending over my chair, his flask in his hand. &quot;My dear Watson,&quot; said the well-remembered voice, &quot;I owe you a thousand apologies. I had no idea that you would be so affected.&quot; I gripped him by the arms. &quot;Holmes!&quot; I cried. &quot;Is it really you? Can it indeed be that you are alive? Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss?&quot; &quot;Wait a moment,&quot; said he. &quot;Are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things? I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance.&quot; &quot;I am all right, but indeed, Holmes, I can hardly believe my eyes. Good heavens! to think that you- you of all men- should be standing in my study.&quot; Again I gripped him by the sleeve, and felt the thin, sinewy arm beneath it. &quot;Well, you&#x27;re not a spirit anyhow,&quot; said I. &quot;My dear chap, I&#x27;m overjoyed to see you. Sit down, and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.&quot; He sat opposite to me, and lit a cigarette in his old, nonchalant manner. He was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book merchant, but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table. Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old, but there was a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a healthy one. &quot;I am glad to stretch myself, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;It is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end. Now, my dear fellow, in the matter of these explanations, we have, if I may ask for your cooperation, a hard and dangerous night&#x27;s work in front of us. Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an account of the whole situation when that work is finished.&quot; &quot;I am full of curiosity. I should much prefer to hear now.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll come with me to-night?&quot; &quot;When you like and where you like.&quot; &quot;This is, indeed, like the old days. We shall have time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go. Well, then, about that chasm. I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that I never was in it.&quot; &quot;You never were in it?&quot; &quot;No, Watson, I never was in it. My note to you was absolutely genuine. I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety. I read an inexorable purpose in his gray eyes. I exchanged some remarks with him, therefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received. I left it with my cigarette-box and my stick, and I walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels. When I reached the end I stood at bay. He drew no weapon, but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me. He knew that his own game was up, and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me. We tottered together upon the brink of the fall. I have some knowledge, however, of baritsu, or the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me. I slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds, and clawed the air with both his hands. But for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he went. With my face over the brink, I saw him fall for a long way. Then he struck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.&quot; I listened with amazement to this explanation, which Holmes delivered between the puffs of his cigarette. &quot;But the tracks!&quot; I cried. &quot;I saw, with my own eyes, that two went down the path and none returned.&quot; &quot;It came about in this way. The instant that the Professor had disappeared, it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed in my way. I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death. There were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader. They were all most dangerous men. One or other would certainly get me. On the other hand, if all the world was convinced that I was dead they would take liberties, these men, they would soon lay themselves open, and sooner or later I could destroy them. Then it would be time for me to announce that I was still in the land of the living. So rapidly does the brain act that I believe I had thought this all out before Professor Moriarty had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall. &quot;I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me. In your picturesque account of the matter, which I read with great interest some months later, you assert that the wall was sheer. That was not literally true. A few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some indication of a ledge. The cliff is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path without leaving some tracks. I might, it is true, have reversed my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception. On the whole, then, it was best that I should risk the climb. It was not a pleasant business, Watson. The fall roared beneath me. I am not a fanciful person, but I give you my word that I seemed to hear Moriarty&#x27;s voice screaming at me out of the abyss. A mistake would have been fatal. More than once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I thought that I was gone. But I struggled upward, and at last I reached a ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I could lie unseen, in the most perfect comfort. There I was stretched, when you, my dear Watson, and all your following were investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death. &quot;At last, when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous conclusions, you departed for the hotel, and I was left alone. I had imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures, but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store for me. A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me, struck the path, and bounded over into the chasm. For an instant I thought that it was an accident, but a moment later, looking up, I saw a man&#x27;s head against the darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon which I was stretched, within a foot of my head. Of course, the meaning of this was obvious. Moriarty had not been alone. A confederate- and even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate was- had kept guard while the Professor had attacked me. From a distance, unseen by me, he had been a witness of his friend&#x27;s death and of my escape. He had waited, and then making his way round to the top of the cliff, he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed. &quot;I did not take long to think about it, Watson. Again I saw that grim face look over the cliff, and I knew that it was the precursor of another stone. I scrambled down on to the path. I don&#x27;t think I could have done it in cold blood. It was a hundred times more difficult than getting up. But I had no time to think of the danger, for another stone sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge. Halfway down I slipped, but, by the blessing of God, I landed, torn and bleeding, upon the path. I took to my heels, did ten miles over the mountains in the darkness, and a week later I found myself in Florence, with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me. &quot;I had only one confidant- my brother Mycroft. I owe you many apologies, my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought I was dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true. Several times during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to you, but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret. For that reason I turned away from you this evening when you upset my books, for I was in danger at the time, and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results. As to Mycroft, I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which I needed. The course of events in London did not run so well as I had hoped, for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members, my own most vindictive enemies, at liberty. I travelled for two years in Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa, and spending some days with the head lama. You may have read of the remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca, and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office. Returning to France, I spent some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I conducted in a laboratory at Montpellier, in the south of France. Having concluded this to my satisfaction and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in London I was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery, which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. I came over at once to London, called in my own person at Baker Street, threw Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been. So it was, my dear Watson, that at two o&#x27;clock to-day I found myself in my old armchair in my own old room, and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned.&quot; Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that April evening- a narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall, spare figure and the keen, eager face, which I had never thought to see again. In some manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in his words. &quot;Work is the best antidote to sorrow, my dear Watson,&quot; said he; &quot;and I have a piece of work for us both to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion, will in itself justify a man&#x27;s life on this planet.&quot; In vain I begged him to tell me more. &quot;You will hear and see enough before morning,&quot; he answered. &quot;We have three years of the past to discuss. Let that suffice until half-past nine, when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house.&quot; It was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself seated beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket, and the thrill of adventure in my heart. Holmes was cold and stern and silent. As the gleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his austere features, I saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed. I knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal London, but I was well assured, from the bearing of this master huntsman, that the adventure was a most grave one- while the sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good for the object of our quest. I had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street, but Holmes stopped the cab at the corner of Cavendish Square. I observed that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right and left, and at every subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was not followed. Our route was certainly a singular one. Holmes&#x27;s knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary, and on this occasion he passed rapidly and with an assured step through a network of mews and stables, the very existence of which I had never known. We emerged at last into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us into Manchester Street, and so to Blandford Street. Here he turned swiftly down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house. We entered together, and he closed it behind us. The place was pitch dark, but it was evident to me that it was an empty house. Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking, and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in ribbons. Holmes&#x27;s cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forward down a long hall, until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the door. Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right and we found ourselves in a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond. There was no lamp near, and the window was thick with dust, so that we could only just discern each other&#x27;s figures within. My companion put his hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear. &quot;Do you know where we are?&quot; he whispered. &quot;Surely that is Baker Street&quot; I answered, staring through the dim window. &quot;Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our own old quarters.&quot; &quot;But why are we here?&quot; &quot;Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile. Might I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show yourself, and then to look up at our old rooms- the starting point of so many of your little fairy-tales? We will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you.&quot; I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. As my eyes fell upon it, I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. The blind was down, and a strong light was burning in the room. The shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. There was no mistaking the poise of the head, the squareness of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features. The face was turned half-round, and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. It was a perfect reproduction of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me. He was quivering with silent laughter. &quot;Well?&quot; said he. &quot;Good heavens!&quot; I cried. &quot;It is marvellous.&quot; &quot;I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety,&quot; said he, and I recognized in his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes in his own creation. &quot;It really is rather like me, is it not?&quot; &quot;I should be prepared to swear that it was you.&quot; &quot;The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier, of Grenoble, who spent some days in doing the moulding. It is a bust in wax. The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street this afternoon.&quot; &quot;But why?&quot; &quot;Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really elsewhere.&quot; &quot;And you thought the rooms were watched?&quot; &quot;I knew that they were watched.&quot; &quot;By whom?&quot; &quot;By my old enemies, Watson. By the charming society whose leader lies in the Reichenbach Fall. You must remember that they knew, and only they knew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they believed that I should come back to my rooms. They watched them continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive.&quot; &quot;How do you know?&quot; &quot;Because I recognized their sentinel when I glanced out of my window. He is a harmless enough fellow, Parker by name, a garroter by trade, and a remarkable performer upon the jew&#x27;s-harp. I cared nothing for him. But I cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind him, the bosom friend of Moriarty, the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff, the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London. That is the man who is after me to-night Watson, and that is the man who is quite unaware that we are after him.&quot; My friend&#x27;s plans were gradually revealing themselves. From this convenient retreat, the watchers were being watched and the trackers tracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the bait, and we were the hunters. In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us. Holmes was silent and motionless; but I could tell that he was keenly alert, and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. It was a bleak and boisterous night and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street. Many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in their coats and cravats. Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen the same figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street. I tried to draw my companion&#x27;s attention to them; but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience, and continued to stare into the street. More than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy, and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped. At last, as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some remark to him, when I raised my eyes to the lighted window, and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before. I clutched Holmes&#x27;s arm, and pointed upward. &quot;The shadow has moved!&quot; I cried. It was indeed no longer the profile, but the back, which was turned towards us. Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own. &quot;Of course it has moved,&quot; said he. &quot;Am I such a farcical bungler, Watson, that I should erect an obvious dummy, and expect that some of the sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it? We have been in this room two hours, and Mrs. Hudson has made some change in that figure eight times, or once in every quarter of an hour. She works it from the front, so that her shadow may never be seen. Ah!&quot; He drew in his breath with a shrill, excited intake. In the dim light I saw his head thrown forward, his whole attitude rigid with attention. Outside the street was absolutely deserted. Those two men might still be crouching in the doorway, but I could no longer see them. All was still and dark, save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard that thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement. An instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and I felt his warning hand upon my lips. The fingers which clutched me were quivering. Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us. But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished. A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the direction of Baker Street, but from the back of the very house in which we lay concealed. A door opened and shut. An instant later steps crept down the passage- steps which were meant to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty house. Holmes crouched back against the wall, and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver. Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. He stood for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea of our presence. He passed close beside us, stole over to the window, and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. As he sank to the level of this opening, the light of the street, no longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon his face. The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement. His two eyes shone like stars, and his features were working convulsively. He was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache. An opera hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. His face was gaunt and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long, whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. He straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the breech-lock. Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder; and saw that amazing target, the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his foresight. For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud whiz and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman&#x27;s back, and hurled him flat upon his face. He was up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat, but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver, and he dropped again upon the floor. I fell upon him, and as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room. &quot;That you, Lestrade?&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It&#x27;s good to see you back in London, sir.&quot; &quot;I think you want a little unofficial help. Three undetected murders in one year won&#x27;t do, Lestrade. But you handled the Molesey Mystery with less than your usual- that&#x27;s to say, you handled it fairly well.&quot; We had all risen to our feet, our prisoner breathing hard, with a stalwart constable on each side of him. Already a few loiterers had begun to collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the window, closed it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade had produced two candles, and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns. I was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner. It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned towards us. With the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a sensualist below, the man must have started with great capacities for good or for evil. But one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and the threatening, deep-lined brow, without reading Nature&#x27;s plainest danger-signals. He took no heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed upon Holmes&#x27;s face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended. &quot;You fiend!&quot; he kept on muttering. &quot;You clever, clever fiend!&quot; &quot;Ah, Colonel!&quot; said Holmes, arranging his rumpled collar. &quot;`Journeys end in lovers&#x27; meetings,&#x27; as the old play says. I don&#x27;t think I have had the pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as I lay on the ledge above the Reichenbach Fall.&quot; The colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance. &quot;You cunning, cunning fiend!&quot; was all that he could say. &quot;I have not introduced you yet,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;This, gentlemen, is Colonel Sebastian Moran, once of Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Army, and the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced. I believe I am correct Colonel, in saying that your bag of tigers still remains unrivalled?&quot; The fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my companion. With his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was wonderfully like a tiger himself. &quot;I wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a shikari,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It must be very familiar to you. Have you not tethered a young kid under a tree, lain above it with your rifle, and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger? This empty house is my tree, and you are my tiger. You have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers, or in the unlikely supposition of your own arm failing you. These,&quot; he pointed around, &quot;are my other guns. The parallel is exact.&quot; Colonel Moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage, but the constables dragged him back. The fury upon his face was terrible to look at. &quot;I confess that you had one small surprise for me,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window. I had imagined you as operating from the street, where my friend, Lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you. With that exception, all has gone as I expected.&quot; Colonel Moran turned to the official detective. &quot;You may or may not have just cause for arresting me,&quot; said he, &quot;but at least there can be no reason why I should submit to the gibes of this person. If I am in the hands of the law, let things be done in a legal way.&quot; &quot;Well, that&#x27;s reasonable enough,&quot; said Lestrade. &quot;Nothing further you have to say, Mr. Holmes, before we go?&quot; Holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor, and was examining its mechanism. &quot;An admirable and unique weapon,&quot; said he, &quot;noiseless and of tremendous power: I knew Von Herder, the blind German mechanic, who constructed it to the order of the late Professor Moriarty. For years I have been aware of its existance though I have never before had the opportunity of handling it. I commend it very specially to your attention, Lestrade and also the bullets which fit it.&quot; &quot;You can trust us to look after that, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said Lestrade, as the whole party moved towards the door. &quot;Anything further to say?&quot; &quot;Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?&quot; &quot;What charge, sir? Why, of course, the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&quot; &quot;Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose to appear in the matter at all. To you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I congratulate you! With your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity, you have got him.&quot; &quot;Got him! Got whom, Mr. Holmes?&quot; &quot;The man that the whole force has been seeking in vain- Colonel Sebastian Moran, who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding bullet from an air-gun through the open window of the second-floor front of No. 427 Park Lane, upon the thirtieth of last month. That&#x27;s the charge, Lestrade. And now, Watson, if you can endure the draught from a broken window, I think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable amusement.&quot; Our old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision of Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson. As I entered I saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but the old landmarks were all in their place. There were the chemical corner and the acid-stained, deal-topped table. There upon a shelf was the row of formidable scrap-books and books of reference which many of our fellow-citizens would have been so glad to burn. The diagrams, the violin-case, and the pipe-rack- even the Persian slipper which contained the tobacco- all met my eyes as I glanced round me. There were two occupants of the room- one, Mrs. Hudson, who beamed upon us both as we entered- the other, the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening&#x27;s adventures. It was a waxcoloured model of my friend, so admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile. It stood on a small pedestal table with an old dressing-gown of Holmes&#x27;s so draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect. &quot;I hope you observed all precautions, Mrs. Hudson?&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told me.&quot; &quot;Excellent. You carried the thing out very well. Did you observe where the bullet went?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir. I&#x27;m afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust, for it passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall. I picked it up from the carpet. Here it is!&quot; Holmes held it out to me. &quot;A soft revolver bullet, as you perceive, Watson. There&#x27;s genius in that, for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an airgun? All right, Mrs. Hudson. I am much obliged for your assistance. And now, Watson, let me see you in your old seat once more, for there are several points which I should like to discuss with you.&quot; He had thrown off the seedy frockcoat, and now he was the Holmes of old in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown which he took from his effigy. &quot;The old shikari&#x27;s nerves have not lost their steadiness, nor his eyes their keenness,&quot; said he, with a laugh, as he inspected the shattered forehead of his bust. &quot;Plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through the brain. He was the best shot in India, and I expect that there are few better in London. Have you heard the name?&quot; &quot;No, I have not.&quot; &quot;Well, well, such is fame! But, then, if I remember right, you had not heard the name of Professor James Moriarty, who had one of the great brains of the century. Just give me down my index of biographies from the shelf.&quot; He turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in his chair and blowing great clouds from his cigar. &quot;My collection of M&#x27;s is a fine one,&quot; said he. &quot;Moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious, and here is Morgan the poisoner, and Merridew of abominable memory, and Mathews, who knocked out my left canine in the waiting room at Charing Cross, and, finally, here is our friend of to-night.&quot; He handed over the book, and I read: Moran, Sebastian, Colonel. Unemployed. Formerly 1st Bangalore Pioneers. Born London, 1840. Son of Sir Augustus Moran, C.B., once British Minister to Persia. Educated Eton and Oxford. Served in Jowaki Campaign, Afghan Campaign, Charasiab (despatches), Sherpur, and Cabul. Author of Heavy Game of the Western Himalayas (1881); Three Months in the Jungle (1884). Address: Conduit Street. Clubs: The Anglo-Indian, the Tankerville, the Bagatelle Card Club. On the margin was written, in Holmes&#x27;s precise hand: The second most dangerous man in London. &quot;This is astonishing,&quot; said I, as I handed back the volume. &quot;The man&#x27;s career is that of an honourable soldier.&quot; &quot;It is true,&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;Up to a certain point he did well. He was always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still told in India how he crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger. There are some trees, Watson, which grow to a certain height, and then suddenly develop some unsightly eccentricity. You will see it often in humans. I have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole procession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his pedigree. The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the history of his own family.&quot; &quot;It is surely rather fanciful.&quot; &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t insist upon it. Whatever the cause, Colonel Moran began to go wrong. Without any open scandal, he still made India too hot to hold him. He retired, came to London, and again acquired an evil name. It was at this time that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty, to whom for a time he was chief of the staff. Moriarty supplied him liberally with money, and used him only in one or two very high-class jobs, which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken. You may have some recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of Lauder, in 1887. Not? Well, I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it, but nothing could be proved. So cleverly was the colonel concealed that, even when the Moriarty gang was broken up, we could not incriminate him. You remember at that date, when I called upon you in your rooms, how I put up the shutters for fear of air-guns? No doubt you thought me fanciful. I knew exactly what I was doing, for I knew of the existence of this remarkable gun, and I knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be behind it. When we were in Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty, and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the Reichenbach ledge. &quot;You may think that I read the papers with some attention during my sojourn in France, on the look-out for any chance of laying him by the heels. So long as he was free in London, my life would really not have been worth living. Night and day the shadow would have been over me, and sooner or later his chance must have come. What could I do? I could not shoot him at sight, or I should myself be in the dock. There was no use appealing to a magistrate. They cannot interfere on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion. So I could do nothing. But I watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later I should get him. Then came the death of this Ronald Adair. My chance had come at last. Knowing what I did, was it not certain that Colonel Moran had done it? He had played cards with the lad, he had followed him home from the club, he had shot him through the open window. There was not a doubt of it. The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose. I came over at once. I was seen by the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct the colonel&#x27;s attention to my presence. He could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime, and to be terribly alarmed. I was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way at once, and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. I left him an excellent mark in the window, and, having warned the police that they might be needed- by the way, Watson, you spotted their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy- I took up what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation, never dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack. Now, my dear Watson, does anything remain for me to explain?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said I. &quot;You have not made it clear what was Colonel Moran&#x27;s motive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair?&quot; &quot;Ah! my dear Watson, there we come into those realms of conjecture, where the most logical mind may be at fault. Each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is as likely to be correct as mine.&quot; &quot;You have formed one, then?&quot; &quot;I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. It came out in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had, between them, won a considerable amount of money. Now, undoubtedly played foul- of that I have long been aware. I believe that on the day of the murder Adair had discovered that Moran was cheating. Very likely he had spoken to him privately, and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the club, and promised not to play cards again. It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by exposing a well known man so much older than himself. Probably he acted as I suggest. The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card-gains. He therefore murdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by his partner&#x27;s foul play. He locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and coins. Will it pass?&quot; &quot;I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.&quot; &quot;It will be verified or disproved at the trial. Meanwhile, come what may, Colonel Moran will trouble us no more. The famous air-gun of Von Herder will embellish the Scotland Yard Museum, and once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of London so plentifully presents.&quot; -THE END- . 1892 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER&#x27;S THUMB by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice-that of Mr. Hatherley&#x27;s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton&#x27;s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect. It was in the summer of &#x27;89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarize. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forego his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence. One morning, at a little before seven o&#x27;clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him. &quot;I&#x27;ve got him here,&quot; he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; &quot;he&#x27;s all right.&quot; &quot;What is it, then?&#x27; I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room. &quot;It&#x27;s a new patient,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d bring him round myself; then he couldn&#x27;t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my duties, just the same as you.&quot; And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him. I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed, with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but be was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control. &quot;I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,&quot; said he, &quot;but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.&quot; I took it up and glanced at it. &quot;Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3d. floor).&quot; That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. &quot;I regret that I have kept you waiting,&quot; said I, sitting down in my library chair. &quot;You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.&quot; &quot;Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,&quot; said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh. &quot;Stop it!&quot; I cried; &quot;pull yourself together!&quot; and I poured out some water from a carafe. It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking. &quot;I have been making a fool of myself,&quot; he gasped. &quot;Not at all. Drink this.&quot; I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks. &quot;That&#x27;s better!&quot; said he. &quot;And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.&quot; He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots. &quot;Good heavens!&quot; I cried, &quot;this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably.&quot; &quot;Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. Then I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.&quot; &quot;Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.&quot; &quot;It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.&quot; &quot;This has been done,&quot; said I, examining the wound, &quot;by a very heavy and sharp instrument.&quot; &quot;A thing like a cleaver,&quot; said he. &quot;An accident, I presume?&quot; &quot;By no means.&quot; &quot;What! a murderous attack?&quot; &quot;Very murderous indeed.&quot; &quot;You horrify me.&#x27; I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolized bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time. &quot;How is that?&quot; I asked when I had finished. &quot;Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.&quot; &quot;Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves.&quot; &quot;Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement; for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they, believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.&quot; &quot;Ha!&quot; cried I, &quot;if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.&quot; &quot;Oh, I have heard of that fellow,&quot; answered my visitor, &quot;and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll do better. I&#x27;ll take you round to him myself.&quot; &quot;I should be immensely obliged to you.&quot; &quot;Well call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?&quot; &quot;Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.&quot; &quot;Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.&quot; I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach. &quot;It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley,&quot; said he. &quot;Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.&quot; &quot;Thank you,&quot; said my patient, &quot;but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.&quot; Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us. &quot;You must know,&quot; said he, &quot;that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &amp; Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father&#x27;s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street. &quot;I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to L27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last: my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all. &quot;Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of &#x27;Colonel Lysander Stark&#x27; engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty. &quot;&#x27;Mr. Hatherley?&#x27; said he, with something of a German accent. &#x27;You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.&#x27; &quot;I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. &#x27;May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;That is quite correct,&#x27; I answered; &#x27;but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential-absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;If I promise to keep a secret,&#x27; said I, &#x27;you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.&#x27; &quot;He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye. &quot;&#x27;Do you promise, then?&#x27; said he at last. &quot;&#x27;Yes, I promise.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I have already given you my word.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Very good.&#x27; He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty. &quot;&#x27;That&#x27;s all right,&#x27; said he, coming back. &#x27;I know the clerks are sometimes curious as to their master&#x27;s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.&#x27; He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look. &quot;A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience. &quot;&#x27;I beg that you will state your business, sir,&#x27; said I; &#x27;my time is of value.&#x27; Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips. &quot;&#x27;How would fifty guineas for a night&#x27;s work suit you?&#x27; he asked. &quot;&#x27;Most admirably.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I say a night&#x27;s work, but an hour&#x27;s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Where to?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Very good.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;There is a drive, then?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.&#x27; &quot;I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. &#x27;Not at all,&#x27; said I, &#x27;I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Entirely.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller&#x27;s-earth is a valuable product. and that it is only found in one or two places in England?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I have heard so.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Some little time ago I bought a small place-a very small place-within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller&#x27;s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left-both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit, and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I quite follow you,&#x27; said I. &#x27;The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller&#x27;s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Ah!&#x27; said he carelessly, &#x27;we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.&#x27; He rose as he spoke. &#x27;I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I shall certainly be there.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;And not a word to a soul.&#x27; He looked at me with a last, long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my band in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room. &quot;Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fullers-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue. &quot;At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o&#x27;clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lanter. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.&quot; &quot;One horse?&quot; interjected Holmes. &quot;Yes, only one.&quot; &quot;Did you observe the colour?&quot; &quot;Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut.&quot; &quot;Tired-looking or fresh?&quot; &quot;Oh, fresh and glossy.&quot; &quot;Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.&quot; &quot;Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pushed me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away. &quot;It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand. &quot;&#x27;Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,&#x27; said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. &#x27;I shall not keep you waiting an instant,&#x27; said he, and vanished into the darkness. &quot;I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee. &quot;Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her. &quot;&#x27;I would go,&#x27; said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly, &#x27;I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;But, madam,&#x27; said I, &#x27;I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;It is not worth your while to wait,&#x27; she went on. &#x27;You can pass through the door; no one hinders.&#x27; And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrang together. &#x27;For the love of Heaven!&#x27; she whispered, &#x27;get away from here before it is too late!&#x27; &quot;But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come. &quot;The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson. &quot;&#x27;This is my secretary and manager,&#x27; said the colonel. &#x27;By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;On the contrary,&#x27; said I, &#x27;I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.&#x27; &quot;He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. &#x27;Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,&#x27; said he. &#x27;Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I had better put my hat on, I suppose.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Oh, no, it is in the house.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;What, you dig fuller&#x27;s-earth in the house?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.&#x27; &quot;We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman. &quot;Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in. &quot;&#x27;We are now,&#x27; said he, &#x27;actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.&#x27; &quot;I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller&#x27;s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me. &quot;&#x27;What are you doing there?&#x27; he asked. &quot;I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. &#x27;I was admiring your fuller&#x27;s-earth,&#x27; said I; &#x27;I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.&#x27; &quot;The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his gray eyes. &quot;&#x27;Very well,&#x27; said he, &#x27;you shall know all about the machine.&#x27; He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. &#x27;Hello!&#x27; I yelled. &#x27;Hello! Colonel! Let me out!&#x27; &quot;And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart. &quot;I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. the panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape. &quot;I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected. &quot;&#x27;Come! come!&#x27; she cried breathlessly. &#x27;They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!&#x27; &quot;This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit&#x27;s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly. &quot;&#x27;It is your only chance,&#x27; said she. &#x27;It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.&#x27; &quot;As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before be was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back. &quot;&#x27;Fritz! Fritz!&#x27; she cried in English, &#x27;remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!&#x27; &quot;&#x27;You are mad, Elise!&#x27; he shouted, struggling to break away from her. &#x27;You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!&#x27; He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below. &quot;I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes. &quot;How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night&#x27;s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream. &quot;Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off. &quot;It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.&quot; We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings. &quot;Here is an advertisement which will interest you,&quot; said he. &quot;It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: &quot;Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o&#x27;clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in- etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.&quot; &quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried my patient. &quot;Then that explains what the girl said.&quot; &quot;Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.&quot; Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre. &quot;There you are,&quot; said he. &quot;That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.&quot; &quot;It was an hour&#x27;s good drive.&quot; &quot;And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?&quot; &quot;They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.&quot; &quot;What I cannot understand,&quot; said I, &quot;is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman&#x27;s entreaties.&quot; &quot;I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.&quot; &quot;Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,&quot; said Bradstreet. &quot;Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.&quot; &quot;I think I could lay my finger on it,&quot; said Holmes quietly. &quot;Really, now!&quot; cried the inspector, &quot;you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.&quot; &quot;And I say east,&quot; said my patient. &quot;I am for west,&quot; remarked the plain-clothes man. &quot;There are several quiet little villages up there.&quot; &quot;And I am for north,&quot; said I, &quot;because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.&quot; &quot;Come,&quot; cried the inspector, laughing, &quot;it&#x27;s a very pretty diversity of opinion. &quot;We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?&quot; &quot;You are all wrong.&quot; &quot;But we can&#x27;t all be.&quot; &quot;Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.&quot; He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. &quot;This is where we shall find them.&quot; &quot;But the twelve-mile drive?&quot; gasped Hatherley. &quot;Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?&quot; &quot;Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,&quot; observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. &quot;Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.&quot; &quot;None at all,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.&quot; &quot;We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,&quot; said the inspector. &quot;They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.&quot; But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape. &quot;A house on fire?&quot; asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way. &quot;Yes, sir!&quot; said the station-master. &quot;When did it break out?&quot; &quot;I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.&quot; &quot;Whose house is it?&quot; &quot;Dr. Becher&#x27;s.&quot; &quot;Tell me,&quot; broke in the engineer, &quot;is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?&quot; The station-master laughed heartily. &quot;No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn&#x27;t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.&quot; The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under. &quot;That&#x27;s it!&quot; cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. &quot;There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from.&quot; &quot;Well, at least,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oillamp which, when it was crushed in the Press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.&quot; And Holmes&#x27;s fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes&#x27;s ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts. The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to. How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger. &quot;Well,&quot; said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, &quot;it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?&quot; &quot;Experience,&quot; said Holmes, laughing. &quot;Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.&quot; -THE END- . 1904 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle When I look at the three massive manuscript volumes which contain our work for the year 1894, I confess that it is very difficult for me, out of such a wealth of material, to select the cases which are most interesting in themselves, and at the same time most conducive to a display of those peculiar powers for which my friend was famous. As I turn over the pages, I see my notes upon the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of Crosby, the banker. Here also I find an account of the Addleton tragedy, and the singular contents of the ancient British barrow. The famous Smith-Mortimer succession case comes also within this period, and so does the tracking and arrest of Huret, the Boulevard assassin- an exploit which won for Holmes an autograph letter of thanks from the French President and the Order of the Legion of Honour. Each of these would furnish a narrative, but on the whole I am of opinion that none of them unites so many singular points of interest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place, which includes not only the lamentable death of young Willoughby Smith, but also those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the causes of the crime. It was a wild, tempestuous night, towards the close of November. Holmes and I sat together in silence all the evening, be engaged with a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest, I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery. Outside the wind howled down Baker Street, while the rain beat fiercely against the windows. It was strange there, in the very depths of the town, with ten miles of man&#x27;s handiwork on every side of us, to feel the iron grip of Nature, and to be conscious that to the huge elemental forces all London was no more than the molehills that dot the fields. I walked to the window, and looked out on the deserted street. The occasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement. A single cab was splashing its way from the Oxford Street end. &quot;Well, Watson, it&#x27;s as well we have not to turn out to-night,&quot; said Holmes, laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest. &quot;I&#x27;ve done enough for one sitting. It is trying work for the eyes. So far as I can make out, it is nothing more exciting than an Abbey&#x27;s accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth century. Halloa! halloa! halloa! What&#x27;s this?&quot; Amid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a horse&#x27;s hoofs, and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against the curb. The cab which I had seen had pulled up at our door. &quot;What can he want?&quot; I ejaculated, as a man stepped out of it. &quot;Want? He wants us. And we, my poor Watson, want overcoats and cravats and goloshes, and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather. Wait a bit, though! There&#x27;s the cab off again! There&#x27;s hope yet. He&#x27;d have kept it if he had wanted us to come. Run down, my dear fellow, and open the door, for all virtuous folk have been long in bed.&quot; When the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor, I had no difficulty in recognizing him. It was young Stanley Hopkins, a promising detective, in whose career Holmes had several times shown a very practical interest. &quot;Is he in?&quot; he asked, eagerly. &quot;Come up, my dear sir,&quot; said Holmes&#x27;s voice from above. &quot;I hope you have no designs upon us such a night as this.&quot; The detective mounted the stairs, and our lamp gleamed upon his shining waterproof. I helped him out of it, while Holmes knocked a blaze out of the logs in the grate. &quot;Now, my dear Hopkins, draw up and warm your toes,&quot; said he. &quot;Here&#x27;s a cigar, and the doctor has a prescription containing hot water and a lemon, which is good medicine on a night like this. It must be something important which has brought you out in such a gale.&quot; &quot;It is indeed, Mr. Holmes. I&#x27;ve had a bustling afternoon, I promise you. Did you see anything of the Yoxley case in the latest editions?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to-day.&quot; &quot;Well, it was only a paragraph, and all wrong at that, so you have not missed anything. I haven&#x27;t let the grass grow under my feet. It&#x27;s down in Kent, seven miles from Chatham and three from the railway line. I was wired for at 3:15, reached Yoxley Old Place at 5, conducted my investigation, was back at Charing Cross by the last train, and straight to you by cab.&quot; &quot;Which means, I suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case?&quot; &quot;It means that I can make neither head nor tail of it. So far as I can see, it is just as tangled a business as ever I handled, and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn&#x27;t go wrong. There&#x27;s no motive, Mr. Holmes. That&#x27;s what bothers me- I can&#x27;t put my hand on a motive. Here&#x27;s a man dead- there&#x27;s no denying that- but, so far as I can see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm.&quot; Holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair. &quot;Let us hear about it,&quot; said he. &quot;I&#x27;ve got my facts pretty clear,&quot; said Stanley Hopkins. &quot;All I want now is to know what they all mean. The story, so far as I can make it out, is like this. Some years ago this country house, Yoxley Old Place, was taken by an elderly man, who gave the name of Professor Coram. He was an invalid, keeping his bed half the time, and the other half hobbling round the house with a stick or being pushed about the grounds by the gardener in a Bath chair. He was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him, and he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man. His household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper, Mrs. Marker, and of a maid, Susan Tarlton. These have both been with him since his arrival, and they seem to be women of excellent character. The professor is writing a learned book, and he found it necessary, about a year ago, to engage a secretary. The first two that he tried were not successes, but the third, Mr. Willoughby Smith, a very young man straight from the university, seems to have been just what his employer wanted. His work consisted in writing all the morning to the professor&#x27;s dictation, and he usually spent the evening in hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next day&#x27;s work. This Willoughby Smith has nothing against him, either as a boy at Uppingham or as a young man at Cambridge. I have seen his testimonials, and from the first he was a decent, quiet, hard-worlding fellow, with no weak spot in him at all. And yet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the professor&#x27;s study under circumstances which can point only to murder.&quot; The wind howled and screamed at the windows. Holmes and I drew closer to the fire, while the young inspector slowly and point by point developed his singular narrative. &quot;If you were to search all England,&quot; said he, &quot;I don&#x27;t suppose you could find a household more self-contained or freer from outside influences. Whole weeks would pass, and not one of them go past the garden gate. The professor was buried in his work and existed for nothing else. Young Smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood, and lived very much as his employer did. The two women had nothing to take them from the house. Mortimer, the gardener, who wheels the Bath chair, is an army pensioner- an old Crimean man of excellent character. He does not live in the house, but in a three-roomed cottage at the other end of the garden. Those are the only people that you would find within the grounds of Yoxley Old Place. At the same time, the gate of the garden is a hundred yards from the main London to Chatham road. It opens with a latch, and there is nothing to prevent anyone from walking in. &quot;Now I will give you the evidence of Susan Tarlton, who is the only person who can say anything positive about the matter. It was in the forenoon, between eleven and twelve. She was engaged at the moment in hanging some curtains in the upstairs front bedroom. Professor Coram was still in bed, for when the weather is bad he seldom rises before midday. The housekeeper was busied with some work in the back of the house. Willoughby Smith had been in his bedroom, which he uses as a sitting-room, but the maid heard him at that moment pass along the passage and descend to the study immediately below her. She did not see him, but she says that she could not be mistaken in his quick, firm tread. She did not hear the study door close, but a minute or so later there was a dreadful cry in the room below. It was a wild, hoarse scream, so strange and unnatural that it might have come either from a man or a woman. At the same instant there was a heavy thud, which shook the old house, and then all was silence. The maid stood petrified for a moment, and then, recovering her courage, she ran downstairs. The study door was shut and she opened it. Inside, young Mr. Willoughby Smith was stretched upon the floor. At first she could see no injury, but as she tried to raise him she saw that blood was pouring from the underside of his neck. It was pierced by a very small but very deep wound, which had divided the carotid artery. The instrument with which the injury had been inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him. It was one of those small sealing-wax knives to be found on old-fashioned writing tables, with an ivory handle and a stiff blade. It was part of the fittings of the professor&#x27;s own desk. &quot;At first the maid thought that young Smith was already dead, but on pouring some water from the carafe over his forehead he opened his eyes for an instant. &#x27;The professor,&#x27; he murmured- &#x27;it was she.&#x27; The maid is prepared to swear that those were the exact words. He tried desperately to say something else, and he held his right hand up in the air. Then he fell back dead. &quot;In the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene, but she was just too late to catch the young man&#x27;s dying words. Leaving Susan with the body, she hurried to the professors room. He was sitting up in bed, horribly agitated, for he had heard enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred. Mrs. Marker is prepared to swear that the professor was still in his night-clothes, and indeed it was impossible for him to dress without the help of Mortimer, whose orders were to come at twelve o&#x27;clock. The professor declares that he heard the distant cry, but that he knows nothing more. He can give no explanation of the young man&#x27;s last words, &#x27;The professor- it was she,&#x27; but imagines that they were the outcome of delirium. He believes that Willoughby Smith had not an enemy in the world, and can give no reason for the crime. His first action was to send Mortimer, the gardener, for the local police. A little later the chief constable sent for me. Nothing was moved before I got there, and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths leading to the house. It was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. There was really nothing wanting.&quot; &quot;Except Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&quot; said my companion, with a somewhat bitter smile. &quot;Well, let us hear about it. What sort of a job did you make of it?&quot; &quot;I must ask you first, Mr. Holmes, to glance at this rough plan, which will give you a general idea of the position of the professor&#x27;s study and the various points of the case. It will help you in my investigation.&quot; He unfolded the rough chart, which I here reproduce, and he laid it across Holmes&#x27;s knee. I rose and, standing behind Holmes, studied it over his shoulder. (See illustration.) &quot;It is very rough, of course, and it only deals with the points which seem to me to be essential. All the rest you will see later for yourself. Now, first of all, presuming that the assassin entered the house, how did he or she come in? Undoubtedly by the garden path and the back door, from which there is direct access to the study. Any other way would have been exceedingly complicated. The escape must have also been made along that line, for of the two other exits from the room one was blocked by Susan as she ran downstairs and the other leads straight to the professor&#x27;s bedroom. I therefore directed my attention at once to the garden path, which was saturated with recent rain, and would certainly show any footmarks. &quot;My examination showed me that I was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal. No footmarks were to be found on the path. There could be no question, however, that someone had passed along the grass border which lines the path, and that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a track. I could not find anything in the nature of a distinct impression, but the grass was trodden down, and someone had undoubtedly passed. It could only have been the murderer, since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning, and the rain had only begun during the night.&quot; &quot;One moment,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Where does this path lead to?&quot; &quot;To the road.&quot; &quot;How long is it?&quot; &quot;A hundred yards or so.&quot; &quot;At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, the path was tiled at that point.&quot; &quot;Well, on the road itself?&quot; &quot;No, it was all trodden into mire.&quot; &quot;Tut-tut! Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?&quot; &quot;It was impossible to say. There was never any outline.&quot; &quot;A large foot or a small?&quot; &quot;You could not distinguish.&quot; Holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience. &quot;It has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since,&quot; said be. &quot;It will be harder to read now than that palimpsest. Well, well, it can&#x27;t be helped. What did you do, Hopkins, after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing?&quot; &quot;I think I made certain of a good deal, Mr. Holmes. I knew that someone had entered the house cautiously from without. I next examined the corridor. It is lined with cocoanut matting and had taken no impression of any kind. This brought me into the study itself. It is a scantily furnished room. The main article is a large writing-table with a fixed bureau. This bureau consists of a double column of drawers, with a central small cupboard between them. The drawers were open, the cupboard locked. The drawers, it seems, were always open, and nothing of value was kept in them. There were some papers of importance in the cupboard, but there were no signs that this had been tampered with, and the professor assures me that nothing was missing. It is certain that no robbery has been committed. &quot;I come now to the body of the young man. It was found near the bureau, and just to the left of it, as marked upon that chart. The stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind forward, so that it is almost impossible that it could have been self-inflicted.&quot; &quot;Unless he fell upon the knife,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Exactly. The idea crossed my mind. But we found the knife some feet away from the body, so that seems impossible. Then, of course, there are the man&#x27;s own dying words. And, finally, there was this very important piece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead man&#x27;s right hand.&quot; From his pocket Stanley Hopkins drew a small paper packet. He unfolded it and disclosed a golden pince-nez, with two broken ends of black silk cord dangling from the end of it. &quot;Willoughby Smith had excellent sight,&quot; he added. &quot;There can be no question that this was snatched from the face or the person of the assassin.&quot; Sherlock Holmes took the glasses into his hand, and examined them with the utmost attention and interest. He held them on his nose, endeavoured to read through them, went to the window and stared up the street with them, looked at them most minutely in the full light of the lamp, and finally, with a chuckle, seated himself at the table and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper, which he tossed across to Stanley Hopkins. &quot;That&#x27;s the best I can do for you,&quot; said he. &quot;It may prove to be of some use.&quot; The astonished detective read the note aloud. It ran as follows: &quot;Wanted, a woman of good address, attired like a lady. She has a remarkably thick nose, with eyes which are set close upon either side of it. She has a puckered forehead, a peering expression, and probably rounded shoulders. There are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months. As her glasses are of remarkable strength, and as opticians are not very numerous, there should be no difficulty in tracing her.&quot; Holmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins, which must have been reflected upon my features. &quot;Surely my deductions are simplicity itself,&quot; said he. &quot;It would be difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses, especially so remarkable a pair as these. That they belong to a woman I infer from their delicacy, and also, of course, from the last words of the dying man. As to her being a person of refinement and well dressed, they are, as you perceive, handsomely mounted in solid gold, and it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other respects. You will find that the clips are too wide for your nose, showing that the lady&#x27;s nose was very broad at the base. This sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one, but there is a sufficient number of exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or from insisting upon this point in my description. My own face is a narrow one, and yet I find that I cannot get my eyes into the centre, nor near the centre, of these glasses. Therefore, the lady&#x27;s eyes are set very near to the sides of the nose. You will perceive, Watson, that the glasses are concave and of unusual strength. A lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision, which are seen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the shoulders.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;I can follow each of your arguments. I confess, however, that I am unable to understand how you arrive at the double visit to the optician.&quot; Holmes took the glasses in his hand. &quot;You will perceive,&quot; he said, &quot;that the clips are lined with tiny bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose. One of these is discoloured and worn to some slight extent, but the other is new. Evidently one has fallen off and been replaced. I should judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few months. They exactly correspond, so I gather that the lady went back to the same establishment for the second.&quot; &quot;By George, it&#x27;s marvellous!&quot; cried Hopkins, in an ecstasy of admiration. &quot;To think that I had all that evidence in my hand and never knew it! I had intended, however, to go the round of the London opticians.&quot; &quot;Of course you would. Meanwhile, have you anything more to tell us about the case?&quot; &quot;Nothing, Mr. Holmes. I think that you know as much as I do now- probably more. We have had inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the country roads or at the railway station. We have heard of none. What beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime. Not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest.&quot; &quot;Ah! there I am not in a position to help you. But I suppose you want us to come out to-morrow?&quot; &quot;If it is not asking too much, Mr. Holmes. There&#x27;s a train from Charing Cross to Chatham at six in the morning, and we should be at Yoxley Old Place between eight and nine.&quot; &quot;Then we shall take it. Your case has certainly some features of great interest, and I shall be delighted to look into it. Well, it&#x27;s nearly one, and we had best get a few hours&#x27; sleep. I daresay you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire. I&#x27;ll light my spirit lamp, and give you a cup of coffee before we start.&quot; The gale had blown itself out next day, but it was a bitter morning when we started upon our journey. We saw the cold winter sun rise over the dreary marshes of the Thames and the long, sudden reaches of the river, which I shall ever associate with our pursuit of the Andaman Islander in the earlier days of our career. After a long and weary journey, we alighted at a small station some miles from Chatham. While a horse was being put into a trap at the local inn, we snatched a hurried breakfast, and so we were all ready for business when we at last arrived at Yoxley Old Place. A constable met us at the garden gate. &quot;Well, Wilson, any news?&quot; &quot;No, sir- nothing.&quot; &quot;No reports of any stranger seen?&quot; &quot;No, sir. Down at the station they are certain that no stranger either came or went yesterday.&quot; &quot;Have you had inquiries made at inns and lodgings?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir: there is no one that we cannot account for.&quot; &quot;Well, it&#x27;s only a reasonable walk to Chatham. Anyone might stay there or take a train without being observed. This is the garden path of which I spoke, Mr. Holmes. I&#x27;ll pledge my word there was no mark on it yesterday.&quot; &quot;On which side were the marks on the grass?&quot; &quot;This side, sir. This narrow margin of grass between the path and the flowerbed. I can&#x27;t see the traces now, but they were clear to me then.&quot; &quot;Yes, yes: someone has passed along,&quot; said Holmes, stooping over the grass border. &quot;Our lady must have picked her steps carefully, must she not, since on the one side she would leave a track on the path, and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand.&quot; I saw an intent look pass over Holmes&#x27;s face. &quot;You say that she must have come back this way?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir, there is no other.&quot; &quot;On this strip of grass?&quot; &quot;Certainly, Mr. Holmes.&quot; &quot;Hum! It was a very remarkable performance- very remarkable. Well, I think we have exhausted the path. Let us go farther. This garden door is usually kept open, I suppose? Then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in. The idea of murder was not in her mind, or she would have provided herself with some sort of weapon, instead of having to pick this knife off the writing-table. She advanced along this corridor, leaving no traces upon the cocoanut matting. Then she found herself in this study. How long was she there? We have no means of judging.&quot; &quot;Not more than a few minutes, sir. I forgot to tell you that Mrs. Marker, the housekeeper, had been in there tidying not very, long before- about a quarter of an hour, she says.&quot; &quot;Well, that gives us a limit. Our lady enters this room, and what does she do? She goes over to the writing-table. What for? Not for anything in the drawers. If there had been anything worth her taking, it would surely have been locked up. No, it was for something in that wooden bureau. Halloa! what is that scratch upon the face of it? Just hold a match, Watson. Why did you not tell me of this, Hopkins?&quot; The mark which he was examining began upon the brasswork on the righthand side of the keyhole, and extended for about four inches, where it had scratched the varnish from the surface. &quot;I noticed it, Mr. Holmes, but you&#x27;ll always find scratches round a keyhole.&quot; &quot;This is recent, quite recent. See how the brass shines where it is cut. An old scratch would be the same colour as the surface. Look at it through my lens. There&#x27;s the varnish, too, like earth on each side of a furrow. Is Mrs. Marker there?&quot; A sad-faced, elderly woman came into the room. &quot;Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;Did you notice this scratch?&quot; &quot;No, sir, I did not.&quot; &quot;I am sure you did not, for a duster would have swept away these shreds of varnish. Who has the key of this bureau?&quot; &quot;The Professor keeps it on his watch-chain.&quot; &quot;Is it a simple key?&quot; &quot;No, sir, it is a Chubb&#x27;s key.&quot; &quot;Very good. Mrs. Marker, you can go. Now we are making a little progress. Our lady enters the room, advances to the bureau, and either opens it or tries to do so. While she is thus engaged, young Willoughby Smith enters the room. In her hurry to withdraw the key, she makes this scratch upon the door. He seizes her, and she, snatching up the nearest object, which happens to be this knife, strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold. The blow is a fatal one. He falls and she escapes, either with or without the object for which she has come. Is Susan, the maid, there? Could anyone have got away through that door after the time that you heard the cry, Susan?&quot; &quot;No sir, it is impossible. Before I got down the stair, I&#x27;d have seen anyone in the passage. Besides, the door never opened, or I would have heard it.&quot; &quot;That settles this exit. Then no doubt the lady went out the way she came. I understand that this other passage leads only to the professor&#x27;s room. There is no exit that way?&quot; &quot;No, sir.&quot; &quot;We shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the professor. Halloa, Hopkins! this is very important, very important indeed. The professor&#x27;s corridor is also lined with cocoanut matting.&quot; &quot;Well, sir, what of that?&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t you see any bearing upon the case? Well, well. I don&#x27;t insist upon it. No doubt I am wrong. And yet it seems to me to be suggestive. Come with me and introduce me.&quot; We passed down the passage, which was of the same length as that which led to the garden. At the end was a short flight of steps ending in a door. Our guide knocked, and then ushered us into the professor&#x27;s bedroom. It was a very large chamber, lined with innumerable volumes, which had overflowed from the shelves and lay in piles in the corners, or were stacked all round at the base of the cases. The bed was in the centre of the room, and in it, propped up with pillows, was the owner of the house. I have seldom seen a more remarkable looking person. It was a gaunt, aquiline face which was turned towards us, with piercing dark eyes, which lurked in deep hollows under overhung and tufted brows. His hair and beard were white, save that the latter was curiously stained with yellow around his mouth. A cigarette glowed amid the tangle of white hair, and the air of the room was fetid with stale tobacco smoke. As he held out his hand to Holmes, I perceived that it was also stained with yellow nicotine. &quot;A smoker, Mr. Holmes?&quot; said he, speaking in well-chosen English, with a curious little mincing accent. &quot;Pray take a cigarette. And you, sir? I can recommend them, for I have them especially prepared by Ionides, of Alexandria. He sends me a thousand at a time, and I grieve to say that I have to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight. Bad, sir, very bad, but an old man has few pleasures. Tobacco and my work- that is all that is left to me.&quot; Holmes had lit a cigarette and was shooting little darting glances all over the room. &quot;Tobacco and my work, but now only tobacco,&quot; the old man exclaimed. &quot;Alas! what a fatal interruption! Who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe? So estimable a young man! I assure you that, after a few months&#x27; training, he was an admirable assistant. What do you think of the matter, Mr. Holmes?&quot; &quot;I have not yet made up my mind.&quot; &quot;I shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us. To a poor bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow is paralyzing. I seem to have lost the faculty of thought. But you are a man of action- you are a man of affairs. It is part of the everyday routine of your life. You can preserve your balance in every emergency. We are fortunate, indeed, in having you at our side.&quot; Holmes was pacing up and down one side of the room whilst the old professor was talking. I observed that he was smoking with extraordinary rapidity. It was evident that he shared our host&#x27;s liking for the fresh Alexandrian cigarettes. &quot;Yes, sir, it is a crushing blow,&quot; said the old man. &quot;That is my magnum opus- the pile of papers on the side table yonder. It is my analysis of the documents found in the Coptic monasteries of Syria and Egypt, a work which will cut deep at the very foundation of revealed religion. With my enfeebled health I do not know whether I shall ever be able to complete it, now that my assistant has been taken from me. Dear me! Mr. Holmes, why, you are even a quicker smoker than I am myself.&quot; Holmes smiled. &quot;I am a connoisseur,&quot; said he, taking another cigarette from the box- his fourth- and lighting it from the stub of that which he had finished. &quot;I will not trouble you with any lengthy cross-examination, Professor Coram, since I gather that you were in bed at the time of the crime, and could know nothing about it. I would only ask this: What do you imagine that this poor fellow meant by his last words: &#x27;The professor- it was she&#x27;?&quot; The professor shook his head. &quot;Susan is a country girl,&quot; said he, &quot;and you know the incredible stupidity of that class. I fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent delirious words, and that she twisted them into this meaningless message.&quot; &quot;I see. You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?&quot; &quot;Possibly an accident, possibly- I only breathe it among ourselves- a suicide. Young men have their hidden troubles- some affair of the heart, perhaps, which we have never known. It is a more probable supposition than murder.&quot; &quot;But the eyeglasses?&quot; &quot;Ah! I am only a student- a man of dreams. I cannot explain the practical things of life. But still, we are aware, my friend, that love-gages may take strange shapes. By all means take another cigarette. It is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so. A fan, a glove, glasses- who knows what article may be carried as a token or treasured when a man puts an end to his life? This gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass, but, after all, it is easy to be mistaken on such a point. As to the knife, it might well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as he fell. It is possible that I speak as a child, but to me it seems that Willoughby Smith has met his fate by his own hand.&quot; Holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward, and he continued to walk up and down for some time, lost in thought and consuming cigarette after cigarette. &quot;Tell me, Professor Coram,&quot; he said, at last, &quot;what is in that cupboard in the bureau?&quot; &quot;Nothing that would help a thief. Family papers, letters from my poor wife, diplomas of universities which have done me honour. Here is the key. You can look for yourself.&quot; Holmes picked up the key, and looked at it for an instant, then he handed it back. &quot;No, I hardly think that it would help me,&quot; said he. &quot;I should prefer to go quietly down to your garden, and turn the whole matter over in my head. There is something to be said for the theory of suicide which you have put forward. We must apologize for having intruded upon you, Professor Coram, and I promise that we won&#x27;t disturb you until after lunch. At two o&#x27;clock we will come again, and report to you anything which may have happened in the interval.&quot; Holmes was curiously distrait, and we walked up and down the garden path for some time in silence. &quot;Have you a clue?&quot; I asked, at last. &quot;It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked,&quot; said he. &quot;It is possible that I am utterly mistaken. The cigarettes will show me.&quot; &quot;My dear Holmes,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;how on earth-&quot; &quot;Well, well, you may see for yourself. If not, there&#x27;s no harm done. Of course, we always have the optician clue to fall back upon, but I take a short cut when I can get it. Ah, here is the good Mrs. Marker! Let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her.&quot; I may have remarked before that Holmes had, when he liked, a peculiarly ingratiating way with women, and that he very readily established terms of confidence with them. In half the time which he had named, he had captured the housekeeper&#x27;s goodwill and was chatting with her as if he had known her for years. &quot;Yes, Mr. Holmes, it is as you say, sir. He does smoke something terrible. All day and sometimes all night, sir. I&#x27;ve seen that room of a morning- well, sir, you&#x27;d have thought it was a London fog. Poor young Mr. Smith, he was a smoker also, but not as bad as the professor. His health- well, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better nor worse for the smoking.&quot; &quot;Ah!&quot; said Holmes, &quot;but it kills the appetite.&quot; &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t know about that, sir.&quot; &quot;I suppose the professor eats hardly anything?&quot; &quot;Well, he is variable. I&#x27;ll say that for him.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll wager he took no breakfast this morning, and won&#x27;t face his lunch after all the cigarettes I saw him consume.&quot; &quot;Well, you&#x27;re out there, sir, as it happens, for he ate a remarkable big breakfast this morning. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve known him make a better one, and he&#x27;s ordered a good dish of cutlets for his lunch. I&#x27;m surprised myself, for since I came into that room yesterday and saw young Mr. Smith lying there on the floor, I couldn&#x27;t bear to look at food. Well, it takes all sorts to make a world, and the professor hasn&#x27;t let it take his appetite away.&quot; We loitered the morning away in the garden. Stanley Hopkins had gone down to the village to look into some rumours of a strange woman who had been seen by some children on the Chatham Road the previous morning. As to my friend, all his usual energy seemed to have deserted him. I had never known him handle a case in such a half-hearted fashion. Even the news brought back by Hopkins that he had found the children, and that they had undoubtedly seen a woman exactly corresponding with Holmes&#x27;s description, and wearing either spectacles or eyeglasses, failed to rouse any sign of keen interest. He was more attentive when Susan, who waited upon us at lunch, volunteered the information that she believed Mr. Smith had been out for a walk yesterday morning, and that he had only returned half an hour before the tragedy occurred. I could not myself see the bearing of this incident, but I clearly perceived that Holmes was weaving it into the general scheme which he had formed in his brain. Suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch. &quot;Two o&#x27;clock, gentlemen,&quot; said he. &quot;We must go up and have it out with our friend, the professor.&quot; The old man had just finished his lunch, and certainly his empty dish bore evidence to the good appetite with which his housekeeper had credited him. He was, indeed, a weird figure as he turned his white mane and his glowing eyes towards us. The eternal cigarette smouldered in his mouth. He had been dressed and was seated in an armchair by the fire. &quot;Well, Mr. Holmes, have you solved this mystery yet?&quot; He shoved the large tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him towards my companion. Holmes stretched out his hand at the same moment, and between them they tipped the box over the edge. For a minute or two we were all on our knees retrieving stray cigarettes from impossible places. When we rose again, I observed Holmes&#x27;s eyes were shining and his cheeks tinged with colour. Only at a crisis have I seen those battle-signals flying. &quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;I have solved it.&quot; Stanley Hopkins and I stared in amazement. Something like a sneer quivered over the gaunt features of the old professor. &quot;Indeed! In the garden?&quot; &quot;No, here.&quot; &quot;Here! When?&quot; &quot;This instant.&quot; &quot;You are surely joking, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You compel me to tell you that this is too serious a matter to be treated in such a fashion.&quot; &quot;I have forged and tested every link of my chain, Professor Coram, and I am sure that it is sound. What your motives are, or what exact part you play in this strange business, I am not yet able to say. In a few minutes I shall probably hear it from your own lips. Meanwhile I will reconstruct what is past for your benefit, so that you may know the information which I still require. &quot;A lady yesterday entered your study. She came with the intention of possessing herself of certain documents which were in your bureau. She had a key of her own. I have had an opportunity of examining yours, and I do not find that slight discolouration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced. You were not an accessory, therefore, and she came, so far as I can read the evidence, without your knowledge to rob you.&quot; The professor blew a cloud from his lips. &quot;This is most interesting and instructive,&quot; said he. &quot;Have you no more to add? Surely, having traced this lady so far, you can also say what has become of her.&quot; &quot;I will endeavour to do so. In the first place she was seized by your secretary, and stabbed him in order to escape. This catastrophe I am inclined to regard as an unhappy accident, for I am convinced that the lady had no intention of inflicting so grievous an injury. An assassin does not come unarmed. Horrified by what she had done, she rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy. Unfortunately for her, she had lost her glasses in the scuffle, and as she was extremely shortsighted she was really helpless without them. She ran down a corridor, which she imagined to be that by which she had come- both were lined with cocoanut matting- and it was only when it was too late that she understood that she had taken the wrong passage, and that her retreat was cut off behind her. What was she to do? She could not go back. She could not remain where she was. She must go on. She went on. She mounted a stair, pushed open a door, and found herself in your room.&quot; The old man sat with his mouth open, staring wildly at Holmes. Amazement and fear were stamped upon his expressive features. Now, with an effort, he shrugged his shoulders and burst into insincere laughter. &quot;All very fine, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he. &quot;But there is one little flaw in your splendid theory. I was myself in my room, and I never left it during the day.&quot; &quot;I am aware of that, Professor Coram.&quot; &quot;And you mean to say that I could lie upon that bed and not be aware that a woman had entered my room?&quot; &quot;I never said so. You were aware of it. You spoke with her. You recognized her. You aided her to escape.&quot; Again the professor burst into high-keyed laughter. He had risen to his feet, and his eyes glowed like embers. &quot;You are mad!&quot; he cried. &quot;You are talking insanely. I helped her to escape? Where is she now?&quot; &quot;She is there,&quot; said Holmes, and he pointed to a high bookcase in the corner of the room. I saw the old man throw up his arms, a terrible convulsion passed over his grim face, and he fell back in his chair. At the same instant the bookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round upon a hinge, and a woman rushed out into the room. &quot;You are right!&quot; she cried, in a strange foreign voice. &quot;You are right! I am here.&quot; She was brown with the dust and draped with the cobwebs which had come from the walls of her hiding-place. Her face, too, was streaked with grime, and at the best she could never have been handsome, for she had the exact physical characteristics which Holmes had divined, with, in addition, a long and obstinate chin. What with her natural blindness, and what with the change from dark to light, she stood as one dazed, blinking about her to see where and who we were. And yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, there was a certain nobility in the woman&#x27;s bearing- a gallantry in the defiant chin and in the upraised head, which compelled something of respect and admiration. Stanley Hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm and claimed her as his prisoner, but she waved him aside gently, and yet with an over-mastering dignity which compelled obedience. The old man lay back in his chair with a twitching face, and stared at her with brooding eyes. &quot;Yes, sir, I am your prisoner,&quot; she said. &quot;From where I stood I could hear everything, and I know that you have learned the truth. I confess it all. It was I who killed the young man. But you are right- you who say it was an accident. I did not even know that it was a knife which I held in my hand, for in my despair I snatched anything from the table and struck at him to make him let me go. It is the truth that I tell.&quot; &quot;Madam,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;I am sure that it is the truth. I fear that you are far from well.&quot; She had turned a dreadful colour, the more ghastly under the dark dust-streaks upon her face. She seated herself on the side of the bed; then she resumed. &quot;I have only a little time here,&quot; she said, &quot;but I would have you to know the whole truth. I am this man&#x27;s wife. He is not an Englishman. He is a Russian. His name I will not tell.&quot; For the first time the old man stirred. &quot;God bless you, Anna!&quot; he cried. &quot;God bless you!&quot; She cast a look of the deepest disdain in his direction. &quot;Why should you cling so hard to that wretched life of yours, Sergius?&quot; said she. &quot;It has done harm to many and good to none- not even to yourself. However, it is not for me to cause the frail thread to be snapped before God&#x27;s time. I have enough already upon my soul since I crossed the threshold of this cursed house. But I must speak or I shall be too late. &quot;I have said, gentlemen, that I am this man&#x27;s wife. He was fifty and I a foolish girl of twenty when we married. It was in a city of Russia, a university- I will not name the place.&quot; &quot;God bless you, Anna!&quot; murmured the old man again. &quot;We were reformers- revolutionists- Nihilists, you understand. He and I and many more. Then there came a time of trouble, a police officer was killed, many were arrested, evidence was wanted, and in order to save his own life and to earn a great reward, my husband betrayed his own wife and his companions. Yes, we were all arrested upon his confession. Some of us found our way to the gallows, and some to Siberia. I was among these last, but my term was not for life. My husband came to England with his ill-gotten gains and has lived in quiet ever since, knowing well that if the Brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before justice would be done.&quot; The old man reached out a trembling hand and helped himself to a cigarette. &quot;I am in your hands, Anna,&quot; said he. &quot;You were always good to me.&quot; &quot;I have not yet told you the height of his villainy,&quot; said she. &quot;Among our comrades of the Order, there was one who was the friend of my heart. He was noble, unselfish, loving- all that my husband was not. He hated violence. We were all guilty- if that is guilt- but he was not. He wrote forever dissuading us from such a course. These letters would have saved him. So would my diary, in which, from day to day, I had entered both my feelings towards him and the view which each of us had taken. My husband found and kept both diary and letters. He hid them, and he tried hard to swear away the young man&#x27;s life. In this he failed, but Alexis was sent a convict to Siberia, where now, at this moment, he works in a salt mine. Think of that, you villain, you villain!- now, now, at this very moment, Alexis, a man whose name you are not worthy to speak, works and lives like a slave, and yet I have your life in my hands, and I let you go.&quot; &quot;You were always a noble woman, Anna,&quot; said the old man, puffing at his cigarette. She had risen, but she fell back again with a little cry of pain. &quot;I must finish,&quot; she said. &quot;When my term was over I set myself to get the diary and letters which, if sent to the Russian government, would procure my friend&#x27;s release. I knew that my husband had come to England. After months of searching I discovered where he was. I knew that he still had the diary, for when I was in Siberia I had a letter from him once, reproaching me and quoting some passages from its pages. Yet I was sure that, with his revengeful nature, he would never give it to me of his own free-will. I must get it for myself. With this object I engaged an agent from a private detective firm, who entered my husband&#x27;s house as a secretary- it was your second secretary, Sergius, the one who left you so hurriedly. He found that papers were kept in the cupboard, and he got an impression of the key. He would not go farther. He furnished me with a plan of the house, and he told me that in the forenoon the study was always empty, as the secretary was employed up here. So at last I took my courage in both hands, and I came down to get the papers for myself. I succeeded; but at what a cost! &quot;I had just taken the paper; and was locking the cupboard, when the young man seized me. I had seen him already that morning. He had met me on the road, and I had asked him to tell me where Professor Coram lived, not knowing that he was in his employ.&quot; &quot;Exactly! Exactly!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;The secretary came back, and told his employer of the woman he had met. Then, in his last breath, he tried to send a message that it was she- the she whom he had just discussed with him.&quot; &quot;You must let me speak,&quot; said the woman, in an imperative voice, and her face contracted as if in pain. &quot;When he had fallen I rushed from the room, chose the wrong door, and found myself in my husband&#x27;s room. He spoke of giving me up. I showed him that if he did so, his life was in my hands. If he gave me to the law, I could give him to the Brotherhood. It was not that I wished to live for my own sake, but it was that I desired to accomplish my purpose. He knew that I would do what I said- that his own fate was involved in mine. For that reason, and for no other, he shielded me. He thrust me into that dark hiding-place- a relic of old days, known only to himself. He took his meals in his own room, and so was able to give me part of his food. It was agreed that when the police left the house I should slip away by night and come back no more. But in some way you have read our plans.&quot; She tore from the bosom of her dress a small packet. &quot;These are my last words,&quot; said she; &quot;here is the packet which will save Alexis. I confide it to your honour and to your love of justice. Take it! You will deliver it at the Russian Embassy. Now, I have done my duty, and-&quot; &quot;Stop her!&quot; cried Holmes. He had bounded across the room and had wrenched a small phial from her hand. &quot;Too late!&quot; she said, sinking back on the bed. &quot;Too late! I took the poison before I left my hiding-place. My head swims! I am going! I charge you, sir, to remember the packet.&quot; &quot;A simple case, and yet, in some ways, an instructive one,&quot; Holmes remarked, as we travelled back to town. &quot;It hinged from the outset upon the pince-nez. But for the fortunate chance of the dying man having seized these, I am not sure that we could ever have reached our solution. It was clear to me, from the strength of the glasses, that the wearer must have been very blind and helpless when deprived of them. When you asked me to believe that she walked along a narrow strip of grass without once making a false step, I remarked, as you may remember, that it was a noteworthy performance. In my mind I set it down as an impossible performance, save in the unlikely case that she had a second pair of glasses. I was forced, therefore, to consider seriously the hypothesis that she had remained within the house. On perceiving the similarity of the two corridors, it became clear that she might very easily have made such a mistake, and, in that case, it was evident that she must have entered the professor&#x27;s room. I was keenly on the alert, therefore, for whatever would bear out this supposition, and I examined the room narrowly for anything in the shape of a hiding-place. The carpet seemed continuous and firmly nailed, so I dismissed the idea of a trap-door. There might well be a recess behind the books. As you are aware, such devices are common in old libraries. I observed that books were piled on the floor at all other points, but that one bookcase was left clear. This, then, might be the door. I could see no marks to guide me, but the carpet was of a dun colour, which lends itself very well to examination. I therefore smoked a great number of those excellent cigarettes, and I dropped the ash all over the space in front of the suspected bookcase. It was a simple trick, but exceedingly effective. I then went downstairs, and I ascertained, in your presence, Watson, without your perceiving the drift of my remarks, that Professor Coram&#x27;s consumption of food had increased- as one would expect when he is supplying a second person. We then ascended to the room again, when, by upsetting the cigarette-box, I obtained a very excellent view of the floor, and was able to see quite clearly, from the traces upon the cigarette ash, that the prisoner had in our absence come out from her retreat. Well, Hopkins, here we are at Charing Cross, and I congratulate you on having brought your case to a successful conclusion. You are going to headquarters, no doubt. I think, Watson, you and I will drive together to the Russian Embassy.&quot; -THE END- . 1924 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle &quot;It can&#x27;t hurt now,&quot; was Mr. Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s comment when, for the tenth time in as many years, I asked his leave to reveal the following narrative. So it was that at last I obtained permission to put on record what was, in some ways, the supreme moment of my friend&#x27;s career. Both Holmes and I had a weakness for the Turkish bath. It was over a smoke in the pleasant lassitude of the drying-room that I have found him less reticent and more human than anywhere else. On the upper floor of the Northumberland Avenue establishment there is an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side, and it was on these that we lay upon September 3, 1902, the day when my narrative begins. I had asked him whether anything was stirring, and for answer he had shot his long, thin, nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside him. &quot;It may be some fussy, self-important fool; it may be a matter of life or death,&quot; said he as he handed me the note. &quot;I know no more than this message tells me.&quot; It was from the Carlton Club and dated the evening before. This is what I read: Sir James Damery presents his compliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes and will call upon him at 4:30 to-morrow. Sir James begs to say that the matter upon which he desires to consult Mr. Holmes is very delicate and also very important. He trusts, therefore, that Mr. Holmes will make every effort to grant this interview, and that he will confirm it over the telephone to the Carlton Club. &quot;I need not say that I have confirmed it, Watson,&quot; said Holmes as I returned the paper. &quot;Do you know anything of this man Damery?&quot; &quot;Only that this name is a household word in society.&quot; &quot;Well, I can tell you a little more than that. He has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers. You may remember his negotiations with Sir George Lewis over the Hammerford Will case. He is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy. I am bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance.&quot; &quot;Our?&quot; &quot;Well, if you will be so good, Watson.&quot; &quot;I shall be honoured.&quot; &quot;Then you have the hour- 4:30. Until then we can put the matter out of our heads.&quot; I was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne Street at the time, but I was round at Baker Street before the time named. Sharp to the half-hour, Colonel Sir James Damery was announced. It is hardly necessary to describe him, for many will remember that large, bluff, honest personality, that broad, clean-shaven face, and, above all, that pleasant, mellow voice. Frankness shone from his gray Irish eyes, and good humour played round his mobile, smiling lips. His lucent top-hat, his dark frock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes, spoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous. The big, masterful aristocrat dominated the little room. &quot;Of course, I was prepared to find Dr. Watson,&quot; he remarked with a courteous bow. &quot;His collaboration may be very necessary, for we are dealing on this occasion, Mr. Holmes, with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will, literally, stick at nothing. I should say that there is no more dangerous man in Europe.&quot; &quot;I have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied,&quot; said Holmes with a smile. &quot;Don&#x27;t you smoke? Then you will excuse me if I light my pipe. If your man is more dangerous than the late Professor Moriarty, or than the living Colonel Sebastian Moran, then he is indeed worth meeting. May I ask his name?&quot; &quot;Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner?&quot; &quot;You mean the Austrian murderer?&quot; Colonel Damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh. &quot;There is no getting past you, Mr. Holmes! Wonderful! So you have already sized him up as a murderer?&quot; &quot;It is my business to follow the details of Continental crime. Who could possibly have read what happened at Prague and have any doubts as to the man&#x27;s guilt! It was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him! I am sure that he killed his wife when the so-called &#x27;accident&#x27; happened in the Splugen Pass as if I had seen him do it. I knew, also, that he had come to England and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do. Well, what has Baron Gruner been up to? I presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again?&quot; &quot;No, it is more serious than that. To revenge crime is important, but to prevent it is more so. It is a terrible thing, Mr. Holmes, to see a dreadful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself before your eyes, to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it. Can a human being be placed in a more trying position?&quot; &quot;Perhaps not.&quot; &quot;Then you will sympathize with the client in whose interests I am acting.&quot; &quot;I did not understand that you were merely an intermediary. Who is the principal?&quot; &quot;Mr. Holmes, I must beg you not to press that question. It is important that I should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter. His motives are, to the last degree, honourable and chivalrous, but he prefers to remain unknown. I need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand. Surely the actual name of your client is immaterial?&quot; &quot;I am sorry,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases, but to have it at both ends is too confusing. I fear, Sir James, that I must decline to act.&quot; Our visitor was greatly disturbed. His large, sensitive face was darkened with emotion and disappointment. &quot;You hardly realize the effect of your own action, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he. &quot;You place me in a most serious dilemma, for I am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if I could give you the facts, and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all. May I, at least, lay all that I can before you?&quot; &quot;By all means, so long as it is understood that I commit myself to nothing.&quot; &quot;That is understood. In the first place, you have no doubt heard of General de Merville?&quot; &quot;De Merville of Khyber fame? Yes, I have heard of him.&quot; &quot;He has a daughter, Violet de Merville, young, rich, beautiful, accomplished, a wonder-woman in every way. It is this daughter, this lovely, innocent girl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend.&quot; &quot;Baron Gruner has some hold over her, then?&quot; &quot;The strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned- the hold of love. The fellow is, as you may have heard, extraordinarily handsome, with a most fascinating manner, a gentle voice, and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman. He is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact.&quot; &quot;But how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of Miss Violet de Merville?&quot; &quot;It was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage. The company, though select, paid their own passages. No doubt the promoters hardly realized the Baron&#x27;s true character until it was too late. The villain attached himself to the lady, and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart. To say that she loves him hardly expresses it. She dotes upon him; she is obsessed by him. Outside of him there is nothing on earth. She will not hear one word against him. Everything has been done to cure her of her madness, but in vain. To sum up, she proposes to marry him next month. As she is of age and has a will of iron, it is hard to know how to prevent her.&quot; &quot;Does she know about the Austrian episode?&quot; &quot;The cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life, but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr. She absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other.&quot; &quot;Dear me! But surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client? It is no doubt General de Merville.&quot; Our visitor fidgeted in his chair. &quot;I could deceive you by saying so, Mr. Holmes, but it would not be true. De Merville is a broken man. The strong soldier has been utterly demoralized by this incident. He has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak, doddering old man, utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant, forceful rascal like this Austrian. My client, however, is an old friend, one who has known the General intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks. He cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it. There is nothing in which Scotland Yard can act. It was his own suggestion that you should be called in, but it was, as I have said, on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter. I have no doubt, Mr. Holmes, with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me, but I must ask you, as a point of honour, to refrain from doing so, and not to break in upon his incognito.&quot; Holmes gave a whimsical smile. &quot;I think I may safely promise that,&quot; said he. &quot;I may add that your problem interests me, and that I shall be prepared to look into it. How shall I keep in touch with you?&quot; &quot;The Carlton Club will find me. But in case of emergency, there is a private telephone call, &#x27;XX.31.&#x27;&quot; Holmes noted it down and sat, still smiling, with the open memorandum-book upon his knee. &quot;The Baron&#x27;s present address, please?&quot; &quot;Vernon Lodge, near Kingston. It is a large house. He has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man, which naturally makes him a more dangerous antagonist.&quot; &quot;Is he at home at present?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Apart from what you have told me, can you give me any further information about the man?&quot; &quot;He has expensive tastes. He is a horse fancier. For a short time he played polo at Hurlingham, but then this Prague affair got noised about and he had to leave. He collects books and pictures. He is a man with a considerable artistic side to his Nature. He is, I believe, a recognized authority upon Chinese pottery and has written a book upon the subject.&quot; &quot;A complex mind,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;All great criminals have that. My old friend Charlie Peace was a violin virtuoso. Wainwright was no mean artist. I could quote many more. Well, Sir James, you will inform your client that I am turning my mind upon Baron Gruner. I can say no more. I have some sources of information of my own, and I dare say we may find some means of opening the matter up.&quot; When our visitor had left us Holmes sat so long in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence. At last, however, he came briskly back to earth. &quot;Well, Watson, any views?&quot; he asked. &quot;I should think you had better see the young lady herself.&quot; &quot;My dear Watson, if her poor old broken father cannot move her, how shall I, a stranger, prevail? And yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails. But I think we must begin from a different angle. I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson might be a help.&quot; I have not had occasion to mention Shinwell Johnson in these memoirs because I have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my friend&#x27;s career. During the first years of the century he became a valuable assistant. Johnson, I grieve to say, made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst. Finally he repented and allied himself to Holmes, acting as his agent in the huge criminal under-world of London and obtaining information which often proved to be of vital importance. Had Johnson been a &quot;nark&quot; of the police he would soon have been exposed, but as he dealt with cases which never came directly into the courts, his activities were never realized by his companions. With the glamour of his two convictions upon him, he had the entree of every nightclub, doss house, and gambling-den in the town, and his quick observation and active brain made him an ideal agent for gaining information. It was to him that Sherlock Holmes now proposed to turn. It was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my friend, for I had some pressing professional business of my own, but I met him by appointment that evening at Simpson&#x27;s, where, sitting at a small table in the front window and looking down at the rushing stream of life in the Strand, he told me something of what had passed. &quot;Johnson is on the prowl,&quot; said he. &quot;He may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld, for it is down there, amid the black roots of crime, that we must hunt for this man&#x27;s secrets.&quot; &quot;But if the lady will not accept what is already known, why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose?&quot; &quot;Who knows, Watson? Woman&#x27;s heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the male. Murder might be condoned or explained, and yet some smaller offence might rankle. Baron Gruner remarked to me-&quot; &quot;He remarked to you!&quot; &quot;Oh, to be sure, I had not told you of my plans. Well, Watson, I love to come to close grips with my man. I like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of. When I had given Johnson his instructions I took a cab out to Kingston and found the Baron in a most affable mood.&quot; &quot;Did he recognize you?&quot; &quot;There was no difficulty about that, for I simply sent in my card. He is an excellent antagonist, cool as ice, silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants, and poisonous as a cobra. He has breeding in him- a real aristocrat of crime, with a superficial suggestion of afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it. Yes, I am glad to have had my attention called to Baron Adelbert Gruner.&quot; &quot;You say he was affable?&quot; &quot;A purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice. Some people&#x27;s affability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls. His greeting was characteristic. &#x27;I rather thought I should see you sooner or later, Mr. Holmes,&#x27; said he. &#x27;You have been engaged, no doubt by General de Merville, to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter, Violet. That is so, is it not?&#x27; &quot;I acquiesced. &quot;&#x27;My dear man,&#x27; said he, &#x27;you will only ruin your own well-deserved reputation. It is not a case in which you can possibly succeed. You will have barren work, to say nothing of incurring some danger. Let me very strongly advise you to draw off at once.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;It is curious,&#x27; I answered, &#x27;but that was the very advice which I had intended to give you. I have a respect for your brains, Baron, and the little which I have seen of your personality has not lessened it. Let me put it to you as man to man. No one wants to rake up your past and make you unduly uncomfortable. It is over, and you are now in smooth waters, but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm of powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made England too hot to hold you. Is the game worth it? Surely you would be wiser if you left the lady alone. It would not be pleasant for you if these facts of your past were brought to her notice.&#x27; &quot;The Baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose, like the short antennae of an insect. These quivered with amusement as he listened, and he finally broke into a gentle chuckle. &quot;&#x27;Excuse my amusement, Mr. Holmes,&#x27; said he, &#x27;but it is really funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it. I don&#x27;t think anyone could do it better, but it is rather pathetic, all the same. Not a colour card there, Mr. Holmes, nothing but the smallest of the small.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;So you think.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;So I know. Let me make the thing clear to you, for my own hand is so strong that I can afford to show it. I have been fortunate enough to win the entire affection of this lady. This was given to me in spite of the fact that I told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents in my past life. I also told her that certain wicked and designing persons- I hope you recognize yourself- would come to her and tell her these things, and I warned her how to treat them. You have heard of post-hypnotic suggestion, Mr. Holmes? Well, you will see how it works, for a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery. So she is ready for you and, I have no doubt, would give you an appointment, for she is quite amenable to her father&#x27;s will- save only in the one little matter.&#x27; &quot;Well, Watson, there seemed to be no more to say, so I took my leave with as much cold dignity as I could summon, but, as I had my hand on the door-handle, he stopped me. &quot;&#x27;By the way, Mr. Holmes,&#x27; said he, &#x27;did you know Le Brun, the French agent?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Yes,&#x27; said I. &quot;&#x27;Do you know what befell him?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I heard that he was beaten by some Apaches in the Montmartre district and crippled for life.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Quite true, Mr. Holmes. By a curious coincidence he had been inquiring into my affairs only a week before. Don&#x27;t do it, Mr. Holmes; it&#x27;s not a lucky thing to do. Several have found that out. My last word to you is, go your own way and let me go mine. Good-bye!&#x27; &quot;So there you are, Watson. You are up to date now.&quot; &quot;The fellow seems dangerous.&quot; &quot;Mighty dangerous. I disregard the blusterer, but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means.&quot; &quot;Must you interfere? Does it really matter if he marries the girl?&quot; &quot;Considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife, I should say it mattered very much. Besides, the client! Well, we need not discuss that. When you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me, for the blithe Shinwell will be there with his report.&quot; We found him sure enough, a huge, coarse, red-faced, scorbutic man, with a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of the very cunning mind within. It seems that he had dived down into what was peculiarly his kingdom, and beside him on the settee was a brand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim, flame-like young, woman with a pale, intense face, youthful, and yet so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous mark upon her. &quot;This is Miss Kitty Winter,&quot; said Shinwell Johnson, waving his fat hand as an introduction. &quot;What she don&#x27;t know- well, there, she&#x27;ll speak for herself. Put my hand right on her, Mr. Holmes, within an hour of your message.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m easy to find,&quot; said the young woman. &quot;Hell, London, gets me every time. Same address for Porky Shinwell. We&#x27;re old mates, Porky, you and I. But, by cripes! there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world! That is the man you are after, Mr. Holmes.&quot; Holmes smiled. &quot;I gather we have your good wishes, Miss Winter.&quot; &quot;If I can help to put him where he belongs, I&#x27;m yours to the rattle,&quot; said our visitor with fierce energy. There was an intensity of hatred in her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain. &quot;You needn&#x27;t go into my past, Mr. Holmes. That&#x27;s neither here nor there. But what I am Adelbert Gruner made me. If I could pull him down!&quot; She clutched frantically with her hands into the air. &quot;Oh, if I could only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so many!&quot; &quot;You know how the matter stands?&quot; &quot;Porky Shinwell has been telling me. He&#x27;s after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time. You want to stop it. Well, you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him.&quot; &quot;She is not in her senses. She is madly in love. She has been told all about him. She cares nothing.&quot; &quot;Told about the murder?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;My Lord, she must have a nerve!&quot; &quot;She puts them all down as slanders.&quot; &quot;Couldn&#x27;t you lay proofs before her silly eyes?&quot; &quot;Well, can you help us do so?&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a proof myself? If I stood before her and told her how he used me-&quot; &quot;Would you do this?&quot; &quot;Would I? Would I not!&quot; &quot;Well, it might be worth trying. But he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her, and I understand she will not reopen the question.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll lay he didn&#x27;t tell her all&quot; said Miss Winter. &quot;I caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss. He would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say: &#x27;He died within a month.&#x27; It wasn&#x27;t hot air, either. But I took little notice- you see, I loved him myself at that time. Whatever he did went with me, same as with this poor fool! There was just one thing that shook me. Yes, by cripes! if it had not been for his poisonous, lying, tongue that explains and soothes, I&#x27;d have left him that very night. It&#x27;s a book he has- a brown leather book with a lock, and his arms in gold on the outside. I think he was a bit drunk that night, or he would not have shown it to me.&quot; &quot;What was it, then?&quot; &quot;I tell you, Mr. Holmes, this man collects women, and takes a pride in his collection, as some men collect moths or butterflies. He had it all in that book. Snapshot photographs, names, details, everything about them. It was a beastly book- a book no man, even if he had come from the gutter, could have put together. But it was Adelbert Gruner&#x27;s book all the same. &#x27;Souls I have ruined.&#x27; He could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded. However, that&#x27;s neither here nor there, for the book would not serve you, and, if it would, you can&#x27;t get it.&quot; &quot;Where is it?&quot; &quot;How can I tell you where it is now? It&#x27;s more than a year since I left him. I know where he kept it then. He&#x27;s a precise, tidy cat of a man in many of his ways, so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the old bureau in the inner study. Do you know his house?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve been in the study,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Have you, though? You haven&#x27;t been slow on the job if you only started this morning. Maybe dear Adelbert has met his match this time. The outer study is the one with the Chinese crockery in it- big glass cupboard between the windows. Then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study- a small room where he keeps pipers and things.&quot; &quot;Is he not afraid of burglars?&quot; &quot;Adelbert is no coward. His worst enemy couldn&#x27;t say that of him. He can look after himself. There&#x27;s a burglar alarm at night. Besides, what is there for a burglar- unless they got away with all this fancy crockery?&quot; &quot;No good,&quot; said Shinwell Johnson with the decided voice of the expert. &quot;No fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell.&quot; &quot;Quite so,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Well, now, Miss Winter, if you would call here to-morrow evening at five, I would consider in the meanwhile whether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be arranged. I am exceedingly obliged to you for your cooperation. I need not say that my clients will consider liberally-&quot; &quot;None of that, Mr. Holmes,&quot; cried the young woman. &quot;I am not out for money. Let me see this man in the mud, and I&#x27;ve got all I&#x27;ve worked for- in the mud with my foot on his cursed face. That&#x27;s my price. I&#x27;m with you to-morrow or any other day so long as you are on his track. Porky here can tell you always where to find me.&quot; I did not see Holmes again until the following evening when we dined once more at our Strand restaurant. He shrugged his shoulders when I asked him what luck he had had in his interview. Then he told the story, which I would repeat in this way. His hard, dry statement needs some little editing to soften it into the terms of real life. &quot;There was no difficulty at all about the appointment,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all secondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it in her engagement. The General &#x27;phoned that all was ready, and the fiery Miss W. turned up according to schedule, so that at half-past five a cab deposited us outside 104 Berkeley Square, where the old soldier resides- one of those awful gray London castles which would make a church seem frivolous. A footman showed us in to a great yellow-curtained drawing-room, and there was the lady awaiting us, demure, pale, self-contained, as inflexible and remote as a snow image on a mountain. &quot;I don&#x27;t quite know how to make her clear to you, Watson. Perhaps you may meet her before we are through, and you can use your own gift of words. She is beautiful, but with the ethereal other-world beauty of some fanatic whose thoughts are set on high. I have seen such faces in the pictures of the old masters of the Middle Ages. How a beastman could have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond I cannot imagine. You may have noticed how extremes call to each other, the spiritual to the animal, the cave-man to the angel. You never saw a worse case than this. &quot;She knew what we had come for, of course- that villain had lost no time in poisoning her mind against us. Miss Winter&#x27;s advent rather amazed her, I think, but she waved us into our respective chairs like a reverend abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants. If your head is inclined to swell, my dear Watson, take a course of Miss Violet de Merville. &quot;&#x27;Well, sir,&#x27; said she in a voice like the wind from an iceberg, &#x27;your name is familiar to me. You have called, as I understand, to malign my fiance, Baron Gruner. It is only by my father&#x27;s request that I see you at all, and I warn you in advance that anything you can say could not possibly have the slightest effect upon my mind.&#x27; &quot;I was sorry for her, Watson. I thought of her for the moment as I would have thought of a daughter of my own. I am not often eloquent. I use my head, not my heart. But I really did plead with her with all the warmth of words that I could find in my nature. I pictured to her the awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man&#x27;s character after she is his wife- a woman who has to submit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous lips. I spared her nothing- the shame, the fear, the agony, the hopelessness of it all. All my hot words could not bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those abstracted eyes. I thought of what the rascal had said about a post-hypnotic influence. One could really believe that she was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream. Yet there was nothing indefinite in her replies. &quot;&#x27;I have listened to you with patience, Mr. Holmes,&#x27; said she. &#x27;The effect upon my mind is exactly as predicted. I am aware that Adelbert, that my fiance, has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust aspersions. You are only the last of a series who have brought their slanders before me. Possibly you mean well, though I learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally willing to act for the Baron as against him. But in any case I wish you to understand once for all that I love him and that he loves me, and that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter of those birds outside the window. If his noble nature has ever for an instant fallen, it may be that I have been specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level. I am not clear&#x27;- here she turned eyes upon my companion-&#x27; who this young lady may be.&#x27; &quot;I was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind. If ever you saw flame and ice face to face, it was those two women. &quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ll tell you who I am,&#x27; she cried, springing out of her chair, her mouth all twisted with passion- &#x27;I am his last mistress. I am one of a hundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the refuse heap, as he will you also. Your refuse heap is more likely to be a grave, and maybe that&#x27;s the best. I tell you, you foolish woman, if you marry this man he&#x27;ll be the death of you. It may be a broken heart or it may be a broken neck, but he&#x27;ll have you one way or the other. It&#x27;s not out of love for you I&#x27;m speaking. I don&#x27;t care a tinker&#x27;s curse whether you live or die. It&#x27;s out of hate for him and to spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me. But it&#x27;s all the same, and you needn&#x27;t look at me like that, my fine lady, for you may be lower than I am before you are through with it.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;I should prefer not to discuss such matters,&#x27; said Miss de Merville coldly. &#x27;Let me say once for all that I am aware of three passages in my fiance&#x27;s life in which he became entangled with designing women, and that I am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may have done.&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Three passages!&#x27; screamed my companion. &#x27;You fool! You unutterable fool!&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Mr. Holmes, I beg that you will bring this interview to an end,&#x27; said the icy voice. &#x27;I have obeyed my father&#x27;s wish in seeing you, but I am not compelled to listen to the ravings of this person.&#x27; &quot;With an oath Miss Winter darted forward, and if I had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair. I dragged her towards the door and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene, for she was beside herself with rage. In a cold way I felt pretty furious myself, Watson, for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save. So now once again you know exactly how we stand, and it is clear that I must plan some fresh opening move, for this gambit won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll keep in touch with you, Watson, for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play, though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us.&quot; And it did. Their blow fell- or his blow rather, for never could I believe that the lady was privy to it. I think I could show you the very paving-stone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon the placard, and a pang of horror passed through my very soul. It was between the Grand Hotel and Charing Cross Station, where a one-legged news-vender displayed his evening papers. The date was just two days after the last conversation. There, black upon yellow, was the terrible news-sheet: MURDEROUS ATTACK UPON SHERLOCK HOLMES I think I stood stunned for some moments. Then I have a confused recollection of snatching at a paper, of the remonstrance of the man, whom I had not paid, and, finally, of standing in the doorway of a chemist&#x27;s shop while I turned up the fateful paragraph. This was how it ran: We learn with regret that Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the well-known private detective, was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has left him in a precarious position. There are no exact details to hand, but the event seems to have occurred about twelve o&#x27;clock in Regent Street, outside the Cafe Royal. The attack was made by two men armed with sticks, and Mr. Holmes was beaten about the head and body, receiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious. He was carried to Charing Cross Hospital and afterwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in Baker Street. The miscreants who attacked him appear to have been respectably dressed men, who escaped from the bystanders by passing through the Cafe Royal and out into Glasshouse Street behind it. No doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity which has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man. I need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph before I had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to Baker Street. I found Sir Leslie Oakshott, the famous surgeon, in the hall and his brougham waiting at the curb. &quot;No immediate danger,&quot; was his report. &quot;Two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises. Several stitches have been necessary. Morphine has been injected and quiet is essential, but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden.&quot; With this permission I stole into the darkened room. The sufferer was wide awake, and I heard my name in a hoarse whisper. The blind was three-quarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck the bandaged head of the injured man. A crimson patch had soaked through the white linen compress. I sat beside him and bent my head. &quot;All right Watson. Don&#x27;t look so scared,&quot; he muttered in a very weak voice. &quot;It&#x27;s not as bad as it seems.&quot; &quot;Thank God for that!&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know. I took most of them on my guard. It was the second man that was too much for me.&quot; &quot;What can I do, Holmes? Of course, it was that damned fellow who set them on. I&#x27;ll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word.&quot; &quot;Good old Watson! No, we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men. But their get-away had been well prepared. We may be sure of that. Wait a little. I have my plans. The first thing is to exaggerate my injuries. They&#x27;ll come to you for news. Put it on thick, Watson. Lucky if I live the week out- concussion- delirium- what you like! You can&#x27;t overdo it.&quot; &quot;But Sir Leslie Oakshott?&quot; &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s all right. He shall see the worst side of me. I&#x27;ll look after that.&quot; &quot;Anything else?&quot; &quot;Yes. Tell Shinwell Johnson to get that girl out of the way. Those beauties will be after her now. They know, of course, that she was with me in the case. If they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her. That is urgent. Do it to-night.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll go now. Anything more?&quot; &quot;Put my pipe on the table- and the tobacco-slipper. Right! Come in each morning and we will plan our campaign.&quot; I arranged with Johnson that evening to take Miss Winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past. For six days the public were under the impression that Holmes was at the door of death. The bulletins were very grave and there were sinister paragraphs in the papers. My continual visits assured me that it was not so bad as that. His wiry constitution and his determined will were working wonders. He was recovering fast, and I had suspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he pretended even to me. There was a curious secretive streak in the man which led to many dramatic effects, but left even his closest friends guessing as to what his exact plans might be. He pushed to an extreme the axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone. I was nearer him than anyone else, and yet I was always conscious of the gap between. On the seventh day the stitches were taken out, in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers. The same evening papers had an announcement which I was bound, sick or well, to carry to my friend. It was simply that among the passengers on the Cunard boat Ruritania, starting from Liverpool on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert Gruner, who had some important financial business to settle in the States before his impending wedding to Miss Violet de Merville, only daughter of, etc., etc. Holmes listened to the news with a cold, concentrated look upon his pale face, which told me that it hit him hard. &quot;Friday!&quot; he cried. &quot;Only three clear days. I believe the rascal wants to put himself out of danger&#x27;s way. But he won&#x27;t, Watson! By the Lord Harry, he won&#x27;t! Now, Watson, I want you to do something for me.&quot; &quot;I am here to be used, Holmes.&quot; &quot;Well, then, spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of Chinese pottery.&quot; He gave no explanations and I asked for none. By long experience I had learned the wisdom of obedience. But when I had left his room I walked down Baker Street, revolving in my head how on earth I was to carry out so strange an order. Finally I drove to the London Library in St. James&#x27;s Square, put the matter to my friend Lomax, the sublibrarian, and departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm. It is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that he can examine an expert witness upon the Monday has forgotten all his forced knowledge before the Saturday. Certainly I should not like now to pose as an authority upon ceramics. And yet all that evening, and all that night with a short interval for rest, and all next morning, I was sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory. There I learned of the hall-marks of the great artist-decorators, of the mystery of cyclical dates, the marks of the Hung-wu and the beauties of the Yung-lo, the writings of Tang-ying, and the glories of the primitive period of the Sung and the Yuan. I was charged with all this information when I called upon Holmes next evening. He was out of bed now, though you would not have guessed it from the published reports, and he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite armchair. &quot;Why, Holmes,&quot; I said, &quot;if one believed the papers, you are dying.&quot; &quot;That,&quot; said he, &quot;is the very impression which I intended to convey. And now, Watson, have you learned your lessons?&quot; &quot;At least I have tried to.&quot; &quot;Good. You could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject?&quot; &quot;I believe I could.&quot; &quot;Then hand me that little box from the mantlepiece.&quot; He opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in some fine Eastern silk. This he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate little saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour. &quot;It needs careful handling, Watson. This is the real egg-shell pottery of the Ming dynasty. No finer piece ever passed through Christie&#x27;s. A complete set of this would be worth a king&#x27;s ransom- in fact, it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the imperial palace of Peking. The sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild.&quot; &quot;What am I to do with it?&quot; Holmes handed me a card upon which was printed: &quot;Dr. Hill Barton, 369 Half Moon Street.&quot; &quot;That is your name for the evening, Watson. You will call upon Baron Gruner. I know something of his habits, and at half-past eight he would probably be disengaged. A note will tell him in advance that you are about to call, and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of Ming china. You may as well be a medical man, since that is a part which you can play without duplicity. You are a collector, this set has come your way, you have heard of the Baron&#x27;s interest in the subject, and you are not averse to selling at a price.&quot; &quot;What price?&quot; &quot;Well asked, Watson. You would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares. This saucer was got for me by Sir James, and comes, I understand, from the collection of his client. You will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world.&quot; &quot;I could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert.&quot; &quot;Excellent, Watson! You scintillate to-day. Suggest Christie or Sotheby. Your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself.&quot; &quot;But if he won&#x27;t see me?&quot; &quot;Oh, yes, he will see you. He has the collection mania in its most acute form- and especially on this subject, on which he is an acknowledged authority. Sit down, Watson, and I will dictate the letter. No answer needed. You will merely say that you are coming, and why.&quot; It was an admirable document, short, courteous, and stimulating to the curiosity of the connoisseur. A district messenger was duly dispatched with it. On the same evening, with the precious saucer in my hand and the card of Dr. Hill Barton in my pocket, I set off on my own adventure. The beautiful house and grounds indicated that Baron Gruner was, as Sir James had said, a man of considerable wealth. A long winding drive, with banks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out into a great gravelled square adorned with statues. The place had been built by a South African gold king in the days of the great boom, and the long, low house with the turrets at the corners, though an architectural nightmare, was imposing in its size and solidity. A butler, who would have adorned a bench of bishops, showed me in and handed me over to a plushclad footman, who ushered me into the Baron&#x27;s presence. He was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between the windows and which contained part of his Chinese collection. He turned as I entered with a small brown vase in his hand. &quot;Pray sit down, Doctor,&quot; said he. &quot;I was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether I could really afford to add to them. This little Tang specimen, which dates from the seventh century, would probably interest you. I am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze. Have you the Ming saucer with you of which you spoke?&quot; I carefully unpacked it and handed it to him. He seated himself at his desk, pulled over the lamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to examine it. As he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features, and I was able to study them at my ease. He was certainly a remarkably handsome man. His European reputation for beauty was fully deserved. In figure he was not more than of middle size, but was built upon graceful and active lines. His face was swarthy, almost Oriental, with large, dark, languorous eyes which might easily hold an irresistible fascination for women. His hair and moustache were raven black, the latter short, pointed, and carefully waxed. His features were regular and pleasing, save only his straight, thin-lipped mouth. If ever I saw a murderer&#x27;s mouth it was there- a cruel, hard gash in the face, compressed, inexorable, and terrible. He was ill-advised to train his moustache away from it, for it was Nature&#x27;s danger-signal, set as a warning to his victims. His voice was engaging and his manners perfect. In age I should have put him at little over thirty, though his record afterwards showed that he was forty-two. &quot;Very fine- very fine indeed!&quot; he said at last. &quot;And you say you have a set of six to correspond. What puzzles me is that I should not have heard of such magnificent specimens. I only know of one in England to match this, and it is certainly not likely to be in the market. Would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you, Dr. Hill Barton, how you obtained this?&quot; &quot;Does it really matter?&quot; I asked with as careless an air as I could muster. &quot;You can see that the piece is genuine, and, as to the value, I am content to take an expert&#x27;s valuation.&quot; &quot;Very mysterious,&quot; said he with a quick, suspicious flash of his dark eyes. &quot;In dealing with objects of such value, one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction. That the piece is genuine is certain. I have no doubts at all about that. But suppose- I am bound to take every possibility into account- that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell?&quot; &quot;I would guarantee you against any claim of the sort.&quot; &quot;That, of course, would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth.&quot; &quot;My bankers would answer that.&quot; &quot;Quite so. And yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual.&quot; &quot;You can do business or not,&quot; said I with indifference. &quot;I have given you the first offer as I understood that you were a connoisseur, but I shall have no difficulty in other quarters.&quot; &quot;Who told you I was a connoisseur?&quot; &quot;I was aware that you had written a book upon the subject.&quot; &quot;Have you read the book?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Dear me, this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand! You are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection, and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held. How do you explain that?&quot; &quot;I am a very busy man. I am a doctor in practice.&quot; &quot;That is no answer. If a man has a hobby he follows it up, whatever his other pursuits may be. You said in your note that you were a connoisseur.&quot; &quot;So I am.&quot; &quot;Might I ask you a few questions to test you? I am obliged to tell you, Doctor- if you are indeed a doctor- that the incident becomes more and more suspicious. I would ask you what do you know of the Emperor Shomu and how do you associate him with the Shoso-in near Nara? Dear me, does that puzzle you? Tell me a little about the Northern Wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramic!&quot; I sprang from my chair in simulated anger. &quot;This is intolerable, sir,&quot; said I. &quot;I came here to do you a favour- and not to be examined as if I were a schoolboy. My knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own, but I certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in, so offensive a way.&quot; He looked at me steadily. The languor had gone from his eyes. They suddenly glared. There was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips. &quot;What is the game? You are here as a spy. You are an emissary of Holmes. This is a trick that you are playing upon me. The fellow is dying I hear, so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me. You&#x27;ve made your way in here without leave, and, by God, you may find it harder to get out than to get in.&quot; He had sprung to his feet, and I stepped back, bracing myself for an attack, for the man was beside himself with rage. He may have suspected me from the first; certainly this cross-examination had shown him the truth; but it was clear that I could not hope to deceive him. He dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously. Then something struck upon his ear, for he stood listening intently. &quot;Ah!&quot; he cried. &quot;Ah!&quot; and dashed into the room behind him. Two steps took me to the open door, and my mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene within. The window leading out to the garden was wide open. Beside it, looking like some terrible ghost, his head girt with bloody bandages, his face drawn and white, stood Sherlock Holmes. The next instant he was through the gap, and I heard the crash of his body among the laurel bushes outside. With a howl of rage the master of the house rushed after him to the open window. And then! It was done in an instant, and yet I clearly saw it. An arm- a woman&#x27;s arm- shot out from among the leaves. At the same instant the Baron uttered a horrible cry- a yell which will always ring in my memory. He clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round the room, beating his head horribly against the walls. Then he fell upon the carpet, rolling and writhing, while scream after scream resounded through the house. &quot;Water! For God&#x27;s sake, water!&quot; was his cry. I seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid. At the same moment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall. I remember that one of them fainted as I knelt by the injured man and turned that awful face to the light of the lamp. The vitriol was eating into it everywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin. One eye was already white and glazed. The other was red and inflamed. The features which I had admired a few minutes before were now like some beautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul sponge. They were blurred, discoloured, inhuman, terrible. In a few words I explained exactly what had occurred, so far as the vitriol attack was concerned. Some had climbed through the window and others had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark and it had begun to rain. Between his screams the victim raged and raved against the avenger. &quot;It was that hell-cat, Kitty Winter!&quot; he cried. &quot;Oh, the she-devil! She shall pay for it! She shall pay! Oh, God in heaven, this pain is more than I can bear!&quot; I bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces, and administered a hypodermic of morphia. All suspicion of me had passed from his mind in the presence of this shock, and he clung to my hands as if I might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which gazed up at me. I could have wept over the ruin had I not remembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a change. It was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands, and I was relieved when his family surgeon, closely followed by a specialist, came to relieve me of my charge. An inspector of police had also arrived, and to him I handed my real card. It would have been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for I was nearly as well known by sight at the Yard as Holmes himself. Then I left that house of gloom and terror. Within an hour I was at Baker Street. Holmes was seated in his familiar chair, looking very pale and exhausted. Apart from his injuries, even his iron nerves had been shocked by the events of the evening, and he listened with horror to my account of the Baron&#x27;s transformation. &quot;The wages of sin, Watson- the wages of sin!&quot; said he. &quot;Sooner or later it will always come. God knows, there was sin enough,&quot; he added, taking up a brown volume from the table. &quot;Here is the book the woman talked of. If this will not break off the marriage, nothing ever could. But it will, Watson. It must. No self-respecting woman could stand it.&quot; &quot;It is his love diary?&quot; &quot;Or his lust diary. Call it what you will. The moment the woman told us of it I realized what a tremendous weapon was there if we could but lay our hands on it. I said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts, for this woman might have given it away. But I brooded over it. Then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the Baron think that no precautions need be taken against me. That was all to the good. I would have waited a little longer, but his visit to America forced my hand. He would never have left so compromising a document behind him. Therefore we had to act at once. Burglary at night is impossible. He takes precautions. But there was a chance in the evening if I could only be sure that his attention was engaged. That was where you and your blue saucer came in. But I had to be sure of the position of the book, and I knew I had only a few minutes in which to act, for my time was limited by your knowledge of Chinese pottery. Therefore I gathered the girl up at the last moment. How could I guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak? I thought she had come altogether on my business, but it seems she had some of her own.&quot; &quot;He guessed I came from you.&quot; &quot;I feared he would. But you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book though not long enough for an unobserved escape. Ah, Sir James, I am very glad you have come!&quot; Our courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons. He listened with the deepest attention to Holmes&#x27;s account of what had occurred. &quot;You have done wonders- wonders!&quot; he cried when he had heard the narrative. &quot;But if these injuries are as terrible as Dr. Watson describes, then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book.&quot; Holmes shook his head. &quot;Women of the De Merville type do not act like that. She would love him the more as a disfigured martyr. No, no. It is his moral side, not his physical, which we have to destroy. That book will bring her back to earth- and I know nothing else that could. It is in his own writing. She cannot get past it.&quot; Sir James carried away both it and the precious saucer. As I was myself overdue, I went down with him into the street. A brougham was waiting for him. He sprang in, gave a hurried order to the cockaded coachman, then drove swiftly away. He flung his overcoat half out of the window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel, but I had seen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less. I gasped with surprise. Then I turned back and ascended the stair to Holmes&#x27;s room. &quot;I have found out who our client is,&quot; I cried, bursting with my great news. &quot;Why, Holmes, it is-&quot; &quot;It is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman,&quot; said Holmes, holding up a restraining hand. &quot;Let that now and forever be enough for us.&quot; I do not know how the incriminating book was used. Sir James may have managed it. Or it is more probable that so delicate a task was entrusted to the young lady&#x27;s father. The effect, at any rate, was all that could be desired. Three days later appeared a paragraph in the Morning Post to say that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville would not take place. The same paper had the first police-court hearing of the proceedings against Miss Kitty Winter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing. Such extenuating circumstances came out in the trial that the sentence, as will be remembered, was the lowest that was possible for such an offence. Sherlock Holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary, but when an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious, even the rigid British law becomes human and elastic. My friend has not yet stood in the dock. -THE END- . 1926 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION&#x27;S MANE by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle It is a most singular thing that a problem which was certainly as abstruse and unusual as any which I have faced in my long professional career should have come to me after my retirement, and be brought, as it were, to my very door. It occurred after my withdrawal to my little Sussex home, when I had given myself up entirely to that soothing life of Nature for which I had so often yearned during the long years spent amid the gloom of London. At this period of my life the good Watson had passed almost beyond my ken. An occasional week-end visit was the most that I ever saw of him. Thus I must act as my own chronicler. Ah! had he but been with me, how much he might have made of so wonderful a happening and of my eventual triumph against every difficulty! As it is, however, I must needs tell my tale in my own plain way, showing by my words each step upon the difficult road which lay before me as I searched for the mystery of the Lion&#x27;s Mane. My villa is situated upon the southern slope of the downs, commanding a great view of the Channel. At this point the coast-line is entirely of chalk cliffs, which can only be descended by a single, long, tortuous path, which is steep and slippery. At the bottom of the path lie a hundred yards of pebbles and shingle, even when the tide is at full. Here and there, however, there are curves and hollows which make splendid swimming-pools filled afresh with each flow. This admirable beach extends for some miles in each direction, save only at one point where the little cove and village of Fulworth break the line. My house is lonely. I, my old housekeeper, and my bees have the estate all to ourselves. Half a mile off, however, is Harold Stackhurst&#x27;s well-known coaching establishment, The Gables, quite a large place, which contains some score of young fellows preparing for various professions, with a staff of several masters. Stackhurst himself was a well-known rowing Blue in his day, and an excellent all-round scholar. He and I were always friendly from the day I came to the coast, and he was the one man who was on such terms with me that we could drop in on each other in the evenings without an invitation. Towards the end of July, 1907, there was a severe gale, the wind blowing upchannel, heaping the seas to the base of the cliffs and leaving a lagoon at the turn of the tide. On the morning of which I speak the wind had abated, and all Nature was newly washed and fresh. It was impossible to work upon so delightful a day, and I strolled out before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air. I walked along the cliff path which led to the steep descent to the beach. As I walked I heard a shout behind me, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his hand in cheery greeting. &quot;What a morning, Mr. Holmes! I thought I should see you out.&quot; &quot;Going for a swim, I see.&quot; &quot;At your old tricks again,&quot; he laughed, patting his bulging pocket. &quot;Yes. McPherson started early, and I expect I may find him there.&quot; Fitzroy McPherson was the science master, a fine upstanding young fellow whose life had been crippled by heart trouble following rheumatic fever. He was a natural athlete, however, and excelled in every game which did not throw too great a strain upon him. Summer and winter he went for his swim, and, as I am a swimmer myself, I have often joined him. At this moment we saw the man himself. His head showed above the edge of the cliff where the path ends. Then his whole figure appeared at the top, staggering like a drunken man. The next instant he threw up his hands and, with a terrible cry, fell upon his face. Stackhurst and I rushed forward- it may have been fifty yards- and turned him on his back. He was obviously dying. Those glazed sunken eyes and dreadful livid cheeks could mean nothing else. One glimmer of life came into his face: for an instant, and he uttered two or three words with an eager air of warning. They were slurred and indistinct, but to my ear the list of them, which burst in a shriek from his lips, were &quot;the Lion&#x27;s Mane.&quot; It was utterly irrelevant and unintelligible, and yet I could twist the sound into no other sense. Then he half raised himself from the ground, threw his arms into the air, and fell forward on his side. He was dead. My companion was paralyzed by the sudden horror of it, but I, as may well be imagined, had every sense on the alert. And I had need, for it was speedily evident that we were, in the presence of an extraordinary case. The man was dressed only in his Burberry overcoat, his trousers, and an unlaced pair of canvas shoes. As he fell over, his Burberry, which had been simply thrown round his shoulders, slipped off, exposing his trunk. We stared at it in amazement. His back was covered with dark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged by a thin wire scourge. The instrument with which this punishment had been inflicted was clearly flexible, for the long, angry weals cursed round his shoulders and ribs. There was blood dripping down his chin, for he had bitten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his agony. His drawn and distorted face told how terrible that agony had been. I was kneeling and Stackhurst standing by the body when a shadow fell across us, and we found that Ian Murdoch was by our side. Murdoch was the mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall, dark, thin man, so taciturn and aloof that none can be said to have been his friend. He seemed to live in some high, abstract region of surds and conic sections, with little to connect him with ordinary life. He was looked upon as an oddity by the students, and would have been their butt, but there was some strange outlandish blood in the man, which showed itself not only in his coal-black eyes and swarthy face but also in occasional outbreaks of temper, which could only be described as ferocious. On one occasion, being plagued by a little dog belonging to McPherson, he had caught the creature up and burled it through the plate-glass window, an action for which Stackhurst would certainly have given him his dismissal had he not been a very valuable teacher. Such was the strange complex man who now appeared beside us. He seemed to be honestly shocked at the sight before him, though the incident of the dog may show that there was no great sympathy between the dead man and himself. &quot;Poor fellow! Poor fellow! What can I do? How can I help?&quot; &quot;Were you with him? Can you tell us what has happened?&quot; &quot;No, no, I was late this morning. I was not on the beach at all. I have come straight from The Gables. What can I do?&quot; &quot;You can hurry to the police-station at Fulworth. Report the matter at once.&quot; Without a word he made off at top speed, and I proceeded to take the matter in hand, while Stackhurst, dazed at this tragedy, remained by the body. My first task naturally was to note who was on the beach. From the top of the path I could see the whole sweep of it, and it was absolutely deserted save that two or three dark figures could be seen far away moving towards the village of Fulworth. Having satisfied myself upon this point, I walked slowly down the path. There was clay or soft marl mixed with the chalk, and every here and there I saw the same footstep, both ascending and descending. No one else had gone down to the beach by this track that morning. At one place I observed the print of an open hand with the fingers towards the incline. This could only mean that poor McPherson had fallen as he ascended. There were rounded depressions, too, which suggested that he had come down upon his knees more than once. At the bottom of the path was the considerable lagoon left by the retreating tide. At the side of it McPherson had undressed, for there lay his towel on a rock. It was folded and dry, so that it would seem that, after all, he had never entered the water. Once or twice as I hunted round amid the hard shingle I came on little patches of sand where the print of his canvas shoe, and also of his naked foot, could be seen. The latter fact proved that he had made all ready to bathe, though the towel indicated that he had not actually done so. And here was the problem clearly defined- as strange a one as had ever confronted me. The man had not been on the beach more than a quarter of an hour at the most. Stackhurst had followed him from The Gables, so there could be no doubt about that. He had gone to bathe and had stripped, as the naked footsteps showed. Then he had suddenly huddled on his clothes again- they were all dishevelled and unfastened- and he had returned without bathing, or at any, rate without drying himself. And the reason for his change of purpose had been that he had been scourged in sonic savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until he bit his lip through in his agony, and was left with only strength enough to crawl away and to die. Who had done this barbarous deed? There were, it is true, small grottos and caves in the base of the cliffs, but the low sun shone directly into them, and there was no place for concealment. Then, again, there were those distant figures on the beach. They seemed too far away to have been connected with the crime, and the broad lagoon in which McPherson had intended to bathe lay between him and them, lapping tip to the rocks. On the sea two or three fishing-boats were at no great distance. Their occupants might be examined at our leisure. There were several roads for inquiry, but none which led to any very obvious goal. When I at last returned to the body I found that a little group of wondering folk had gathered round it. Stackhurst was, of course, still there, and Ian Murdoch had just arrived with Anderson, the village constable, a big, ginger-moustached man of the slow, solid Sussex breed- a breed which covers much good sense under a heavy, silent exterior. He listened to everything, took note of all we said, and finally drew me aside. &quot;I&#x27;d be glad of your advice, Mr. Holmes. This is a big thing for me to handle, and I&#x27;ll hear of it from Lewes if I go wrong.&quot; I advised him to send for his immediate superior, and for a doctor; also to allow nothing to be moved, and as few fresh footmarks as possible to be made, until they came. In the meantime I searched the dead man&#x27;s pockets. There were his handkerchief, a large knife, and a small folding card-case. From this projected a slip of paper, which I unfolded and handed to the constable. There was written on it in a scrambling, feminine hand: I will be there, you may be sure. MAUDIE. It read like a love affair, an assignation, though when and where were a blank. The constable replaced it in the card-case and returned it with the other things to the pockets of the Burberry. Then, as nothing more suggested itself, I walked back to my house for breakfast, having first arranged that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly searched. Stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell me that the body had been removed to The Gables, where the inquest would be held. He brought with him some serious and definite news. As I expected, nothing had been found in the small caves below the cliff, but he had examined the papers in McPherson&#x27;s desk, and there were several which showed an intimate correspondence with a certain Miss Maud Bellamy, of Fulworth. We had then established the identity of the writer of the note. &quot;The police have the letters,&quot; he explained. &quot;I could not bring them. But there is no doubt that it was a serious love affair. I see no reason, however, to connect it with that horrible happening save, indeed, that the lady had made an appointment with him.&quot; &quot;But hardly at a bathing-pool which all of you were in the habit of using,&quot; I remarked. &quot;It is mere chance,&quot; said he, &quot;that several of the students were not with McPherson.&quot; &quot;Was it mere chance?&quot; Stackhurst knit his brows in thought. &quot;Ian Murdoch held them back,&quot; said he. &quot;He would insist upon some algebraic demonstration before breakfast. Poor chap, he is dreadfully cut up about it all.&quot; &quot;And yet I gather that they were not friends.&quot; &quot;At one time they were not. But for a year or more Murdoch has been as near to McPherson as he ever could be to anyone. He is not of a very sympathetic disposition by nature.&quot; &quot;So I understand. I seem to remember your telling me once about a quarrel over the ill-usage of a dog.&quot; &quot;That blew over all right.&quot; &quot;But left some vindictive feeling, perhaps.&quot; &quot;No, no, I am sure they were real friends.&quot; &quot;Well, then, we must explore the matter of the girl. Do you know her?&quot; &quot;Everyone knows her. She is the beauty of the neighbourhood- a real beauty, Holmes, who would draw attention everywhere. I knew that McPherson was attracted by her, but I had no notion that it had gone so far as these letters would seem to indicate.&quot; &quot;But who is she?&quot; &quot;She is the daughter of old Tom Bellamy, who owns all the boats and bathing-cots at Fulworth. He was a fisherman to start with, but is now a man of some substance. He and his son William run the business.&quot; &quot;Shall we walk into Fulworth and see them?&quot; &quot;On what pretext?&quot; &quot;Oh, we can easily find a pretext. After all, this poor man did not ill-use himself in this outrageous way. Some human hand was on the handle of that scourge, if indeed it was a scourge which inflicted the injuries. His circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely limited. Let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail to come upon the motive, which in turn should lead us to the criminal.&quot; It would have been a pleasant walk across the thyme-scented downs had our minds not been poisoned by the tragedy we had witnessed. The village of Fulworth lies in a hollow curving in a semicircle round the bay. Behind the old-fashioned hamlet several modern houses have been built upon the rising ground. It was to one of these that Stackhurst guided me. &quot;That&#x27;s The Haven, as Bellamy called it. The one with the corner tower and slate roof. Not bad for a man who started with nothing but- By Jove, look at that!&quot; The garden gate of The Haven had opened and a man had emerged. There was no mistaking that tall, angular, straggling figure. It was Ian Murdoch, the mathematician. A moment later we confronted him upon the road. &quot;Hullo!&quot; said Stackhurst. The man nodded, gave us a sideways glance from his curious dark eyes, and would have passed us, but his principal pulled him up. &quot;What were you doing there?&quot; he asked. Murdoch&#x27;s face flushed with anger. &quot;I am your subordinate, sir, under your roof. I am not aware that I owe you any account of my private actions.&quot; Stackhurst&#x27;s nerve; were near the surface after all he had endured. Otherwise, perhaps, he would have waited. Now he lost his temper completely. &quot;In the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence, Mr. Murdoch.&quot; &quot;Your own question might perhaps come under the same heading.&quot; &quot;This is not the first time that I have had to overlook your insubordinate ways. It will certainly be the last. You will kindly make fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can.&quot; &quot;I had intended to do so. I have lost to-day the only person who made The Gables habitable.&quot; He strode off upon his way, while Stackhurst, with angry eyes, stood glaring after him. &quot;Is he not an impossible, intolerable man&quot; he cried. The one thing that impressed itself forcibly upon my mind was that Mr. Ian Murdoch was taking the first chance to open a path of escape from the scene of the crime. Suspicion, vague and nebulous, was now beginning to take outline in my mind. Perhaps the visit to the Bellamys might throw some further light upon the matter. Stackhurst pulled himself together, and we went forward to the house. Mr. Bellamy proved to be a middle-aged man with a flaming red beard. He seemed to be in a very angry mood, and his face was soon as florid as his hair. &quot;No, sir, I do not desire any particulars. My son here&quot;- indicating a powerful young man, with a heavy, sullen face, in the corner of the sitting-room- &quot;is of one mind with me that Mr. McPherson&#x27;s attentions to Maud were insulting. Yes, sir, the word &#x27;marriage&#x27; was never mentioned, and yet there were letters and meetings, and a great deal more of which neither of us could approve. She has no mother, and we are her only guardians. We are determined-&quot; But the words were taken from his mouth by the appearance of the lady herself. There was no gainsaying that she would have graced any assembly in the world. Who could have imagined that so rare a flower would grow from such a root and in such an atmosphere? Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart, but I could not look upon her perfect clear-cut face, with all the soft freshness of the downlands in her delicate colouring, without realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed. Such was the girl who had pushed open the door and stood now, wide-eyed and intense, in front of Harold Stackhurst. &quot;I know already that Fitzroy is dead,&quot; she said. &quot;Do not be afraid to tell me the particulars.&quot; &quot;This other gentleman of yours let us know the news,&quot; explained the father. &quot;There is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter,&quot; growled the younger man. The sister turned a sharp, fierce look upon him. &quot;This is my business, William. Kindly leave me to manage it in my own way. By all accounts there has been a crime committed. If I can help to show who did it, it is the least I can do for him who is gone.&quot; She listened to a short account from my companion, with a composed concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as well as great beauty. Maud Bellamy will always remain in my memory as a most complete and remarkable woman. It seems that she already knew me by sight, for she turned to me at the end. &quot;Bring them to justice, Mr. Holmes. You have my sympathy and my help, whoever they may be.&quot; It seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at her father and brother as she spoke. &quot;Thank you,&quot; said I. &quot;I value a woman&#x27;s instinct in such matters. You use the word &#x27;they.&#x27; You think that more than one was concerned?&quot; &quot;I knew Mr. McPherson well enough to be aware that he was a brave and a strong man. No single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage upon him.&quot; &quot;Might I have one word with you alone?&quot; &quot;I tell you, Maud, not to mix yourself up in the matter,&quot; cried her father angrily. She looked at me helplessly. &quot;What can I do?&quot; &quot;The whole world will know the facts presently, so there can be no harm if I discuss them here,&quot; said I. &quot;I should have preferred privacy, but if your father will not allow it he must share the deliberations.&quot; Then I spoke of the note which had been found in the dead man&#x27;s pocket. &quot;It is sure to be produced at the inquest. May I ask you to throw any light upon it that you can?&quot; &quot;I see no reason for mystery,&quot; she answered. &quot;We were engaged to be married, and we only kept it secret because Fitzroy&#x27;s uncle, who is very old and said to be dying, might have disinherited him if he had married against his wish. There was no other reason.&quot; &quot;You could have told us,&quot; growled Mr. Bellamy. &quot;So I would, father, if you had ever shown sympathy.&quot; &quot;I object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station.&quot; &quot;It was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you. As to this appointment&quot;- she fumbled in her dress and produced a crumpled note &quot;it was in answer to this.&quot; DEAREST [ran the message]: The old place on the beach just after sunset on Tuesday. It is the only time I can get away. F. M. &quot;Tuesday was to-day, and I had meant to meet him to-night.&quot; I turned over the paper. &quot;This never came by post. How did you get it?&quot; &quot;I would rather not answer that question. It has really nothing to do with the matter which you are investigating. But anything which bears upon that I will most freely answer.&quot; She was as good as her word, but there was nothing which was helpful in our investigation. She had no reason to think that her fiance had any hidden enemy, but she admitted that she had had several warm admirers. &quot;May I ask if Mr. Ian Murdoch was one of them?&quot; She blushed and seemed confused. &quot;There was a time when I thought he was. But that was all changed when he understood the relations between Fitzroy and myself.&quot; Again the shadow round this strange man seemed to me to be taking more definite shape. His record must be examined. His rooms must be, privately searched. Stackhurst was a willing collaborator, for in his mind also suspicions were forming. We returned from our visit to The haven with the hope that one free end of this tangled skein was already in our hands. A week passed. The inquest had thrown no light upon the matter and had been adourned for further evidence. Stackhurst had made discreet inquiry about his subordinate, and there had been a superficial search of his room, but without result. Personally, I had gone over the whole ground again, both physically and mentally, but with no new conclusions. In all my chronicles the reader will find no case which brought me so completely to the limit of my powers. Even my imagination could conceive no solution to the mystery. And then there came the incident of the dog. It was my old housekeeper who heard of it first by that strange wireless by which such people collect the news of the countryside. &quot;Sad story this, sir, about Mr. McPherson&#x27;s dog,&quot; said she one evening. I do not encourage such conversations, but the words arrested my attention. &quot;What of Mr. McPherson&#x27;s dog?&quot; &quot;Dead, sir. Died of grief for its master.&quot; &quot;Who told you this?&quot; &quot;Why, sir, everyone is talking of it. It took on terrible, and has eaten nothing for a week. Then to-day two of the young gentlemen from The Gables found it dead- down on the beach, sir, at the very place where its master met his end.&quot; &quot;At the very place.&quot; The words stood out clear in my memory. Some dim perception that the matter was vital rose in my mind. That the dog should die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs. But &quot;in the very place&quot;! Why should this lonely beach be fatal to it? Was it possible that it also had been sacrificed to some revengeful feud? Was it possible-? Yes, the perception was dim, but already something was building up in my mind. In a few minutes I was on my way to The Gables, where I found Stackhurst in his study. At my request he sent for Sudbury and Blount, the two students who had found the dog. &quot;Yes, it lay on the very edge of the pool,&quot; said one of them. &quot;It must have followed the trail of its dead master.&quot; I saw the faithful little creature, an Airedale terrier, laid out upon the mat in the ball. The body was stiff and rigid, the eyes projecting, and the limbs contorted. There was agony in every line of it. From The Gables I walked down to the bathing-pool. The sun had sunk and the shadow of the great cliff lay black across the water, which glimmered dully like a sheet of lead. The place was deserted and there was no sign of life save for two sea-birds circling and screaming overhead. In the fading light I could dimly make out the little dog&#x27;s spoor upon the sand round the very rock on which his master&#x27;s towel had been laid. For a long time I stood in deep meditation while the shadows grew darker around me. My mind was filled with racing thoughts. You have known what it was to be in a nightmare in which you feel that there is some all-important thing for which you search and which you know is there, though it remains forever just beyond your reach. That was how I felt that evening as I stood alone by that place of death. Then at last I turned and walked slowly homeward. I had just reached the top of the path when it came to me. Like a flash, I remembered the thing for which I had so eagerly and vainly grasped. You will know, or Watson has written in vain, that I hold a vast store of out-of-the-way knowledge without scientific system, but very available for the needs of my work. My mind is like a crowded box-room with packets of all sorts stowed away therein- so many that I may well have but a vague perception of what was there. I had known that there was something which might bear upon this matter. It was still vague, but at least I knew how I could make it clear. It was monstrous, incredible, and yet it was always a possibility. I would test it to the full. There is a great garret in my little house which is stuffed with books. It was into this that I plunged and rummaged for all hour. At the end of that time I emerged with a little chocolate and silver volume. Eagerly I turned up the chapter of which I had a dim remembrance. Yes, it was indeed a far-fetched and unlikely proposition, and yet I could not be at rest until I had made sure if it might, indeed, be so. It was late when I retired, with my mind eagerly awaiting the work of the morrow. But that work met with an annoying interruption. I had hardly swallowed my early cup of tea and was starting for the beach when I had a call from Inspector Bardle of the Sussex Constabulary- a steady, solid, bovine man with thoughtful eyes, which looked at me now with a very troubled expression. &quot;I know your immense experience, sir,&quot; said he. &quot;This is quite unofficial, of course, and need go no farther. But I am fairly up against it in this McPherson case. The question is, shall I make an arrest, or shall I not?&quot; &quot;Meaning Mr. Ian Murdoch?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir. There is really no one else when you come to think of it. That&#x27;s the advantage of this solitude. We narrow it down to a very small compass. If he did not do it, then who did?&quot; &quot;What have you against him?&quot; He had gleaned along the same furrows as I had. There was Murdoch&#x27;s character and the mystery which seemed to hang round the man. His furious bursts of temper, as shown in the incident of the dog. The fact that he had quarrelled with McPherson in the past, and that there was some reason to think that he might have resented his attentions to Miss Bellamy. He had all my points, but no fresh ones, save that Murdoch seemed to be making every preparation for departure. &quot;What would my position be if I let him slip away with all this evidence against him?&quot; The burly, phlegmatic man was sorely troubled in his mind. &quot;Consider,&quot; I said, &quot;all the essential gaps in your case. On the morning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi. He had been with his scholars till the last moment, and within a few minutes of McPherson&#x27;s appearance he came upon us from behind. Then bear in mind the absolute impossibility that he could singlehanded have inflicted this outrage upon a man quite as strong as himself. Finally, there is this question of the instrument with which these injuries were inflicted.&quot; &quot;What could it be but a scourge or flexible whip of some sort?&quot; &quot;Have you examined the marks?&quot; I asked. &quot;I have seen them. So has the doctor.&quot; &quot;But I have examined them very carefully with a lens. They have peculiarities.&quot; &quot;What are they, Mr. Holmes?&quot; I stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photograph. &quot;This is my method in such cases,&quot; I explained. &quot;You certainly do things thoroughly, Mr. Holmes.&quot; &quot;I should hardly be what I am if I did not. Now let us consider this weal which extends round the right shoulder. Do you observe nothing remarkable?&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t say I do.&quot; &quot;Surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity. There is a dot of extravasated blood here, and another there. There are similar indications in this other weal down here. What can that mean?&quot; &quot;I have no idea. Have you?&quot; &quot;Perhaps I have. Perhaps I haven&#x27;t. I may be able to say more soon. Anything which will define what made that mark will bring us a long way towards the criminal.&quot; &quot;It is, of course, in absurd idea,&quot; said the policeman, &quot;but if a red-hot net of wire had been laid across the back, then these better marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each other.&quot; &quot;A most ingenious comparison. Or shall we say a very stiff cat-o&#x27;-nine-tails with small hard knots upon it?&quot; &quot;By Jove, Mr. Holmes, I think you have hit it.&quot; &quot;Or there may be some very different cause, Mr. Bardle. But your case is far too weak for an arrest. Besides, we have those last words- the &#x27;Lion&#x27;s Mane.&#x27;&quot; I have wondered whether Ian-&quot; &quot;Yes, I have considered that. If the second word had borne any resemblance to Murdoch- but it did not. He gave it almost in a shriek. I am sure that it was &#x27;Mane.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Have you no alternative, Mr. Holmes?&quot; &quot;Perhaps I have. But I do not care to discuss it until there is something more solid to discuss.&quot; &quot;And when will that be?&quot; &quot;In all hour- possibly less.&quot; The inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes. &quot;I wish I could see what was in your mind, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps it&#x27;s those fishing-boats.&quot; &quot;No, no, they were too far out.&quot; &quot;Well, then, is it Bellamy and that big son of his? They were not too sweet upon Mr. McPherson. Could they have done him a mischief?&quot; &quot;No, no, you won&#x27;t draw me until I am ready,&quot; said I with a smile. &quot;Now, Inspector, we each have our own work to do. Perhaps if you were to meet me here at midday-&quot; So far we had got when there came the tremendous interruption which was the beginning of the end. My outer door was flung open, there were blundering footsteps in the passage, and Ian Murdoch staggered into the room, pallid, dishevelled, his clothes in wild disorder, clawing with his bony hands at the furniture to hold himself great. &quot;Brandy! Brandy!&quot; he gasped, and fell groaning upon the sofa. He was not alone. Behind him came Stackhurst, hatless and panting, almost as distrait as his companion. &quot;Yes, yes, brandy!&quot; he cried. &quot;The man is at his last gasp. It was all I could do to bring him here. He fainted twice upon the way.&quot; Half a tumbler of the raw spirit brought about a wondrous change. He pushed himself up on one arm and swung his coat from his shoulder &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, oil, opium, morphia!&quot; he cried. &quot;Anything to ease this infernal agony!&quot; The inspector and I cried out at the sight. There, crisscrossed upon the man&#x27;s naked shoulder, was the same strange reticulated pattern of red, inflamed lines which had been the death-mark of Fitzroy, McPherson. The pain was evidently terrible and was more than local, for the sufferer&#x27;s breathing would stop for a time, his face would turn black, and then with loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart, while his brow dropped beads of sweat. At any moment he might die. More and more brandy was poured down his throat, each fresh dose bringing him back to life. Pads of cotton-wool soaked in salad-oil seemed to take the agony from the strange wounds. At last his head fell heavily upon the cushion. Exhausted Nature had taken refuge in its last storehouse of vitality. It was half a sleep and half a faint, but at least it was ease from pain. To question him had been impossible, but the moment we were assured of his condition Stackhurst turned upon me. &quot;My God!&quot; he cried, &quot;what is it, Holmes? What is it?&quot; &quot;Where did you find him?&quot; &quot;Down on the beach. Exactly where poor McPherson met his end. If this man&#x27;s heart had been weak as McPherson&#x27;s was, he would not be here now. More than once I thought he was gone as I brought him up. It was too far to The Gables, so I made for you.&quot; &quot;Did you see him on the beach?&quot; &quot;I was walking on the cliff when I heard his cry. He was at the edge of the water, reeling about like a drunken man. I ran down, threw some clothes about him, and brought him up. For heaven&#x27;s sake, Holmes, use all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this place, for life is becoming unendurable. Can you, with all your world-wide reputation, do nothing for us?&quot; &quot;I think I can, Stackhurst. Come with me now! And you, Inspector, come along! We will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your hands.&quot; Leaving the unconscious man in the charge of my housekeeper, we all three went down to the deadly lagoon. On the shingle there was piled a little heap of towels and clothes left by the stricken man. Slowly I walked round the edge of the water, my comrades in Indian file behind me. Most of the pool was quite shallow, but under the cliff where the beach was hollowed out it was four or five feet deep. It was to this part that a swimmer would naturally go, for it formed a beautiful pellucid green pool as clear as crystal. A line of rocks lay above it at the base of the cliff, and along this I led the way, peering eagerly into the depths beneath me. I had reached the deepest and stillest pool when my eyes caught that for which they were searching, and I burst into a shout of triumph. &quot;Cyanea!&quot; I cried. &quot;Cyanea! Behold the Lion&#x27;s Mane!&quot; The strange object at which I pointed did indeed look like a tangled mass torn from the mane of a lion. It lay upon a rocky shelf some three feet under the water, a curious waving, vibrating, hairy creature with streaks of silver among its yellow tresses. It pulsated with a slow, heavy dilation and contraction. &quot;It has done mischief enough. Its day is over!&quot; I cried. &quot;Help me, Stackhurst! Let us end the murderer forever.&quot; There was a big boulder just above the ledge, and we pushed it until it fell with a tremendous splash into the water. When the ripples had cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below. One flapping edge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it. A thick oily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water round, rising slowly to the surface. &quot;Well, this gets me!&quot; cried the inspector. &quot;What was it, Mr. Holmes? I&#x27;m born and bred in these parts, but I never saw such a thing. It don&#x27;t belong to Sussex.&quot; &quot;Just as well for Sussex,&quot; I remarked. &quot;It may have been the southwest gale that brought it up. Come back to my house, both of you, and I will give you the terrible experience of one who has good reason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas.&quot; When we reached my study we found that Murdoch was so far recovered that he could sit up. He was dazed in mind, and every now and then was shaken by a paroxysm of pain. In broken words he explained that he had no notion what had occurred to him, save that terrific pangs had suddenly shot through him, and that it had taken all his fortitude to reach the bank. &quot;Here is a book,&quot; I said, taking up the little volume, &quot;which first brought light into what might have been forever dark. It is Out of Doors, by the famous observer, J. G. Wood. Wood himself very nearly perished from contact with this vile creature, so he wrote with a very full knowledge. Cyanea capillata is the miscreant&#x27;s full name, and he can be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful than, the bite of the cobra. Let me briefly give this extract. &quot;If the bather should see a loose roundish mass of tawny membranes and fibres, something like very large handfuls of lion&#x27;s mane and silver paper, let him beware, for this is the fearful stinger, Cyanea capillata. Could our sinister acquaintance be more clearly described? &quot;He goes on to tell of his own encounter with one when swimming off the coast of Kent. He found that the creature radiated almost invisible filaments to the distance of fifty feet, and that anyone within that circumference from the deadly centre was in danger of death. Even at a distance the effect upon Wood was almost fatal. &quot;The multitudinous threads caused light scarlet lines upon the skin which on closer examination resolved into minute dots or pustules, each dot charged as it were with a red-hot needle making its way through the nerves. &quot;The local pain was, as he explains, the least part of the exquisite torment. &quot;Pangs shot through the chest, causing me to fall as if struck by a bullet. The pulsation would cease, and then the heart would give six or seven leaps as if it would force its way through the chest. &quot;It nearly killed him, although he had only been exposed to it in the disturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of a bathing-pool. He says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards, so white, wrinkled and shrivelled was his face. He griped down brandy, a whole bottleful, and it seems to have saved his life. There is the book, Inspector. I leave it with you, and you cannot doubt that it contains a full explanation of the tragedy of poor McPherson.&quot; &quot;And incidentally exonerates me,&quot; remarked Ian Murdoch with a wry smile. &quot;I do not blame you, Inspector, nor you, Mr. Holmes, for your suspicions were natural. I feel that on the very eve of my arrest I have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend.&quot; &quot;No, Mr. Murdoch. I was already upon the track, and had I been out as early as I intended I might well have saved you from this terrific experience.&quot; &quot;But how did you know, Mr. Holmes?&quot; &quot;I am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles. That phrase &#x27;the Lion&#x27;s Mane&#x27; haunted my mind. I knew that I had seen it somewhere in an unexpected context. You have seen that it does describe the creature. I have no doubt that it was floating on the water when McPherson saw it, and that this phrase was the only one by which he could convey to us a warning as to the creature which had been his death.&quot; &quot;Then I, at least, am cleared,&quot; said Murdoch, rising slowly to his feet. &quot;There are one or two words of explanation which I should give, for I know the direction in which your inquiries have run. It is true that I loved this lady, but from the day when she chose my friend McPherson my one desire was to help her to happiness. I was well content to stand aside and act as their go-between. Often I carried their messages, and it was because I was in their confidence and because she was so dear to me that I hastened to tell her of my friend&#x27;s death, lest someone should forestall me in a more sudden and heartless manner. She would not tell you, sir, of our relations lest you should disapprove and I might suffer. But with your leave I must try to get back to The Gables, for my bed will be very welcome.&quot; Stackhurst held out his hand. &quot;Our nerves have all been at concert-pitch,&quot; said be. &quot;Forgive what is past, Murdoch. We shall understand each other better in the future.&quot; They passed out together with their arms linked in friendly fashion. The inspector remained, staring at me in silence with his ox-like eyes. &quot;Well, you&#x27;ve done it!&quot; he cried at last. &quot;I had read of you, but I never believed it. It&#x27;s wonderful!&quot; I was forced to shake my head. To accept such praise was to lower one&#x27;s own standards. &quot;I was slow at the outset- culpably slow. Had the body been found in the water I could hardly have missed it. It was the towel which misled me. The poor fellow had never thought to dry himself, and so I in turn was led to believe that he had never been in the water. Why, then, should the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me? That was where I went astray. Well, well, Inspector, I often ventured to chaff you gentlemen of the police force, but Cyanea capillata very nearly avenged Scotland Yard.&quot; -THE END- . 1921 SHERLOCK HOLMES THE ADVENTURE OF THE MAZARIN STONE by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle It was pleasant to Dr. Watson to find himself once more in the untidy room of the first floor in Baker Street which had been the starting-point of so many remarkable adventures. He looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. Finally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy, the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective. &quot;It all seems very unchanged, Billy. You don&#x27;t change, either. I hope the same can be said of him?&quot; Billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom. &quot;I think he&#x27;s in bed and asleep,&quot; he said. It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer&#x27;s day, but Dr. Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend&#x27;s hours to feel no surprise at the idea. &quot;That means a case, I suppose?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. I&#x27;m frightened for his health. He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. &#x27;When will you be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?&#x27; Mrs. Hudson asked. &#x27;Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,&#x27; said he. You know his way when he is keen on a case.&quot; &quot;Yes, Billy, I know.&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s following someone. Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job. To-day he was an old woman. Fairly took me in, he did, and I ought to know his ways by now.&quot; Billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa. &quot;That&#x27;s part of the old woman&#x27;s outfit,&quot; he said. &quot;But what is it all about, Billy?&quot; Billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of State. &quot;I don&#x27;t mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther. It&#x27;s this case of the Crown diamond.&quot; &quot;What!- the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa. Mr. Holmes was very nice to them. He soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could. Then there is Lord Cantlemere-&quot; &quot;Ah!&quot; &quot;Yes, sir, you know what that means. He&#x27;s a stiff &#x27;un, sir, if I may say so. I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I&#x27;ve nothing against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man, but I can&#x27;t stand his Lordship. Neither can Mr. Holmes, sir. You see, he don&#x27;t believe in Mr. Holmes and he was against employing him. He&#x27;d rather he failed.&quot; &quot;And Mr. Holmes knows it?&quot; &quot;Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is to know.&quot; &quot;Well, we&#x27;ll hope he won&#x27;t fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be confounded. But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across the window?&quot; &quot;Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days ago. We&#x27;ve got something funny behind it.&quot; Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window. Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. There was a facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downward, as though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an armchair. Billy detached the head and held it in the air. &quot;We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more lifelike. I wouldn&#x27;t dare touch it if the blind were not down. But when it&#x27;s up you can see this from across the way.&quot; &quot;We used something of the sort once before.&quot; &quot;Before my time,&quot; said Billy. He drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street. &quot;There are folk who watch us from over yonder. I can see a fellow now at the window. Have a look for yourself.&quot; Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn but his step and bearing as active as ever. With a single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind once more. &quot;That will do, Billy,&quot; said he. &quot;You were in danger of your life then, my boy, and I can&#x27;t do without you just yet. Well, Watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again. You come at a critical moment.&quot; &quot;So I gather.&quot; &quot;You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Watson. How far am I justified in allowing him to be in danger?&quot; &quot;Danger of what, Holmes?&quot; &quot;Of sudden death. I&#x27;m expecting something this evening.&quot; &quot;Expecting what?&quot; &quot;To be murdered, Watson.&quot; &quot;No, no, you are joking, Holmes!&quot; &quot;Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that. But we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not? Is alcohol permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old place. Let me see you once more in the customary armchair. You have not, I hope, learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? It has to take the place of food these days.&quot; &quot;But why not eat?&quot; &quot;Because the faculties become refined when you starve them. Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must consider.&quot; &quot;But this danger, Holmes?&quot; &quot;Ah, yes, in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with my love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the name- Count Negretto Sylvius. Write it down, man, write it down! 136 Moorside Gardens, N.W. Got it?&quot; Watson&#x27;s honest face was twitching with anxiety. He knew only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration. Watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion. &quot;Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do for a day or two.&quot; &quot;Your morals don&#x27;t improve, Watson. You have added fibbing to your other vices. You bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him every hour.&quot; &quot;Not such important ones. But can&#x27;t you have this fellow arrested?&quot; &quot;Yes, Watson, I could. That&#x27;s what worries him so.&quot; &quot;But why don&#x27;t you?&quot; &quot;Because I don&#x27;t know where the diamond is.&quot; &quot;Ah! Billy told me- the missing Crown jewel!&quot; &quot;Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. I&#x27;ve cast my net and I have my fish. But I have not got the stone. What is the use of taking them? We can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels. But that is not what I am out for. It&#x27;s the stone I want.&quot; &quot;And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?&quot; &quot;Yes, and he&#x27;s a shark. He bites. The other is Sam Merton, the boxer. Not a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him. Sam&#x27;s not a shark. He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. But he is flopping about in my net all the same.&quot; &quot;Where is this Count Sylvius?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve been at his very elbow all the morning. You&#x27;ve seen me as an old lady, Watson. I was never more convincing. He actually picked up my parasol for me once. &#x27;By your leave, madame,&#x27; said he- half-Italian, you know, and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in the other mood. Life is full of whimsical happenings, Watson.&quot; &quot;It might have been tragedy.&quot; &quot;Well, perhaps it might. I followed him to old Straubenzee&#x27;s workshop in the Minories. Straubenzee made the air-gun- a very pretty bit of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment. Have you seen the dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to you. Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it?&quot; The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile. &quot;The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game. It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel.&quot; &quot;Send for the police.&quot; &quot;I probably shall. But not just yet. Would you glance carefully out of the window, Watson, and see if anyone is banging about in the street?&quot; Watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain. &quot;Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door.&quot; &quot;That will be Sam Merton- the faithful but rather fatuous Sam. Where is this gentleman, Billy?&quot; &quot;In the waiting-room, sir.&quot; &quot;Show him up when I ring.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;If I am not in the room, show him in all the same.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion. &quot;Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to murder you. &quot;I should not be surprised.&quot; &quot;I insist upon staying with you.&quot; &quot;You would be horribly in the way.&quot; &quot;In his way?&quot; &quot;No, my dear fellow- in my way.&quot; &quot;Well, I can&#x27;t possibly leave you.&quot; &quot;Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed to play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.&quot; Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. &quot;Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the C.I.D. Come back with the police. The fellow&#x27;s arrest will follow.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll do that with joy.&quot; &quot;Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the stone is.&quot; He touched the bell. &quot;I think we will go out through the bedroom. This second exit is exceedingly useful. I rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I have, as you will remember, my own way of doing it.&quot; It was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute later, ushered Count Sylvius. The famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark moustache shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved nose like the beak of an eagle. He was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. As the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the armchair in the window. At first his expression was one of pure amazement. Then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. He took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent figure. He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door: &quot;Don&#x27;t break it, Count! Don&#x27;t break it!&quot; The assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face. For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something in that steady gray eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side. &quot;It&#x27;s a pretty little thing,&quot; said Holmes, advancing towards the image. &quot;Tavernier, the French modeller, made it. He is as good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.&quot; &quot;Air-guns, sir! What do you mean?&quot; &quot;Put your hat and stick on the side-table. Thank you! Pray take a seat. Would you care to put your revolver out also? Oh, very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most opportune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes&#x27; chat with you.&quot; The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows. &quot;I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. That is why I am here. I won&#x27;t deny that I intended to assault you just now.&quot; Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table. &quot;I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,&quot; said he. &quot;But why these personal attentions?&quot; &quot;Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. Because you have put your creatures upon my track.&quot; &quot;My creatures! I assure you no!&quot; &quot;Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can play at that game, Holmes.&quot; &quot;It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me. You can understand that, with my, routine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues&#x27; gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious.&quot; &quot;Well, Mr. Holmes, then.&quot; &quot;Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents.&quot; Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously. &quot;Other people can observe as well as you. Yesterday there was an old sporting man. To-day it was an elderly woman. They held me in view all day.&quot; &quot;Really, sir, you compliment me. Old Baron Dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost. And now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise?&quot; &quot;It was you- you yourself?&quot; Holmes shrugged his shoulders. &quot;You can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the Minories before you began to suspect.&quot; &quot;If I had known, you might never-&quot; &quot;Have seen this horrible home again. I was well aware of it. We all have neglected opportunities to deplore. As it happens, you did not know, so here we are!&quot; The Count&#x27;s knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes. &quot;What you say only makes the matter worse. It was not your agents but your play-acting, busybody self! You admit that you have dogged me. Why?&quot; &quot;Come now, Count. You used to shoot lions in Algeria.&quot; &quot;Well?&quot; &quot;But why?&quot; &quot;Why? The sport- the excitement- the danger!&quot; &quot;And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?&quot; &quot;Exactly!&quot; &quot;My reasons in a nutshell!&quot; The Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket. &quot;Sit down, sir, sit down! There was another, more practical, reason. I want that yellow diamond!&quot; Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile. &quot;Upon my word!&quot; said he. &quot;You knew that I was after you for that. The real reason why you are here tonight is to find out how much I know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. Well, I should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essential, for I know all about it, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me.&quot; &quot;Oh, indeed! And pray, what is this missing fact?&quot; &quot;Where the Crown diamond now is.&quot; The Count looked sharply at his companion. &quot;Oh, you want to know that, do you? How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is?&quot; &quot;You can, and you will.&quot; &quot;Indeed!&quot; &quot;You can&#x27;t bluff me, Count Sylvius.&quot; Holmes&#x27;s eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel. &quot;You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very back of your mind.&quot; &quot;Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!&quot; Holmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive finger. &quot;Then you do know. You have admitted it!&quot; &quot;I admit nothing.&quot; &quot;Now, Count, if you will be reasonable we can do business. If not, you will get hurt.&quot; Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. &quot;And you talk about bluff!&quot; said he. Holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move. Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook. &quot;Do you know what I keep in this book?&quot; &quot;No, sir, I do not!&quot; &quot;You!&quot; &quot;Me!&quot; &quot;Yes, sir, you! You are all here- every action of your vile and dangerous life.&quot; &quot;Damn you, Holmes!&quot; cried the Count with blazing eyes. &quot;There are limits to my patience!&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s all here, Count. The real facts as to the death of old Mrs. Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled away.&quot; &quot;You are dreaming!&quot; &quot;And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender.&quot; &quot;Tut! You will make nothing of that!&quot; &quot;Plenty more here, Count. Here is the robbery in the train de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13, 1892. Here is the forged check in the same year on the Credit Lyonnais.&quot; &quot;No; you&#x27;re wrong there.&quot; &quot;Then I am right on the others! Now, Count, you are a card-player. When the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your hand.&quot; &quot;What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke?&quot; &quot;Gently, Count. Restrain that eager mind! Let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion. I have all this against you; but, above all, I have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond.&quot; &quot;Indeed!&quot; &quot;I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the cabman who brought you away. I have the commissionaire who saw you near the case. I have Ikey Sanders, who refused to cut it up for you. Ikey has peached, and the game is up.&quot; The veins stood out on the Count&#x27;s forehead. His dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. He tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves. &quot;That&#x27;s the hand I play from,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I put it all on the table. But one card is missing. It&#x27;s the king of diamonds. I don&#x27;t know where the stone is.&quot; &quot;You never shall know.&quot; &quot;No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the situation. You are going to be locked up for twenty years. So is Sam Merton. What good are you going to get out of your diamond? None in the world. But if you hand it over- well, I&#x27;ll compound a felony. We don&#x27;t want you or Sam. We want the stone. Give that up, and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future. If you make another slip- well, it will be the last. But this time my commission is to get the stone, not you.&quot; &quot;But if I refuse?&quot; &quot;Why, then- alas!- it must be you and not the stone.&quot; Billy had appeared in answer to a ring. &quot;I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at this conference. After all, his interests should be represented. Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door. Ask him to come up.&quot; &quot;If he won&#x27;t come, sir?&quot; &quot;No violence, Billy. Don&#x27;t be rough with him. If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come.&quot; &quot;What are you going to do now?&quot; asked the Count as Billy disappeared. &quot;My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I had a shark and gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up they come together.&quot; The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back. Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown. &quot;You won&#x27;t die in your bed, Holmes.&quot; &quot;I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid. Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?&quot; A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal. Holmes&#x27;s figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready. &quot;It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend,&quot; he said in a quiet voice. You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good day, Mr. Merton. Rather dull in the street, is it not?&quot; The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes&#x27;s debonair manner was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more astute comrade for help. &quot;What&#x27;s the game now, Count? What&#x27;s this fellow want? What&#x27;s up?&quot; His voice was deep and raucous. The Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was Holmes who answered. &quot;If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was all up.&quot; The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate. &quot;Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I&#x27;m not in the funny mood myself.&quot; &quot;No, I expect not,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I think I can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. Now, look here, Count Sylvius. I&#x27;m a busy man and I can&#x27;t waste time. I&#x27;m going into that bedroom. Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. You can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffman &#x27;Barcarole&#x27; upon my violin. In five minutes I shall return for your final answer. You quite grasp the alternative, do you not? Shall we take you, or shall we have the stone?&quot; Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom. &quot;What is it, then?&quot; asked Merton anxiously as his companion turned to him. &quot;Does he know about the stone?&quot; &quot;He knows a damned sight too much about it. I&#x27;m not sure that he doesn&#x27;t know all about it.&quot; &quot;Good Lord!&quot; The boxer&#x27;s sallow face turned a shade whiter. &quot;Ikey Sanders has split on us.&quot; &quot;He has, has he? I&#x27;ll do him down a thick &#x27;un for that if I swing for it.&quot; &quot;That won&#x27;t help us much. We&#x27;ve got to make up our minds what to do.&quot; &quot;Half a mo&#x27;,&quot; said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door. &quot;He&#x27;s a leary cove that wants watching. I suppose he&#x27;s not listening?&quot; &quot;How can he be listening with that music going?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s right. Maybe somebody&#x27;s behind a curtain. Too many curtains in this room.&quot; As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed for words. &quot;Tut! it&#x27;s only a dummy,&quot; said the Count. &quot;A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tussaud ain&#x27;t in it. It&#x27;s the living spit of him, gown and all. But them curtains, Count!&quot; &quot;Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting our time, and there is none too much. He can lag us over this stone.&quot; &quot;The deuce he can!&quot; &quot;But he&#x27;ll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is.&quot; &quot;What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thousand quid?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s one or the other.&quot; Merton scratched his short-cropped pate. &quot;He&#x27;s alone in there. Let&#x27;s do him in. If his light were out we should have nothing to fear.&quot; The Count shook his head. &quot;He is armed and ready. If we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this. Besides, it&#x27;s likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got. Hallo! What was that?&quot; There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. Both men sprang round, but all was quiet. Save for the one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty. &quot;Something in the street,&quot; said Merton. &quot;Now look here, guv&#x27;nor, you&#x27;ve got the brains. Surely you can think a way out of it. If slugging is no use then it&#x27;s up to you. &quot;I&#x27;ve fooled better men than he,&quot; the Count answered. &quot;The stone is here in my secret pocket. I take no chances leaving it about. It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in Amsterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van Seddar.&quot; &quot;I thought Van Seddar was going next week.&quot; &quot;He was. But now he must get off by the next boat. One or other of us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him.&quot; &quot;But the false bottom ain&#x27;t ready.&quot; &quot;Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There&#x27;s not a moment to lose.&quot; Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come. &quot;As to Holmes,&quot; he continued, &quot;we can fool him easily enough. You see, the damned fool won&#x27;t arrest us if he can get the stone. Well, we&#x27;ll promise him the stone. We&#x27;ll put him on the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in Holland and we out of the country.&quot; &quot;That sounds good to me!&quot; cried Sam Merton with a grin. &quot;You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. I&#x27;ll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. I&#x27;ll tell him that the stone is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn&#x27;t in Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water. Come back here, out of a line with that keyhole. Here is the stone.&quot; &quot;I wonder you dare carry it.&quot; &quot;Where could I have it safer? If we could take it out of Whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings.&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s have a look at it.&quot; Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him. &quot;What- d&#x27;ye think I&#x27;m going to snitch it off you? See here, mister, I&#x27;m getting a bit tired of your ways.&quot; &quot;Well, well, no offence, Sam. We can&#x27;t afford to quarrel. Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. Now hold it to the light! Here!&quot; &quot;Thank you!&quot; With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy&#x27;s chair and had grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the Count&#x27;s head. The two villains staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell. &quot;No violence, gentlemen- no violence, I beg of you! Consider the furniture! It must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one. The police are waiting below.&quot; The Count&#x27;s bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear. &quot;But how the deuce-?&quot; he gasped. &quot;Your surprise is very natural. You are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. I fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my side. It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence.&quot; The Count gave a gesture of resignation. &quot;We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil himself.&quot; &quot;Not far from him, at any rate,&quot; Holmes answered with a polite smile. Sam Merton&#x27;s slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke silence at last. &quot;A fair cop!&quot; said he. &quot;But, I say, what about that bloomin&#x27; fiddle! I hear it yet.&quot; &quot;Tut, tut!&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;You are perfectly right. Let it play! These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention.&quot; There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with his card-tray. &quot;Lord Cantlemere, sir.&quot; &quot;Show him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;He is an excellent and loyal person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make him unbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred.&quot; The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand. &quot;How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly for the time of year, but rather warm indoors. May I take your overcoat?&quot; &quot;No, I thank you; I will not take it off.&quot; Holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve. &quot;Pray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious.&quot; His Lordship shook himself free with some impatience. &quot;I am quite comfortable, sir. I have no need to stay. I have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing.&quot; &quot;It is difficult- very difficult.&quot; &quot;I feared that you would find it so.&quot; There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier&#x27;s words and manner. &quot;Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed.&quot; &quot;No doubt.&quot; &quot;Especially upon one point. Possibly you could help me upon it?&quot; &quot;You apply for my advice rather late in the day. I thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods. Still, I am ready to help you.&quot; &quot;You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves.&quot; &quot;When you have caught them.&quot; &quot;Exactly. But the question is- how shall we proceed against the receiver?&quot; &quot;Is this not rather premature?&quot; &quot;It is as well to have our plans ready. Now, what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver?&quot; &quot;The actual possession of the stone.&quot; &quot;You would arrest him upon that?&quot; &quot;Most undoubtedly.&quot; Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson could remember. &quot;In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest.&quot; Lord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow checks. &quot;You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of official life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir, engaged upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes. I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. I have the honour, sir, to wish you good-evening.&quot; Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door. &quot;One moment, sir,&quot; said he. &quot;To actually go off with the Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it.&quot; &quot;Sir, this is intolerable! Let me pass.&quot; &quot;Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat.&quot; &quot;What do you mean, sir?&quot; &quot;Come- come, do what I ask.&quot; An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm. &quot;What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?&quot; &quot;Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!&quot; cried Holmes. &quot;My old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking. Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation. I took the liberty- the very great liberty, I admit- of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview.&quot; The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him. &quot;Sir, I am bewildered. But- yes- it is indeed the Mazarin stone. We are greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes. Your sense of humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers. But how-&quot; &quot;The case is but half finished; the details can wait. No doubt, Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted role to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke. Billy, you will show his Lordship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible.&quot;</div></div></div><div
