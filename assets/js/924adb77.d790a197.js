Many a brave soul did it send\r\nhurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs\r\nand vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the\r\nday on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first\r\nfell out with one another.\r\nAnd which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the\r\nson of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a\r\npestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of\r\nAtreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the\r\nships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a\r\ngreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo\r\nwreathed with a suppliant\'s wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but\r\nmost of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.\r\n"Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the gods\r\nwho dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach\r\nyour homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for\r\nher, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove."\r\nOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for\r\nrespecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not\r\nso Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away.\r\n"Old man," said he, "let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor\r\nyet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall\r\nprofit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my\r\nhouse at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom\r\nand visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the\r\nworse for you."\r\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went\r\nby the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo\r\nwhom lovely Leto had borne. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the\r\nsilver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos\r\nwith thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your\r\ntemple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or\r\ngoats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon\r\nthe Danaans."\r\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down\r\nfurious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver\r\nupon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage\r\nthat trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with\r\na face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot\r\nhis arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their\r\nhounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves,\r\nand all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.\r\nFor nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon\r\nthe tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,\r\nwho saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon\r\nthem. Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.\r\n"Son of Atreus," said he, "I deem that we should now turn roving\r\nhome if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by\r\nwar and pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some\r\nreader of dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why\r\nPhoebus Apollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we\r\nhave broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will\r\naccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take\r\naway the plague from us."\r\nWith these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest\r\nof augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He\r\nit was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius,\r\nthrough the prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him.\r\nWith all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:-\r\n"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of\r\nKing Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that\r\nyou will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I\r\nshall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the\r\nAchaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger\r\nof a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse\r\nrevenge till he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you\r\nwill protect me."\r\nAnd Achilles answered, "Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon\r\nyou from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose\r\noracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand\r\nupon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth- no, not\r\nthough you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the\r\nAchaeans."\r\nThereon the seer spoke boldly. "The god," he said, "is angry neither\r\nabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest\'s sake, whom Agamemnon\r\nhas dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a\r\nransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will\r\nyet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans from this\r\npestilence till Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee or\r\nransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thus\r\nwe may perhaps appease him."\r\nWith these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart\r\nwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on\r\nCalchas and said, "Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth\r\nthings concerning me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was\r\nevil. You have brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you\r\ncome seeing among Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us\r\nbecause I would not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of\r\nChryses. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own house, for I\r\nlove her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she\r\nis alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments.\r\nStill I will give her up if I must, for I would have the people\r\nlive, not die; but you must find me a prize instead, or I alone\r\namong the Argives shall be without one. This is not well; for you\r\nbehold, all of you, that my prize is to go elsewhither."\r\nAnd Achilles answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond\r\nall mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have no\r\ncommon store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities\r\nhave been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made\r\nalready. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove\r\ngrants us to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three and\r\nfourfold."\r\nThen Agamemnon said, "Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not\r\nthus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me.\r\nAre you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and\r\ngive up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize\r\nin fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or\r\nthat of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall\r\nrue my coming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the\r\npresent, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her\r\nexpressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseis\r\nalso; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either Ajax,\r\nor Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are,\r\nthat we may offer sacrifice and appease the the anger of the god."\r\nAchilles scowled at him and answered, "You are steeped in\r\ninsolence and lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do\r\nyour bidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came not\r\nwarring here for any ill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel\r\nwith them. They have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut\r\ndown my harvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them\r\nthere is a great space, both mountain and sounding sea. We have\r\nfollowed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not ours- to gain\r\nsatisfaction from the Trojans for your shameless self and for\r\nMenelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize for\r\nwhich I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me.\r\nNever when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do I receive\r\nso good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the better\r\npart of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far the\r\nlargest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can\r\nget and be thankful, when my labour of fighting is done. Now,\r\ntherefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better for me to\r\nreturn home with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonoured to\r\ngather gold and substance for you."\r\nAnd Agamemnon answered, "Fly if you will, I shall make you no\r\nprayers to stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and\r\nabove all Jove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so\r\nhateful to me as you are, for you are ever quarrelsome and ill\r\naffected. What though you be brave? Was it not heaven that made you\r\nso? Go home, then, with your ships and comrades to lord it over the\r\nMyrmidons. I care neither for you nor for your anger; and thus will\r\nI do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis from me, I shall send\r\nher with my ship and my followers, but I shall come to your tent and\r\ntake your own prize Briseis, that you may learn how much stronger I am\r\nthan you are, and that another may fear to set himself up as equal\r\nor comparable with me."\r\nThe son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy\r\nbreast was divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside,\r\nand kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his\r\nanger. While he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty\r\nsword from its scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had\r\nsent her in the love she bore to them both), and seized the son of\r\nPeleus by his yellow hair, visible to him alone, for of the others\r\nno man could see her. Achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that\r\nflashed from her eyes at once knew that she was Minerva. "Why are\r\nyou here," said he, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove? To see the\r\npride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shall\r\nsurely be- he shall pay for this insolence with his life."\r\nAnd Minerva said, "I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid\r\nyou stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you\r\nalike. Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at\r\nhim if you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you-\r\nand it shall surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts three\r\ntimes as splendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore,\r\nand obey."\r\n"Goddess," answered Achilles, "however angry a man may be, he must\r\ndo as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear\r\nthe prayers of him who has obeyed them."\r\nHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it\r\nback into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to\r\nOlympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.\r\nBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus,\r\nfor he was still in a rage. "Wine-bibber," he cried, "with the face of\r\na dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the\r\nhost in fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this\r\nas you do death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes\r\nfrom any man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you\r\nare king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward\r\nyou would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a great\r\noath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf nor\r\nshoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left its parent stem upon\r\nthe mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and bark, and now the\r\nsons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians of the decrees of\r\nheaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter they shall\r\nlook fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the day of your\r\ndistress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of Hector,\r\nyou shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your heart with\r\nrage for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest of the\r\nAchaeans."\r\nWith this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on the\r\nground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning\r\nfiercely from his place upon the other side. Then uprose\r\nsmooth-tongued Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the\r\nwords fell from his lips sweeter than honey. Two generations of men\r\nborn and bred in Pylos had passed away under his rule, and he was\r\nnow reigning over the third. With all sincerity and goodwill,\r\ntherefore, he addressed them thus:-\r\n"Of a truth," he said, "a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean\r\nland. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be\r\nglad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are\r\nso excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;\r\ntherefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend of\r\nmen even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.\r\nNever again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd of\r\nhis people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus\r\nson of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men\r\never born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought\r\nthe fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. I\r\ncame from distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they would\r\nhave me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living\r\ncould withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded by\r\nthem. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent\r\nway. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl\r\naway, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles;\r\nand you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who by\r\nthe grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. You\r\nare strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon is\r\nstronger than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus,\r\ncheck your anger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who\r\nin the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans."\r\nAnd Agamemnon answered, "Sir, all that you have said is true, but\r\nthis fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord\r\nof all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be.\r\nGranted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also\r\ngiven him the right to speak with railing?"\r\nAchilles interrupted him. "I should be a mean coward," he cried,\r\n"were I to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not\r\nme, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying\r\nto your heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about this\r\ngirl, for those that take were those also that gave. But of all else\r\nthat is at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that\r\nothers may see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your\r\nblood."\r\nWhen they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up the\r\nassembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back\r\nto his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company,\r\nwhile Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of\r\ntwenty oarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a\r\nhecatomb for the god. And Ulysses went as captain.\r\nThese, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. But\r\nthe son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they\r\npurified themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they\r\noffered hecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore,\r\nand the smoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up\r\ntowards heaven.\r\nThus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon did\r\nnot forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty\r\nmessengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. "Go," said he, "to\r\nthe tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and\r\nbring her hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others and\r\ntake her- which will press him harder."\r\nHe charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon\r\nthey went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to\r\nthe tents and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by\r\nhis tent and his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them.\r\nThey stood fearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did\r\nthey speak, but he knew them and said, "Welcome, heralds, messengers\r\nof gods and men; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with\r\nAgamemnon who has sent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus,\r\nbring her and give her to them, but let them be witnesses by the\r\nblessed gods, by mortal men, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon\'s\r\nanger, that if ever again there be need of me to save the people\r\nfrom ruin, they shall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is mad\r\nwith rage and knows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans\r\nmay fight by their ships in safety."\r\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis\r\nfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them\r\nto the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. Then\r\nAchilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and\r\nlooking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in\r\nprayer to his immortal mother, "Mother," he cried, "you bore me doomed\r\nto live but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders from\r\nOlympus, might have made that little glorious. It is not so.\r\nAgamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me\r\nof my prize by force."\r\nAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was\r\nsitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.\r\nForthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down\r\nbefore him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and\r\nsaid, "My son, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you?\r\nKeep it not from me, but tell me, that we may know it together."\r\nAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, "You know it; why tell you\r\nwhat you know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of\r\nEetion, sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the\r\nAchaeans shared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as\r\nthe meed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the\r\nships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a\r\ngreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo,\r\nwreathed with a suppliant\'s wreath, and he besought the Achaeans,\r\nbut most of all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs.\r\n"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\r\nthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so\r\nAgamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So\r\nhe went back in anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his\r\nprayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the\r\npeople died thick on one another, for the arrows went everywhither\r\namong the wide host of the Achaeans. At last a seer in the fulness\r\nof his knowledge declared to us the oracles of Apollo, and I was\r\nmyself first to say that we should appease him. Whereon the son of\r\nAtreus rose in anger, and threatened that which he has since done. The\r\nAchaeans are now taking the girl in a ship to Chryse, and sending\r\ngifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from my\r\ntent the daughter of Briseus, whom the Achaeans had awarded to myself.\r\n"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and\r\nif you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid\r\nof Jove. Ofttimes in my father\'s house have I heard you glory in\r\nthat you alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin,\r\nwhen the others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put\r\nhim in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to\r\nOlympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men\r\nAegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore he\r\ntook his seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods\r\nwere afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of all\r\nthis, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Let\r\nthe Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish\r\non the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their\r\nking, and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to\r\nthe foremost of the Achaeans."\r\nThetis wept and answered, "My son, woe is me that I should have\r\nborne or suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free\r\nfrom all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you\r\nshould be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers:\r\nwoe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I\r\nwill go to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove,\r\nif he will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your\r\nships, nurse your anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from\r\nfight. For Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among the\r\nEthiopians, and the other gods went with him. He will return to\r\nOlympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his mansion paved with\r\nbronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to\r\npersuade him."\r\nOn this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had been\r\ntaken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.\r\nWhen they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid\r\nthem in the ship\'s hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the\r\nmast into its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they\r\nwould have her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and\r\nmade fast the hawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landed\r\nthe hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulysses\r\nled her to the altar to deliver her into the hands of her father.\r\n"Chryses," said he, "King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your\r\nchild, and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that\r\nwe may propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow upon the\r\nArgives."\r\nSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her\r\ngladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the\r\naltar of the god. They washed their hands and took up the\r\nbarley-meal to sprinkle over the victims, while Chryses lifted up\r\nhis hands and prayed aloud on their behalf. "Hear me," he cried, "O\r\ngod of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla, and\r\nrulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou didst hear me aforetime\r\nwhen I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the Achaeans, so hear me\r\nyet again, and stay this fearful pestilence from the Danaans."\r\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done\r\npraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of\r\nthe victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the\r\nthigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some\r\npieces of raw meat on the top of them, and then Chryses laid them on\r\nthe wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men stood\r\nnear him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the\r\nthigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut\r\nthe rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted them till\r\nthey were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finished\r\ntheir work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his\r\nfull share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough\r\nto eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water and\r\nhanded it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.\r\nThus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song,\r\nhymning him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took\r\npleasure in their voices; but when the sun went down, and it came on\r\ndark, they laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the\r\nship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they\r\nagain set sail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair\r\nwind, so they raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft.\r\nAs the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deep\r\nblue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.\r\nWhen they reached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they\r\ndrew the vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong\r\nprops beneath her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.\r\nBut Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not to\r\nthe honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed at\r\nhis own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.\r\nNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to\r\nOlympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the\r\ncharge her son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and\r\nwent through great heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she\r\nfound the mighty son of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost\r\nridges. She sat herself down before him, and with her left hand seized\r\nhis knees, while with her right she caught him under the chin, and\r\nbesought him, saying-\r\n"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the\r\nimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is to\r\nbe cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking\r\nhis prize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord\r\nof counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give\r\nmy son his due and load him with riches in requital."\r\nJove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still\r\nkept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time.\r\n"Incline your head," said she, "and promise me surely, or else deny\r\nme- for you have nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly you\r\ndisdain me."\r\nAt this Jove was much troubled and answered, "I shall have trouble\r\nif you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with\r\nher taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before the\r\nother gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back\r\nnow, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will\r\nbring it about as wish. See, I incline my head that you believe me.\r\nThis is the most solemn that I can give to any god. I never recall\r\nmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded my\r\nhead."\r\nAs he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the\r\nambrosial locks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.\r\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to his\r\nhouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged\r\ninto the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the\r\ncoming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but all\r\nstood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. But\r\nJuno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman\'s daughter,\r\nsilver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began\r\nto upbraid him. "Trickster," she cried, "which of the gods have you\r\nbeen taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters in\r\nsecret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could help\r\nit, one word of your intentions."\r\n"Juno," replied the sire of gods and men, "you must not expect to be\r\ninformed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find it\r\nhard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is\r\nno one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a\r\nmatter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions."\r\n"Dread son of Saturn," answered Juno, "what are you talking about?\r\nI? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in\r\neverything. Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman\'s\r\ndaughter Thetis has been talking you over, for she was with you and\r\nhad hold of your knees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore,\r\nthat you have been promising her to give glory to Achilles, and to\r\nkill much people at the ships of the Achaeans."\r\n"Wife," said Jove, "I can do nothing but you suspect me and find\r\nit out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you\r\nthe more, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you\r\nsay; I mean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid\r\nyou for if I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven\r\nwere on your side it would profit you nothing."\r\nOn this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat\r\ndown in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout\r\nthe house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and\r\npacify his mother Juno. "It will be intolerable," said he, "if you two\r\nfall to wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of\r\nmortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no\r\npleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother- and she must\r\nherself know that it will be better- to make friends with my dear\r\nfather Jove, lest he again scold her and disturb our feast. If the\r\nOlympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can do\r\nso, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair words, and he will\r\nthen soon be in a good humour with us."\r\nAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his\r\nmother\'s hand. "Cheer up, my dear mother," said he, "and make the best\r\nof it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a\r\nthrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help for there is\r\nno standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you,\r\nhe caught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold. All\r\nday long from morn till eve, was I falling, till at sunset I came to\r\nground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little life\r\nleft in me, till the Sintians came and tended me."\r\nJuno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her\r\nson\'s hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and\r\nserved it round among the gods, going from left to right; and the\r\nblessed gods laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ing\r\nbustling about the heavenly mansion.\r\nThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they\r\nfeasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\r\nApollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices,\r\ncalling and answering one another. But when the sun\'s glorious light\r\nhad faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame\r\nVulcan with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove,\r\nthe Olympian Lord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always\r\nslept; and when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the\r\ngolden throne by his side.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     BOOK II\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept\r\nsoundly, but Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to\r\nAchilles, and destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In\r\nthe end he deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King\r\nAgamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it, "Lying Dream, go to\r\nthe ships of the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to\r\nhim word to word as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeans\r\ninstantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longer\r\ndivided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them to her own\r\nmind, and woe betides the Trojans."\r\nThe dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the\r\nships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found him\r\nin his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his head\r\nin the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured\r\nabove all his councillors, and said:-\r\n"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his\r\nhost and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his\r\nsleep. Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who,\r\nthough he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He\r\nbids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take\r\nTroy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has\r\nbrought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at\r\nthe hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you wake see that it does\r\nnot escape you."\r\nThe dream then left him, and he thought of things that were,\r\nsurely not to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was\r\nto take the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind\r\nof Jove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store alike for\r\nDanaans and Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine message\r\nstill ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft\r\nshirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound his\r\nsandals on to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded sword\r\nabout his shoulders; then he took the imperishable staff of his\r\nfather, and sallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans.\r\nThe goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might\r\nherald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent\r\nthe criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them\r\nand the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of\r\nthe elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were\r\nassembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.\r\n"My friends," said he, "I have had a dream from heaven in the dead\r\nof night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor\'s. It\r\nhovered over my head and said, \'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one\r\nwho has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon his\r\nshoulders should dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger\r\nfrom Jove, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and\r\npities you. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you\r\nshall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the\r\ngods; Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides\r\nthe Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this.\' The dream then\r\nvanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of the\r\nAchaeans. But it will be well that I should first sound them, and to\r\nthis end I will tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others\r\ngo about among the host and prevent their doing so."\r\nHe then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all\r\nsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: "My friends," said he,\r\n"princes and councillors of the Argives, if any other man of the\r\nAchaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it false,\r\nand would have had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is\r\nthe foremost man among us; we must therefore set about getting the\r\npeople under arms."\r\nWith this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred\r\nkings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the\r\npeople pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally from\r\nsome hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring\r\nflowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty\r\nmultitude pour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range\r\nthemselves upon the wide-watered shore, while among them ran\r\nWildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus\r\nthey gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the earth groaned\r\nunder the tramp of men as the people sought their places. Nine heralds\r\nwent crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid them\r\nlisten to the kings, till at last they were got into their several\r\nplaces and ceased their clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding his\r\nsceptre. This was the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of\r\nSaturn. Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide and\r\nguardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and\r\nPelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, left\r\nit to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to be\r\nborne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of all Argos and of the\r\nisles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the Argives.\r\n"My friends," he said, "heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven\r\nhas been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise\r\nthat I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has\r\nplayed me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos\r\nwith the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid\r\nmany a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his\r\npower is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an\r\nAchaean host, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against\r\nmen fewer in number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in\r\nsight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn\r\ncovenant, and that they have each been numbered- the Trojans by the\r\nroll of their householders, and we by companies of ten; think\r\nfurther that each of our companies desired to have a Trojan\r\nhouseholder to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in number\r\nthat full many a company would have to go without its cup-bearer.\r\nBut they have in the town allies from other places, and it is these\r\nthat hinder me from being able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of\r\nJove years are gone; the timbers of our ships have rotted; their\r\ntackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home look\r\nanxiously for our coming, but the work that we came hither to do has\r\nnot been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say: let us sail\r\nback to our own land, for we shall not take Troy."\r\nWith these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of\r\nthem as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to\r\nand fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south\r\nwinds break from heaven\'s clouds to lash them; or as when the west\r\nwind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast,\r\neven so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries towards the\r\nships, and the dust from under their feet rose heavenward. They\r\ncheered each other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the\r\nchannels in front of them; they began taking away the stays from\r\nunderneath them, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eager\r\nwere they to return.\r\nThen surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was\r\nnot fated. But Juno said to Minerva, "Alas, daughter of\r\naegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their\r\nown land over the broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory\r\nof still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have\r\ndied at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host,\r\nand speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships\r\ninto the sea."\r\nMinerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the\r\ntopmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of\r\nthe Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel,\r\nstanding alone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he\r\nwas grieved and sorry; so she went close up to him and said, "Ulysses,\r\nnoble son of Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your\r\nships and be off home to your own land in this way? Will you leave\r\nPriam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake\r\nso many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go\r\nabout at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man,\r\nthat they draw not their ships into the sea."\r\nUlysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak\r\nfrom him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca,\r\nwho waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went\r\nstraight up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral,\r\nimperishable staff. With this he went about among the ships of the\r\nAchaeans.\r\nWhenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke him\r\nfairly. "Sir," said he, "this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand\r\nto your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not\r\nyet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere\r\nlong will visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all\r\nof us at the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be\r\nangry and do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the\r\nhand of Jove is with them."\r\nBut when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he\r\nstruck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, "Sirrah, hold\r\nyour peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward\r\nand no soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot\r\nall be kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one\r\nman must be supreme- one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has\r\ngiven the sceptre of sovereignty over you all."\r\nThus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people\r\nhurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as\r\nthe thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and\r\nall the sea is in an uproar.\r\nThe rest now took their seats and kept to their own several\r\nplaces, but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- a\r\nman of many words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a\r\nrailer against all who were in authority, who cared not what he\r\nsaid, so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest\r\nman of all those that came before Troy- bandy-legged, lame of one\r\nfoot, with his two shoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His\r\nhead ran up to a point, but there was little hair on the top of it.\r\nAchilles and Ulysses hated him worst of all, for it was with them that\r\nhe was most wont to wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice\r\nhe began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and\r\ndisgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling at the\r\nson of Atreus.\r\n"Agamemnon," he cried, "what ails you now, and what more do you\r\nwant? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for\r\nwhenever we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have\r\nyet more gold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his\r\nson, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some\r\nyoung girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of\r\nthe Achaeans, should bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards,\r\nwomen rather than men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at\r\nTroy to stew in his own meeds of honour, and discover whether we\r\nwere of any service to him or no. Achilles is a much better man than\r\nhe is, and see how he has treated him- robbing him of his prize and\r\nkeeping it himself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he\r\ndid, son of Atreus, you would never again insult him."\r\nThus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and\r\nrebuked him sternly. "Check your glib tongue, Thersites," said be,\r\n"and babble not a word further. Chide not with princes when you have\r\nnone to back you. There is no viler creature come before Troy with the\r\nsons of Atreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them\r\nnor keep harping about going home. We do not yet know how things are\r\ngoing to be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with good\r\nsuccess or evil. How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans\r\nhave awarded him so many prizes? I tell you, therefore- and it shall\r\nsurely be- that if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I will\r\neither forfeit my own head and be no more called father of Telemachus,\r\nor I will take you, strip you stark naked, and whip you out of the\r\nassembly till you go blubbering back to the ships."\r\nOn this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till\r\nhe dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody weal\r\non his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish as\r\nhe wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yet\r\nthey laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying,\r\n"Ulysses has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council,\r\nbut he never did the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this\r\nfellow\'s mouth from prating further. He will give the kings no more of\r\nhis insolence."\r\nThus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and\r\nMinerva in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that\r\nthose who were far off might hear him and consider his council. He\r\ntherefore with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:-\r\n"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among all\r\nmankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out\r\nfrom Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of\r\nTroy, and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set\r\noff homeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to be\r\ndisheartened. A man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even\r\nfor a single month, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind\r\nand sea, but it is now nine long years that we have been kept here;\r\nI cannot, therefore, blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we\r\nshall be shamed if we go home empty after so long a stay- therefore,\r\nmy friends, be patient yet a little longer that we may learn whether\r\nthe prophesyings of Calchas were false or true.\r\n"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were\r\nyesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were\r\ndetained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on\r\nPriam and the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountain\r\noffering hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a\r\nfine plane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of pure\r\nwater. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out of\r\nthe ground, with blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from\r\nunder the altar on to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of young\r\nsparrows, quite small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from\r\nunder the leaves, eight in all, and their mother that hatched them\r\nmade nine. The serpent ate the poor cheeping things, while the old\r\nbird flew about lamenting her little ones; but the serpent threw his\r\ncoils about her and caught her by the wing as she was screaming. Then,\r\nwhen he had eaten both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent\r\nhim made him become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned\r\nhim into stone, and we stood there wondering at that which had come to\r\npass. Seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in upon our\r\nhecatombs, Calchas forthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven.\r\n\'Why, Achaeans,\' said he, \'are you thus speechless? Jove has sent us\r\nthis sign, long in coming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though its\r\nfame shall last for ever. As the serpent ate the eight fledglings\r\nand the sparrow that hatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fight\r\nnine years at Troy, but in the tenth shall take the town.\' This was\r\nwhat he said, and now it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all\r\nof you, till we take the city of Priam."\r\nOn this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with\r\nthe uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. "Shame on\r\nyou," he cried, "to stay talking here like children, when you should\r\nfight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths\r\nthat we have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with\r\nour drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we\r\nhave put our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our\r\ntalking here shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of\r\nAtreus, by your own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on to\r\nbattle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme\r\nin vain, to get back to Argos ere they have learned whether Jove be\r\ntrue or a liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that we\r\nshould succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and\r\ndestruction upon the Trojans. He showed us favourable signs by\r\nflashing his lightning on our right hands; therefore let none make\r\nhaste to go till he has first lain with the wife of some Trojan, and\r\navenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of\r\nHelen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such haste to be at home\r\nagain, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in\r\nthe sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear to my counsel,\r\nfor the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide your men,\r\nAgamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and\r\ntribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if the\r\nAchaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, are\r\nbrave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the other.\r\nThus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of\r\nheaven or the cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town."\r\nAnd Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, you have again outdone the sons\r\nof the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and\r\nApollo, that I had among them ten more such councillors, for the\r\ncity of King Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we\r\nshould sack it. But the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless\r\nwranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this girl,\r\nin which matter I was the first to offend; if we can be of one mind\r\nagain, the Trojans will not stave off destruction for a day. Now,\r\ntherefore, get your morning meal, that our hosts join in fight. Whet\r\nwell your spears; see well to the ordering of your shields; give\r\ngood feeds to your horses, and look your chariots carefully over, that\r\nwe may do battle the livelong day; for we shall have no rest, not\r\nfor a moment, till night falls to part us. The bands that bear your\r\nshields shall be wet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands\r\nshall weary upon your spears, your horses shall steam in front of your\r\nchariots, and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep\r\nout of it at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall\r\nbe a prey to dogs and vultures."\r\nThus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves\r\nrun high before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty\r\nheadland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as\r\nthe storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans\r\nrise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted\r\ntheir fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every\r\nman to one or other of the gods, and praying each one of them that\r\nhe might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men,\r\nsacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and\r\ninvited the princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestor\r\nand King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and\r\nsixthly Ulysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his own\r\naccord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round\r\nthe bull with the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed,\r\nsaying, "Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and\r\nridest upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor\r\nthe night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates\r\nare consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of\r\nHector about his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bite\r\nthe dust as they fall dying round him."\r\nThus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer.\r\nHe accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil\r\ncontinually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal\r\nupon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed\r\nit. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers\r\nof fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These they\r\nburned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inward\r\nmeats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-bones\r\nwere burned, and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest\r\nup small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done,\r\nand drew them off; then, when they had finished their work and the\r\nfeast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so\r\nthat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\r\ndrink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. "King Agamemnon,"\r\nsaid he, "let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work\r\nthat heaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds summon the\r\npeople to gather at their several ships; we will then go about among\r\nthe host, that we may begin fighting at once."\r\nThus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent\r\nthe criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called\r\nthem, and the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of\r\nAtreus chose their men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among\r\nthem holding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death.\r\nFrom it there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly\r\nwoven, and each one of them worth a hundred oxen. With this she darted\r\nfuriously everywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging them\r\nforward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that he\r\nmight fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter\r\nin their eyes even than returning home in their ships. As when some\r\ngreat forest fire is raging upon a mountain top and its light is\r\nseen afar, even so as they marched the gleam of their armour flashed\r\nup into the firmament of heaven.\r\nThey were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the\r\nplain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and\r\nthither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle\r\ntill the fen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes\r\npour from ships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the\r\nground rang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as\r\nthick upon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.\r\nAs countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman\'s homestead in\r\nthe time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so\r\ndid the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and\r\ndestroy them.\r\nThe chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight\r\nbegan, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks\r\nwhen they have got mixed while feeding; and among them went King\r\nAgamemnon, with a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist\r\nlike Mars, and a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that\r\nlords it over the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the\r\nson of Atreus stand peerless among the multitude of heroes.\r\nAnd now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me-\r\nfor you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all\r\nthings, while we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and\r\nprinces of the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so\r\nthat I could not name every single one of them though I had ten\r\ntongues, and though my voice failed not and my heart were of bronze\r\nwithin me, unless you, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing\r\nJove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless, I will tell the\r\ncaptains of the ships and all the fleet together.\r\nPeneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were\r\ncaptains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and\r\nrocky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of\r\nEteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They\r\nalso held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and\r\nPeteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and\r\nThisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus;\r\nPlataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus\r\nwith its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea,\r\nsacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty\r\nships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men of the\r\nBoeotians.\r\nAscalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt\r\nin Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble\r\nmaiden bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had\r\ngone with Mars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with\r\nher. With these there came thirty ships.\r\nThe Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty\r\nIphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus,\r\nrocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in\r\nAnemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus,\r\nand Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains came\r\nforty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, which\r\nwere stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.\r\nAjax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not so\r\ngreat, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a\r\nlittle man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of the\r\nspear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt in\r\nCynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and\r\nThronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships\r\nof the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.\r\nThe fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,\r\nHistiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perched\r\ntown of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra;\r\nElephenor of the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son of\r\nChalcodon, and chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet\r\nof foot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who\r\nwould ever strive to tear open the corslets of their foes with their\r\nlong ashen spears. Of these there came fifty ships.\r\nAnd they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great\r\nErechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove\'s daughter,\r\nMinerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich\r\nsanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him with\r\nsacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus,\r\nson of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling of\r\nchariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone rival him, for he was\r\nolder. With him there came fifty ships.\r\nAjax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside\r\nthose of the Athenians.\r\nThe men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns,\r\nwith Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the\r\nvineyard lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came\r\nfrom Aegina and Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud\r\nbattle-cry, and Sthenelus son of famed Capaneus. With them in\r\ncommand was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomed\r\nwas chief over them all. With these there came eighty ships.\r\nThose who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;\r\nOrneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old;\r\nHyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land\r\nround about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under the command of\r\nKing Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far both finest and\r\nmost numerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all glorious\r\nin his armour of gleaming bronze- foremost among the heroes, for he\r\nwas the greatest king, and had most men under him.\r\nAnd those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills,\r\nPharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae,\r\nAmyclae, and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these\r\nwere led by Menelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and\r\nof them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others.\r\nAmong them went Menelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to\r\nfight; for he longed to avenge the toil and sorrow that he had\r\nsuffered for the sake of Helen.\r\nThe men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the\r\nriver Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum,\r\nHelos, and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his\r\nminstrelsy for ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus\r\nlived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses,\r\ndaughters of aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him;\r\nwhereon they were angry, and maimed him. They robbed him of his divine\r\npower of song, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These\r\nwere commanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there came\r\nninety ships.\r\nAnd those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene,\r\nnear the tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men\r\nof Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie,\r\nand bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and\r\nParrhasia; of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, and\r\nthey had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each\r\none of them, but Agamemnon found them the ships in which to cross\r\nthe sea, for they were not a people that occupied their business\r\nupon the waters.\r\nThe men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is\r\nenclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock\r\nOlene and Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had ten\r\nships, with many Epeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus\r\nand Thalpius- the one, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- both\r\nof the race of Actor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces,\r\nand Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas.\r\nAnd those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt\r\nbeyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, and\r\nthe son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his\r\nfather, and went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came forty\r\nships.\r\nUlysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with\r\nits forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, with\r\nthe mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led by\r\nUlysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve\r\nships.\r\nThoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in\r\nPleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for\r\nthe great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as\r\nwas also golden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians\r\nto be their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.\r\nThe famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,\r\nand the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and\r\nLycastus that lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus\r\nand Rhytium, with the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities\r\nof Crete. All these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of\r\nmurderous Mars. And with these there came eighty ships.\r\nTlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of\r\nstature, brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These\r\ndwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus,\r\nIelysus, and Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These were\r\ncommanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he had\r\ncarried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, after sacking many\r\ncities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up, he killed his\r\nfather\'s uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous warrior in his time,\r\nbut was then grown old. On this he built himself a fleet, gathered a\r\ngreat following, and fled beyond the sea, for he was menaced by the\r\nother sons and grandsons of Hercules. After a voyage. during which\r\nhe suffered great hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the people\r\ndivided into three communities, according to their tribes, and were\r\ndearly loved by Jove, the lord, of gods and men; wherefore the son\r\nof Saturn showered down great riches upon them.\r\nAnd Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was the\r\nhandsomest man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after the\r\nson of Peleus- but he was a man of no substance, and had but a small\r\nfollowing.\r\nAnd those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the\r\ncity of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded\r\nby Pheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of\r\nHercules. And with them there came thirty ships.\r\nThose again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and\r\nthose of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called\r\nMyrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which\r\nAchilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war,\r\ninasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed by\r\nhis ships, furious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had\r\ntaken from Lyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sacked\r\nLyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of\r\nking Evenor, son of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving,\r\nbut ere long he was again to join them.\r\nAnd those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus,\r\nsanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea,\r\nand Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus\r\nhad been captain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under\r\nthe earth. He had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeks\r\nin sorrow, and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a\r\nDardanian warrior while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil\r\nof Troy. Still, though his people mourned their chieftain, they were\r\nnot without a leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled\r\nthem; he was son of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of\r\nPhylacus, and he was own brother to Protesilaus, only younger,\r\nProtesilaus being at once the elder and the more valiant. So the\r\npeople were not without a leader, though they mourned him whom they\r\nhad lost. With him there came forty ships.\r\nAnd those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe,\r\nGlaphyrae, and the populous city of Iolcus, these with their eleven\r\nships were led by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to\r\nhim, loveliest of the daughters of Pelias.\r\nAnd those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and\r\nrugged Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and\r\nthey had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good\r\narchers; but Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the Island of\r\nLemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been\r\nbitten by a poisonous water snake. There he lay sick and sorry, and\r\nfull soon did the Argives come to miss him. But his people, though\r\nthey felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon, the bastard son\r\nof Oileus by Rhene, set them in array.\r\nThose, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they\r\nthat held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were\r\ncommanded by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of\r\nhealing, Podalirius and Machaon. And with them there came thirty\r\nships.\r\nThe men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia,\r\nwith those that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus,\r\nthese were led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there\r\ncame forty ships.\r\nThose that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white\r\ncity of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was son\r\nof Pirithous, who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to\r\nPirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain\r\nsavages and drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoetes\r\nwas not sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race of\r\nMars, who was son of Coronus, the son of Caeneus. And with these there\r\ncame forty ships.\r\nGuneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed\r\nby the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona,\r\nand held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends\r\nits waters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver\r\neddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for the\r\nTitaresius is a branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx.\r\nOf the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They were\r\nthey that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet\r\nof foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.\r\nSuch were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O\r\nMuse, was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that\r\nfollowed after the sons of Atreus?\r\nOf the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest.\r\nThey were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They were\r\nof the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo,\r\nof the silver bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, and\r\nterrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was much\r\nthe foremost so long as Achilles\' anger lasted, for Achilles\r\nexcelled him greatly and he had also better horses; but Achilles was\r\nnow holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel with\r\nAgamemnon, and his people passed their time upon the sea shore,\r\nthrowing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and in archery.\r\nTheir horses stood each by his own chariot, champing lotus and wild\r\ncelery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners, for\r\nlack of leadership, wandered hither and thither about the host and\r\nwent not forth to fight.\r\nThus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned\r\nbeneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land\r\nabout Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even\r\nso did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.\r\nAnd now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad\r\nnews among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young,\r\nat Priam\'s gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the\r\nvoice of Priam\'s son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was\r\nstationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes,\r\nto look out for any sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke,\r\nsaying, "Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is\r\nat hand. I have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such a host\r\nas is now advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city as\r\nthick as leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above\r\nall others, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about the\r\ncity of Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues.\r\nTherefore, let each chief give orders to his own people, setting\r\nthem severally in array and leading them forth to battle."\r\nThus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once\r\nbroke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were\r\nopened, and the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the\r\ntramp as of a great multitude.\r\nNow there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the\r\nplain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb of\r\nlithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.\r\nPriam\'s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the\r\nTrojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and\r\nmost valiant of those who were longing for the fray.\r\nThe Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to\r\nAnchises, when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the\r\nmountain slopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two\r\nsons of Antenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all the\r\narts of war.\r\nThey that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men of\r\nsubstance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are of\r\nTrojan blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo\r\nhad taught to use the bow.\r\nThey that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia,\r\nand the high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus and\r\nAmphius, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops\r\nof Percote, who excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them\r\nnot to take part in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured\r\nthem to destruction.\r\nThey that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, and\r\nArisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander-\r\nAsius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of\r\nthe breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.\r\nHippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in\r\nfertile Larissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons\r\nof the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.\r\nAcamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those\r\nthat came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.\r\nEuphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the\r\nCiconian spearsmen.\r\nPyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the\r\nbroad waters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.\r\nThe Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from\r\nEnetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held\r\nCytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river\r\nParthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.\r\nOdius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant\r\nAlybe, where there are mines of silver.\r\nChromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in\r\naugury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by the\r\nhand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew\r\nothers also of the Trojans.\r\nPhorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far\r\ncountry of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray.\r\nMesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,\r\nborn to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dwelt\r\nunder Mt. Tmolus.\r\nNastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held\r\nMiletus and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the\r\nriver Maeander and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were\r\ncommanded by Nastes and Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came\r\ninto the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his\r\ngold was of no avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the hand\r\nof the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles bore away his gold.\r\nSarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by the\r\neddying waters of the Xanthus.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     BOOK III\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'When the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,\r\nthe Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream\r\noverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters of\r\nOceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and they\r\nwrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently,\r\nin high heart, and minded to stand by one another.\r\nAs when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain\r\ntops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man\r\ncan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust\r\nfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.\r\nWhen they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward as\r\nchampion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a\r\npanther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod\r\nwith bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet\r\nhim in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before the\r\nranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of\r\nsome goat or horned stag, and devours it there and then, though dogs\r\nand youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes\r\ncaught sight of Alexandrus, for he deemed that now he should be\r\nrevenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit\r\nof armour.\r\nAlexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in\r\nfear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back\r\naffrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a\r\nserpent in some mountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the\r\nthrong of Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son\r\nAtreus.\r\nThen Hector upbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris,\r\nfair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had\r\nnever been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to\r\nbe disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us\r\nand say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but\r\nwho has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, get\r\nyour following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you not from\r\nyour a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people of\r\nwarriors- to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and your\r\nwhole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness to\r\nyourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner\r\nof man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your\r\nlyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour,\r\nwhen you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a\r\nweak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones\r\nfor the wrongs you have done them."\r\nAnd Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just. You are\r\nhard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the\r\ntimber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of\r\nyour scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus has\r\ngiven me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the\r\ngods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the\r\nasking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the\r\nTrojans and Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in their\r\nmidst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious\r\nand prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear\r\nthem to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace\r\nwhereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others go\r\nhome to Argos and the land of the Achaeans."\r\nWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the\r\nTrojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and\r\nthey all sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at\r\nhim with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying,\r\n"Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to\r\nspeak."\r\nThey ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. "Hear\r\nfrom my mouth," said he, "Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of\r\nAlexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the\r\nTrojans and Achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and\r\nMenelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let\r\nhim who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the\r\nwoman and all she has, to bear them to his own home, but let the\r\nrest swear to a solemn covenant of peace."\r\nThus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the\r\nloud battle-cry addressed them. "And now," he said, "hear me too,\r\nfor it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of\r\nAchaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much\r\nhave suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did\r\nme. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more.\r\nBring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and\r\nSun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam\r\ncome, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons are\r\nhigh-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not be\r\ntransgressed or taken in vain. Young men\'s minds are light as air, but\r\nwhen an old man comes he looks before and after, deeming that which\r\nshall be fairest upon both sides."\r\nThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they\r\nthought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots\r\ntoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying it\r\ndown upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with a\r\nlittle space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to\r\nbring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius\r\nto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had\r\nsaid.\r\nMeanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law,\r\nwife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had\r\nmarried Laodice, the fairest of Priam\'s daughters. She found her in\r\nher own room, working at a great web of purple linen, on which she was\r\nembroidering the battles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had\r\nmade them fight for her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said,\r\n"Come hither, child, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and\r\nAchaeans till now they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust\r\nof battle, but now they have left off fighting, and are leaning upon\r\ntheir shields, sitting still with their spears planted beside them.\r\nAlexandrus and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are\r\nto the the wife of him who is the victor."\r\nThus spoke the goddess, and Helen\'s heart yearned after her former\r\nhusband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over\r\nher head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone,\r\nbut attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus,\r\nand Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.\r\nThe two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were\r\nseated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus,\r\nClytius, and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to\r\nfight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales\r\nthat chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood.\r\nWhen they saw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly to\r\none another, "Small wonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endure\r\nso much and so long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously and\r\ndivinely lovely. Still, fair though she be, let them take her and\r\ngo, or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children after us."\r\nBut Priam bade her draw nigh. "My child," said he, "take your seat\r\nin front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen\r\nand your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you who\r\nare to blame. It is they that have brought about this terrible war\r\nwith the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and\r\ngoodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and so\r\nroyal. Surely he must be a king."\r\n"Sir," answered Helen, "father of my husband, dear and reverend in\r\nmy eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here\r\nwith your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling\r\ndaughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be,\r\nand my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the\r\nhero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and a\r\nbrave soldier, brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my\r\nabhorred and miserable self."\r\nThe old man marvelled at him and said, "Happy son of Atreus, child\r\nof good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great\r\nmultitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of\r\nOtreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river\r\nSangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers\r\nof men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the\r\nAchaeans."\r\nThe old man next looked upon Ulysses; "Tell me," he said, "who is\r\nthat other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the\r\nchest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks\r\nin front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his\r\newes."\r\nAnd Helen answered, "He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of\r\nLaertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of\r\nstratagems and subtle cunning."\r\nOn this Antenor said, "Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once\r\ncame here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received\r\nthem in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and\r\nconversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,\r\nMenelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses\r\nhad the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their\r\nmessage, and the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he\r\ndid not say much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very\r\nclearly and to the point, though he was the younger man of the two;\r\nUlysses, on the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent\r\nand kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor\r\ngraceful movement of his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a\r\nman unpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for a mere\r\nchurl or simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came\r\ndriving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then\r\nthere was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what he\r\nlooked like."\r\nPriam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, "Who is that great and\r\ngoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest\r\nof the Argives?"\r\n"That," answered Helen, "is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,\r\nand on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus\r\nlooking like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him.\r\nOften did Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he came\r\nvisiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose\r\nnames I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find,\r\nCastor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are\r\nchildren of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have\r\nnot left Lacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships,\r\nthey will not show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace\r\nthat I have brought upon them."\r\nShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the\r\nearth in their own land of Lacedaemon.\r\nMeanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings\r\nthrough the city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth;\r\nand Idaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to\r\nPriam and said, "Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and\r\nAchaeans bid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemn\r\ncovenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus are to fight for Helen in single\r\ncombat, that she and all her wealth may go with him who is the victor.\r\nWe are to swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we others\r\nshall dwell here in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and the\r\nland of the Achaeans."\r\nThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the\r\nhorses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,\r\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside\r\nhim; they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When\r\nthey reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the\r\nchariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space between the\r\nhosts.\r\nAgamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought\r\non the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they\r\npoured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus\r\ndrew the dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs\'\r\nheads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean\r\nprinces, and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer.\r\n"Father Jove," he cried, "that rulest in Ida, most glorious in\r\npower, and thou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earth\r\nand Rivers, and ye who in the realms below chastise the soul of him\r\nthat has broken his oath, witness these rites and guard them, that\r\nthey be not vain. If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and\r\nall her wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus\r\nkills Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that she\r\nhas; let them moreover pay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be\r\nagreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born hereafter.\r\nAid if Priam and his sons refuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen,\r\nthen will I stay here and fight on till I have got satisfaction."\r\nAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and\r\nlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had\r\nreft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the\r\nmixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying,\r\nTrojans and Achaeans among one another, "Jove, most great and\r\nglorious, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them\r\nwho shall first sin against their oaths- of them and their children-\r\nmay be shed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wives\r\nbecome the slaves of strangers."\r\nThus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.\r\nThen Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojans\r\nand Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: I\r\ndare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and\r\nMenelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall\r\nfall."\r\nOn this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He\r\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two\r\nthen went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and\r\ncast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim\r\nfirst. Meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed\r\nsaying, "Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power,\r\ngrant that he who first brought about this war between us may die, and\r\nenter the house of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by\r\nour oaths."\r\nGreat Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,\r\nand the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several\r\nstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were\r\nlying, while Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly\r\narmour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted\r\nwith ancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his\r\nbrother Lycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his\r\nsilver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his\r\nmighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought,\r\nwith a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he\r\ngrasped a redoubtable spear that suited his hands. In like fashion\r\nMenelaus also put on his armour.\r\nWhen they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode\r\nfierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans\r\nwere struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one\r\nanother on the measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each\r\nfurious against the other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the\r\nround shield of the son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it,\r\nfor the shield turned its point. Menelaus next took aim, praying to\r\nFather Jove as he did so. "King Jove," he said, "grant me revenge on\r\nAlexandrus who has wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages\r\nyet to come a man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of\r\nhis host."\r\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of\r\nAlexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt\r\nby his flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life.\r\nThen the son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting\r\npart of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four\r\npieces from his hand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, "Father\r\nJove, of all gods thou art the most despiteful; I made sure of my\r\nrevenge, but the sword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled\r\nin vain, and I have not killed him."\r\nWith this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume\r\nof his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The\r\nstrap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and\r\nMenelaus would have dragged him off to his own great glory had not\r\nJove\'s daughter Venus been quick to mark and to break the strap of\r\noxhide, so that the empty helmet came away in his hand. This he\r\nflung to his comrades among the Achaeans, and was again springing upon\r\nAlexandrus to run him through with a spear, but Venus snatched him\r\nup in a moment (as a god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness,\r\nand conveyed him to his own bedchamber.\r\nThen she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with\r\nthe Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman\r\nwho used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and\r\nof whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by\r\nperfumed robe and said, "Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to\r\nthe house; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and\r\ndressed in gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come\r\nfrom fighting, but rather that he was going to a dance, or had done\r\ndancing and was sitting down."\r\nWith these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she\r\nmarked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and\r\nsparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said, "Goddess, why do you\r\nthus beguile me? Are you going to send me afield still further to some\r\nman whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has\r\njust vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with\r\nhim. You are come here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus\r\nyourself; henceforth be goddess no longer; never let your feet carry\r\nyou back to Olympus; worry about him and look after him till he make\r\nyou his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave- but me? I shall\r\nnot go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word among\r\nall the women of Troy. Besides, I have trouble on my mind."\r\nVenus was very angry, and said, "Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if\r\nyou do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I\r\nhave loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and\r\nAchaeans, and you shall come to a bad end."\r\nAt this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and\r\nwent in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan\r\nwomen.\r\nWhen they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set\r\nabout their work, but Helen went into her own room, and the\r\nlaughter-loving goddess took a seat and set it for her facing\r\nAlexandrus. On this Helen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down,\r\nand with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband.\r\n"So you are come from the fight," said she; "would that you had\r\nfallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You\r\nused to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than\r\nMenelaus. go, but I then, an challenge him again- but I should\r\nadvise you not to do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him\r\nin single combat, you will soon all by his spear."\r\nAnd Paris answered, "Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches.\r\nThis time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me;\r\nanother time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will\r\nstand by me. Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Never\r\nyet was I so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment- not even\r\nwhen I first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you-\r\nnot even when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in the\r\nisland of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now." On this\r\nhe led her towards the bed, and his wife went with him.\r\nThus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus\r\nstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no\r\nman, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they\r\nhad seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them\r\nhated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men,\r\nspoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The\r\nvictory has been with Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all her\r\nwealth, and pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony\r\namong them that shall be born hereafter."\r\nThus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     BOOK IV\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Now the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor\r\nwhile Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as\r\nthey pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon\r\nthe town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno,\r\ntalking at her so as to provoke her. "Menelaus," said he, "has two\r\ngood friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of\r\nAlalcomene, but they only sit still and look on, while Venus keeps\r\never by Alexandrus\' side to defend him in any danger; indeed she has\r\njust rescued him when he made sure that it was all over with him-\r\nfor the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We must consider what we\r\nshall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make peace\r\nbetween them? If you will agree to this last Menelaus can take back\r\nHelen and the city of Priam may remain still inhabited."\r\nMinerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by\r\nside hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father,\r\nfor she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but\r\nJuno could not contain herself. "Dread son of Saturn," said she,\r\n"what, pray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go\r\nfor nothing, and the sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of my\r\nhorses, while getting the people together against Priam and his\r\nchildren? Do as you will, but we other gods shall not all of us\r\napprove your counsel."\r\nJove was angry and answered, "My dear, what harm have Priam and\r\nhis sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of\r\nIlius? Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat\r\nPriam raw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it\r\nyour own way then; for I would not have this matter become a bone of\r\ncontention between us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart,\r\nif ever I want to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, you\r\nmust not try to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I am\r\ngiving in to you sorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities under\r\nthe sun and stars of heaven, there was none that I so much respected\r\nas Ilius with Priam and his whole people. Equitable feasts were\r\nnever wanting about my altar, nor the savour of burning fat, which\r\nis honour due to ourselves."\r\n"My own three favourite cities," answered Juno, "are Argos,\r\nSparta, and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased with\r\nthem. I shall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and\r\ntried to stay you, I should take nothing by it, for you are much\r\nstronger than I am, but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a\r\ngod and of the same race with yourself. I am Saturn\'s eldest daughter,\r\nand am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I am\r\nyour wife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then,\r\nof give-and-take between us, and the rest of the gods will follow\r\nour lead. Tell Minerva to go and take part in the fight at once, and\r\nlet her contrive that the Trojans shall be the first to break their\r\noaths and set upon the Achaeans."\r\nThe sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva,\r\n"Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that the\r\nTrojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the\r\nAchaeans."\r\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted\r\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as\r\nsome brilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a\r\nsign to mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of light\r\nfollows in its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe\r\nas they beheld, and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, "Either\r\nwe shall again have war and din of combat, or Jove the lord of\r\nbattle will now make peace between us."\r\nThus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus,\r\nson of Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find\r\nPandarus, the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing\r\namong the stalwart heroes who had followed him from the banks of the\r\nAesopus, so she went close up to him and said, "Brave son of Lycaon,\r\nwill you do as I tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you\r\nwill win honour and thanks from all the Trojans, and especially from\r\nprince Alexandrus- he would be the first to requite you very\r\nhandsomely if he could see Menelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain by\r\nan arrow from your hand. Take your home aim then, and pray to Lycian\r\nApollo, the famous archer; vow that when you get home to your strong\r\ncity of Zelea you will offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his\r\nhonour."\r\nHis fool\'s heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case.\r\nThis bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed as\r\nit was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen as\r\nthe arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms long,\r\nand a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them well\r\ndown, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung his bow\r\nhe laid it carefully on the ground, and his brave followers held their\r\nshields before him lest the Achaeans should set upon him before he had\r\nshot Menelaus. Then he opened the lid of his quiver and took out a\r\nwinged arrow that had yet been shot, fraught with the pangs of\r\ndeath. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo,\r\nthe famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong city\r\nof Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.\r\nHe laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drew\r\nboth notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near the\r\nbow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, and\r\nthe bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly on\r\nover the heads of the throng.\r\nBut the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove\'s\r\ndaughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee\r\nand ward off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a\r\nmother whisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly;\r\nshe guided it to the part where the golden buckles of the belt that\r\npassed over his double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck\r\nthe belt that went tightly round him. It went right through this and\r\nthrough the cuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the belt\r\nbeneath it, which he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows;\r\nit was this that served him in the best stead, nevertheless the\r\narrow went through it and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood\r\nbegan flowing from the wound.\r\nAs when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a\r\npiece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to\r\nbe laid up in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it,\r\nbut the king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver\r\nmay be proud- even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your\r\nlegs down to your fair ancles stained with blood.\r\nWhen King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was\r\nafraid, and so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs\r\nof the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft\r\nwere still outside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved\r\na deep sigh as he held Menelaus\'s hand in his own, and his comrades\r\nmade moan in concert. "Dear brother, "he cried, "I have been the death\r\nof you in pledging this covenant and letting you come forward as our\r\nchampion. The Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have wounded\r\nyou; nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings\r\nand the right hands of fellowship in which have put our trust shall\r\nnot be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now,\r\nhe. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their\r\nlives and with their wives and children. The day will surely come when\r\nmighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam\'s people, when\r\nthe son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them with\r\nhis awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This shall\r\nsurely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot now\r\nto die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans will\r\nat once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of\r\nstill keeping Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie here\r\nat Troy with your purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart\r\nTrojan leap upon your tomb and say, \'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak his\r\nvengeance; he brought his army in vain; he is gone home to his own\r\nland with empty ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.\' Thus will\r\none of them say, and may the earth then swallow me."\r\nBut Menelaus reassured him and said, "Take heart, and do not alarm\r\nthe people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer\r\nbelt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass and\r\nthe belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me."\r\nAnd Agamemnon answered, "I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be even\r\nso, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it\r\nto relieve your pain."\r\nHe then said to Talthybius, "Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the\r\ngreat physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately.\r\nSome Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our\r\ndismay, and to his own great glory."\r\nTalthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to\r\nfind Machaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors\r\nwho had followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and\r\nsaid, "Son of Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and see\r\nMenelaus immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him\r\nwith an arrow to our dismay and to his own great glory."\r\nThus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed\r\nthrough the spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they\r\ncame to the place where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with\r\nthe chieftains gathered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the\r\nmiddle of the ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bending\r\nits barbs back through the force with which he pulled it out. He undid\r\nthe burnished belt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt of\r\nmail which the bronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the\r\nwound, he wiped away the blood and applied some soothing drugs which\r\nChiron had given to Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him.\r\nWhile they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward\r\nagainst them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed the\r\nfight.\r\nYou would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and\r\nunwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot\r\nrich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of\r\nPtolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness\r\nagainst the time his limbs should weary of going about and giving\r\norders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw\r\nmen hasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on.\r\n"Argives," said he, "slacken not one whit in your onset; father Jove\r\nwill be no helper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to break\r\ntheir oaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of\r\nvultures; we shall take their city and carry off their wives and\r\nchildren in our ships."\r\nBut he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined to\r\nfight. "Argives," he cried, "cowardly miserable creatures, have you no\r\nshame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longer\r\nscud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight? You are as\r\ndazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans reach\r\nthe sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whether\r\nthe son of Saturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?"\r\nThus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing\r\nthrough the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round\r\nIdomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while\r\nMeriones was bringing up the battalions that were in the rear.\r\nAgamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke him fairly. "Idomeneus,"\r\nsaid he, "I treat you with greater distinction than I do any others of\r\nthe Achaeans, whether in war or in other things, or at table. When the\r\nprinces are mixing my choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have\r\neach of them a fixed allowance, but your cup is kept always full\r\nlike my own, that you may drink whenever you are minded. Go,\r\ntherefore, into battle, and show yourself the man you have been always\r\nproud to be."\r\nIdomeneus answered, "I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised you\r\nfrom the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we may\r\njoin battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their\r\ncovenants. Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have\r\nbeen the first to break their oaths and to attack us."\r\nThe son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the\r\ntwo Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when a\r\ngoat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over the deep\r\nbefore the west wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mighty\r\nwhirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock\r\ninto a cave- even thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark\r\nmass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. Glad\r\nwas King Agamemnon when he saw them. "No need," he cried, "to give\r\norders to such leaders of the Argives as you are, for of your own\r\nselves you spur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, by\r\nfather Jove, Minerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are,\r\nfor the city of Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we\r\nshould sack it."\r\nWith this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker\r\nof the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in\r\ncompany with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd\r\nof his people. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses in\r\nthe front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom he\r\ncould trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle,\r\nthat they might fight whether they would or no. He gave his orders\r\nto the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand,\r\nso as to avoid confusion. "Let no man," he said, "relying on his\r\nstrength or horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with\r\nthe Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your\r\nattack; but let each when he meets an enemy\'s chariot throw his\r\nspear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men of\r\nold took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they minded."\r\nThus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight,\r\nand King Agamemnon was glad. "I wish," he said to him, that your limbs\r\nwere as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age,\r\nthe common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that it\r\nhad fallen upon some other, and that you were still young."\r\nAnd Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, "Son of Atreus, I too\r\nwould gladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but\r\nthe gods will not give us everything at one and the same time. I was\r\nthen young, and now I am old; still I can go with my knights and\r\ngive them that counsel which old men have a right to give. The\r\nwielding of the spear I leave to those who are younger and stronger\r\nthan myself."\r\nAgamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,\r\nson of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the\r\nAthenians loud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning\r\nUlysses, with his sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not yet\r\nheard the battle-cry, for the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only\r\njust begun to move, so they were standing still, waiting for some\r\nother columns of the Achaeans to attack the Trojans and begin the\r\nfighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked them and said, "Son of\r\nPeteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart of guile, why stand\r\nyou here cowering and waiting on others? You two should be of all\r\nmen foremost when there is hard fighting to be done, for you are\r\never foremost to accept my invitation when we councillors of the\r\nAchaeans are holding feast. You are glad enough then to take your fill\r\nof roast meats and to drink wine as long as you please, whereas now\r\nyou would not care though you saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the\r\nenemy in front of you."\r\nUlysses glared at him and answered, "Son of Atreus, what are you\r\ntalking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans\r\nare in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do\r\nso, that the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost\r\nof them. You are talking idly."\r\nWhen Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly at\r\nhim and withdrew his words. "Ulysses," said he, "noble son of Laertes,\r\nexcellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders\r\nto give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are of\r\na mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and if\r\nany ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing."\r\nHe then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son of\r\nTydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with\r\nSthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to\r\nupbraid him. "Son of Tydeus," he said, "why stand you cowering here\r\nupon the brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever\r\nahead of his men when leading them on against the foe- so, at least,\r\nsay they that saw him in battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself.\r\nThey say that there was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae,\r\nnot as an enemy but as a guest, in company with Polynices to recruit\r\nhis forces, for they were levying war against the strong city of\r\nThebes, and prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them.\r\nThe men of Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Jove\r\ndissuaded them by showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus,\r\ntherefore, and Polynices went their way. When they had got as far\r\nthe deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans\r\nsent Tydeus as their envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered in\r\ngreat numbers to a banquet in the house of Eteocles. Stranger though\r\nhe was, he knew no fear on finding himself single-handed among so\r\nmany, but challenged them to contests of all kinds, and in each one of\r\nthem was at once victorious, so mightily did Minerva help him. The\r\nCadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty youths\r\nwith two captains- the godlike hero Maeon, son of Haemon, and\r\nPolyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head, to lie in wait for\r\nhim on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them, save\r\nonly Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven\'s omens. Such was\r\nTydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he cannot fight\r\nas his father did."\r\nDiomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;\r\nbut the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, "Son of Atreus,\r\ntell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast\r\nourselves as even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated\r\nThebes, though the wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number,\r\nfor we trusted in the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove,\r\nwhereas they perished through their own sheer folly; hold not, then,\r\nour fathers in like honour with us."\r\nDiomed looked sternly at him and said, "Hold your peace, my\r\nfriend, as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the\r\nAchaeans forward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, and\r\nhis the shame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us acquit\r\nourselves with valour."\r\nAs he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so\r\nfiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have been\r\nscared to hear it.\r\nAs when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west\r\nwind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and now\r\ncomes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high\r\nover the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions-\r\neven so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly\r\nto battle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but the\r\nmen said never a word; no man would think it, for huge as the host\r\nwas, it seemed as though there was not a tongue among them, so\r\nsilent were they in their obedience; and as they marched the armour\r\nabout their bodies glistened in the sun. But the clamour of the Trojan\r\nranks was as that of many thousand ewes that stand waiting to be\r\nmilked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly in\r\nanswer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not one speech nor\r\nlanguage, but their tongues were diverse, and they came from many\r\ndifferent places. These were inspired of Mars, but the others by\r\nMinerva- and with them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never\r\ntires, sister and friend of murderous Mars, who, from being at first\r\nbut low in stature, grows till she uprears her head to heaven,\r\nthough her feet are still on earth. She it was that went about among\r\nthem and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow with even hand\r\nbetween them.\r\nWhen they were got together in one place shield clashed with\r\nshield and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed\r\nshields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great\r\nmultitude- death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and\r\nthe earth ran red with blood. As torrents swollen with rain course\r\nmadly down their deep channels till the angry floods meet in some\r\ngorge, and the shepherd the hillside hears their roaring from afar-\r\neven such was the toil and uproar of the hosts as they joined in\r\nbattle.\r\nFirst Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,\r\nson of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the\r\nprojecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the\r\npoint of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes;\r\nheadlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he\r\ndropped King Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proud\r\nAbantes began dragging him out of reach of the darts that were falling\r\naround him, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose was\r\nnot for long; Agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him in\r\nthe side with his bronze-shod spear- for as he stooped his side was\r\nleft unprotected by his shield- and thus he perished. Then the fight\r\nbetween Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew\r\nupon each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.\r\nForthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius,\r\nson of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois,\r\nas she was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her\r\nparents to see their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he\r\ndid not live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off\r\nuntimely by the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast\r\nby the right nipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters;\r\nthe spear went right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar\r\nthat has grown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top\r\nis thick with branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots\r\nthat he may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and\r\nit lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to\r\nearth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleaming\r\ncorslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowd\r\nand missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, in\r\nthe groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over to the other\r\nside; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. Ulysses\r\nwas furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armour\r\nthrough the front ranks till he was quite close; then he glared\r\nround about him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did\r\nso. His dart was not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastard\r\nson of Priam, who had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge\r\nof his father\'s mares. Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his\r\ncomrade, hit him with his spear on one temple, and the bronze point\r\ncame through on the other side of his forehead. Thereon darkness\r\nveiled his eyes, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell\r\nheavily to the ground. Hector, and they that were in front, then\r\ngave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off the dead,\r\npressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down from\r\nPergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased.\r\n"Trojans," he cried, "rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves be\r\nthus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron that\r\nwhen hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of\r\nlovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at the\r\nships."\r\nThus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while\r\nJove\'s redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the host\r\nof the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them\r\nslackening.\r\nThen fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck\r\nby a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled it\r\nwas Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come\r\nfrom Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the\r\npitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his death\r\nthroes stretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous,\r\nwho had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into his\r\nbelly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and\r\ndarkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of Aetolia\r\nstruck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in\r\nhis lungs. Thoas came close up to him, pulled the spear out of his\r\nchest, and then drawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the\r\nbelly so that he died; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his\r\nThracian comrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of\r\ntheir heads, stood round the body and kept him off with their long\r\nspears for all his great stature and valour; so he was driven back.\r\nThus the two corpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, the\r\none captain of the Thracians and the other of the Epeans; and many\r\nanother fell round them.\r\nAnd now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could\r\nhave gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva\r\nleading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears\r\nand arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched\r\nside by side face downwards upon the earth.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     BOOK V\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Then Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of\r\nTydeus, that he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself\r\nwith glory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet\r\nlike the star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in\r\nthe waters of Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his head\r\nand shoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of\r\nthe fight.\r\nNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,\r\npriest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and\r\nIdaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came\r\nforward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being\r\non foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up\r\nto one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over\r\nDiomed\'s left shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his\r\nspear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the\r\nnipple, and he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to\r\nbestride his brother\'s body, but sprang from the chariot and took to\r\nflight, or he would have shared his brother\'s fate; whereon Vulcan\r\nsaved him by wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old\r\nfather might not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of\r\nTydeus drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take them\r\nto the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of\r\nDares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his\r\nchariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by the hand and said, "Mars,\r\nMars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, may we not now\r\nleave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out, and see to which of\r\nthe two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go away, and thus\r\navoid his anger."\r\nSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon\r\nthe steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the\r\nTrojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First\r\nKing Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his\r\nchariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,\r\njust as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the\r\nshoulders and went right through his chest, and his armour rang\r\nrattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\r\nThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had\r\ncome from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as\r\nhe was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded\r\nhim as he fell heavily from the car.\r\nThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while\r\nMenelaus, son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a\r\nmighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had\r\ntaught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred in\r\nmountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in archery could\r\nnow save him, for the spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he\r\nwas flying; it struck him between the shoulders and went right through\r\nhis chest, so that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling round\r\nhim.\r\nMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of\r\nHermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning\r\nworkmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that\r\nmade the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all\r\nmischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus\r\nhimself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook\r\nhim as he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The point\r\nof the spear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came\r\nupon him as he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.\r\nMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was\r\na bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children,\r\nfor the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up\r\nto him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under\r\nhis tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell\r\ndead in the dust.\r\nAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble\r\nDolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was\r\nhonoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave\r\nhim chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon\r\nthe arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand\r\nfell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can\r\nwithstand, came over his eyes.\r\nThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of\r\nTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or\r\nthe Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has\r\nburst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful\r\nvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven,\r\nbut in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste\r\nthat many a strong man hand has reclaimed- even so were the dense\r\nphalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many\r\nthough they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.\r\nNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving\r\nthe Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the\r\nfront part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right\r\nthrough the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was\r\ncovered with blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph,\r\n"Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and\r\nhe will not hold out much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me\r\nwhen I sped from Lycia hither."\r\nThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew\r\nand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.\r\n"Dear son of Capaneus," said he, "come down from your chariot, and\r\ndraw the arrow out of my shoulder."\r\nSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the\r\nwound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had\r\nbeen made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, "Hear me, daughter\r\nof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well\r\nand stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant\r\nme to come within a spear\'s throw of that man and kill him. He has\r\nbeen too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting\r\nthat I shall not see the light of the sun much longer."\r\nThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs\r\nsupple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to\r\nhim and said, "Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for\r\nI have set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus.\r\nMoreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods\r\nand men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you\r\nbattle, do not fight him; but should Jove\'s daughter Venus come,\r\nstrike her with your spear and wound her."\r\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus\r\nagain took his place among the foremost fighters, three times more\r\nfierce even than he had been before. He was like a lion that some\r\nmountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over\r\nthe wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has\r\nroused the brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes\r\nshelter under cover of the buildings, while the sheep,\r\npanic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one on top of\r\nthe other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. Even\r\nthus did Diomed go furiously about among the Trojans.\r\nHe killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a\r\nthrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with\r\na sword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his\r\nneck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas\r\nand Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never\r\ncame back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made\r\nan end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two\r\nsons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn\r\nout with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But\r\nDiomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly,\r\nfor he nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen\r\ndivided his wealth among themselves.\r\nThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as\r\nthey were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens\r\non the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a\r\ncoppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them both from their\r\nchariot and stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave\r\ntheir horses to his comrades to take them back to the ships.\r\nWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went\r\nthrough the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find\r\nPandarus. When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said,\r\n"Pandarus, where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and your\r\nrenown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival you nor\r\nis there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands to\r\nJove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so masterfully\r\nabout, and has done such deadly work among the Trojans. He has\r\nkilled many a brave man- unless indeed he is some god who is angry\r\nwith the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and has set his hand\r\nagainst them in his displeasure."\r\nAnd the son of Lycaon answered, "Aeneas, I take him for none other\r\nthan the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his\r\nhelmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if\r\nhe is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without\r\nheaven\'s help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud\r\nof darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have\r\ntaken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow\r\nwent through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I\r\nshould send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I\r\nhave not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me.\r\nMoreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father\'s stables\r\nthere are eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite\r\nnew, with cloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a\r\npair of horses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me\r\nagain and again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to\r\ntake chariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in\r\nbattle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been much\r\nbetter if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which\r\nhad been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a great\r\ngathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and\r\ncame on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow and arrows. These it\r\nseems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains, the\r\nsons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I\r\nhave only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow\r\ndown from its peg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in\r\nHector\'s service, and if ever I get home again to set eyes on my\r\nnative place, my wife, and the greatness of my house, may some one cut\r\nmy head off then and there if I do not break the bow and set it on a\r\nhot fire- such pranks as it plays me."\r\nAeneas answered, "Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go\r\nagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of\r\narms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can\r\nspeed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If\r\nJove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us\r\nsafely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins\r\nwhile I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man\'s\r\nonset while I look after the horses."\r\n"Aeneas." replied the son of Lycaon, "take the reins and drive; if\r\nwe have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better\r\nfor their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they\r\nexpect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the\r\nfight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the\r\nhorses. Therefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with\r\nmy spear."\r\nThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son\r\nof Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to\r\nDiomed, "Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two\r\nheroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a\r\nskilful archer, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose\r\nsire is Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let\r\nus retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may\r\nget killed."\r\nDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: "Talk not of flight,\r\nfor I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither\r\nflight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to\r\nmount, but will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me\r\nbe afraid of no man, and even though one of them escape, their\r\nsteeds shall not take both back again. I say further, and lay my\r\nsaying to your heart- if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of\r\nkilling both, stay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rim\r\nof the chariot; then be sure you spring Aeneas\' horses and drive\r\nthem from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. They are of the stock\r\nthat great Jove gave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede, and\r\nare the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stole\r\nthe blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon\'s knowledge,\r\nand they bore him six foals. Four are still in his stables, but he\r\ngave the other two to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we can\r\ntake them."\r\nThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to\r\nthem, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. "Great and mighty son,"\r\nsaid he, "of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will\r\nnow try with my spear."\r\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck\r\nthe shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and\r\npassed on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon\r\nshouted out and said, "You are hit clean through the belly; you will\r\nnot stand out for long, and the glory of the fight is mine."\r\nBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, "You have missed, not hit,\r\nand before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you\r\nshall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood."\r\nWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to\r\nPandarus\'s nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white\r\nteeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his to tongue,\r\ncoming out under his chin, and his glistening armour rang rattling\r\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses started aside\r\nfor fear, and he was reft of life and strength.\r\nAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear,\r\nfearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as\r\na lion in the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him\r\nand a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should\r\ndare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge\r\nand great that as men now are it would take two to lift it;\r\nnevertheless he bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with this he\r\nstruck Aeneas on the groin where the hip turns in the joint that is\r\ncalled the "cup-bone." The stone crushed this joint, and broke both\r\nthe sinews, while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh. The hero\r\nfell on his knees, and propped himself with his hand resting on the\r\nground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And now\r\nAeneas, king of men, would have perished then and there, had not his\r\nmother, Jove\'s daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchises\r\nwhen he was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two\r\nwhite arms about the body of her dear son. She protected him by\r\ncovering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some Danaan\r\nshould drive a spear into his breast and kill him.\r\nThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the\r\nson of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had\r\ngiven him. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly,\r\nby binding the reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon\r\nAeneas\'s horses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks.\r\nWhen he had so done he gave them over to his chosen comrade\r\nDeipylus, whom he valued above all others as the one who was most\r\nlike-minded with himself, to take them on to the ships. He then\r\nremounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and drove with all\r\nspeed in search of the son of Tydeus.\r\nNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear\r\nin hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses\r\nthat can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster\r\nof cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he\r\nflew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate\r\nhand. The point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had\r\nwoven for her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm\r\nof her hand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the\r\nveins of the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods\r\ndo not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as\r\nours, and are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall,\r\nbut Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of\r\ndarkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and\r\nkill him; and Diomed shouted out as he left her, "Daughter of Jove,\r\nleave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling\r\nsilly women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will make\r\nyou shudder at the very name of war."\r\nThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as\r\nthe wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all\r\nbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,\r\nwith his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon\r\nshe fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her\r\nhave his horses. "Dear brother," she cried, "save me, and give me your\r\nhorses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly\r\nwounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even\r\nwith father Jove."\r\nThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She\r\nmounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her\r\nand took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew\r\nforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where\r\nthe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them\r\nfrom the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus\r\nflung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms\r\nabout her and caressed her, saying, "Which of the heavenly beings\r\nhas been treating you in this way, as though you had been doing\r\nsomething wrong in the face of day?"\r\nAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, "Proud Diomed, the son of\r\nTydeus, wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I\r\nlove best of all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one\r\nbetween Trojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to\r\nfighting with the immortals."\r\n"Bear it, my child," replied Dione, "and make the best of it. We\r\ndwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men,\r\nand we lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus\r\nand Ephialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that\r\nhe lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would\r\nhave then perished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of\r\nAloeus, told Mercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh\r\nworn out by the severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when\r\nthe mighty son of Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a\r\nthree-barbed arrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also,\r\ndid huge Hades, when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit\r\nhim with an arrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly.\r\nThereon Hades went to the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and\r\nfull of pain; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great\r\nanguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading soothing herbs on the\r\nwound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring, head-strong,\r\nevildoer who recked not of his sin in shooting the gods that dwell\r\nin Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus on against\r\nyourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no man who fights\r\nwith gods will live long or hear his children prattling about his\r\nknees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus see\r\nthat he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than you\r\nare. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus,\r\nrouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded\r\nlord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans."\r\nSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with\r\nboth hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But\r\nMinerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with\r\ntheir mocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak. "Father Jove,"\r\nsaid she, "do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must\r\nhave been persuading some one of the Achaean women to go with the\r\nTrojans of whom she is so very fond, and while caressing one or\r\nother of them she must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pin\r\nof the woman\'s brooch."\r\nThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his\r\nside. "My child," said he, "it has not been given you to be a warrior.\r\nAttend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and\r\nleave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva."\r\nThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he\r\nknew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear\r\nthe mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of\r\nhis armour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay\r\nhim, and thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he\r\nwas coming on for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo\r\nshouted to him with an awful voice and said, "Take heed, son of\r\nTydeus, and draw off; think not to match yourself against gods, for\r\nmen that walk the earth cannot hold their own with the immortals."\r\nThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the\r\nanger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set\r\nhim in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the\r\nmighty sanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to\r\nbehold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the\r\nlikeness of Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and\r\nAchaeans hacked at the bucklers about one another\'s breasts, hewing\r\neach other\'s round shields and light hide-covered targets. Then\r\nPhoebus Apollo said to Mars, "Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained\r\nstormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus,\r\nwho would now fight even with father Jove, and draw him out of the\r\nbattle? He first went up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand\r\nnear her wrist, and afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a\r\ngod."\r\nHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars\r\nwent about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the\r\nlikeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. "Sons of Priam," said\r\nhe, "how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the\r\nAchaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas\r\nthe son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as\r\nHector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from the\r\nstress of the fight."\r\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then\r\nSarpedon rebuked Hector very sternly. "Hector," said he, "where is\r\nyour prowess now? You used to say that though you had neither people\r\nnor allies you could hold the town alone with your brothers and\r\nbrothers-in-law. I see not one of them here; they cower as hounds\r\nbefore a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear the brunt of the\r\nbattle. I have come from afar, even from Lycia and the banks of the\r\nriver Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my infant son, and much\r\nwealth to tempt whoever is needy; nevertheless, I head my Lycian\r\nsoldiers and stand my ground against any who would fight me though I\r\nhave nothing here for the Achaeans to plunder, while you look on,\r\nwithout even bidding your men stand firm in defence of their wives.\r\nSee that you fall not into the hands of your foes as men caught in the\r\nmeshes of a net, and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep this\r\nbefore your mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your\r\nallies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away their\r\nreproaches from you."\r\nSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang\r\nfrom his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among\r\nthe host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and\r\nraising the terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again\r\nfaced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were\r\nnot driven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon some\r\ngoodly threshing-floor, when men are winnowing- while yellow Ceres\r\nblows with the wind to sift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff-\r\nheaps grow whiter and whiter- even so did the Achaeans whiten in the\r\ndust which the horses\' hoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, as\r\ntheir drivers turned them back to battle, and they bore down with\r\nmight upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans, covered them\r\nin a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them,\r\ninasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that when he saw Pallas,\r\nMinerva leave the fray he was to put courage into the hearts of the\r\nTrojans- for it was she who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollo\r\nsent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart with\r\nvalour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who were\r\noverjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; but\r\nthey could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy\r\nwith the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in\r\ntheir midst.\r\nThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless\r\nof the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds\r\nwhich the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there\r\nis no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds\r\nwhose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions- even so\r\ndid the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The\r\nson of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. "My friends,"\r\nsaid he, "quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one\r\nanother\'s eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour\r\nmore often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life\r\nnor name."\r\nAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the\r\nfront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the\r\nTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever\r\nquick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon\r\nstruck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed\r\nit not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly,\r\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the\r\nground.\r\nThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and\r\nOrsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city\r\nof Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad\r\nstream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat\r\nOrsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to Diocles,\r\nwho in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well\r\nskilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew up, went to\r\nIlius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon\r\nsons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As two lions whom\r\ntheir dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest to\r\nplunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle till they get killed\r\nby the hand of man, so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and fell\r\nlike high pine-trees to the ground.\r\nBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the\r\nfront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars\r\negged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by\r\nAeneas; but Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward,\r\nfearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring all their\r\nlabour to nothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting\r\ntheir hands and spears against one another eager to do battle,\r\nAntilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though\r\nhe was, drew back on seeing the two heroes side by side in front of\r\nhim, so they drew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of\r\nthe Achaeans and committed the two poor fellows into the hands of\r\ntheir comrades. They then turned back and fought in the front ranks.\r\nThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian\r\nwarriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on\r\nhis chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the\r\nson of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with\r\na stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell\r\nfrom his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck\r\nhim on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the\r\nchariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and\r\nshoulders buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soil\r\ntill his horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as\r\nAntilochus lashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry\r\nrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.\r\nMars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil\r\nof battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now\r\nin front of Hector and now behind him.\r\nDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide\r\nplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river\r\nrolling swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts back\r\nin fear- even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to\r\nhis men, "My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear\r\nso well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars\r\nis with him in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore\r\ntowards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not\r\nfight with gods."\r\nAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,\r\nboth in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in\r\nwar. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up\r\nand hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of\r\ngreat wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but\r\nhis lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax\r\nstruck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly,\r\nand he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to\r\nstrip him of his armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him,\r\nmany of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon the\r\nbody and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him\r\nthat he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The\r\nTrojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with\r\ntheir spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant\r\nthough he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.\r\nThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong\r\nhand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both\r\nbrave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and\r\ngrandson of great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke\r\nfirst. "Sarpedon," said he, "councillor of the Lycians, why should you\r\ncome skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you\r\nson of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were of\r\nold his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and\r\nlion-hearted father, who came here for the horses of Laomedon, and\r\nthough he had six ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked the\r\ncity of Ilius and made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward,\r\nand your people are falling from you. For all your strength, and all\r\nyour coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will\r\npass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand."\r\nAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, "Tlepolemus, your\r\nfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon\'s folly in refusing\r\npayment to one who had served him well. He would not give your\r\nfather the horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for\r\nyourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to\r\nmyself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds."\r\nThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw\r\nat the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his\r\nthroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell\r\nupon his eyes. Tlepolemus\'s spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\r\nwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone,\r\nbut his father as yet warded off destruction from him.\r\nHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the\r\nweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in\r\nsuch haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of\r\ndrawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly.\r\nMeanwhile the Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon\r\nUlysses was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld\r\nthem. He doubted whether to pursue the son of Jove, or to make\r\nslaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was not decreed, however,\r\nthat he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore, turned him\r\nagainst the main body of the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor,\r\nChromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have\r\nslain yet more, had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the front\r\nof the fight clad in his suit of mail, filling the Danaans with\r\nterror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him coming, and besought him,\r\nsaying, "Son of Priam, let me not he here to fall into the hands of\r\nthe Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return home to gladden the\r\nhearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die within the walls of\r\nyour city."\r\nHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon\r\nthe Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then bore\r\nSarpedon away and laid him beneath Jove\'s spreading oak tree. Pelagon,\r\nhis friend and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon\r\nfainted and a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself\r\nagain, for the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him\r\nnew life, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he had\r\nfallen.\r\nMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by\r\nMars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that\r\nMars was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still\r\nturned towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be\r\nslain by Mars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes\r\nthe renowned charioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus,\r\nHelenus the son of Oenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who\r\nwas possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with\r\nthe other Boeotians who lived near him, owners of a fertile country.\r\nNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said\r\nto Minerva, "Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the\r\npromise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had\r\nsacked the city of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars rage\r\nthus furiously. Let us go into the fray at once."\r\nMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter of\r\ngreat Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with\r\nall speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on\r\neither side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of\r\ngold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze,\r\nwondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round\r\nthe axle upon either side. The car itself was made with plaited\r\nbands of gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running all\r\nround it. From the body of the car there went a pole of silver, on\r\nto the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands of\r\ngold that were to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put her\r\nsteeds under the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry.\r\nMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with\r\nher own hands, on to her father\'s threshold, and donned the shirt of\r\nJove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis\r\nabout. her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and\r\non it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;\r\nmoreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim and\r\nawful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set\r\nher helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in\r\nfront and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; then\r\nshe stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout\r\nand sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who\r\nhave displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of\r\nheaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates over\r\nwhich the flours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus,\r\neither to open the dense cloud that hides them, or to close it.\r\nThrough these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the\r\nson of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus.\r\nThere Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn,\r\nlord of all. "Father Jove," said she, "are you not angry with Mars for\r\nthese high doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he\r\nhas destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason,\r\nwhile the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and\r\nsetting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I hope,\r\nFather Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and\r\nchase him out of the battle."\r\nAnd Jove answered, "Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more\r\noften than any one else does."\r\nJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew\r\nforward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can\r\nsee when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can\r\nthe loud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When\r\nthey reached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois\r\nand Scamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the\r\nchariot. She hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia\r\nspring up for them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like\r\nturtledoves in their eagerness to help the Argives. When they came\r\nto the part where the bravest and most in number were gathered about\r\nmighty Diomed, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and\r\nendurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of\r\nbrazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men\r\ntogether. "Argives," she cried; "shame on cowardly creatures, brave in\r\nsemblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear was\r\nso deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves outside the\r\nDardanian gates, but now they sally far from the city and fight even\r\nat your ships."\r\nWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva\r\nsprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his\r\nchariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For\r\nthe sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield\r\nirritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up\r\nthe strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the\r\nyoke of his horses and said, "The son of Tydeus is not such another as\r\nhis father. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed\r\nmadly into the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went\r\nall unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I\r\nbade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high\r\nspirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the\r\nCadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so\r\nmightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I\r\nbid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired\r\nout, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that\r\nyou are no true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus."\r\nDiomed answered, "I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing\r\nJove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of\r\nheart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your\r\nown instructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods;\r\nbut if Jove\'s daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound her\r\nwith my spear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other\r\nArgives gather in this place, for I know that Mars is now lording it\r\nin the field."\r\n"Diomed, son of Tydeus," replied Minerva, "man after my own heart,\r\nfear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will\r\nbefriend you. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close\r\ncombat; fear not this raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one\r\nside and then on the other. But now he was holding talk with Juno\r\nand myself, saying he would help the Argives and attack the Trojans;\r\nnevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives."\r\nWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the\r\nchariot on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground,\r\nwhereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side\r\nof Diomed. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the\r\nawful goddess and the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins,\r\nand drove straight at Mars. He was in the act of stripping huge\r\nPeriphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars\r\nwas stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned the helmet of\r\nHades, that he might not see her; when, therefore, he saw Diomed, he\r\nmade straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen. As\r\nsoon as they were at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spear\r\nover the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomed\'s life, but Minerva\r\ncaught the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the\r\nchariot. Diomed then threw, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into\r\nthe pit of Mars\'s stomach where his under-girdle went round him. There\r\nDiomed wounded him, tearing his fair flesh and then drawing his\r\nspear out again. Mars roared as loudly as nine or ten thousand men\r\nin the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans and Trojans were struck with\r\npanic, so terrible was the cry he raised.\r\nAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even\r\nso did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens.\r\nWith all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great\r\npain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the\r\nimmortal blood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously,\r\nsaying, "Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods\r\nare continually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another\'s\r\nhands while helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having\r\nbegotten that mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing\r\noutrage of some kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her\r\nyou neither scold nor punish; you encourage her because the\r\npestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been inciting\r\nproud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went up\r\nto the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he\r\nsprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for it I\r\nmust either have lain there for long enough in torments among the\r\nghastly corpes, or have been eaten alive with spears till I had no\r\nmore strength left in me."\r\nJove looked angrily at him and said, "Do not come whining here,\r\nSir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus,\r\nfor you are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the\r\nintolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can\r\ndo to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight:\r\nstill, I cannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are my\r\nown off-spring, and it was by me that your mother conceived you; if,\r\nhowever, you had been the son of any other god, you are so destructive\r\nthat by this time you should have been lying lower than the Titans."\r\nHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing\r\nherbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As\r\nthe juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment\r\nthough it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars.\r\nThen Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took\r\nhis seat by his father Jove all glorious to behold.\r\nBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put a\r\nstop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house\r\nof Jove.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK VI\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THE fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it\r\nwould, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain as\r\nthey aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streams\r\nof Simois and Xanthus.\r\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke\r\na phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades\r\nby killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians,\r\nbeing both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting\r\npeak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead\r\ninto the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes.\r\nThen Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived in\r\nthe strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had a\r\nhouse by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit\r\nnot one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed\r\nkilled both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his\r\ncharioteer- so the pair passed beneath the earth.\r\nEuryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of\r\nAesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to noble\r\nBucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard.\r\nWhile tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she\r\nconceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and he\r\nstripped the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed\r\nAstyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell\r\nby the spear of Nestor\'s son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men,\r\nkilled Elatus who dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the river\r\nSatnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus slew\r\nMelanthus.\r\nThen Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his\r\nhorses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the\r\nplain, and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the\r\ncity along with the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out,\r\nand fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot;\r\nMenelaus came up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him by\r\nthe knees begging for his life. "Take me alive," he cried, "son of\r\nAtreus, and you shall have a full ransom for me: my father is rich and\r\nhas much treasure of gold, bronze, and wrought iron laid by in his\r\nhouse. From this store he will give you a large ransom should he\r\nhear of my being alive and at the ships of the Achaeans."\r\nThus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to a\r\nsquire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon came\r\nrunning up to him and rebuked him. "My good Menelaus," said he,\r\n"this is no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so\r\nwell at the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of\r\nthem- not even the child unborn and in its mother\'s womb; let not a\r\nman of them be left alive, but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded and\r\nforgotten."\r\nThus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his\r\nwords were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him,\r\nwhereon King Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then\r\nthe son of Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear\r\nfrom the body.\r\nMeanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, "My friends, Danaan\r\nwarriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,\r\nand bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we can;\r\nthe bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them later\r\nat your leisure."\r\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the\r\nTrojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had not\r\nPriam\'s son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas,\r\n"Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the Trojans and\r\nLycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in fight and\r\ncounsel; hold your ground here, and go about among the host to rally\r\nthem in front of the gates, or they will fling themselves into the\r\narms of their wives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you have\r\nput heart into all our companies, we will stand firm here and fight\r\nthe Danaans however hard they press us, for there is nothing else to\r\nbe done. Meanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell our\r\nmother what is happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the\r\ntemple of Minerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open\r\nthe doors of the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva,\r\nlet her lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house- the one\r\nshe sets most store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve\r\nyearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of\r\nthe goddess, if she will take pity on the town, with the wives and\r\nlittle ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling on\r\nthe goodly city of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men\'s\r\nsouls with panic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear\r\neven their great champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be,\r\nas we do this man: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none\r\ncan vie with him in prowess"\r\nHector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot,\r\nand went about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears,\r\nurging the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle.\r\nThereon they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground and\r\nceased their murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of the\r\nimmortals had come down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, so\r\nstrangely had they rallied. And Hector shouted to the Trojans,\r\n"Trojans and allies, be men, my friends, and fight with might and\r\nmain, while I go to Ilius and tell the old men of our council and\r\nour wives to pray to the gods and vow hecatombs in their honour."\r\nWith this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went round\r\nhis shield beat against his neck and his ancles.\r\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into the\r\nopen space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they were\r\nclose up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first to\r\nspeak. "Who, my good sir," said he, "who are you among men? I have\r\nnever seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond all\r\nothers if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face\r\nmy might. If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come down\r\nfrom heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus, son of\r\nDryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the gods. He it\r\nwas that drove the nursing women who were in charge of frenzied\r\nBacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the\r\nground as murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus\r\nhimself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him to\r\nher bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which the\r\nman reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry with\r\nLycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he live\r\nmuch longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. Therefore\r\nI will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that\r\neat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your doom."\r\nAnd the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of my\r\nlineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees.\r\nThose of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring\r\nreturns the forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the\r\ngenerations of mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away.\r\nIf, then, you would learn my descent, it is one that is well known\r\nto many. There is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land of\r\nhorses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest\r\nof all mankind. He was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus,\r\nwho was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most\r\nsurpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and\r\nbeing stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, over\r\nwhich Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted\r\nafter him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; but\r\nBellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told lies\r\nabout him to Proteus. \'Proetus,\' said she, \'kill Bellerophon or die,\r\nfor he would have had converse with me against my will.\' The king\r\nwas angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to\r\nLycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a folded\r\ntablet, and containing much ill against the bearer. He bade\r\nBellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the end that\r\nhe might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia, and the\r\ngods convoyed him safely.\r\n"When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king\r\nreceived him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine\r\nheifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon\r\nthe tenth day, he questioned him and desired to see the letter from\r\nhis son-in-law Proetus. When he had received the wicked letter he\r\nfirst commanded Bellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera,\r\nwho was not a human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of a\r\nlion and the tail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and\r\nshe breathed forth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he\r\nwas guided by signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famed\r\nSolymi, and this, he said, was the hardest of all his battles.\r\nThirdly, he killed the Amazons, women who were the peers of men, and\r\nas he was returning thence the king devised yet another plan for his\r\ndestruction; he picked the bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed\r\nthem in ambuscade, but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophon\r\nkilled every one of them. Then the king knew that he must be the\r\nvaliant offspring of a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave him his\r\ndaughter in marriage, and made him of equal honour in the kingdom with\r\nhimself; and the Lycians gave him a piece of land, the best in all the\r\ncountry, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to have and to hold.\r\n"The king\'s daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander,\r\nHippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with\r\nLaodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon\r\ncame to be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate and\r\ndismayed upon the Alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, and\r\nshunning the path of man. Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his son\r\nIsander while he was fighting the Solymi; his daughter was killed by\r\nDiana of the golden reins, for she was angered with her; but\r\nHippolochus was father to myself, and when he sent me to Troy he urged\r\nme again and again to fight ever among the foremost and outvie my\r\npeers, so as not to shame the blood of my fathers who were the noblest\r\nin Ephyra and in all Lycia. This, then, is the descent I claim."\r\nThus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted\r\nhis spear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. "Then,"\r\nhe said, you are an old friend of my father\'s house. Great Oeneus once\r\nentertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged\r\npresents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon a\r\ndouble cup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do not\r\nremember Tydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child,\r\nwhen the army of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes.\r\nHenceforth, however, I must be your host in middle Argos, and you mine\r\nin Lycia, if I should ever go there; let us avoid one another\'s spears\r\neven during a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans and\r\nallies whom I can kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers them\r\ninto my hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whose\r\nlives you may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour,\r\nthat all present may know of the old ties that subsist between us."\r\nWith these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one\r\nanother\'s hands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn made\r\nGlaucus take leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for\r\nbronze, the worth of a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.\r\nNow when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wives\r\nand daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask after\r\ntheir sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set about\r\npraying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.\r\nPresently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned with\r\ncolonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers- all of\r\nhewn stone- built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept,\r\neach with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the\r\ncourtyard, there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for\r\nPriam\'s daughters, built near one another, where his sons-in-law slept\r\nwith their wives. When Hector got there, his fond mother came up to\r\nhim with Laodice the fairest of her daughters. She took his hand\r\nwithin her own and said, "My son, why have you left the battle to come\r\nhither? Are the Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about the\r\ncity that you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove\r\nfrom the citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine that you may make\r\noffering to Jove and to the other immortals, and may then drink and be\r\nrefreshed. Wine gives a man fresh strength when he is wearied, as\r\nyou now are with fighting on behalf of your kinsmen."\r\nAnd Hector answered, "Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unman\r\nme and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering to\r\nJove with unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and\r\nfilth may not pray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, and\r\ngo with offerings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there,\r\nupon the knees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have\r\nin your house- the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to\r\nsacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad,\r\nin the temple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, with\r\nthe wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus\r\nfrom off the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, and\r\nfills men\'s souls with panic. Go, then, to the temple of Minerva,\r\nwhile I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Would\r\nthat the earth might open her jaws and swallow him, for Jove bred\r\nhim to be the bane of the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam\'s sons.\r\nCould I but see him go down into the house of Hades, my heart would\r\nforget its heaviness."\r\nHis mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who\r\ngathered the matrons throughout the city. She then went down into\r\nher fragrant store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the\r\nwork of Sidonian women, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidon\r\nwhen he sailed the seas upon that voyage during which he carried off\r\nHelen. Hecuba took out the largest robe, and the one that was most\r\nbeautifully enriched with embroidery, as an offering to Minerva: it\r\nglittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. With\r\nthis she went on her way and many matrons with her.\r\nWhen they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter\r\nof Cisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans\r\nhad made her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their hands\r\nto the goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay it\r\nupon the knees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter of\r\ngreat Jove. "Holy Minerva," she cried, "protectress of our city,\r\nmighty goddess, break the spear of Diomed and lay him low before the\r\nScaean gates. Do this, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers that\r\nhave never yet known the goad, in your temple, if you will have pity\r\nupon the town, with the wives and little ones If the Trojans." Thus\r\nshe prayed, but Pallas Minerva granted not her prayer.\r\nWhile they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hector\r\nwent to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him by\r\nthe foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house,\r\nstorehouse, and courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on the\r\nacropolis. Here Hector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in his\r\nhand; the bronze point gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to\r\nthe shaft of the spear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus within\r\nthe house, busied about his armour, his shield and cuirass, and\r\nhandling his curved bow; there, too, sat Argive Helen with her\r\nwomen, setting them their several tasks; and as Hector saw him he\r\nrebuked him with words of scorn. "Sir," said he, "you do ill to\r\nnurse this rancour; the people perish fighting round this our town;\r\nyou would yourself chide one whom you saw shirking his part in the\r\ncombat. Up then, or ere long the city will be in a blaze."\r\nAnd Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just; listen\r\ntherefore, and believe me when I tell you that I am not here so much\r\nthrough rancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire to\r\nindulge my grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, and\r\nI hold it better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait,\r\nthen, while I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shall\r\nbe sure to overtake you."\r\nHector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. "Brother,"\r\nsaid she, "to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind\r\nhad caught me up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had\r\nborne me to some mountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that\r\nshould have swept me away ere this mischief had come about. But, since\r\nthe gods have devised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had been\r\nwife to a better man- to one who could smart under dishonour and men\'s\r\nevil speeches. This fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nor\r\nnever will be, and he will surely reap what he has sown. Still,\r\nbrother, come in and rest upon this seat, for it is you who bear the\r\nbrunt of that toil that has been caused by my hateful self and by\r\nthe sin of Alexandrus- both of whom Jove has doomed to be a theme of\r\nsong among those that shall be born hereafter."\r\nAnd Hector answered, "Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the\r\ngoodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the\r\nTrojans, who miss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge your\r\nhusband, and of his own self also let him make haste to overtake me\r\nbefore I am out of the city. I must go home to see my household, my\r\nwife and my little son, for I know not whether I shall ever again\r\nreturn to them, or whether the gods will cause me to fill by the hands\r\nof the Achaeans."\r\nThen Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did not\r\nfind Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of her\r\nmaids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within, he\r\nstood on the threshold of the women\'s rooms and said, "Women, tell me,\r\nand tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house? Was\r\nit to my sisters, or to my brothers\' wives? or is she at the temple of\r\nMinerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?"\r\nHis good housekeeper answered, "Hector, since you bid me tell you\r\ntruly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers\' wives, nor\r\nyet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiating\r\nthe awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she had\r\nheard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans\r\nwere in great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the\r\nnurse went with her carrying the child."\r\nHector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went\r\ndown the streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gone\r\nthrough the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which he\r\nwould go out on to the plain, his wife came running towards him,\r\nAndromache, daughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under the\r\nwooded slopes of Mt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. His\r\ndaughter had married Hector, and now came to meet him with a nurse who\r\ncarried his little child in her bosom- a mere babe. Hector\'s darling\r\nson, and lovely as a star. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the\r\npeople called him Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chief\r\nguardian of Ilius. Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did\r\nnot speak, and Andromache stood by him weeping and taking his hand\r\nin her own. "Dear husband," said she, "your valour will bring you to\r\ndestruction; think on your infant son, and on my hapless self who\r\nere long shall be your widow- for the Achaeans will set upon you in\r\na body and kill you. It would be better for me, should I lose you,\r\nto lie dead and buried, for I shall have nothing left to comfort me\r\nwhen you are gone, save only sorrow. I have neither father nor\r\nmother now. Achilles slew my father when he sacked Thebe the goodly\r\ncity of the Cilicians. He slew him, but did not for very shame despoil\r\nhim; when he had burned him in his wondrous armour, he raised a barrow\r\nover his ashes and the mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing\r\nJove, planted a grove of elms about his tomb. I had seven brothers\r\nin my father\'s house, but on the same day they all went within the\r\nhouse of Hades. Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep and\r\ncattle. My mother- her who had been queen of all the land under Mt.\r\nPlacus- he brought hither with the spoil, and freed her for a great\r\nsum, but the archer- queen Diana took her in the house of your father.\r\nNay- Hector- you who to me are father, mother, brother, and dear\r\nhusband- have mercy upon me; stay here upon this wall; make not your\r\nchild fatherless, and your wife a widow; as for the host, place them\r\nnear the fig-tree, where the city can be best scaled, and the wall\r\nis weakest. Thrice have the bravest of them come thither and\r\nassailed it, under the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus,\r\nand the brave son of Tydeus, either of their own bidding, or because\r\nsome soothsayer had told them."\r\nAnd Hector answered, "Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but\r\nwith what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I\r\nshirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save to\r\nfight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown alike\r\nfor my father and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely come\r\nwhen mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam\'s people,\r\nbut I grieve for none of these- not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam,\r\nnor for my brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust before\r\ntheir foes- for none of these do I grieve as for yourself when the day\r\nshall come on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob you for ever of\r\nyour freedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you will\r\nhave to ply the loom in Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or to\r\nfetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally\r\nby some cruel task-master; then will one say who sees you weeping,\r\n\'She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans\r\nduring the war before Ilius.\' On this your tears will break forth anew\r\nfor him who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May I\r\nlie dead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear\r\nyour cry as they carry you into bondage."\r\nHe stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and\r\nnestled in his nurse\'s bosom, scared at the sight of his father\'s\r\narmour, and at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his\r\nhelmet. His father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took\r\nthe helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground.\r\nThen he took his darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his\r\narms, praying over him the while to Jove and to all the gods.\r\n"Jove," he cried, "grant that this my child may be even as myself,\r\nchief among the Trojans; let him be not less excellent in strength,\r\nand let him rule Ilius with his might. Then may one say of him as he\r\ncomes from battle, \'The son is far better than the father.\' May he\r\nbring back the blood-stained spoils of him whom he has laid low, and\r\nlet his mother\'s heart be glad.\'"\r\nWith this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who\r\ntook him to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her\r\nhusband watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed\r\nher fondly, saying, "My own wife, do not take these things too\r\nbitterly to heart. No one can hurry me down to Hades before my time,\r\nbut if a man\'s hour is come, be he brave or be he coward, there is\r\nno escape for him when he has once been born. Go, then, within the\r\nhouse, and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your\r\ndistaff, and the ordering of your servants; for war is man\'s matter,\r\nand mine above all others of them that have been born in Ilius."\r\nHe took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back\r\nagain to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towards\r\nhim. When she reached her home she found her maidens within, and\r\nbade them all join in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his own\r\nhouse though he was yet alive, for they deemed that they should\r\nnever see him return safe from battle, and from the furious hands of\r\nthe Achaeans.\r\nParis did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly\r\narmour overlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast as\r\nhis feet could take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and\r\ngallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to\r\nbathe in the fair-flowing river- he holds his head high, and his\r\nmane streams upon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies\r\nlike the wind to the haunts and feeding ground of the mares- even so\r\nwent forth Paris from high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in his\r\narmour, and he laughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way.\r\nForthwith he came upon his brother Hector, who was then turning away\r\nfrom the place where he had held converse with his wife, and he was\r\nhimself the first to speak. "Sir," said he, "I fear that I have kept\r\nyou waiting when you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you\r\nbade me."\r\n"My good brother," answered Hector, you fight bravely, and no man\r\nwith any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But you\r\nare careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear\r\nthe ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have suffered\r\nmuch on your account. Let us be going, and we will make things right\r\nhereafter, should Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of our\r\ndeliverance before ever-living gods of heaven in our own homes, when\r\nwe have chased the Achaeans from Troy."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK VII\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'WITH these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother\r\nAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends a\r\nbreeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have\r\nlaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so\r\nwelcome was the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.\r\nThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he\r\nlived in Ame, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of\r\nPhylomedusa. Hector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead\r\nwith a wound in the neck under the bronze rim of his helmet.\r\nGlaucus, moreover, son of Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard\r\nhand-to-hand fight smote Iphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he\r\nwas springing on to his chariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell\r\nto earth from the car, and there was no life left in him.\r\nWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the\r\nArgives, she darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and\r\nApollo, who was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he\r\nwanted the Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and\r\nKing Apollo son of Jove was first to speak. "What would you have\r\nsaid he, "daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent\r\nyou hither from Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and\r\nwould you incline the scales of victory in favour of the Danaans?\r\nLet me persuade you- for it will be better thus- stay the combat for\r\nto-day, but let them renew the fight hereafter till they compass the\r\ndoom of Ilius, since you goddesses have made up your minds to\r\ndestroy the city."\r\nAnd Minerva answered, "So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind\r\nthat I came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me,\r\nthen, how do you propose to end this present fighting?"\r\nApollo, son of Jove, replied, "Let us incite great Hector to\r\nchallenge some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the\r\nAchaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him."\r\nMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of\r\nthe gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, "Hector son of\r\nPriam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then\r\npersuade you. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take\r\ntheir seats, and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you\r\nin single combat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods,\r\nand the hour of your doom is not yet come."\r\nHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the\r\nTrojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and\r\nthey all sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But\r\nMinerva and Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father\r\nJove\'s high oak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close\r\nranged together, bristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when\r\nthe rising west wind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark\r\nbeneath it, so sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the\r\nplain. And Hector spoke thus:-\r\n"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am\r\nminded; Jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to\r\nnothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take\r\nthe towers of Troy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The\r\nprinces of the Achaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him,\r\nthen, that will fight me stand forward as your champion against\r\nHector. Thus I say, and may Jove be witness between us. If your\r\nchampion slay me, let him strip me of my armour and take it to your\r\nships, but let him send my body home that the Trojans and their\r\nwives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead. In like manner, if\r\nApollo vouchsafe me glory and I slay your champion, I will strip him\r\nof his armour and take it to the city of Ilius, where I will hang it\r\nin the temple of Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the\r\nAchaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build him a mound by the\r\nwide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails\r\nhis ship over the sea, \'This is the monument of one who died long\r\nsince a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.\' Thus will one say,\r\nand my fame shall not be lost."\r\nThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline\r\nthe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose\r\nand rebuked them, for he was angry. "Alas," he cried, "vain braggarts,\r\nwomen forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us\r\nif no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned every\r\nman of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious\r\nin your places. I will myself go out against this man, but the\r\nupshot of the fight will be from on high in the hands of the\r\nimmortal gods."\r\nWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your\r\nlife would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for he\r\nwas far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung\r\nupon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right\r\nhand and said, "Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be\r\npatient in spite of passion, do not think of fighting a man so much\r\nstronger than yourself as Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many\r\nanother as well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more doughty than\r\nyou are, shrank from meeting him in battle. Sit down your own\r\npeople, and the Achaeans will send some other champion to fight\r\nHector; fearless and fond of battle though he be, I ween his knees\r\nwill bend gladly under him if he comes out alive from the\r\nhurly-burly of this fight."\r\nWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,\r\nwhereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.\r\nThen Nestor rose and spoke, "Of a truth," said he, "the Achaean land\r\nis fallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and\r\norator among the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to\r\nquestion me concerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How\r\nwould it not grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before\r\nHector? Many a time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul\r\nmight leave his body and go down within the house of Hades. Would,\r\nby father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and\r\nstrong as when the Pylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the\r\nrapid river Celadon under the walls of Pheia, and round about the\r\nwaters of the river Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood\r\nforward as their champion, with the armour of King Areithous upon\r\nhis shoulders- Areithous whom men and women had surnamed \'the\r\nMace-man,\' because he fought neither with bow nor spear, but broke the\r\nbattalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus killed him, not\r\nin fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow way where his mace\r\nserved him in no stead; for Lycurgus was too quick for him and speared\r\nhim through the middle, so he fell to earth on his back. Lycurgus then\r\nspoiled him of the armour which Mars had given him, and bore it in\r\nbattle thenceforward; but when he grew old and stayed at home, he gave\r\nit to his faithful squire Ereuthalion, who in this same armour\r\nchallenged the foremost men among us. The others quaked and quailed,\r\nbut my high spirit bade me fight him though none other would\r\nventure; I was the youngest man of them all; but when I fought him\r\nMinerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the biggest and strongest man\r\nthat ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay sprawling upon\r\nthe earth. Would that I were still young and strong as I then was, for\r\nthe son of Priam would then soon find one who would face him. But you,\r\nforemost among the whole host though you be, have none of you any\r\nstomach for fighting Hector."\r\nThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started\r\nto their feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him\r\nbrave Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men\r\nclothed in valour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and\r\nMeriones his brother in arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon,\r\nThoas the son of Andraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor\r\nknight of Gerene again spoke, saying: "Cast lots among you to see\r\nwho shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight he will have\r\ndone good service alike to his own soul and to the Achaeans."\r\nThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had\r\nthrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people\r\nlifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he\r\nlooked into the vault of heaven, "Father Jove, grant that the lot fall\r\non Ajax, or on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene\r\nhimself."\r\nAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and\r\nfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted- the lot of Ajax.\r\nThe herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the\r\nAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of of them owned it.\r\nWhen, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon\r\nit and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and\r\nthe herald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw him mark he knew it and was\r\nglad; he threw it to the ground and said, "My friends, the lot is\r\nmine, and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my\r\narmour; meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves\r\nthat the Trojans may not hear you- or aloud if you will, for we fear\r\nno man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I\r\nwas born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things."\r\nWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus\r\nwould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, "Father\r\nJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory\r\nto Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector\r\nalso and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and\r\nprowess.\r\nThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming\r\nbronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous\r\nMars when he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with\r\none another- even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring\r\nforward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long\r\nspear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him,\r\nbut the Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector\r\nbeat quickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks\r\nbehind him, for he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his\r\nshield in front of him like a wall- a shield of bronze with seven\r\nfolds of oxhide- the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far\r\nthe best worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of seven\r\nfull-fed bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze.\r\nHolding this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to\r\nHector, and menaced him saying, "Hector, you shall now learn, man to\r\nman, what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides\r\nlion-hearted Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at\r\nthe ships in anger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there\r\nare many of us who are well able to face you; therefore begin the\r\nfight."\r\nAnd Hector answered, "Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the\r\nhost, treat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot\r\nfight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle.\r\nI am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for\r\nthis I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among the\r\nchariots and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight the\r\nheart of Mars; howbeit I would not take such a man as you are off\r\nhis guard- but I will smite you openly if I can."\r\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck\r\nthe sevenfold shield in its outermost layer- the eighth, which was\r\nof bronze- and went through six of the layers but in the seventh\r\nhide it stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round\r\nshield of the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his\r\ngleaming shield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunning\r\nworkmanship; it pierced the shirt against his side, but he swerved and\r\nthus saved his life. They then each of them drew out the spear from\r\nhis shield, and fell on one another like savage lions or wild boars of\r\ngreat strength and endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of\r\nAjax\'s shield, but the bronze did not break, and the point of his dart\r\nwas turned. Ajax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector;\r\nthe spear went through it and staggered him as he was springing\r\nforward to attack; it gashed his neck and the blood came pouring\r\nfrom the wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave\r\nground, and with his brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that\r\nwas lying upon the plain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax on\r\nthe boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang again. But\r\nAjax in turn caught up a far larger stone, swung it aloft, and\r\nhurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of a rock broke\r\nHector\'s shield inwards and threw him down on his back with the shield\r\ncrushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once. Thereon they\r\nwould have hacked at one another in close combat with their swords,\r\nhad not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come forward, one from\r\nthe Trojans and the other from the Achaeans- Talthybius and Idaeus\r\nboth of them honourable men; these parted them with their staves,\r\nand the good herald Idaeus said, "My sons, fight no longer, you are\r\nboth of you valiant, and both are dear to Jove; we know this; but\r\nnight is now falling, and the behests of night may not be well\r\ngainsaid."\r\nAjax son of Telamon answered, "Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was\r\nhe that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will\r\naccept his saying."\r\nThen Hector said, "Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and\r\nstrength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all\r\nothers of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting;\r\nhereafter we will fight anew till heaven decide between us, and give\r\nvictory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and the\r\nbehests of night may not be well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts\r\nof the Achaeans at your ships, and more especially those of your own\r\nfollowers and clansmen, while I, in the great city of King Priam,\r\nbring comfort to the Trojans and their women, who vie with one another\r\nin their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover, exchange presents\r\nthat it may be said among the Achaeans and Trojans, \'They fought\r\nwith might and main, but were reconciled and parted in friendship.\'\r\nOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and\r\nleathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with\r\npurple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans,\r\nand the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their\r\nhero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty\r\nAjax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been\r\nsaved beyond their hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought\r\nAjax elated with victory to Agamemnon.\r\nWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon\r\nsacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son\r\nof Saturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into\r\njoints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting\r\nthem on the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them\r\noff. When they had done all this and had prepared the feast, they\r\nate it, and every man had his full and equal share, so that all were\r\nsatisfied, and King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways\r\ndown the loin, as a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had\r\nenough to cat and drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest\r\nbegan to speak; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he\r\naddressed them thus:-\r\n"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the\r\nAchaeans are now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the\r\nScamander, and their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it\r\nwill be well when morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will\r\nthen wheel our dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far\r\nfrom the ships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our\r\ncomrades home to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will\r\nbuild a barrow that shall be raised from the plain for all in\r\ncommon; near this let us set about building a high wall, to shelter\r\nourselves and our ships, and let it have well-made gates that there\r\nmay be a way through them for our chariots. Close outside we will\r\ndig a deep trench all round it to keep off both horse and foot, that\r\nthe Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us."\r\nThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the\r\nTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis by\r\nthe gates of King Priam\'s palace; and wise Antenor spoke. "Hear me\r\nhe said, "Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as\r\nI am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons of\r\nAtreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn\r\ncovenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say."\r\nHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to\r\nspeak. "Antenor," said he, "your words are not to my liking; you can\r\nfind a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you have\r\nspoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your\r\nreason. I will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that\r\nI will not give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought home\r\nwith her from Argos I will restore, and will add yet further of my\r\nown."\r\nOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race\r\nof Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity\r\nand goodwill addressed them thus: "Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and\r\nallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now\r\nas hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful.\r\nAt daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and\r\nMenelaus sons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this\r\nquarrel has come about; and let him also be instant with them that\r\nthey now cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight\r\nanew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one or to\r\nthe other."\r\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took\r\nsupper in their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his wa to the\r\nships. He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern\r\nof Agamemnon\'s ship, and took his place in the midst of them. "Son\r\nof Atreus," he said, "and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the\r\nother noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of\r\nAlexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you\r\nmay find it acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships\r\nto Troy- would that he had sooner perished- he will restore, and\r\nwill add yet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded\r\nwife of Menelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priam\r\nbade me inquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn our\r\ndead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us\r\nand give victory to one or to the other."\r\nThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud\r\nwar-cry spoke, saying, "Let there be no taking, neither treasure,\r\nnor yet Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans\r\nis at hand."\r\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed\r\nhad spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, "Idaeus, you\r\nhave heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as\r\nconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are\r\nonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jove\r\nthe mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant."\r\nAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods,\r\nand Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and\r\nDardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he\r\ncame, he stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon as\r\nthey heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gather\r\nthe corpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their part\r\nalso hastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and others\r\nto bring in wood.\r\nThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into\r\nthe vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when\r\nthe two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they\r\nwashed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and\r\nlifted them upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to\r\nwail aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the\r\npyre, and having burned them went back to the city of Ilius. The\r\nAchaeans in like manner heaped their dead sadly and silently on the\r\npyre, and having burned them went back to their ships.\r\nNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the\r\nAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was\r\nraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to\r\nshelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that\r\nthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and close\r\noutside it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within\r\nwith stakes.\r\nThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove\r\nthe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune,\r\nlord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, "Father Jove, what mortal in\r\nthe whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you not\r\nhow the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a\r\ntrench all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The The\r\nfame of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no\r\nlonger think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built\r\nwith so much labour for Laomedon."\r\nJove was displeased and answered, "What, O shaker of the earth,\r\nare you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be\r\nalarmed at what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn\r\nitself. Surely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships,\r\nyou can shatter their wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover the\r\nbeach with sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be\r\nutterly effaced."\r\nThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was\r\ncompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their\r\nsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus\r\nthe son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted\r\nthem with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to\r\nthe sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the\r\nAchaeans bought their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some\r\nwith hides, some with whole heifers, and some again with captives.\r\nThey spread a goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, as\r\nalso did the Trojans and their allies in the city. But all the time\r\nJove boded them ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale\r\nfear got hold upon them, and they spilled the wine from their cups\r\non to the ground, nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to\r\nthe most mighty son of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down to\r\nrest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK VIII\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NOW when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse\r\nlight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost\r\ncrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave\r\near. "Hear me," said he, "gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as\r\nI am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross\r\nme, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an\r\nend. If I see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or\r\nDanaans, he shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to\r\nOlympus; or I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the\r\ndeepest pit under the earth, where the gates are iron and the floor\r\nbronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that\r\nyou may learn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find\r\nout for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay\r\nhold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you will,\r\nyou will not drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth;\r\nbut were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and\r\nsea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about some\r\npinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament.\r\nSo far am I above all others either of gods or men."\r\nThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had\r\nspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, "Father, son of\r\nSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be\r\ngainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are\r\nperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so\r\nbid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable\r\nsuggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish in\r\nyour displeasure."\r\nJove smiled at her and answered, "Take heart, my child,\r\nTrito-born; I am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you."\r\nWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and\r\nmanes of glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the\r\nbody, seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon\r\nhe lashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt\r\nearth and starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained Ida,\r\nmother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and\r\nfragrant altar. There the father of gods and men stayed his horses,\r\ntook them from the chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he\r\ntook his seat all glorious upon the topmost crests, looking down\r\nupon the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans.\r\nThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and\r\nafterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise\r\narmed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but\r\nnevertheless eager perforce to do battle for their wives and children.\r\nAll the gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth\r\nwith the tramp as of a great multitude.\r\nWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed with\r\nshield, and spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty\r\nwas the din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another-\r\ndeath- cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth\r\nran red with blood.\r\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their\r\nweapons beat against one another, and the people fell, but when the\r\nsun had reached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden\r\nscales, and put two fates of death within them, one for the Trojans\r\nand the other for the Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and\r\nwhen he lifted it up the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught\r\nscale of the Achaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of\r\nthe Trojans rose heavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and\r\nsent the glare of his lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this,\r\npale fear fell upon them and they were sore afraid.\r\nIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two\r\nAjaxes, servants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene\r\nalone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but\r\none of his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had\r\nhit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins\r\nto grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded in\r\nhis anguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw\r\nothers into confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the\r\ntraces with his sword, but Hector\'s fleet horses bore down upon him\r\nthrough the rout with their bold charioteer, even Hector himself,\r\nand the old man would have perished there and then had not Diomed been\r\nquick to mark, and with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.\r\n"Ulysses," he cried, "noble son of Laertes where are you flying\r\nto, with your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck\r\nwith a spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend\r\nNestor from this man\'s furious onset."\r\nUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the\r\nAchaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the\r\nthick of the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of\r\nNeleus. "Sir," said he, "these young warriors are pressing you hard,\r\nyour force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught,\r\nand your horses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the\r\nhorses of Tros can do- how cleverly they can scud hither and thither\r\nover the plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the\r\nhero Aeneas. Let our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us\r\ndrive mine straight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how\r\nfuriously I too can wield my spear."\r\nNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the\r\ndoughty squires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor\'s\r\nhorses, while the two both mounted Diomed\'s chariot. Nestor took the\r\nreins in his hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up\r\nwith Hector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was\r\ncharging full speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his\r\ncharioteer and squire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breast\r\nby the nipple while the reins were in his hands, so that he died there\r\nand then, and the horses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot.\r\nHector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let\r\nhim lie for all his sorrow, while he went in quest of another\r\ndriver; nor did his steeds have to go long without one, for he\r\npresently found brave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him\r\nget up behind the horses, giving the reins into his hand.\r\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have\r\nbeen penned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men\r\nbeen quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which\r\nfell just in front of Diomed\'s horses with a flare of burning\r\nbrimstone. The horses were frightened and tried to back beneath the\r\ncar, while the reins dropped from Nestor\'s hands. Then he was afraid\r\nand said to Diomed, "Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see\r\nyou not that the hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes\r\nvictory to Hector; to-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant\r\nit to ourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of\r\nJove, for he is far stronger than any."\r\nDiomed answered, "All that you have said is true; there is a grief\r\nhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among\r\nthe Trojans and say, \'The son of Tydeus fled before me to the\r\nships.\' This is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow\r\nme."\r\n"Son of Tydeus," replied Nestor, "what mean you? Though Hector say\r\nthat you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him,\r\nnor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low."\r\nSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,\r\nand with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their\r\ndarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, "Son of Tydeus,\r\nthe Danaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at\r\ntable, the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.\r\nHenceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than\r\na woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale our\r\nwalls through any Hinching upon my part; neither shall you carry off\r\nour wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand."\r\nThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his\r\nhorses round again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice\r\ndid Jove thunder from the heights of. Ida in token to the Trojans that\r\nhe would turn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to\r\nthem and said, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close\r\nfighting, be men, my friends, and fight with might and with main; I\r\nsee that Jove is minded to vouchsafe victory and great glory to\r\nmyself, while he will deal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for\r\nhaving thought of building this weak and worthless wall. It shall\r\nnot stay my fury; my horses will spring lightly over their trench, and\r\nwhen I am BOOK at their ships forget not to bring me fire that I may\r\nburn them, while I slaughter the Argives who will be all dazed and\r\nbewildered by the smoke."\r\nThen he cried to his horses, "Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon\r\nand goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the\r\nhoney-sweet corn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has\r\nfed you, and for she has mixed wine and water for you to drink\r\nwhenever you would, before doing so even for me who am her own\r\nhusband. Haste in pursuit, that we may take the shield of Nestor,\r\nthe fame of which ascends to heaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods\r\nand all, and that we may strip from the shoulders of Diomed. the\r\ncuirass which Vulcan made him. Could we take these two things, the\r\nAchaeans would set sail in their ships this self-same night."\r\nThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she\r\nshook with rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of\r\nNeptune, "What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find\r\nno compassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you\r\nmany a welcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then.\r\nIf all of us who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back\r\nand keep Jove from helping them, he would have to sit there sulking\r\nalone on Ida."\r\nKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, "Juno, rash of\r\ntongue, what are you talking about? We other gods must not set\r\nourselves against Jove, for he is far stronger than we are."\r\nThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch,\r\nfrom the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and\r\nwarriors, who were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that\r\nthe hand of Jove was with him. He would even have set fire to the\r\nships and burned them, had not Queen Juno put it into the mind of\r\nAgamemnon, to bestir himself and to encourage the Achaeans. To this\r\nend he went round the ships and tents carrying a great purple cloak,\r\nand took his stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses\' ship, which\r\nwas middlemost of all; it was from this place that his voice would\r\ncarry farthest, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of\r\nTelamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles- for these two\r\nheroes, well assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn up\r\ntheir ships at the two ends of the line. From this spot then, with a\r\nvoice that could be heard afar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying,\r\n"Argives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only;\r\nwhere are now our vaunts that we should prove victorious- the vaunts\r\nwe made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned\r\ncattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You vowed that you\r\nwould each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred men, and\r\nnow you prove no match even for one- for Hector, who will be ere\r\nlong setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever so ruin a\r\ngreat king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? yet, when to my\r\nsorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altars\r\nwithout offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every one\r\nof them, so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me then\r\nthis prayer- suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and let\r\nnot the Achaeans be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans."\r\nThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him\r\nthat his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle,\r\nmost unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its\r\ntalons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the\r\nAchaeans sacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, the\r\npeople saw that the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely\r\nupon the Trojans and fought more boldly.\r\nThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that\r\nhe had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight\r\nsooner than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he\r\nslew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon.\r\nHe had turned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the\r\nback midway between his shoulders and went right through his chest,\r\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his\r\nchariot.\r\nAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two\r\nAjaxes clothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his\r\ncompanion in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus\r\nthe brave son of Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his\r\nplace under cover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax\r\nlifted his shield Teucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one\r\nin the throng, the man would fall dead; then Teucer would hie back\r\nto Ajax as a child to its mother, and again duck down under his\r\nshield.\r\nWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and\r\nthen Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike\r\nLycophontes, Amopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turn\r\ndid he lay low upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw\r\nhim making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him\r\nand said, "Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain\r\namong the host, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and\r\nthe glory of your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care\r\nof you in his own house when you were a child, bastard though you\r\nwere. Cover him with glory though he is far off; I will promise and\r\nI will assuredly perform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me\r\nto sack the city of Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour\r\nafter my own- a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman\r\nwho shall go up into your bed."\r\nAnd Teucer answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge\r\nme; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never\r\nceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and\r\nkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been\r\nburied in the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit."\r\nAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was\r\nbent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit\r\nPriam\'s brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair\r\nCastianeira, lovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and\r\nnow he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is\r\nweighed down by showers in spring- even thus heavy bowed his head\r\nbeneath the weight of his helmet.\r\nAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again\r\nhis arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector\'s\r\nbrave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he was\r\ndriving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as he\r\nfell headlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him.\r\nHector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for\r\nall his sorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother\r\nCebriones, who was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had\r\nsaid. Hector thereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the\r\nground, and seizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent\r\nkill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had\r\nlaid it upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged\r\nstone as he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder;\r\nhe hit him just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest,\r\na very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his\r\nwrist was less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward\r\non his knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and running\r\ntowards him bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield.\r\nMeanwhile his two trusty squires, Mecisteus son of Echius, and\r\nAlastor, came up and bore him to the ships groaning in his great pain.\r\nglad when he saw\r\nJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the\r\nAchaeans to their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their\r\nhead. As a hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he\r\ngives him chase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did\r\nHector follow close upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as\r\nthey rushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set\r\nstakes and trench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands\r\nof the Trojans, they halted at their ships, calling upon one another\r\nand praying every man instantly as they lifted up their hands to the\r\ngods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes\r\nglaring like those of Gorgo or murderous Mars.\r\nJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to\r\nMinerva, "Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no\r\nmore thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever\r\ndo so? See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of\r\nbut a single man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury,\r\nand has already done great mischief."\r\nMinerva answered, "Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his own\r\nland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is mad\r\nwith spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets\r\nhow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours\r\nEurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to\r\nheaven, and then Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the\r\nsense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of\r\nHades, to fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come\r\nback alive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove\r\nhates me, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his\r\nknees and took hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do\r\nhonour to Achilles. I shall know what to do next time he begins\r\ncalling me his grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go\r\nwithin the house of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we\r\nshall then find out whether Priam\'s son Hector will be glad to meet us\r\nin the highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and\r\nvultures with the fat of their flesh as they he dead by the ships of\r\nthe Achaeans."\r\nThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,\r\nobeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened\r\nsteeds, while Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her\r\nrichly vesture, made with her own hands, on to the threshold of her\r\nfather, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle.\r\nThen she stepped into her flaming chariot, and grasped the spear so\r\nstout and sturdy and strong with which she quells the ranks of\r\nheroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed her horses, and the\r\ngates of heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord-\r\ngates over which the Hours preside, in whose hands are heaven and\r\nOlympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them or to close\r\nit. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.\r\nBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent\r\nwinged Iris with a message to them. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, turn\r\nthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to\r\nfighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is\r\nwhat I mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them\r\nfrom their chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them all\r\nten years to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them;\r\nmy grey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father\r\nmeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say she\r\nalways contradicts me."\r\nWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights\r\nof Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the\r\nouter gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. "What,"\r\nsaid she, "are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids\r\ngoing. This is what he says, and this is he means to do, he will\r\nlame your horses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will\r\nbreak it in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal the\r\nwounds his lightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn,\r\ngrey-eyed goddess, what quarrelling with your father means. He is less\r\nhurt and angry with Juno, for whatever he says she always\r\ncontradicts him but you, bold bold hussy, will you really dare to\r\nraise your huge spear in defiance of Jove?"\r\nWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, "Of a truth,\r\nchild of aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men\'s battles\r\nfurther in defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have\r\nit, and let Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and\r\nDanaans according to his own pleasure."\r\nShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them\r\nfast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the\r\nend wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon\r\ntheir golden thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they\r\nwere very angry.\r\nPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered\r\nthe assembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his\r\nhorses for him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it.\r\nJove then sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath\r\nhim. Minerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke\r\nnor asked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said,\r\n"Minerva and Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing\r\nso many of your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is\r\nthe might of my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you\r\nwere both of you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its\r\nterrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been- I\r\nshould have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would never\r\nhave brought you back again to Olympus."\r\nMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and\r\nbrooded mischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word,\r\nfor she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her\r\nfather; but Juno could not contain herself and said, "What, dread\r\nson of Saturn, are you talking about? We know how great your power is,\r\nnevertheless we have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are\r\nperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so\r\nbid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable\r\nsuggestions to the Argives, that they may not all of them perish in\r\nyour displeasure."\r\nAnd Jove answered, "To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,\r\nyou will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the\r\nArgives, for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused\r\nthe son of Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their\r\nships\' sterns about the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is\r\nhow it is decreed; for aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths\r\nbeneath earth and sea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus\r\nwith neither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go\r\non and on till you get there, and I shall not care one whit for your\r\ndispleasure; you are the greatest vixen living."\r\nJuno made him no answer. The sun\'s glorious orb now sank into\r\nOceanus and drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the\r\nTrojans when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for\r\ndid darkness fall upon the Achaeans.\r\nThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a\r\ncouncil on the open space near the river, where there was a spot ear\r\ncorpses. They left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear\r\nthe speech he made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the\r\nbronze point of which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the\r\nspear-head was of gold Spear in hand he spoke. "Hear me," said he,\r\n"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I should\r\ndestroy the ships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to\r\nIlius, but darkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved\r\nthem and their ships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey\r\nthe behests of night, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of\r\ntheir chariots and give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to\r\nbring sheep and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for\r\nyour horses and gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn\r\nwatchfires whose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try\r\nto fly beyond the sea by night, and they must not embark scatheless\r\nand unmolested; many a man among them must take a dart with him to\r\nnurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is leaping on board his\r\nship, that others may fear to bring war and weeping upon the\r\nTrojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about the city that the\r\ngrowing youths and grey-bearded men are to camp upon its\r\nheaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a great fire in\r\nher house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be entered by\r\nsurprise while the host is outside. See to it, brave Trojans, as I\r\nhave said, and let this suffice for the moment; at daybreak I will\r\ninstruct you further. I pray in hope to Jove and to the gods that we\r\nmay then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for \'tis the\r\nfates that have borne them and their ships hither. This night,\r\ntherefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put on our\r\narmour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then\r\nknow whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back from\r\nthe ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry\r\noff his bloodstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle,\r\nabide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be\r\namong the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him.\r\nWould that I were as sure of being immortal and never growing old, and\r\nof being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this day\r\nwill bring evil to the Argives."\r\nThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took\r\ntheir sweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each\r\nby his own chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the\r\ncity, they brought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered\r\nmuch wood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals,\r\nand the wind carried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven- but\r\nthe blessed gods partook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius\r\nwith Priam and Priam\'s people. Thus high in hope they sat through\r\nthe livelong night by the highways of war, and many a watchfire did\r\nthey kindle. As when the stars shine clear, and the moon is bright-\r\nthere is not a breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor jutting\r\nheadland but it stands out in the ineffable radiance that breaks\r\nfrom the serene of heaven; the stars can all of them be told and the\r\nheart of the shepherd is glad- even thus shone the watchfires of the\r\nTrojans before Ilius midway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A\r\nthousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each\r\nthere sat fifty men, while the horses, champing oats and corn beside\r\ntheir chariots, waited till dawn should come.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK IX\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THUS did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained\r\nRout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were all\r\nof them in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace- the\r\nnorth and the northwest- spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury of\r\nthe main- in a moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scatter\r\ntheir sea-wrack in all directions- even thus troubled were the\r\nhearts of the Achaeans.\r\nThe son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a\r\ncouncil man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste\r\nalso himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their\r\nassembly. Agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract\r\non the side of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he\r\nspoke to the Achaeans. "My friends," said he, "princes and councillors\r\nOf the Argives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me.\r\nCruel Jove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of\r\nTroy before returning, but he has played me false, and is now\r\nbidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people.\r\nSuch is the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust\r\nas he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore,\r\nlet us all do as I say and sail back to our own country, for we\r\nshall not take Troy."\r\nThus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat\r\nsorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed of\r\nthe loud battle-cry made answer saying, "Son of Atreus, I will chide\r\nyour folly, as is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that I\r\nshould do so. In the first place you attacked me before all the\r\nDanaans and said that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives young\r\nand old know that you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowed\r\nyou by halves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but\r\nvalour, which is the highest both right and might he did not give you.\r\nSir, think you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike\r\nand cowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going\r\nhome- go- the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you\r\nfrom Mycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stay\r\nhere till we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should turn\r\nhomeward with their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight on\r\ntill we reach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when we\r\ncame."\r\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,\r\nand presently Nestor rose to speak. "Son of Tydeus," said he, "in\r\nwar your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all\r\nwho are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light of\r\nwhat you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end of\r\nthe whole matter. You are still young- you might be the youngest of my\r\nown children- still you have spoken wisely and have counselled the\r\nchief of the Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I am\r\nolder than you and I will tell you every" thing; therefore let no man,\r\nnot even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments\r\ncivil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw.\r\n"Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,\r\nbut let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that is\r\nwithout the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men;\r\nwhen they have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your\r\norders, for you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for\r\nyour councillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so;\r\nthere is abundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of the\r\nAchaeans bring from Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposal\r\nwherewith to entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When many\r\nare got together, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest-\r\nand sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has\r\nlit his watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other than\r\ndismayed? This night will either be the ruin of our host, or save it."\r\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinels\r\nwent out in their armour under command of Nestor\'s son Thrasymedes,\r\na captain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus and\r\nIalmenus: there were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the son\r\nof Creion, noble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of the\r\nsentinels, and with each there went a hundred youths armed with long\r\nspears: they took their places midway between the trench and the wall,\r\nand when they had done so they lit their fires and got every man his\r\nsupper.\r\nThe son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to\r\nhis quarters prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid their\r\nhands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they\r\nhad enough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was ever\r\ntruest, was the first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, with\r\nall sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus.\r\n"With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\r\nwill I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over much\r\npeople. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and to\r\nuphold righteousness, that you may take thought for your people\r\nunder you; therefore it behooves you above all others both to speak\r\nand to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have been\r\nminded to speak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands,\r\ntherefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of a\r\ntruer mind than that which has been mine from the hour when you,\r\nsir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent against\r\nmy judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your own\r\npride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven itself had honoured- for you\r\nstill hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however, let\r\nus think how we may appease him, both with presents and fair\r\nspeeches that may conciliate him."\r\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you have reproved my folly\r\njustly. I was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himself\r\na host, and Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying\r\nmuch people of the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to\r\nmy worser mind; therefore I will make amends, and will give him\r\ngreat gifts by way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence of\r\nyou all. I will give him seven tripods that have never yet been on the\r\nfire, and ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons\r\nand twelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes.\r\nRich, indeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as\r\nmy horses have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen,\r\nLesbians, whom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos- all of\r\nsurpassing beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom I\r\nerewhile took from him, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great\r\noath that I never went up into her couch, nor have been with her after\r\nthe manner of men and women.\r\n"All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter the\r\ngods vouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we\r\nAchaeans are dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and\r\nbronze to his liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women,\r\nthe loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean\r\nArgos, wealthiest of all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I will\r\nshow him like honour with my own dear son Orestes, who is being\r\nnurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters, Chrysothemis,\r\nLaodice, and lphianassa, let him take the one of his choice, freely\r\nand without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; I will add such\r\ndower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give\r\nhim seven well established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where\r\nthere is grass; holy Pherae and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea\r\nalso, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and on\r\nthe borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in\r\ncattle and sheep; they will honour him with gifts as though he were\r\na god, and be obedient to his comfortable ordinances. All this will\r\nI do if he will now forgo his anger. Let him then yieldit is only\r\nHades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding- and hence he is of all\r\ngods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover I am older and more\r\nroyal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey me."\r\nThen Nestor answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,\r\nAgamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then send\r\nchosen messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus\r\nwithout delay. Let those go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear to\r\nJove, lead the way; let Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heralds\r\nOdius and Eurybates go with them. Now bring water for our hands, and\r\nbid all keep silence while we pray to Jove the son of Saturn, if so be\r\nthat he may have mercy upon us."\r\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants\r\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the\r\nmixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\r\nevery man his drink-offering; then, when they had made their\r\nofferings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set\r\nout from the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, looking\r\nfirst to one and then to another, but most especially at Ulysses,\r\nwas instant with them that they should prevail with the noble son of\r\nPeleus.\r\nThey went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed\r\nearnestly to earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the\r\nson of Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they reached\r\nthe ships and tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on a\r\nlyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver.\r\nIt was part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city\r\nof Eetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing the\r\nfeats of heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite to\r\nhim and said nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. Ulysses\r\nand Ajax now came in- Ulysses leading the way -and stood before him.\r\nAchilles sprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and\r\nPatroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greeted\r\nthem saying, "All hail and welcome- you must come upon some great\r\nmatter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the\r\nAchaeans."\r\nWith this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered\r\nwith purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him, "Son\r\nof Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water with\r\nthe wine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear friends,\r\nwho are now under my roof."\r\nPatroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block\r\nin front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the\r\nloin also of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held the\r\nmeat while Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put them\r\non spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. When\r\nthe flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top\r\nof them, lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-racks; and\r\nhe sprinkled them with salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it on\r\nplatters, and handed bread round the table in fair baskets, while\r\nAchilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat facing\r\nUlysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus\r\noffer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire,\r\nand they laid their hands upon the good things that were before\r\nthem. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made a\r\nsign to Phoenix, and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with\r\nwine and pledged Achilles.\r\n"Hail," said he, "Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer,\r\nneither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been\r\nplenty to eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter.\r\nSir, we are in the face of great disaster, and without your help\r\nknow not whether we shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and\r\ntheir allies have camped hard by our ships and by the wall; they\r\nhave lit watchfires throughout their host and deem that nothing can\r\nnow prevent them from falling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has sent\r\nhis lightnings on their right; Hector, in all his glory, rages like\r\na maniac; confident that Jove is with him he fears neither god nor\r\nman, but is gone raving mad, and prays for the approach of day. He\r\nvows that he will hew the high sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire\r\nto their hulls, and make havoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed\r\nand smothered in smoke; I much fear that heaven will make good his\r\nboasting, and it will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from our\r\nhome in Argos. Up, then, and late though it be, save the sons of the\r\nAchaeans who faint before the fury of the Trojans. You will repent\r\nbitterly hereafter if you do not, for when the harm is done there will\r\nbe no curing it; consider ere it be too late, and save the Danaans\r\nfrom destruction.\r\n"My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to\r\nAgamemnon, did he not charge you saying, \'Son, Minerva and Juno will\r\nmake you strong if they choose, but check your high temper, for the\r\nbetter part is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and the\r\nAchaeans old and young will respect you more for doing so.\' These were\r\nhis words, but you have forgotten them. Even now, however, be\r\nappeased, and put away your anger from you. Agamemnon will make you\r\ngreat amends if you will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you what\r\nhe has said in his tent that he will give you. He will give you\r\nseven tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of\r\ngold; twenty iron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have won\r\nraces and carried off prizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold is\r\nhe who has as many prizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon.\r\nMoreover he will give you seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he\r\nchose for himself, when you took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty.\r\nHe will give you these, and with them her whom he erewhile took from\r\nyou, the daughter of Briseus, and he will swear a great oath, he has\r\nnever gone up into her couch nor been with her after the manner of men\r\nand women. All these things will he give you now down, and if\r\nhereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you can\r\ncome when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load your ship\r\nwith gold and bronze to your liking. You can take twenty Trojan women,\r\nthe loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean\r\nArgos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his son-in-law, and he\r\nwill show you like honour with his own dear son Orestes, who is\r\nbeing nurtured in all abundance. Agamemnon has three daughters,\r\nChrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa; you may take the one of your\r\nchoice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; he\r\nwill add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter,\r\nand will give you seven well-established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and\r\nHire where there is grass; holy Pheras and the rich meadows of Anthea;\r\nAepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and\r\non the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in\r\ncattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as though were a\r\ngod, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All this will\r\nhe do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though you hate both\r\nhim and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the rest of the\r\nAchaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will honour\r\nyou as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. You\r\nmight even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he is\r\ninfatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have brought\r\ncan hold his own against him."\r\nAchilles answered, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give you\r\nformal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no\r\nmore of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do I\r\nhate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hides\r\nanother in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be\r\nappeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the\r\nDanaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting. He\r\nthat fights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are\r\nheld in equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who works\r\nand him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships- with my\r\nlife ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes it\r\nto her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so man a long night\r\nhave I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by day\r\nagainst those who were fighting for their women. With my ships I\r\nhave taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed\r\nwith my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one of\r\nthem, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where he\r\nwas by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept\r\nmuch himself.\r\n"Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the\r\nchieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone of\r\nthe Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted- let him keep\r\nher and sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the\r\nTrojans? What made the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them?\r\nWas it not for the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only\r\nmen in the world who love their wives? Any man of common right feeling\r\nwill love and cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with my\r\nwhole heart, though she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon has\r\ntaken her from me; he has played me false; I know him; let him tempt\r\nme no further, for he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses,\r\nand to the other princes to save his ships from burning. He has done\r\nmuch without me already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep\r\nand wide all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but\r\neven so he stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I\r\nfought the Achaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from\r\nthe city walls; he would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree,\r\nbut no further. Once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape\r\nmy onset: now, however, since I am in no mood to fight him, I will\r\nto-morrow offer sacrifice to Jove and to all the gods; I will draw\r\nmy ships into the water and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning,\r\nif you care to look, you will see my ships on the Hellespont, and my\r\nmen rowing out to sea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes\r\nme a fair passage, in three days I shall be in Phthia. I have much\r\nthere that I left behind me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shall\r\nbring back still further store of gold, of red copper, of fair\r\nwomen, and of iron, my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one\r\nprize, he who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now\r\nbid you, and tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him and\r\nbeware of him should he think that he can yet dupe others for his\r\neffrontery never fails him.\r\n"As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I\r\nwill take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in common\r\nwith him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen\r\nme further; let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of his\r\nreason. I loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw.\r\nHe may offer me ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay-\r\nnot though it be all that he has in the world, both now or ever\r\nshall have; he may promise me the wealth of Orchomenus or of\r\nEgyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world, for\r\nit has a hundred gates through each of which two hundred men may drive\r\nat once with their chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts as the\r\nsands of the sea or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even so he\r\nshall not move me till I have been revenged in full for the bitter\r\nwrong he has done me. I will not marry his daughter; she may be fair\r\nas Venus, and skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: let\r\nanother take her, who may be a good match for her and who rules a\r\nlarger kingdom. If the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will\r\nfind me a wife; there are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia,\r\ndaughters of kings that have cities under them; of these I can take\r\nwhom I will and marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home in\r\nPhthia to woo and wed a woman who would make me a suitable wife, and\r\nto enjoy the riches of my old father Peleus. My life is more to me\r\nthan all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace before the\r\nAchaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on the stone\r\nfloor of Apollo\'s temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheep\r\nare to be had for harrying, and a man buy both tripods and horses if\r\nhe wants them, but when his life has once left him it can neither be\r\nbought nor harried back again.\r\n"My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may\r\nmeet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but my\r\nname will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die, but it\r\nwill be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then, I say,\r\n\'Go home, for you will not take Ilius.\' Jove has held his hand over\r\nher to protect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore, as\r\nin duty bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message that I\r\nhave sent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving of\r\ntheir ships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the one\r\nthat they have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him\r\nsleep here that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will.\r\nBut I will not take him by force."\r\nThey all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he\r\nhad denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his great\r\nfear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said,\r\n"Noble Achilles, if you are now minded to return, and in the\r\nfierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships from\r\nburning, how, my son, can I remain here without you? Your father\r\nPeleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad from\r\nPhthia to Agamemnon. You knew nothing neither of war nor of the arts\r\nwhereby men make their mark in council, and he sent me with you to\r\ntrain you in all excellence of speech and action. Therefore, my son, I\r\nwill not stay here without you- no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe\r\nto strip my years from off me, and make me young as I was when I first\r\nleft Hellas the land of fair women. I was then flying the anger of\r\nfather Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who was furious with me in the\r\nmatter of his concubine, of whom he was enamoured to the wronging of\r\nhis wife my mother. My mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to\r\nlie with the woman myself, that so she hate my father, and in the\r\ncourse of time I yielded. But my father soon came to know, and\r\ncursed me bitterly, calling the dread Erinyes to witness. He prayed\r\nthat no son of mine might ever sit upon knees- and the gods, Jove of\r\nthe world below and awful Proserpine, fulfilled his curse. I took\r\ncounsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me think\r\non men\'s evil tongues and how I should be branded as the murderer of\r\nmy father: nevertheless I could not bear to stay in my father\'s\r\nhouse with him so bitter a against me. My cousins and clansmen came\r\nabout me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many a sheep and many an ox\r\ndid they slaughter, and many a fat hog did they set down to roast\r\nbefore the fire; many a jar, too, did they broach of my father\'s wine.\r\nNine whole nights did they set a guard over me taking it in turns to\r\nwatch, and they kept a fire always burning, both in the cloister of\r\nthe outer court and in the inner court at the doors of the room\r\nwherein I lay; but when the darkness of the tenth night came, I\r\nbroke through the closed doors of my room, and climbed the wall of the\r\nouter court after passing quickly and unperceived through the men on\r\nguard and the women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I came\r\nto fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King Peleus, who made me\r\nwelcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heir\r\nto all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people,\r\nestablishing me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief ruler\r\nover the Dolopians.\r\n"It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with all\r\nmy heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone\r\nout elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the\r\ndainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your\r\nlips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness\r\nover my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heaven\r\nhad vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and I made a son of you,\r\nAchilles, that in my hour of need you might protect me. Now,\r\ntherefore, I say battle with your pride and beat it; cherish not\r\nyour anger for ever; the might and majesty of heaven are more than\r\nours, but even heaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned he\r\nprays the gods, and reconciles them to himself by his piteous cries\r\nand by frankincense, with drink-offerings and the savour of burnt\r\nsacrifice. For prayers are as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled,\r\nwith eyes askance, they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being\r\nfierce and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful\r\nto mankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; but\r\nnevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after. If a man has\r\npity upon these daughters of Jove when they draw near him, they will\r\nbless him and hear him too when he is praying; but if he deny them and\r\nwill not listen to them, they go to Jove the son of Saturn and pray\r\nthat he may presently fall into sin- to his ruing bitterly\r\nhereafter. Therefore, Achilles, give these daughters of Jove due\r\nreverence, and bow before them as all good men will bow. Were not\r\nthe son of Atreus offering you gifts and promising others later- if he\r\nwere still furious and implacable- I am not he that would bid you\r\nthrow off your anger and help the Achaeans, no matter how great\r\ntheir need; but he is giving much now, and more hereafter; he has sent\r\nhis captains to urge his suit, and has chosen those who of all the\r\nArgives are most acceptable to you; make not then their words and\r\ntheir coming to be of none effect. Your anger has been righteous so\r\nfar. We have heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they\r\nwere roused to fury, but still they could be won by gifts, and fair\r\nwords could soothe them.\r\n"I have an old story in my mind- a very old one- but you are all\r\nfriends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were\r\nfighting and killing one another round Calydon- the Aetolians\r\ndefending the city and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Diana\r\nof the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had\r\nnot offered her his harvest first-fruits. The other gods had all\r\nbeen feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of great Jove alone\r\nhe had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her, or somehow or other it\r\nhad escaped him, and this was a grievous sin. Thereon the archer\r\ngoddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature against him- a\r\nsavage wild boar with great white tusks that did much harm to his\r\norchard lands, uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them\r\nto the ground. But Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from\r\nmany cities and killed it- for it was so monstrous that not a few were\r\nneeded, and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this\r\nthe goddess set the Curetes and the Aetolians fighting furiously about\r\nthe head and skin of the boar.\r\n"So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the\r\nCuretes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their ground\r\nunder the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angered\r\nas even a wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with his\r\nmother Althaea, and therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair\r\nCleopatra, who was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and of\r\nIdes the man then living. He it was who took his bow and faced King\r\nApollo himself for fair Marpessa\'s sake; her father and mother then\r\nnamed her Alcyone, because her mother had mourned with the plaintive\r\nstrains of the halcyon-bird when Phoebus Apollo had carried her off.\r\nMeleager, then, stayed at home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which\r\nhe felt by reason of his mother\'s curses. His mother, grieving for the\r\ndeath of her brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with her\r\nhands, calling upon Hades and on awful Proserpine; she went down\r\nupon her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed that\r\nthey would kill her son- and Erinys that walks in darkness and knows\r\nno ruth heard her from Erebus.\r\n"Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and\r\nthe dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the\r\nelders of the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest of\r\ntheir priests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising him\r\na great reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most\r\nfertile in the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other\r\nopen plough-land. The old warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at the\r\nthreshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. His\r\nsisters and his mother herself besought him sore, but he the more\r\nrefused them; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to\r\nhim also prayed him, but they could not move him till the foe was\r\nbattering at the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaled\r\nthe walls and were setting fire to the city. Then at last his\r\nsorrowing wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city is\r\ntaken; she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given\r\nover to the flames, while the women and children are carried into\r\ncaptivity; when he heard all this, his heart was touched, and he\r\ndonned his armour to go forth. Thus of his own inward motion he\r\nsaved the city of the Aetolians; but they now gave him nothing of\r\nthose rich rewards that they had offered earlier, and though he\r\nsaved the city he took nothing by it. Be not then, my son, thus\r\nminded; let not heaven lure you into any such course. When the ships\r\nare burning it will be a harder matter to save them. Take the gifts,\r\nand go, for the Achaeans will then honour you as a god; whereas if you\r\nfight without taking them, you may beat the battle back, but you\r\nwill not be held in like honour."\r\nAnd Achilles answered, "Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no\r\nneed of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abide\r\nwith me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs are\r\nstrong. I say further- and lay my saying to your heart- vex me no more\r\nwith this weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son of\r\nAtreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you. You\r\nought to help me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be king as\r\nmuch as I am, and share like honour with myself; the others shall take\r\nmy answer; stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; at\r\ndaybreak we will consider whether to remain or go."\r\nOn this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to\r\nprepare a bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their\r\nleave. Ajax son of Telamon then said, "Ulysses, noble son of\r\nLaertes, let us be gone, for I see that our journey is vain. We must\r\nnow take our answer, unwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who are\r\nwaiting to receive it. Achilles is savage and remorseless; he is\r\ncruel, and cares nothing for the love his comrades lavished upon him\r\nmore than on all the others. He is implacable- and yet if a man\'s\r\nbrother or son has been slain he will accept a fine by way of amends\r\nfrom him that killed him, and the wrong-doer having paid in full\r\nremains in peace among his own people; but as for you, Achilles, the\r\ngods have put a wicked unforgiving spirit in your heart, and this, all\r\nabout one single girl, whereas we now offer you the seven best we\r\nhave, and much else into the bargain. Be then of a more gracious mind,\r\nrespect the hospitality of your own roof. We are with you as\r\nmessengers from the host of the Danaans, and would fain he held\r\nnearest and dearest to yourself of all the Achaeans."\r\n"Ajax," replied Achilles, "noble son of Telamon, you have spoken\r\nmuch to my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, and\r\nremember how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I\r\nwere some vile tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go,\r\nthen, and deliver your message; say that I will have no concern with\r\nfighting till Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of the\r\nMyrmidons in his murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships.\r\nFor all his lust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when he\r\nis at my own tent and ship."\r\nOn this they took every man his double cup, made their\r\ndrink-offerings, and went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the\r\nway. But Patroclus told his men and the maid-servants to make ready\r\na comfortable bed for Phoenix; they therefore did so with\r\nsheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of fine linen. The old man then laid\r\nhimself down and waited till morning came. But Achilles slept in an\r\ninner room, and beside him the daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede,\r\nwhom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroclus lay on the other side\r\nof the room, and with him fair Iphis whom Achilles had given him\r\nwhen he took Scyros the city of Enyeus.\r\nWhen the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans\r\nrose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. King\r\nAgamemnon was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses," said he, "will he\r\nsave the ships from burning, or did be refuse, and is he still\r\nfurious?"\r\nUlysses answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\r\nAchilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever, and\r\nspurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with the\r\nAchaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself,\r\nhe said that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water. He\r\nsaid further that he should advise every one to sail home likewise,\r\nfor that you will not reach the goal of Ilius. \'Jove,\' he said, \'has\r\nlaid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have taken\r\nheart.\' This is what he said, and the others who were with me can tell\r\nyou the same story- Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, who\r\nmay be trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep,\r\nfor so Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the\r\nmorning if he so would; but he will not take him by force."\r\nThey all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and\r\ndejected, by reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refused\r\nthem, till presently Diomed said, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of\r\nmen, Agamemnon, you ought not to have sued the son of Peleus nor\r\noffered him gifts. He is proud enough as it is, and you have\r\nencouraged him in his pride am further. Let him stay or go as he will.\r\nHe will fight later when he is in the humour, and heaven puts it in\r\nhis mind to do so. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; we have\r\neaten and drunk our fill, let us then take our rest, for in rest there\r\nis both strength and stay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears,\r\nforthwith bring out your host and your horsemen in front of the ships,\r\nurging them on, and yourself fighting among the foremost."\r\nThus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They\r\nthen made their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent,\r\nwhere they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK X\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole\r\nnight through, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he\r\ncould get no rest. As when fair Juno\'s lord flashes his lightning in\r\ntoken of great rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the\r\nground, or again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry\r\nwar, even so did Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul\r\ntrembled within him. When he looked upon the plain of Troy he\r\nmarvelled at the many watchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the\r\nsound of pipes and flutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he\r\nturned towards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair\r\nby handfuls before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very\r\ndisquietness of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at once\r\nto Nestor son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find any\r\nway of the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his\r\nshirt, bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a\r\nhuge tawny lion over his shoulders- a skin that reached his feet-\r\nand took his spear in his hand.\r\nNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives\r\nwho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the\r\nTrojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther,\r\nput a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny\r\nhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most\r\npowerful of the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though\r\nhe were a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting\r\nhis goodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his\r\nbrother had come.\r\nMenelaus spoke first. "Why," said he, "my dear brother, are you thus\r\narming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the\r\nTrojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and\r\nspy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of\r\ngreat daring."\r\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, "Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd\r\ncounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his\r\nmind, and inclines towards Hector\'s sacrifices rather than ours. I\r\nnever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one\r\nday as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans- and\r\nthat too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor\r\ngoddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with\r\nall speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.\r\nMeanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among the\r\ncompanies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they\r\nwill listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and\r\nMeriones brother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. It\r\nwas to them more particularly that we gave this charge."\r\nMenelaus replied, "How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with\r\nthem and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have\r\ngiven your orders?" "Wait," answered King Agamemnon, "for there are so\r\nmany paths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every\r\nman on your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage\r\nand by his father\'s name, give each all titular observance, and\r\nstand not too much upon your own dignity; we must take our full\r\nshare of toil, for at our birth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us."\r\nWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went\r\non to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent\r\nhard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him- his shield,\r\nhis two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle\r\nwith which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people\r\ninto battle- for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his\r\nelbow and looked up at Agamemnon. "Who is it," said he, "that goes\r\nthus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when\r\nmen are sleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for some\r\ncomrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but speak. What is your\r\nbusiness?"\r\nAnd Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the\r\nAchaean name, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has\r\nlaid labour and sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my\r\nlimbs carry me. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my\r\neyelids, but my heart is big with war and with the jeopardy of the\r\nAchaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without\r\nsure counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap out of my body,\r\nand my limbs fail me. If then you can do anything- for you too\r\ncannot sleep- let us go the round of the watch, and see whether they\r\nare drowsy with toil and sleeping to the neglect of their duty. The\r\nenemy is encamped hard and we know not but he may attack us by night."\r\nNestor replied, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\r\nJove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will\r\nhave troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I\r\nwill go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son of\r\nTydeus, or Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some\r\none had also better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their\r\nships are not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however\r\nrefrain from blaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him- and\r\nI will say so plainly, even at the risk of offending you- for sleeping\r\nand leaving all this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about\r\nimploring aid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in\r\nextreme danger."\r\nAnd Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,\r\nfor he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself- not indeed from\r\nsloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects me\r\nto take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before I\r\nwas, and came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to call\r\nthe very men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shall\r\nfind them with the watch outside the gates, for it was there I said\r\nthat we would meet them."\r\n"In that case," answered Nestor, "the Argives will not blame him nor\r\ndisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them\r\ninstructions."\r\nWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his\r\ncomely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large,\r\nand of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod\r\nspear, and wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First\r\nhe called loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him,\r\nfor he was soon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside\r\nhis tent and said, "Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along\r\nthe line of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that\r\nyou find so urgent?" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, "Ulysses,\r\nnoble son of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great\r\nstraits. Come with me and let us wake some other, who may advise\r\nwell with us whether we shall fight or fly."\r\nOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his\r\nshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of\r\nTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his\r\ncomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as for\r\ntheir spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts that\r\nwere driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar\r\nlike the lightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon the skin\r\nof an ox, with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went up\r\nto him and stirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him\r\nand urging him to bestir himself. "Wake up," he exclaimed, "son of\r\nTydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you not see that the\r\nTrojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships,\r\nwith but a little space between us and them?"\r\nOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, "Old man, your\r\nheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there\r\nno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the\r\nprinces? There is no tiring you."\r\nAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, "My son, all that you\r\nhave said is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might\r\ncall the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger;\r\nlife and death are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go\r\nthen, for you are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax\r\nand the fleet son of Phyleus."\r\nDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders- a\r\nskin that reached his feet- and grasped his spear. When he had\r\nroused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the\r\nround of those who were on guard, and found the captains not\r\nsleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms\r\nabout them. As sheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are\r\nyarded, and hear a wild beast coming through the mountain forest\r\ntowards them- forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs and men, and\r\nslumber is broken- even so was sleep chased from the eyes of the\r\nAchaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they turned\r\nconstantly towards the plain whenever they heard any stir among the\r\nTrojans. The old man was glad bade them be of good cheer. "Watch on,\r\nmy children," said he, "and let not sleep get hold upon you, lest\r\nour enemies triumph over us."\r\nWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the\r\nAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave\r\nson of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were\r\nbeyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held their\r\nmeeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses,\r\nfor it was here that when night fell Hector had turned back from his\r\nonslaught on the Argives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate\r\nwith one another.\r\nNestor spoke first. "My friends," said he, "is there any man bold\r\nenough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or us\r\nnews of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the\r\nships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted the\r\nAchaeans, they will retire within their walls. If he could learn all\r\nthis and come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in\r\nthe mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs\r\nfrom all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her\r\nlamb- which is a present of surpassing value- and he would be asked as\r\na guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings."\r\nThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke\r\nsaying, "Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over\r\nagainst us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater\r\nconfidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see\r\nsome opportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a man\r\nis alone he is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker."\r\nOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes,\r\nservants of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so\r\ndid Menelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host\r\nof the Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and thereon\r\nAgamemnon king of men spoke thus: "Diomed," said he, "son of Tydeus,\r\nman after my own heart, choose your comrade for yourself- take the\r\nbest man of those that have offered, for many would now go with you.\r\nDo not through delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst\r\nout of respect for his lineage, because he is of more royal blood."\r\nHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, "If\r\nyou bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I\r\nfail to think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face\r\nall kinds of danger- and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were\r\nto go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is\r\nquick to see and understand."\r\n"Son of Tydeus," replied Ulysses, "say neither good nor ill about\r\nme, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for\r\nthe night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,\r\ntwo-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone left\r\nus."\r\nThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son of\r\nTydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship)\r\nand on his head he set a helmet of bull\'s hide without either peak\r\nor crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear.\r\nMeriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set\r\na leathern helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern\r\nthongs, while on the outside it was thickly studded with boar\'s teeth,\r\nwell and skilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner\r\nlining of felt. This helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out of\r\nEleon when he broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He\r\ngave it to Amphidamas of Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas\r\ngave it as a guest-gift to Molus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and\r\nnow it was set upon the head of Ulysses.\r\nWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains\r\nbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon\r\ntheir right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they\r\nheard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to\r\nMinerva: "Hear me," he cried, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who\r\nspy out all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships;\r\nbefriend me in this mine hour, and grant that we may return to the\r\nships covered with glory after having achieved some mighty exploit\r\nthat shall bring sorrow to the Trojans."\r\nThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: "Hear me too," said he,\r\n"daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my\r\nnoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the\r\nAchaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus,\r\nand went to the city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on\r\nhis return thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of\r\ndaring, for you were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me\r\nnow, and in return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer\r\nof a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the\r\nyoke. I will gild her horns and will offer her up to you in\r\nsacrifice."\r\nThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they\r\nhad done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way\r\nlike two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained\r\nbodies of them that had fallen.\r\nNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called\r\nthe princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his\r\ncounsel before them. "Is there one," said he, "who for a great\r\nreward will do me the service of which I will tell you? He shall be\r\nwell paid if he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple of\r\nhorses, the fleetest that can be found at the ships of the Achaeans,\r\nif he will dare this thing; and he will win infinite honour to boot;\r\nhe must go to the ships and find out whether they are still guarded as\r\nheretofore, or whether now that we have beaten them the Achaeans\r\ndesign to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep\r\ntheir watches."\r\nThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain\r\nman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald- a man rich in gold\r\nand bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an only\r\nson among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans.\r\n"I, Hector," said he, "Will to the ships and will exploit them. But\r\nfirst hold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the\r\nchariot, bedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the\r\nnoble son of Peleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail\r\nyou. I will go through the host from one end to the other till I\r\ncome to the ship of Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of the\r\nAchaeans are now consulting whether they shall fight or fly."\r\nWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore\r\nhim his oath saying, "May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear\r\nwitness that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds,\r\nand that you shall have your will with them for ever."\r\nThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on\r\ngoing. He hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore\r\nthe skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret\r\nskin. Then he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships,\r\nbut he was not to return with any news for Hector. When he had left\r\nthe horses and the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way,\r\nbut Ulysses perceived his coming and said to Diomed, "Diomed, here\r\nis some one from the camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, or\r\nwhether it is some thief who would plunder the bodies of the dead; let\r\nhim get a little past us, we can then spring upon him and take him.\r\nIf, however, he is too quick for us, go after him with your spear\r\nand hem him in towards the ships away from the Trojan camp, to prevent\r\nhis getting back to the town."\r\nWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among the\r\ncorpses. Dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had\r\ngot about as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds\r\none that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land\r\nquicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their\r\nfootsteps he stood still, for he made sure they were friends from\r\nthe Trojan camp come by Hector\'s orders to bid him return; when,\r\nhowever, they were only a spear\'s cast, or less away form him, he\r\nsaw that they were enemies as fast as his legs could take him. The\r\nothers gave chase at once, and as a couple of well-trained hounds\r\npress forward after a doe or hare that runs screaming in front of\r\nthem, even so did the son of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cut\r\nhim off from his own people. But when he had fled so far towards the\r\nships that he would soon have fallen in with the outposts, Minerva\r\ninfused fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for fear some other of\r\nthe Achaeans might have the glory of being first to hit him, and he\r\nmight himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward with his\r\nspear and said, "Stand, or I shall throw my spear, and in that case\r\nI shall soon make an end of you."\r\nHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew\r\nover the man\'s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He\r\nstood stock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered,\r\nand he turned pale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and\r\nseized his hands, whereon he began to weep and said, "Take me alive; I\r\nwill ransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought\r\niron, and from this my father will satisfy you with a very large\r\nransom, should he hear of my being alive at the ships of the\r\nAchaeans."\r\n"Fear not," replied Ulysses, "let no thought of death be in your\r\nmind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about\r\nalone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards the\r\nships, while other men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of\r\nthe slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on at\r\nthe ships? Or did you come here of your own mere notion?"\r\nDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: "Hector, with his\r\nvain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said\r\nhe would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his\r\nbronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the\r\nflying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the ships\r\nare still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten\r\nthem, the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are\r\nneglecting to keep their watches."\r\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, "You had indeed set your heart\r\nupon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are\r\nhardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than\r\nAchilles himself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and\r\ntell me true, where did you leave Hector when you started? Where\r\nlies his armour and his horses? How, too, are the watches and\r\nsleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered? What are their plans? Will\r\nthey stay here by the ships and away from the city, or now that they\r\nhave worsted the Achaeans, will they retire within their walls?"\r\nAnd Dolon answered, "I will tell you truly all. Hector and the other\r\ncouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of great\r\nIlus, away from the general tumult; as for the guards about which\r\nyou ask me, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host.\r\nThe Trojans have their watchfires, for they are bound to have them;\r\nthey, therefore, are awake and keep each other to their duty as\r\nsentinels; but the allies who have come from other places are asleep\r\nand leave it to the Trojans to keep guard, for their wives and\r\nchildren are not here."\r\nUlysses then said, "Now tell me; are they sleeping among the\r\nTrojan troops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may\r\nunderstand it."\r\n"I will tell you truly all," replied Dolon. "To the seaward lie\r\nthe Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the\r\nnoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and\r\nMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask\r\nabout an this? If you want to find your way into the host of the\r\nTrojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie\r\napart from the others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus\r\nson of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest\r\nthat I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than\r\nany wind that blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold,\r\nand he has brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest\r\nworkmanship- too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only\r\nfor the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely\r\nhere, until you come back and have proved my words whether they be\r\nfalse or true."\r\nDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, "Think not, Dolon, for\r\nall the good information you have given us, that you shall escape\r\nnow you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will\r\ncome some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy\r\nor as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will\r\ngive no more trouble."\r\nOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him\r\nfurther, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his\r\nsword and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the\r\ndust while he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his\r\nhead, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses\r\nhung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and\r\nprayed saying, "Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in\r\npreference to all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still\r\nfurther towards the horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians."\r\nWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk\r\ntree, and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering\r\nboughs of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back\r\nthrough the\' flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards\r\namid the fallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the\r\ncompany of Thracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with\r\ntheir day\'s toil; their goodly armour was lying on the ground beside\r\nthem all orderly in three rows, and each man had his yoke of horses\r\nbeside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the middle, and hard by him his\r\nhorses were made fast to the topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses\r\nfrom some way off saw him and said, "This, Diomed, is the man, and\r\nthese are the horses about which Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your\r\nvery utmost; dally not about your armour, but loose the horses at\r\nonce- or else kill the men yourself, while I see to the horses."\r\nThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote\r\nthem right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being\r\nhacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion\r\nsprings furiously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds without\r\ntheir shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian\r\nsoldiers till he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and\r\ndrew them aside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go\r\nforward freely without being frightened as they passed over the dead\r\nbodies, for they were not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus\r\ncame to the king, he killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was\r\nbreathing hard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the\r\nseed of Oeneus, hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses\r\nuntied the horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off,\r\nstriking them with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip from\r\nthe chariot. Then he whistled as a sign to Diomed.\r\nBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he\r\nmight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which\r\nthe king\'s armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift\r\nthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not\r\nkill some more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up\r\nto him and said, "Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be\r\ndriven thither, should some other god rouse the Trojans."\r\nDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the\r\nhorses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the\r\nships of the Achaeans.\r\nBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son\r\nof Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the\r\nTrojans he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble\r\nkinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the\r\nhorses were no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in\r\ntheir death-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his\r\nfriend by name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the\r\npeople kept hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of\r\nthe heroes who had now got away towards the ships.\r\nWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector\'s scout,\r\nUlysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the\r\nground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and\r\nremounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward\r\nnothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will.\r\nNestor was first to hear the tramp of their feet. "My friends," said\r\nhe, "princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right or\r\nwrong?- but I must say what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of\r\nthe tramp of horses. I hope it may Diomed and Ulysses driving in\r\nhorses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest of the\r\nArgives may have come to some harm at their hands."\r\nHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,\r\nwhereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and\r\ncongratulated them. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question\r\nthem. "Tell me," said he, "renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by\r\nthese horses? Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some\r\ngod meet you and give them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well\r\nconversant with the Trojans, for old warrior though I am I never\r\nhold back by the ships, but I never yet saw or heard of such horses as\r\nthese are. Surely some god must have met you and given them to you,\r\nfor you are both of dear to Jove, and to Jove\'s daughter Minerva."\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, "Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\r\nname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than\r\nthese, for the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses,\r\nhowever, about which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace.\r\nDiomed killed their king with the twelve bravest of his companions.\r\nHard by the ships we took a thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector and\r\nthe other Trojans had sent as a spy upon our ships."\r\nHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while\r\nthe other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly\r\nbuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with\r\nthongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood\r\neating their sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils\r\nof Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred\r\noffering to Minerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and\r\nwashed the sweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs.\r\nWhen the sea-water had taken all the sweat from off them, and had\r\nrefreshed them, they went into the baths and washed themselves.\r\nAfter they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil, they\r\nsat down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a\r\ndrink-offering of wine to Minerva.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XI\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'AND now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of\r\nlight alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord with\r\nthe ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She\r\ntook her stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses\' ship which was\r\nmiddlemost of all, so that her voice might carry farthest on either\r\nside, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on\r\nthe other towards those of Achilles- for these two heroes,\r\nwell-assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn up their\r\nships at the two ends of the line. There she took her stand, and\r\nraised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the Achaeans with\r\ncourage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and with all their\r\nmight, so that they had rather stay there and do battle than go home\r\nin their ships.\r\nThe son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves\r\nfor battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodly\r\ngreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps of\r\nsilver; and about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras had\r\nonce given him as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as\r\nCyprus that the Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he\r\ngave it to the king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of\r\ngold, and ten of tin. There were serpents of cyanus that reared\r\nthemselves up towards the neck, three upon either side, like the\r\nrainbows which the son of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal\r\nmen. About his shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses of\r\ngold; and the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to\r\nhang it. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered his\r\nbody when he was in battle- fair to see, with ten circles of bronze\r\nrunning all round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there were\r\ntwenty bosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the middle:\r\nthis last was made to show a Gorgon\'s head, fierce and grim, with Rout\r\nand Panic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was of\r\nsilver, on which there was a writhing snake of cyanus with three heads\r\nthat sprang from a single neck, and went in and out among one another.\r\nOn his head Agamemnon set a helmet, with a peak before and behind, and\r\nfour plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; then he\r\ngrasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his\r\narmour shot from him as a flame into the firmament, while Juno and\r\nMinerva thundered in honour of the king of rich Mycene.\r\nEvery man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold\r\nthem in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot\r\nclad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the\r\ndawning. The chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got\r\nthere, but these came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent\r\nof evil sound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for\r\nhe was about to send many a brave man hurrying down to Hades.\r\nThe Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain,\r\nwere gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who was\r\nhonoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of\r\nAntenor, Polybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god.\r\nHector\'s round shield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful\r\nstar that shines for a moment through a rent in the clouds and is\r\nagain hidden beneath them; even so was Hector now seen in the front\r\nranks and now again in the hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed\r\nlike the lightning of aegis-bearing Jove.\r\nAnd now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a\r\nrich man\'s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did\r\nthe Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood\r\nfor yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better\r\nof the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the\r\nonly god that went among them; the others were not there, but stayed\r\nquietly each in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus.\r\nAll of them blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory to\r\nthe Trojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from\r\nall, and sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon\r\nthe city of the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of\r\nbronze, and alike upon the slayers and on the slain.\r\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts\r\nrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hour\r\ndrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get\r\nhis midday meal- for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is\r\ntired out, and must now have food- then the Danaans with a cry that\r\nrang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy.\r\nAgamemnon led them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of his\r\npeople, and afterwards his comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprang\r\nfrom his chariot and was coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struck\r\nhim on the forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail\r\nagainst the weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his\r\nbrains were battered in and he was killed in full fight.\r\nAgamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with\r\ntheir breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on\r\nto kill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the\r\nother born in wedlock; they were in the same chariot- the bastard\r\ndriving, while noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once\r\ntaken both of them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound\r\nthem with fresh withes as they were shepherding, but he had taken a\r\nransom for them; now, however, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in\r\nthe chest above the nipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphus\r\nhard by the ear and threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he\r\nstripped their goodly armour from off them and recognized them, for he\r\nhad already seen them at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida.\r\nAs a lion fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great\r\njaws, robbing them of their tender life while he on his way back to\r\nhis lair- the hind can do nothing for them even though she be close\r\nby, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the thick\r\nforest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before the mighty monster-\r\nso, no man of the Trojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for they\r\nwere themselves flying panic before the Argives.\r\nThen King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and\r\nbrave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in\r\npreventing Helen\'s being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely\r\nbribed by Alexandrus; and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the\r\nsame chariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand- for they had\r\nlost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear. The son of\r\nAtreus sprang upon them like a lion, and the pair besought him from\r\ntheir chariot. "Take us alive," they cried, "son of Atreus, and you\r\nshall receive a great ransom for us. Our father Antimachus has great\r\nstore of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy\r\nyou with a very large ransom should he hear of our being alive at\r\nthe ships of the Achaeans."\r\nWith such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but\r\nthey heard no pitiful answer in return. "If," said Agamemnon, "you are\r\nsons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that\r\nMenelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be\r\nkilled and not suffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul\r\niniquity of your father."\r\nAs he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth,\r\nsmiting him on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost\r\nupon the ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he\r\ncut off his hands and his head- which he sent rolling in among the\r\ncrowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and\r\nwherever the ranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other\r\nAchaeans followed. Foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in\r\nrout before them, and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen,\r\nand the thundering tramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust frim off\r\nthe plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and\r\ncheering on the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze-\r\nthe eddying gusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets\r\nshrivel and are consumed before the blast of the flame- even so fell\r\nthe heads of the flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and\r\nmany a noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways\r\nof war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful\r\nnow to vultures than to their wives.\r\nJove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage\r\nand din of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out\r\nlustily to the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of\r\nDardanus, in the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild\r\nfig-tree making always for the city- the son of Atreus still shouting,\r\nand with hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the\r\nScaean gates and the oak tree, there they halted and waited for the\r\nothers to come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over the\r\nmiddle of the plain like a herd cows maddened with fright when a\r\nlion has attacked them in the dead of night- he springs on one of\r\nthem, seizes her neck in the grip of his strong teeth and then laps up\r\nher blood and gorges himself upon her entrails- even so did King\r\nAgamemnon son of Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost\r\nas they fled pell-mell before him. Many a man was flung headlong\r\nfrom his chariot by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded\r\nhis spear with fury.\r\nBut when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city,\r\nthe father of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat,\r\nthunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then\r\ntold Iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him. "Go," said\r\nhe, "fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector-  say that so long as he\r\nsees Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks,\r\nhe is to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,\r\nbut when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to\r\nhis chariot, then will I vouchsafe him strength to slay till he\r\nreach the ships and night falls at the going down of the sun."\r\nIris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the\r\ncrests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariot\r\nand horses. Then she said, "Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in\r\ncounsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this message- so long\r\nas you see Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan\r\nranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of\r\nthe battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow,\r\nand takes to his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to\r\nslay till you reach the ships, and till night falls at the going\r\ndown of the sun."\r\nWhen she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armed\r\nfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went about\r\neverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and\r\nstirring the dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round,\r\nand again met the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part\r\nstrengthened their battalions. The battle was now in array and they\r\nstood face to face with one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forward\r\nin his eagerness to be ahead of all others.\r\nTell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who,\r\nwhether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face\r\nAgamemnon? It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of\r\ngreat stature, who was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother of\r\nsheep. Cisses, his mother\'s father, brought him up in his own house\r\nwhen he was a child- Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reached\r\nmanhood, Cisses would have kept him there, and was for giving him\r\nhis daughter in marriage, but as soon as he had married he set out\r\nto fight the Achaeans with twelve ships that followed him: these he\r\nhad left at Percote and had come on by land to Ilius. He it was that\r\nnaw met Agamemnon son of Atreus. When they were close up with one\r\nanother, the son of Atreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on\r\nthe girdle below the cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting\r\nto his strength of arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor\r\nnearly so, for the point of the spear struck against the silver and\r\nwas turned aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught\r\nit from his hand, and drew it towards him with the fury of a lion;\r\nhe then drew his sword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the\r\nneck. So there the poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of\r\nbronze, killed in the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from his\r\nwedded wife, of whom he had had no joy though he had given much for\r\nher: he had given a hundred-head of cattle down, and had promised\r\nlater on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from the\r\ncountless flocks of which he was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus\r\nthen despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the host of the\r\nAchaeans.\r\nWhen noble Coon, Antenor\'s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were\r\nhis eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon he\r\ngot beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his\r\narm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the\r\narm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this\r\ndid he leave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that\r\nflew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to drag\r\noff the body of his brother- his father\'s son- by the foot, and was\r\ncrying for help to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon\r\nstruck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was\r\ndragging the dead body through the press of men under cover of his\r\nshield: he then cut off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas.\r\nThus did the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son\r\nof Atreus, and go down into the house of Hades.\r\nAs long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went\r\nabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and with\r\ngreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and the\r\nwound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which the\r\nEilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno and\r\ndispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour-\r\neven so sharp were the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his\r\nchariot, and bade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in\r\ngreat agony. With a loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, "My\r\nfriends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, defend the ships\r\nyourselves, for Jove has not suffered me to fight the whole day\r\nthrough against the Trojans."\r\nWith this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and\r\nthey flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam\r\nand their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of\r\nthe battle.\r\nWhen Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the\r\nTrojans and Lycians saying, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors,\r\nbe men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their\r\nbest man has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph;\r\ncharge the foe with your chariots that. you may win still greater\r\nglory."\r\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a\r\nhuntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did\r\nHector, peer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans.\r\nFull of hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight\r\nlike some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its\r\ndeep blue waters into fury.\r\nWhat, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed\r\nin the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,\r\nAutonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;\r\nAesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains\r\nof the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and\r\nfile. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south\r\nand beats them down with the fierceness of its fury- the waves of\r\nthe sea roll high, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the\r\nwandering wind- even so thick were the heads of them that fell by\r\nthe hand of Hector.\r\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would\r\nhave fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to\r\nDiomed, "Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget\r\nour prowess? Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we\r\nshall be shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships."\r\nAnd Diomed answered, "Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shall\r\nhave scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to the\r\nTrojans rather than to us."\r\nWith these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the\r\nground, smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysses\r\nkilled Molion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they\r\nhad stopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on playing\r\nhavoc with the foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the\r\nhounds that hunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slay\r\nthem, and the Achaeans were thankful to have breathing time in their\r\nflight from Hector.\r\nThey then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of\r\nMerops of Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of\r\ndivination. He had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would\r\nnot obey him, for fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son of\r\nTydeus slew them both and stripped them of their armour, while Ulysses\r\nkilled Hippodamus and Hypeirochus.\r\nAnd now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that\r\nneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing one\r\nanother. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the\r\nhip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly\r\nwith, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of it\r\nat some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost\r\nuntil he lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and\r\nUlysses were making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed\r\nby the Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and\r\nsaid to Ulysses who was beside him, "Great Hector is bearing down upon\r\nus and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset."\r\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss his\r\nmark. He had aimed at Hector\'s head near the top of his helmet, but\r\nbronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear\r\nwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal,\r\nwhich Phoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great\r\nbound under cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped\r\nhimself with his brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had\r\nfallen on his eyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed\r\nin among the foremost fighters, to the place where he had seen it\r\nstrike the ground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing\r\nback into his chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he\r\nsaved his life. But Diomed made at him with his spear and said,\r\n"Dog, you have again got away though death was close on your heels.\r\nPhoebus Apollo, to whom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has\r\nagain saved you, nevertheless I will meet you and make and end of\r\nyou hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and be\r\nmy helper. For the present I must pursue those I can lay hands on."\r\nAs he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but\r\nAlexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning\r\nagainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son of\r\nDardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass from\r\noff the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the shield\r\nfrom off his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly an arrow\r\nthat sped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat of\r\nDiomed\'s right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in the\r\nground. Thereon Paris with a hearty laugh sprang forward from his\r\nhiding-place, and taunted him saying, "You are wounded- my arrow has\r\nnot been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly and\r\nkilled you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion,\r\nwould have had a truce from evil."\r\nDiomed all undaunted answered, "Archer, you who without your bow are\r\nnothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single\r\ncombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve\r\nyou in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched the\r\nsole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy had\r\nhit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wound\r\na man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for my\r\nweapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief and\r\nhis children will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening the\r\nearth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him."\r\nThus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this\r\ncover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the\r\npain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and\r\nbade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.\r\nUlysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they\r\nwere all panic-stricken. "Alas," said he to himself in his dismay,\r\n"what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these\r\nodds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner,\r\nfor the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic.\r\nBut why talk to myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards\r\nquit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand\r\nfirm and hold his own."\r\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced\r\nand hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to me it. As hounds\r\nand lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair\r\nwhetting his white tusks- they attack him from every side and can hear\r\nthe gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold\r\ntheir ground- even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses.\r\nFirst he sprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the\r\nshoulder with a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After\r\nthese he struck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had\r\njust sprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutched\r\nthe earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on\r\nto wound Charops son of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus,\r\nhero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close to\r\nUlysses he said, "Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil,\r\nthis day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of\r\nHippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before\r\nmy spear."\r\nWith these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went\r\nthrough the shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass,\r\ntearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer\r\nit to pierce the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hour\r\nwas not yet come, but he gave ground and said to Socus, "Wretch, you\r\nshall now surely die. You have stayed me from fighting further with\r\nthe Trojans, but you shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory to\r\nmyself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds."\r\nSocus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him\r\nin the back midway between the shoulders, and went right through his\r\nchest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him\r\nsaying, "O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been\r\ntoo quick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not\r\neven in death shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the\r\nravening vultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their dark\r\nwings and devour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans will\r\ngive me my due rites of burial."\r\nSo saying he drew Socus\'s heavy spear out of his flesh and from\r\nhis shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so\r\nthat he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was\r\nbleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a body towards\r\nhim; he therefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come and\r\nhelp him. Thrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did\r\nbrave Menelaus hear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close\r\nbeside him and said, "Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of your\r\npeople, the cry of Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had\r\ncut him off and were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us\r\nmake our way through the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I\r\nfear he may come to harm for all his valour if he be left without\r\nsupport, and the Danaans would miss him sorely."\r\nHe led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had\r\ngathered round Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the\r\ncarcase of some homed stag that has been hit with an arrow- the stag\r\nhas fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and his\r\nstrength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the savage\r\njackals devour him in the shady glades of the forest. Then heaven\r\nsends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals fly in terror and the\r\nlion robs them of their prey- even so did Trojans many and brave\r\ngather round crafty Ulysses, but the hero stood at bay and kept them\r\noff with his spear. Ajax then came up with his shield before him\r\nlike a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the Trojans fled in all\r\ndirections. Menelaus took Ulysses by the hand, and led him out of\r\nthe press while his squire brought up his chariot, but Ajax rushed\r\nfuriously on the Trojans and killed Doryclus, a bastard son of\r\nPriam; then he wounded Pandocus, Lysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes;\r\nas some swollen torrent comes rushing in full flood from the mountains\r\non to the plain, big with the rain of heaven- many a dry oak and\r\nmany a pine does it engulf, and much mud does it bring down and cast\r\ninto the sea- even so did brave Ajax chase the foe furiously over\r\nthe plain, slaying both men and horses.\r\nHector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting\r\non the extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander,\r\nwhere the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor\r\nand brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter\r\nwith his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranks\r\nthat were opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given no\r\nground, had not Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen stayed the\r\nprowess of Machaon shepherd of his people, by wounding him in the\r\nright shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans were in\r\ngreat fear that as the fight had turned against them the Trojans might\r\ntake him prisoner, and Idomeneus said to Nestor, "Nestor son of\r\nNeleus, honour to the Achaean name, mount your chariot at once; take\r\nMachaon with you and drive your horses to the ships as fast as you\r\ncan. A physician is worth more than several other men put together,\r\nfor he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs."\r\nNestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at\r\nonce mounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician\r\nAesculapius went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward\r\nnothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own free will.\r\nThen Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from\r\nhis place beside him, "Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme\r\nwing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout,\r\nthey and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before him;\r\nI know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot and\r\nhorses thither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately,\r\nand where the cry of battle is loudest."\r\nWith this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip\r\nthey drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans,\r\nover the bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was\r\nbespattered with blood, and the rail round the car was covered with\r\nsplashes both from the horses\' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels.\r\nHector tore his way through and flung himself into the thick of the\r\nfight, and his presence threw the Danaans into confusion, for his\r\nspear was not long idle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks\r\nwith sword and spear, and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son\r\nof Telamon, for Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a\r\nbetter man than himself.\r\nThen father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart\r\nof Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him-\r\nlooking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some\r\nwild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly\r\nbackwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their\r\nstockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick\r\nof their herd- he makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the\r\ndarts from many a strong hand fall thick around him, with burning\r\nbrands that scare him for all his fury, and when morning comes he\r\nslinks foiled and angry away- even so did Ajax, sorely against his\r\nwill, retreat angrily before the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the\r\nAchaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken\r\nabout his back, when he into a field begins eating the corn- boys beat\r\nhim but he is too many for them, and though they lay about with\r\ntheir sticks they cannot hurt him; still when he has had his fill they\r\nat last drive him from the field- even so did the Trojans and their\r\nallies pursue great Ajax, ever smiting the middle of his shield with\r\ntheir darts. Now and again he would turn and show fight, keeping\r\nback the battalions of the Trojans, and then he would again retreat;\r\nbut he prevented any of them from making his way to the ships.\r\nSingle-handed he stood midway between the Trojans and Achaeans: the\r\nspears that sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mighty\r\nshield, while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the ground\r\nere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh.\r\nNow when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was\r\nbeing overpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and\r\nhurled his spear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below\r\nthe midriff, and laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped\r\nthe armour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimed\r\nan arrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow\r\nbroke, but the point that was left in the wound dragged on the\r\nthigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his comrades to save\r\nhis life, shouting as he did so to the Danaans, "My friends, princes\r\nand counsellors of the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who is\r\nbeing overpowered, and I doubt whether he will come out of the fight\r\nalive. Hither, then, to the rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon."\r\nEven so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came\r\nnear, and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from their\r\nshoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and\r\nturned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men.\r\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the\r\nmares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out\r\nof the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles\r\nsaw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship\r\nwatching the hard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the\r\nship to his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came\r\nout looking like Mars himself- here indeed was the beginning of the\r\nill that presently befell him. "Why," said he, "Achilles do you call\r\nme? what do you what do you want with me?" And Achilles answered,\r\n"Noble son of Menoetius, man after my own heart, I take it that I\r\nshall now have the Achaeans praying at my knees, for they are in great\r\nstraits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who is that he is bearing\r\naway wounded from the field; from his back I should say it was Machaon\r\nson of Aesculapius, but I could not see his face for the horses went\r\nby me at full speed."\r\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off\r\nrunning by the ships and tents of the Achaeans.\r\nWhen Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of\r\nNeleus, they dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horses\r\nfrom the chariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside\r\nto dry the sweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they\r\ncame inside and took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had had\r\nawarded to him from Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them a\r\nmess; she was daughter of wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had given\r\nher to Nestor because he excelled all of them in counsel. First she\r\nset for them a fair and well-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it\r\nthere was a vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink,\r\nwith honey and cakes of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare\r\nworkmanship which the old man had brought with him from home,\r\nstudded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of which\r\nthere were two golden doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand\r\non. Any one else would hardly have been able to lift it from the table\r\nwhen it was full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the\r\nwoman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she\r\ngrated goat\'s milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a\r\nhandful of white barley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess she\r\nbade them drink it. When they had done so and had thus quenched\r\ntheir thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at this moment\r\nPatroclus appeared at the door.\r\nWhen the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand,\r\nled him into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but\r\nPatroclus stood where he was and said, "Noble sir, I may not stay, you\r\ncannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be\r\ntrifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you were\r\nbearing away from the field. I can now see for myself that he is\r\nMachaon shepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles. You,\r\nsir, know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even where\r\nno blame should lie."\r\nAnd Nestor answered, "Why should Achilles care to know how many of\r\nthe Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns in\r\nour host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed son\r\nof Tydeus is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus has been\r\nhit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this man\r\nfrom the field- he too wounded- with an arrow; nevertheless\r\nAchilles, so valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will\r\nhe wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we\r\nperish one upon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in\r\nme any longer; would that I Were still young and strong as in the days\r\nwhen there was a fight between us and the men of Elis about some\r\ncattle-raiding. I then killed Itymoneus the valiant son of Hypeirochus\r\na dweller in Elis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart\r\nthrown my hand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his\r\ncows, so he fell and the country people around him were in great fear.\r\nWe drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of\r\ncattle and as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and\r\nas many wide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we seized a\r\nhundred and fifty, all of them mares, and many had foals running\r\nwith them. All these did we drive by night to Pylus the city of\r\nNeleus, taking them within the city; and the heart of Neleus was\r\nglad in that I had taken so much, though it was the first time I had\r\never been in the field. At daybreak the heralds went round crying that\r\nall in Elis to whom there was a debt owing should come; and the\r\nleading Pylians assembled to divide the spoils. There were many to\r\nwhom the Epeans owed chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and had\r\nbeen oppressed with wrong; in former years Hercules had come, and\r\nhad laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all our best men had\r\nperished. Neleus had had twelve sons, but I alone was left; the others\r\nhad all been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all this had looked\r\ndown upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose a herd of\r\ncattle and a great flock of sheep- three hundred in all- and he took\r\ntheir shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to him in\r\nElis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and their chariots\r\nwith them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but King\r\nAugeas took them, and sent back their driver grieving for the loss\r\nof his horses. Neleus was angered by what he had both said and done,\r\nand took great value in return, but he divided the rest, that no man\r\nmight have less than his full share.\r\n"Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods\r\nthroughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in a\r\nbody, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with\r\nthem the two Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads and\r\nunused to fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched\r\nupon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this they\r\nwould destroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they had\r\ncrossed their whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympus\r\nand bade us set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiers\r\nin Pylos, for the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and\r\nhid my horses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war;\r\nnevertheless Minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I\r\nwas, I fought among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of\r\nthem. There is a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene,\r\nand there they that were mounted (and I with them) waited till\r\nmorning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force.\r\nThence in full panoply and equipment we came towards noon to the\r\nsacred waters of the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty\r\nJove, with a bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to\r\nMinerva. After this we took supper in our companies, and laid us\r\ndown to rest each in his armour by the river.\r\n"The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take\r\nit, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for\r\nthem. When the sun\'s rays began to fall upon the earth we joined\r\nbattle, praying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight had\r\nbegun, I was the first to kill my man and take his horses- to wit\r\nthe warrior Mulius. He was son-in-law to Augeas, having married his\r\neldest daughter, golden-haired Agamede, who knew the virtues of\r\nevery herb which grows upon the face of the earth. I speared him as he\r\nwas coming towards me, and when he fell headlong in the dust, I sprang\r\nupon his chariot and took my place in the front ranks. The Epeans fled\r\nin all directions when they saw the captain of their horsemen (the\r\nbest man they had) laid low, and I swept down on them like a\r\nwhirlwind, taking fifty chariots- and in each of them two men bit\r\nthe dust, slain by my spear. I should have even killed the two\r\nMoliones sons of Actor, unless their real father, Neptune lord of\r\nthe earthquake, had hidden them in a thick mist and borne them out\r\nof the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the Pylians a great victory, for\r\nwe chased them far over the plain, killing the men and bringing in\r\ntheir armour, till we had brought our horses to Buprasium rich in\r\nwheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is called Alision,\r\nat which point Minerva turned the people back. There I slew the last\r\nman and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses back from\r\nBuprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among the gods, and among\r\nmortal men to Nestor.\r\n"Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is\r\nfor keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it\r\nhereafter when the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did\r\nnot Menoetius charge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia\r\nto Agamemnon? Ulysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all\r\nthat he said to you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while\r\nbeating up recruits throughout all Achaea, and when we got there we\r\nfound Menoetius and yourself, and Achilles with you. The old knight\r\nPeleus was in the outer court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a\r\nheifer to Jove the lord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in\r\nhis hand from which he poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning\r\nsacrifice. You two were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment\r\nwe stood at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us\r\nby the hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us such\r\nhospitable entertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied\r\nourselves with meat and drink, I said my say and urged both of you\r\nto join us. You were ready enough to do so, and the two old men\r\ncharged you much and straitly. Old Peleus bade his son Achilles\r\nfight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers, while Menoetius\r\nthe son of Actor spoke thus to you: \'My son,\' said he, \'Achilles is of\r\nnobler birth than you are, but you are older than he, though he is far\r\nthe better man of the two. Counsel him wisely, guide him in the\r\nright way, and he will follow you to his own profit.\' Thus did your\r\nfather charge you, but you have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, say\r\nall this to Achilles if he will listen to you. Who knows but with\r\nheaven\'s help you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend\'s\r\nadvice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his mother\r\nhas told him something from Jove, then let him send you, and let the\r\nrest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if perchance you may bring\r\nlight and saving to the Danaans. And let him send you into battle clad\r\nin his own armour, that the Trojans may mistake you for him and\r\nleave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans may thus have time to get\r\ntheir breath, for they are hard pressed and there is little\r\nbreathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might easily drive a\r\ntired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents and ships."\r\nWith these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off\r\nrunning by the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus.\r\nWhen he had got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their\r\nplace of assembly and court of justice, with their altars dedicated to\r\nthe gods, Eurypylus son of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thigh\r\nwith an arrow, and limping out of the fight. Sweat rained from his\r\nhead and shoulders, and black blood welled from his cruel wound, but\r\nhis mind did not wander. The son of Menoetius when he saw him had\r\ncompassion upon him and spoke piteously saying, "O unhappy princes and\r\ncounsellors of the Danaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds\r\nof Troy with your fat, far from your friends and your native land?\r\nsay, noble Eurypylus, will the Achaeans be able to hold great Hector\r\nin check, or will they fall now before his spear?"\r\nWounded Eurypylus made answer, "Noble Patroclus, there is no hope\r\nleft for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they\r\nthat were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the\r\nhands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save\r\nme and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash the\r\nblack blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those\r\ngracious herbs which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles,\r\nwho was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the\r\ncentaurs. For of the physicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that\r\nthe one is lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need of\r\nhealing, while the other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain."\r\n"Hero Eurypylus," replied the brave son of Menoetius, "how may these\r\nthings be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble\r\nAchilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so I\r\nwill not be unmindful your distress."\r\nWith this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,\r\nand a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground for\r\nhim to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp\r\narrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with\r\nwarm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his\r\nhands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which\r\nkilled all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off\r\nflowing.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"\t\t\tBOOK XII\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'SO THE son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus\r\nwithin the tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately,\r\nnor were the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in\r\ncheck longer. They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug\r\nthe trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and the\r\nrich spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs\r\nto the gods. It had been built without the consent of the immortals,\r\nand therefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles\r\nnursed his anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken,\r\nthe great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of the\r\nTrojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some were\r\nyet left alive when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenth\r\nyear, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their own\r\ncountry- then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall, and\r\nthey turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount Ida into\r\nthe sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus,\r\nand goodly Scamander, with Simois, where many a shield and helm had\r\nfallen, and many a hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust.\r\nPhoebus Apollo turned the mouths of all these rivers together and made\r\nthem flow for nine days against the wall, while Jove rained the\r\nwhole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune himself,\r\ntrident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea all the\r\nfoundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid with so\r\nmuch toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont,\r\nand then when he had swept the wall away he spread a great beach of\r\nsand over the place where it had been. This done he turned the\r\nrivers back into their old courses.\r\nThis was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as\r\nyet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its\r\ntimbers rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed\r\nby the scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of\r\nHector the mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought with\r\nthe force and fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns\r\nfiercely on the dogs and men that attack him, while these form solid\r\nwall and shower their javelins as they face him- his courage is all\r\nundaunted, but his high spirit will be the death of him; many a time\r\ndoes he charge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall back\r\nas often as he does so- even so did Hector go about among the host\r\nexhorting his men, and cheering them on to cross the trench.\r\nBut the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink,\r\nfor the width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor cross\r\nit, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above\r\nwhich there were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had\r\nplanted so close and strong as a defence against all who would\r\nassail it; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw his\r\nchariot after him, but those who were on foot kept trying their very\r\nutmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hector and said, "Hector, and you\r\nother captains of the Trojans and allies, it is madness for us to\r\ntry and drive our horses across the trench; it will be very hard to\r\ncross, for it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the\r\nwall. Our horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no\r\nuse if they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to\r\nharm. If, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in his\r\nanger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly see\r\nthem perish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rally\r\nand we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench\r\nthere will be not so much as a man get back to the city to tell the\r\ntale. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires hold our\r\nhorses by the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, clad\r\nin full armour, and if the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeans\r\nwill not be able to withstand us."\r\nThus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in\r\nfull armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they saw\r\nhim do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses\r\nover to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at the\r\ntrench. Then they formed themselves into companies, made themselves\r\nready, and in five bodies followed their leaders. Those that went with\r\nHector and Polydamas were the bravest and most in number, and the most\r\ndetermined to break through the wall and fight at the ships. Cebriones\r\nwas also joined with them as third in command, for Hector had left his\r\nchariot in charge of a less valiant soldier. The next company was\r\nled by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus and\r\nDeiphobus, two sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius-\r\nAsius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed\r\nthat comes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe.\r\nAeneas the valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons\r\nof Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts of\r\nwar. Sarpedon was captain over the allies, and took with him Glaucus\r\nand Asteropaeus whom he deemed most valiant after himself- for he\r\nwas far the best man of them all. These helped to array one another in\r\ntheir ox-hide shields, and then charged straight at the Danaans, for\r\nthey felt sure that they would not hold out longer and that they\r\nshould themselves now fall upon the ships.\r\nThe rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel of\r\nPolydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would not leave his horses and his\r\nesquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with him\r\ntowards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in\r\nconsequence. Nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exulting\r\nin his chariot and his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened\r\nname had overshadowed him and he had fallen by the spear of\r\nIdomeneus the noble son of Deucalion. He had driven towards the left\r\nwing of the ships, by which way the Achaeans used to return with their\r\nchariots and horses from the plain. Hither he drove and found the\r\ngates with their doors opened wide, and the great bar down- for the\r\ngatemen kept them open so as to let those of their comrades enter\r\nwho might be flying towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did he\r\ndirect his horses, and his men followed him with a loud cry, for\r\nthey felt sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and that\r\nthey should now fall upon the ships. Little did they know that at\r\nthe gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sons\r\nof the fighting Lapithae- the one, Polypoetes, mighty son of\r\nPirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous Mars. These stood\r\nbefore the gates like two high oak trees upon the mountains, that\r\ntower from their wide-spreading roots, and year after year battle with\r\nwind and rain- even so did these two men await the onset of great\r\nAsius confidently and without flinching. The Trojans led by him and by\r\nIamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius, Thoon and Oenomaus,\r\nraised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the wall, holding\r\ntheir shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for a while the two\r\ndefenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm in\r\nthe defence of their ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojans\r\nwere attacking the wall, while the Danaans were crying out for help\r\nand being routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gates\r\nlike two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attack of men\r\nand dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all round\r\nthem tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the clattering of\r\ntheir tusks, till some one hits them and makes an end of them- even so\r\ndid the gleaming bronze rattle about their breasts, as the weapons\r\nfell upon them; for they fought with great fury, trusting to their own\r\nprowess and to those who were on the wall above them. These threw\r\ngreat stones at their assailants in defence of themselves their\r\ntents and their ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes of snow\r\nwhich some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down\r\nin sheets upon the earth- even so fell the weapons from the hands\r\nalike of Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the great\r\nstones rained upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus in his dismay\r\ncried aloud and smote his two thighs. "Father Jove," he cried, "of a\r\ntruth you too are altogether given to lying. I made sure the Argive\r\nheroes could not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted wasps, or\r\nbees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside- they leave not\r\nthe holes wherein they have built undefended, but fight for their\r\nlittle ones against all who would take them- even so these men, though\r\nthey be but two, will not be driven from the gates, but stand firm\r\neither to slay or be slain."\r\nHe spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then\r\nwas to give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans were\r\nfighting about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to\r\ntell about all these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the\r\nstone wall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though\r\nthey were, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who\r\nwere defending the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae\r\nkept on fighting with might and main.\r\nThereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a\r\nspear upon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him,\r\nfor the point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so\r\nthat the brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. He\r\nthen slew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killed\r\nHippomachus the son of Antimachus by striking him with his spear\r\nupon the girdle. He then drew his sword and sprang first upon\r\nAntiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face upwards on\r\nthe earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laid\r\nthem low one after the other.\r\nWhile they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the\r\nyouths who were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were the\r\ngreater part and the most valiant of those that were trying to break\r\nthrough the wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the\r\ntrench, uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a sign from\r\nheaven when they had essayed to cross it- a soaring eagle that flew\r\nskirting the left wing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snake\r\nin its talons still alive and struggling to escape. The snake was\r\nstill bent on revenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it\r\nstruck the bird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird\r\nbeing in pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host,\r\nand then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were\r\nstruck with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing\r\nJove, writhing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hector\r\nand said, "Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke\r\nme, even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth,\r\nthat one of the people should cross your will either in the field or\r\nat the council board; you would have them support you always:\r\nnevertheless I will say what I think will be best; let us not now go\r\non to fight the Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen if\r\nthis soaring eagle which skirted the left wing of our with a monstrous\r\nblood-red snake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was really\r\nsent as an omen to the Trojans on their essaying to cross the\r\ntrench. The eagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it\r\nhome to her little ones, and so will it be- with ourselves; even\r\nthough by a mighty effort we break through the gates and wall of the\r\nAchaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return in\r\ngood order by the way we came, but shall leave many a man behind us\r\nwhom the Achaeans will do to death in defence of their ships. Thus\r\nwould any seer who was expert in these matters, and was trusted by the\r\npeople, read the portent."\r\nHector looked fiercely at him and said, "Polydamas, I like not of\r\nyour reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.\r\nIf, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven\r\nrobbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the\r\ncounsels of Jove, nor to the promises he made me- and he bowed his\r\nhead in confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of\r\nwild-fowl. What care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, and\r\nwhether they be on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trust\r\nrather in the counsel of great Jove, king of mortals and immortals.\r\nThere is one omen, and one only- that a man should fight for his\r\ncountry. Why are you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at the\r\nships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you\r\nare not steadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or would\r\ntalk others over from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my\r\nspear."\r\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after\r\nwith a cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent the\r\nblast of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust\r\ndown towards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, and\r\ngave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their\r\nown might and to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break through\r\nthe great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks from\r\nthe walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved the\r\nbuttresses, which the Achaeans had set in front of the wall in order\r\nto support it; when they had pulled these down they made sure of\r\nbreaking through the wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign of\r\ngiving ground; they still fenced the battlements with their shields of\r\nox-hide, and hurled their missiles down upon the foe as soon as any\r\ncame below the wall.\r\nThe two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the\r\nAchaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any\r\none whom they saw to be remiss. "My friends," they cried, "Argives one\r\nand all- good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet, in\r\nwhich all were of equal prowess- there is now work enough, as you very\r\nwell know, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flight\r\ntowards the ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press\r\nforward and keep one another in heart, if it may so be that Olympian\r\nJove the lord of lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and\r\ndrive them back towards the city."\r\nThus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on.\r\nAs the flakes that fall thick upon a winter\'s day, when Jove is minded\r\nto snow and to display these his arrows to mankind- he lulls the\r\nwind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of\r\nthe high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy\r\nplains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the\r\nforelands, and havens of the grey sea, but the waves as they come\r\nrolling in stay it that it can come no further, though all else is\r\nwrapped as with a mantle so heavy are the heavens with snow- even thus\r\nthickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, some\r\nthrown at the Trojans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and\r\nthe whole wall was in an uproar.\r\nStill the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down\r\nthe gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon\r\nagainst the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle.\r\nBefore him he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith had\r\nbeaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which he had\r\nmade fast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in\r\nfront of him, and brandishing his two spears came on like some lion of\r\nthe wilderness, who has been long famished for want of meat and will\r\ndare break even into a well-fenced homestead to try and get at the\r\nsheep. He may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks\r\nwith dogs and spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from the\r\nfold till he has had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheep\r\nand carry it off, or be hit by a spear from strong hand- even so was\r\nSarpedon fain to attack the wall and break down its battlements.\r\nThen he said to Glaucus son of Hippolochus, "Glaucus, why in Lycia\r\ndo we receive especial honour as regards our place at table? Why are\r\nthe choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why do\r\nmen look up to us as though we were gods? Moreover we hold a large\r\nestate by the banks of the river Xanthus, fair with orchard lawns\r\nand wheat-growing land; it becomes us, therefore, to take our stand at\r\nthe head of all the Lycians and bear the brunt of the fight, that\r\none may say to another, Our princes in Lycia eat the fat of the land\r\nand drink best of wine, but they are fine fellows; they fight well and\r\nare ever at the front in battle.\' My good friend, if, when we were\r\nonce out of this fight, we could escape old age and death\r\nthenceforward and for ever, I should neither press forward myself\r\nnor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever over\r\nour heads, and no man can elude him; therefore let us go forward and\r\neither win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another."\r\nGlaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host of\r\nLycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them, for\r\nit was against his part of the wall that they came- bringing\r\ndestruction with them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain\r\nto support his comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the\r\nfray, and Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them;\r\nbut he could not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an\r\nuproar was there from crashing shields and helmets and the battering\r\nof gates with a din which reached the skies. For all the gates had\r\nbeen closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and break\r\ntheir way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a\r\nmessage to Ajax. "Run, good Thootes," said and call Ajax, or better\r\nstill bid both come, for it will be all over with us here directly;\r\nthe leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought\r\ndesperately heretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to let\r\nthem come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer\r\nthe famous bowman come with him."\r\nThe messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall\r\nof the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, "Sirs,\r\nprinces of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to him\r\nfor a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or it\r\nwill be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians are\r\nupon him, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you have\r\ntoo much on your hands to let both come, at any rate let Ajax son of\r\nTelamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with him."\r\nGreat Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke to\r\nthe son of Oileus. "Ajax," said he, "do you two, yourself and brave\r\nLycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their\r\nhardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but I\r\nwill come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help they\r\nneed."\r\nWith this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother by\r\nthe same father went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer\'s bow. They\r\nwent along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where\r\nMenestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave\r\ncaptains and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements as\r\nit were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising\r\nthe battle-cry aloud.\r\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of\r\nSarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the\r\nbattlements at the very top of the wall. As men now are, even one\r\nwho is in the bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his two\r\nhands, but Ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashing\r\nEpicles\' four-crested helmet so that the bones of his head were\r\ncrushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though he were\r\ndiving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus the\r\nbrave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on to attack the wall. He\r\nsaw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucus\r\nleave off fighting. Thereon he sprang covertly down for fear some of\r\nthe Achaeans might see that he was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was\r\nstung with grief when he saw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave\r\noff fighting, but aimed his spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor and\r\nhit him. He drew his spear back again Alcmaon came down headlong after\r\nit with his bronzed armour rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized\r\nthe battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it an gave\r\nway together, and a breach was made through which many might pass.\r\nAjax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him\r\nwith an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body,\r\nbut Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall by\r\nthe ships\' sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his\r\nshield, but the spear did not go clean through, though it hustled\r\nhim back that he could come on no further. He therefore retired a\r\nlittle space from the battlement, yet without losing all his ground,\r\nfor he still thought to cover himself with glory. Then he turned round\r\nand shouted to the brave Lycians saying, "Lycians, why do you thus\r\nfail me? For all my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open a\r\nway to the ships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for the\r\nmore there are of us the better."\r\nThe Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who\r\nwas their counsellor their king. The Argives on their part got their\r\nmen in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly struggle\r\nbetween them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and force\r\ntheir way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians from\r\nthe wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods\r\nin hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own in\r\ncommon, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a mere\r\nstrip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone of\r\ncontention, and they beat one another\'s round shields for their\r\npossession. Many a man\'s body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as\r\nhe turned round and bared his back to the foe, and many were struck\r\nclean through their shields; the wall and battlements were\r\neverywhere deluged with the blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans.\r\nBut even so the Trojans could not rout the Achaeans, who still held\r\non; and as some honest hard-working woman weighs wool in her balance\r\nand sees that the scales be true, for she would gain some pitiful\r\nearnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced evenly\r\nbetween them till the time came when Jove gave the greater glory to\r\nHector son of Priam, who was first to spring towards the wall of the\r\nAchaeans. As he did so, he cried aloud to the Trojans, "Up, Trojans,\r\nbreak the wall of the Argives, and fling fire upon their ships."\r\nThus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at\r\nthe wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with\r\nsharp spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just\r\noutside the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other;\r\ntwo of the best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise it\r\nfrom the ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it\r\nquite easily by himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made it\r\nlight for him. As a shepherd picks up a ram\'s fleece with one hand and\r\nfinds it no burden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone and\r\ndrive it right at the doors that closed the gates so strong and so\r\nfirmly set. These doors were double and high, and were kept closed\r\nby two cross-bars to which there was but one key. When he had got\r\nclose up to them, Hector strode towards them that his blow might\r\ngain in force and struck them in the middle, leaning his whole\r\nweight against them. He broke both hinges, and the stone fell inside\r\nby reason of its great weight. The portals re-echoed with the sound,\r\nthe bars held no longer, and the doors flew open, one one way, and the\r\nother the other, through the force of the blow. Then brave Hector\r\nleaped inside with a face as dark as that of flying night. The\r\ngleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had tow\r\nspears in his hand. None but a god could have withstood him as he\r\nflung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire. Then he\r\nturned round towards the Trojans and called on them to scale the wall,\r\nand they did as he bade them- some of them at once climbing over the\r\nwall, while others passed through the gates. The Danaans then fled\r\npanic-stricken towards their ships, and all was uproar and confusion.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XIII\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NOW when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the\r\nships, he left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen\r\neyes away, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace,\r\nthe Mysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who\r\nlive on milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind. He no longer\r\nturned so much as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that any\r\nof the immortals would go and help either Trojans or Danaans.\r\nBut King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking\r\nadmiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded\r\nSamothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and\r\nthe ships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken\r\nhis place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome\r\nby the Trojans; and he was furiously angry with Jove.\r\nPresently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as\r\nhe strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath\r\nthe tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the\r\nfourth he reached his goal- Aegae, where is his glittering golden\r\npalace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there,\r\nhe yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all\r\nflying in the wind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped his\r\ngold whip, and took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his way\r\nover the waves the sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew\r\ntheir lord, and came gambolling round him from every quarter of the\r\ndeep, while the sea in her gladness opened a path before his\r\nchariot. So lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the car\r\nwas not even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him\r\nto the ships of the Achaeans.\r\nNow there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway\r\nbetween Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the\r\nearthquake stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them\r\ntheir ambrosial forage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold\r\nwhich none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay\r\nthere in that place until their lord should return. This done he\r\nwent his way to the host of the Achaeans.\r\nNow the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a\r\nstorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising\r\nthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of the\r\nAchaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there.\r\nMeanwhile earth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on\r\nthe Argives, for he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the\r\nform and voice of Calchas.\r\nFirst he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,\r\nand said, "Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you\r\nwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I am\r\nnot afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force, will\r\nbe victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of them\r\nin check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here where\r\nfurious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, is\r\nleading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it\r\ninto your hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do\r\nthe like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even though\r\nhe be inspired by Jove himself."\r\nAs he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck\r\nboth of them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring.\r\nHe made their legs light and active, as also their hands and their\r\nfeet. Then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some\r\nsheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase some bird over the\r\nplain, even so did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into\r\nthe air and leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the\r\nfirst to know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said to\r\nAjax son of Telamon, "Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on\r\nOlympus, who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard\r\nby our ships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew\r\nhim at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods\r\nare soon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn more\r\nfiercely within me, while my hands and my feet under me are more eager\r\nfor the fray."\r\nAnd Ajax son of Telamon answered, "I too feel my hands grasp my\r\nspear more firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble;\r\nI long, moreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in\r\nsingle combat."\r\nThus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with\r\nwhich the god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused\r\nthe Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at\r\nonce by hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans had\r\ngot over the wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as\r\nthey beheld them, for they made sure that they should not escape\r\ndestruction; but the lord of the earthquake passed lightly about among\r\nthem and urged their battalions to the front.\r\nFirst he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and\r\nThoas and Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors;\r\nall did he exhort. "Shame on you young Argives," he cried, "it was\r\non your prowess I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not\r\nwith might and main, this very day will see us overcome by the\r\nTrojans. Of a truth my eyes behold a great and terrible portent\r\nwhich I had never thought to see- the Trojans at our ships- they,\r\nwho were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and\r\nwolves in a forest, with no strength but in flight for they cannot\r\ndefend themselves. Hitherto the Trojans dared not for one moment\r\nface the attack of the Achaeans, but now they have sallied far from\r\ntheir city and are fighting at our very ships through the cowardice of\r\nour leader and the disaffection of the people themselves, who in their\r\ndiscontent care not to fight in defence of the ships but are being\r\nslaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus is the cause\r\nof our disaster by having insulted the son of Peleus, still this is no\r\nreason why we should leave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal,\r\nfor the hearts of the brave heal quickly. You do ill to be thus\r\nremiss, you, who are the finest soldiers in our whole army. I blame no\r\nman for keeping out of battle if he is a weakling, but I am\r\nindignant with such men as you are. My good friends, matters will soon\r\nbecome even worse through this slackness; think, each one of you, of\r\nhis own honour and credit, for the hazard of the fight is extreme.\r\nGreat Hector is now fighting at our ships; he has broken through the\r\ngates and the strong bolt that held them."\r\nThus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them\r\non. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men,\r\nof whom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make\r\nlight if they went among them, for they were the picked men of all\r\nthose who were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans.\r\nThey made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to\r\nbuckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests on\r\ntheir gleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward,\r\nso closely seffied were they; the spears they brandished in their\r\nstrong hands were interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle.\r\nThe Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head\r\npressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of\r\nsome mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the\r\nfoundations of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain,\r\nand as it bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an\r\nuproar; it swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level\r\nground, but then for all its fury it can go no further- even so easily\r\ndid Hector for a while seem as though he would career through the\r\ntents and ships of the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in his\r\nmurderous course; but the closely serried battalions stayed him when\r\nhe reached them, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him with\r\nswords and spears pointed at both ends, and drove him from them so\r\nthat he staggered and gave ground; thereon he shouted to the\r\nTrojans, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close\r\ncombat, stand firm: the Achaeans have set themselves as a wall against\r\nme, but they will not check me for long; they will give ground\r\nbefore me if the mightiest of the gods, the thundering spouse of Juno,\r\nhas indeed inspired my onset."\r\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus\r\nson of Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with\r\nhis round shield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly\r\nforward. Meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit\r\nthe broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the\r\nspear broke in two pieces long ere he could do so; moreover\r\nDeiphobus had seen it coming and had held his shield well away from\r\nhim. Meriones drew back under cover of his comrades, angry alike at\r\nhaving failed to vanquish Deiphobus, and having broken his spear. He\r\nturned therefore towards the ships and tents to fetch a spear which he\r\nhad left behind in his tent.\r\nThe others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into\r\nthe heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man, to\r\nwit, the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the\r\nAchaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste a\r\nbastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet he\r\nhad gone back to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans,\r\ndwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honour with his own\r\nsons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spear\r\nwhich he then drew back again, and Imbrius fell headlong as an\r\nash-tree when it is felled on the crest of some high mountain\r\nbeacon, and its delicate green foliage comes toppling down to the\r\nground. Thus did he fall with his bronze-dight armour ringing\r\nharshly round him, and Teucer sprang forward with intent to strip\r\nhim of his armour; but as he was doing so, Hector took aim at him with\r\na spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit\r\nAmphimachus, son of Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he was\r\ncoming into battle, and his armour rang rattling round him as he\r\nfell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang forward to take\r\nAmphimachus\'s helmet from off his temples, and in a moment Ajax\r\nthrew a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased all\r\nover in his terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of\r\nhis shield with such force as to drive him back from the two\r\ncorpses, which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus,\r\ncaptains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the host of the\r\nAchaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the like by\r\nImbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that have it in\r\ntheir fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high above the ground\r\nin their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrius, and\r\nstrip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus severed the head from\r\nthe neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus, and sent it whirling\r\nover the crowd as though it had been a ball, till fell in the dust\r\nat Hector\'s feet.\r\nNeptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should\r\nhave fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the\r\nAchaeans to urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the\r\nTrojans. Idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who\r\nhad just come to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His\r\nfellow-soldiers bore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given\r\norders to the physicians went on to his tent, for he was still\r\nthirsting for battle. Neptune spoke in the likeness and with the voice\r\nof Thoas son of Andraemon who ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron and\r\nhigh Calydon, and was honoured among his people as though he were a\r\ngod. "Idomeneus," said he, "lawgiver to the Cretans, what has now\r\nbecome of the threats with which the sons of the Achaeans used to\r\nthreaten the Trojans?"\r\nAnd Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, "Thoas, no one, so\r\nfar as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held back\r\nneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty Jove\r\nthat the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos: you,\r\nThoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart if you\r\nsee any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do\r\ntheir utmost."\r\nTo this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, "Idomeneus,\r\nmay he never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten\r\nupon, who is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour\r\nand go, we must make all haste together if we may be of any use,\r\nthough we are only two. Even cowards gain courage from\r\ncompanionship, and we two can hold our own with the bravest."\r\nTherewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and\r\nIdomeneus when he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped\r\nhis two spears, and sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of\r\nSaturn brandishes from bright Olympus when he would show a sign to\r\nmortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide- even so did his armour\r\ngleam about him as he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire met him while he\r\nwas still near his tent (for he was going to fetch his spear) and\r\nIdomeneus said\r\n"Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left\r\nthe field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting\r\nyou? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had\r\nfar rather fight than stay in my tent."\r\n"Idomeneus," answered Meriones, "I come for a spear, if I can find\r\none in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the\r\nshield of Deiphobus."\r\nAnd Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, "You will find one\r\nspear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall of\r\nmy tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I am\r\nnot one to keep my enemy at arm\'s length; therefore I have spears,\r\nbossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets."\r\nThen Meriones said, "I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils\r\ntaken from the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all\r\ntimes valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my\r\nown among the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do\r\nnot know how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself."\r\nIdomeneus answered, "I know you for a brave man: you need not tell\r\nme. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush-\r\nand there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; it\r\ncomes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change\r\ncolour at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps\r\nshifting his weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart\r\nbeats fast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of\r\nhis teeth; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be on\r\nfinding himself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go into\r\naction- if the best men were being chosen for such a service, no one\r\ncould make light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck\r\nby a dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind,\r\nin your neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or\r\nbelly as you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks.\r\nBut let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill\r\nspoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once."\r\nOn this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself a\r\nspear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great\r\ndeeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and his\r\nson Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror even\r\ninto the heart of a hero- the pair have gone from Thrace to arm\r\nthemselves among the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they will\r\nnot listen to both the contending hosts, and will give victory to\r\none side or to the other- even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captains\r\nof men, go out to battle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones was\r\nfirst to speak. "Son of Deucalion," said he, "where would you have\r\nus begin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or on\r\nthe left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?"\r\nIdomeneus answered, "There are others to defend the centre- the\r\ntwo Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans,\r\nand is good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son\r\nof Priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to\r\nvanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of\r\nSaturn fling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son\r\nof Telamon will yield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the\r\ngrain of Ceres, if bronze and great stones can overthrow him. He would\r\nnot yield even to Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness\r\nof foot there is none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the\r\nleft wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory\r\nto some other, or he to us."\r\nMeriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to the\r\npart of the host which Idomeneus had named.\r\nNow when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire,\r\nhim and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted\r\nand made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight\r\nraged under the ships\' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle\r\nupon a day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it\r\ninto a thick cloud- even such was the fury of the combat, and might\r\nand main did they hack at each other with spear and sword throughout\r\nthe host. The field bristled with the long and deadly spears which\r\nthey bore. Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their\r\nfresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they joined\r\nbattle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage who could\r\ntake pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look on it without\r\nbeing dismayed.\r\nThus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal\r\nheroes. Jove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to\r\nHector, so as to do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did\r\nnot mean to utterly overthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and\r\nonly wanted to glorify Thetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the\r\nother hand went about among the Argives to incite them, having come up\r\nfrom the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing them\r\nvanquished by the Trojans, and was furiously angry with Jove. Both\r\nwere of the same race and country, but Jove was elder born and knew\r\nmore, therefore Neptune feared to defend the Argives openly, but in\r\nthe likeness of man, he kept on encouraging them throughout their\r\nhost. Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of war and battle,\r\nthat none could unloose or break, and set both sides tugging at it, to\r\nthe failing of men\'s knees beneath them.\r\nAnd now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,\r\ncalled loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he\r\nleaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner,\r\nwho had but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra\r\nthe fairest of Priam\'s daughters in marriage, but offered no gifts\r\nof wooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would\r\ndrive the sons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priam\r\nhad given his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on\r\nthe strength of the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed a\r\nspear, and hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze did\r\nnot protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell\r\nheavily to the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying,\r\n"Othryoneus, there is no one in the world whom I shall admire more\r\nthan I do you, if you indeed perform what you have promised Priam\r\nson of Dardanus in return for his daughter. We too will make you an\r\noffer; we will give you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus,\r\nand will bring her from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack the\r\ngoodly city of Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along with me,\r\nthat we may make a covenant at the ships about the marriage, and we\r\nwill not be hard upon you about gifts of wooing."\r\nWith this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick\r\nof the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in front\r\nof his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he\r\ncould feel their \'breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike\r\ndown Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his\r\nspear in the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean\r\nthrough it. He fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights\r\nhave felled for ship\'s timber upon the mountains with whetted axes-\r\neven thus did he lie full length in front of his chariot and horses,\r\ngrinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained just. His\r\ncharioteer was struck with panic and did not dare turn his horses\r\nround and escape: thereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of his\r\nbody with a spear; his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and\r\nthe spear stuck in his belly. He fell gasping from his chariot and\r\nAntilochus great Nestor\'s son, drove his horses from the Trojans to\r\nthe Achaeans.\r\nDeiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and\r\ntook aim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and\r\navoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore- a\r\nshield of oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He\r\ncrouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the\r\nshield rang out as the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in\r\nvain from the strong hand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor son\r\nof Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the liver under the midriff,\r\nand his limbs failed beneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried\r\nwith a loud voice saying, "Of a truth Asius has not fallen\r\nunavenied; he will be glad even while passing into the house of Hades,\r\nstrong warden of the gate, that I have sent some one to escort him."\r\nThus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble\r\nAntilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him\r\nforget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and\r\ncovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades,\r\nMecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor stooped down, and bore him away\r\ngroaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He\r\nkept on striving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in the\r\ndarkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil day\r\nfrom the Achaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes: he was\r\nson-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia\r\nwho was the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her\r\ngeneration in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore\r\nthe bravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife- him did Neptune lay\r\nlow by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding his\r\nstrong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one\r\nside, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus\r\nstruck him with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail\r\nthat had hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang\r\nharshly as the spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground,\r\nand the spear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the\r\nbutt-end of the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life.\r\nIdomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,\r\n"Deiphobus, since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now\r\nthat we have killed three men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight\r\nwith me yourself, that you may learn what manner of Jove-begotten\r\nman am I that have come hither. Jove first begot Minos chief ruler\r\nin Crete, and Minos in his turn begot a son, noble Deucalion;\r\nDeucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men in Crete, and my\r\nships have now brought me hither, to be the bane of yourself, your\r\nfather, and the Trojans."\r\nThus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go\r\nback and fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the\r\nchallenge single-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch\r\nAeneas, whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been\r\naggrieved with Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did not\r\ngive him his due share of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said,\r\n"Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship,\r\nhelp me now to defend the body of your sister\'s husband; come with\r\nme to the rescue of Alcathous, who being husband to your sister\r\nbrought you up when you were a child in his house, and now Idomeneus\r\nhas slain him."\r\nWith these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in\r\npursuit of Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneus\r\nwas not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his\r\nground as a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming\r\nof a great crowd of men in some lonely place- the bristles stand\r\nupright on his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in\r\nhis eagerness to defend himself against hounds and men- even so did\r\nfamed Idomeneus hold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas.\r\nHe cried aloud to his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus,\r\nDeipyrus, Meriones, and Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers-\r\n"Hither my friends," he cried, "and leave me not single-handed- I go\r\nin great fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a\r\nredoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the flower of\r\nyouth when a man\'s strength is greatest; if I was of the same age as\r\nhe is and in my present mind, either he or I should soon bear away the\r\nprize of victory\r\nOn this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on\r\nshoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking\r\ntowards Deiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of the\r\nTrojans along with himself, and the people followed them as sheep\r\nfollow the ram when they go down to drink after they have been\r\nfeeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad- even so was the\r\nheart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him.\r\nThen they fought furiously in close combat about the body of\r\nAlcathous, wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about\r\ntheir bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the\r\npress of the fight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers\r\nof Mars, outxied every one in their desire to hack at each other\r\nwith sword and spear. Aeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on\r\nthe lookout and avoided the spear, so that it sped from Aeneas\' strong\r\nhand in vain, and fell quivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile\r\nsmote Oenomaus in the middle of his belly, and broke the plate of\r\nhis corslet, whereon his bowels came gushing out and he clutched the\r\nearth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.\r\nIdomeneus drew his spear out of the body, but could not strip him of\r\nthe rest of his armour for the rain of darts that were showered upon\r\nhim: moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him so that he\r\ncould no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to recover\r\nhis own weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was aimed at him;\r\ntherefore, though he still defended himself in hand-to-hand fight, his\r\nheavy feet could not bear him swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobus\r\naimed a spear at him as he was retreating slowly from the field, for\r\nhis bitterness against him was as fierce as ever, but again he\r\nmissed him, and hit Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; the spear went\r\nthrough his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in the palms of his\r\nhands as he fell sprawling in the dust.\r\nGrim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen,\r\nfor he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the golden\r\nclouds, by command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting,\r\nforbidden to take part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously\r\nabout the body. Deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but\r\nMeriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the arm with a spear so\r\nthat the visored helmet fell from his hand and came ringing down\r\nupon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew\r\nthe spear from his shoulder, and fell back under cover of his men.\r\nThen Polites, own brother of Deiphobus passed his arms around his\r\nwaist, and bore him away from the battle till he got to his horses\r\nthat were standing in the rear of the fight with the chariot and their\r\ndriver. These took him towards the city groaning and in great pain,\r\nwith the blood flowing from his arm.\r\nThe others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven\r\nwithout ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and\r\nstruck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards him;\r\nhis head fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down along\r\nwith him, and death, life\'s foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied\r\nhis chance, flew forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was\r\nturning round. He laid open the vein that runs all the way up the back\r\nto the neck; he cut this vein clean away throughout its whole\r\ncourse, and Thoon fell in the dust face upwards, stretching out his\r\nhands imploringly towards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and\r\nstripped the armour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as\r\nhe did so. The Trojans came about him on every side and struck his\r\nbroad and gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune\r\nstood guard over the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thickly\r\nround him. He was never clear of the foe, but was always in the\r\nthick of the fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it\r\nin every direction, so eager was he to hit some one from a distance or\r\nto fight him hand to hand.\r\nAs he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas son\r\nof Asius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the\r\nmiddle of his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for\r\nhe grudged him the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the\r\nspear stuck fast like a charred stake in Antilochus\'s shield, while\r\nthe other lay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of\r\nhis men, but Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway\r\nbetween the private parts and the navel, where a wound is particualrly\r\npainful to wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he\r\nwrithed convulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain\r\nherdsmen have bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce.\r\nEven so did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very long,\r\ntill Meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes\r\nwere veiled in darkness.\r\nHelenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting\r\nhim on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his\r\nhead; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were\r\nfighting on the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his\r\nfeet, but the eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.\r\nOn this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,\r\nbrandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two\r\nattacked one another at one and the same moment, the one with his\r\nspear, and the other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit\r\nthe breastplate of Menelaus\'s corslet, but the arrow glanced from\r\noff it. As black beans or pulse come pattering down on to a\r\nthreshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds\r\nand shaken by the shovel- even so did the arrow glance off and\r\nrecoil from the shield of Menelaus, who in his turn wounded the hand\r\nwith which Helenus carried his bow; the spear went right through his\r\nhand and stuck in the bow itself, so that to his life he retreated\r\nunder cover of his men, with his hand dragging by his side- for the\r\nspear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out and bound the hand\r\ncarefully up in a woollen sling which his esquire had with him.\r\nPisander then made straight at Menelaus- his evil destiny luring him\r\non to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus. When\r\nthe two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus turned\r\naside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield of\r\nbrave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the\r\nspear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure of\r\nvictory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and\r\nsprang upon him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with\r\nits long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under\r\nhis shield, and the two made at one another. Pisander struck the\r\npeak of Menelaus\'s crested helmet just under the crest itself, and\r\nMenelaus hit Pisander as he was coming towards him, on the forehead,\r\njust at the rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his two\r\ngore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards\r\nto the ground, and Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his\r\narmour, and vaunted over him saying, "Even thus shall you Trojans\r\nleave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle\r\nthough you be: nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shame\r\nwhich you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are,\r\nyou feared not the anger of dread Jove, avenger of violated\r\nhospitality, who will one day destroy your city; you stole my wedded\r\nwife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were her guest,\r\nand now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. A\r\nday will come when, rage as you may, you shall be stayed. O father\r\nJove, you, who they say art above all both gods and men in wisdom, and\r\nfrom whom all things that befall us do proceed, how can you thus\r\nfavour the Trojans- men so proud and overweening, that they are\r\nnever tired of fighting? All things pall after a while- sleep, love,\r\nsweet song, and stately dance- still these are things of which a man\r\nwould surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of\r\nbattle that the Trojans are insatiate."\r\nSo saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body\r\nof Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged\r\nhimself among those who were in the front of the fight.\r\nHarpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come\r\nto fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home\r\nagain. He struck the middle of Menelaus\'s shield with his spear but\r\ncould not pierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his\r\nmen, looking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. But\r\nMeriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the\r\nfield, and hit him on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone\r\nthrough and through, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down\r\nwhere he was and breathed his last in the arms of his comrades,\r\nstretched like a worm upon the ground and watering the earth with\r\nthe blood that flowed from his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended\r\nhim with all due care; they raised him into his chariot, and bore\r\nhim sadly off to the city of Troy; his father went also with him\r\nweeping bitterly, but there was no ransom that could bring his dead\r\nson to life again.\r\nParis was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host\r\nwhen he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, in\r\norder to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, son\r\nof Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was in\r\nCorinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that it\r\nwould be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had\r\noften told him that he must either stay at home and die of a\r\nterrible disease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of\r\nthe Trojans; he chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine\r\nthe Achaeans would have laid upon him, and at the same time to\r\nescape the pain and suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the\r\njaw under his ear, whereon the life went out of him and he was\r\nenshrouded in the darkness of death.\r\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had\r\nnot yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havoc\r\nof his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere long\r\nwould have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer them\r\non and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he had first\r\nforced his way through the gates and the wall, after breaking\r\nthrough the serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the\r\nships of Ajax and Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here the\r\nwall was at its lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged most\r\nfiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics, the\r\nLocrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans\r\ncould hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor\r\ncould they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The\r\nchosen men of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus son\r\nof Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias:\r\nMeges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, while\r\nMedon and staunch Podarces led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medon\r\nwas bastard son to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace\r\naway from his own country, for he had killed the brother of his\r\nstepmother Eriopis, the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was the\r\nson of Iphiclus son of Phylacus. These two stood in the van of the\r\nPhthians, and defended the ships along with the Boeotians.\r\nAjax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son of\r\nTelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the\r\nplough which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat\r\nsteams upwards from about the roots of their horns- nothing but the\r\nyoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach the\r\nend of the field- even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to\r\nshoulder by one another. Many and brave comrades followed the son of\r\nTelamon, to relieve him of his shield when he was overcome with\r\nsweat and toil, but the Locrians did not follow so close after the son\r\nof Oileus, for they could not hold their own in a hand-to-hand\r\nfight. They had no bronze helmets with plumes of horse-hair, neither\r\nhad they shields nor ashen spears, but they had come to Troy armed\r\nwith bows, and with slings of twisted wool from which they showered\r\ntheir missiles to break the ranks of the Trojans. The others,\r\ntherefore, with their heavy armour bore the brunt of the fight with\r\nthe Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians shot from behind,\r\nunder their cover; and thus the Trojans began to lose heart, for the\r\narrows threw them into confusion.\r\nThe Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the\r\nships and tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently\r\nsaid to Hector, "Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice.\r\nBecause heaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you\r\nthink that you must therefore excel others in counsel; but you\r\ncannot thus claim preeminence in all things. Heaven has made one man\r\nan excellent soldier; of another it has made a dancer or a singer\r\nand player on the lyre; while yet in another Jove has implanted a wise\r\nunderstanding of which men reap fruit to the saving of many, and he\r\nhimself knows more about it than any one; therefore I will say what\r\nI think will be best. The fight has hemmed you in as with a circle\r\nof fire, and even now that the Trojans are within the wall some of\r\nthem stand aloof in full armour, while others are fighting scattered\r\nand outnumbered near the ships. Draw back, therefore, and call your\r\nchieftains round you, that we may advise together whether to fall\r\nnow upon the ships in the hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory,\r\nor to beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fear\r\nthat the Achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, for\r\nthere is one abiding at their ships who is never weary of battle,\r\nand who will not hold aloof much longer."\r\nThus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang\r\nin full armour from his chariot and said, "Polydamas, gather the\r\nchieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at\r\nonce when I have given them their orders."\r\nHe then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loud\r\ncry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When\r\nthey heard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas the\r\nexcellent son of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost,\r\nlooking everywhere to find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son of\r\nAsius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he\r\ncould no longer find them, for the two last were lying by the sterns\r\nof the Achaean ships, slain by the Argives, while the others had\r\nbeen also stricken and wounded by them; but upon the left wing of\r\nthe dread battle he found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen,\r\ncheering his men and urging them on to fight. He went up to him and\r\nupbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris, fair to see\r\nbut woman-mad and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King\r\nHelenus? Where are Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus?\r\nWhere too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone and will now surely fall!"\r\nAlexandrus answered, "Hector, why find fault when there is no one to\r\nfind fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather\r\nthan this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about\r\nme. From the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships we\r\nhave been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades\r\nabout whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone\r\nhave left the field, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son\r\nof Saturn saved them alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would\r\nhave us go, and we will follow with right goodwill; you shall not find\r\nus fail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no man can do\r\nmore than in him lies, no matter how willing he may be."\r\nWith these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went\r\ntowards the part of the battle where the fight was thickest, about\r\nCebriones, brave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes,\r\nPalmys, Ascanius, and Morys son of Hippotion, who had come from\r\nfertile Ascania on the preceding day to relieve other troops. Then\r\nJove urged them on to fight. They flew forth like the blasts of some\r\nfierce wind that strike earth in the van of a thunderstorm- they\r\nbuffet the salt sea into an uproar; many and mighty are the great\r\nwaves that come crashing in one after the other upon the shore with\r\ntheir arching heads all crested with foam- even so did rank behind\r\nrank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming armour follow their leaders\r\nonward. The way was led by Hector son of Priam, peer of murderous\r\nMars, with his round shield before him- his shield of ox-hides covered\r\nwith plates of bronze- and his gleaming helmet upon his temples. He\r\nkept stepping forward under cover of his shield in every direction,\r\nmaking trial of the ranks to see if they would give way be him, but he\r\ncould not daunt the courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first to\r\nstride out and challenge him. "Sir," he cried, "draw near; why do\r\nyou think thus vainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent\r\nsoldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Your\r\nheart, forsooth, is set on destroying our ships, but we too have bands\r\nthat can keep you at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner taken\r\nand sacked by ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Jove and\r\nall the gods in your flight, that your steeds may be swifter than\r\nhawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear you back to your\r\ncity."\r\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and\r\nthe host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But\r\nHector answered, "Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I\r\nwere as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with\r\nQueen Juno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with\r\nMinerva and Apollo, as I am that this day is big with the\r\ndestruction of the Achaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dare\r\nabide my spear; it shall rend your fair body and bid you glut our\r\nhounds and birds of prey with your fat and your flesh, as you fall\r\nby the ships of the Achaeans."\r\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after with a\r\ncry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argives\r\non their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their\r\nprowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan\r\nchieftains, and the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to\r\nthe brightness of Jove\'s presence.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XIV\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NESTOR was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not\r\nescape him, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, "What, noble\r\nMachaon, is the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our\r\nships grow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over\r\nyour wine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted\r\nblood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station and\r\nsee what it is all about."\r\nAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was\r\nlying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken\r\nhis father\'s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and\r\nas soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who,\r\nnow that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before the\r\nTrojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves\r\nare dumb- they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence the\r\nfierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and\r\nset neither this way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down\r\nfrom heaven to determine them- even so did the old man ponder\r\nwhether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of\r\nAgamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus;\r\nbut meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, and the\r\nhard bronze rattled on their bodies, as they thrust at one another\r\nwith their swords and spears.\r\nThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son\r\nof Atreus, fell in Nestor as they were coming up from their ships- for\r\ntheirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on,\r\nbeing on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first,\r\nwhile the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch of\r\nthe shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the\r\nships, and the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placed\r\nthe ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole\r\nopening of the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings,\r\nleaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in\r\ngreat anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with\r\ndismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him, "Nestor son of Neleus, honour\r\nto the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I\r\nfear that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among\r\nthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had fired\r\nour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all\r\ncoming true. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in anger\r\nwith me that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships."\r\nThen Nestor knight of Gerene answered, "It is indeed as you say;\r\nit is all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders\r\nfrom on high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we\r\nrelied as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The\r\nTrojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look\r\nwhere you may you cannot see from what quarter the rout of the\r\nAchaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass and the\r\nbattle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any\r\nuse, what we had better do; but I do not advise our going into\r\nbattle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is wounded."\r\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed\r\nfighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench\r\nhas served us- over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they\r\ndeemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet- I\r\nsee it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish\r\ningloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to\r\ndefend us, and I know now that he is raising the Trojans to like\r\nhonour with the gods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound hand\r\nand foot. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down\r\nthe ships that are on the beach and draw them into the water; let us\r\nmake them fast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against the\r\nfall of night- if even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting;\r\nwe may then draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in\r\nflying ruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly\r\nand be saved than be caught and killed."\r\nUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, "Son of Atreus, what are\r\nyou talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and\r\nbaser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a\r\nlife of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of us\r\nperish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win\r\nwhich we have suffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some\r\nother of the Achaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give\r\ngood counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argives\r\nshould ever have let fall from his lips. I despise your judgement\r\nutterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us draw\r\ndown our ships into the water while the battle is raging, and thus\r\nplay further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would be\r\nruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the ships\r\nbeing drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keep\r\nturning their eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain,\r\nwould be our destruction."\r\nAgamemnon answered, "Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart.\r\nI am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into\r\nthe sea whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young,\r\ncan offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear."\r\nThen said Diomed, "Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, if\r\nyou will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger\r\nthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who lies\r\nburied at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,\r\nAgrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was\r\nthe knight Oeneus, my father\'s father, and he was the most valiant\r\nof them all. Oeeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as\r\nJove and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married\r\ninto the family of Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance,\r\nfor he had large estates of rich corn-growing land, with much\r\norchard ground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelled\r\nall the Argives in the use of the spear. You must yourselves have\r\nheard whether these things are true or no; therefore when I say well\r\ndespise not my words as though I were a coward or of ignoble birth.\r\nI say, then, let us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though\r\nwe be. When there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the\r\nrange of the spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we\r\nhave already, but we can spur on others, who have been indulging their\r\nspleen and holding aloof from battle hitherto."\r\nThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,\r\nKing Agamemnon leading the way.\r\nMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them in\r\nthe semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon\'s right hand in his own\r\nand said, "Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that he\r\nsees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse-\r\nmay he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, the\r\nblessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the\r\nprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust upon\r\nthe plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents\r\ntowards their city."\r\nWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to\r\nthe plain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine\r\nor ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight,\r\nand it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war\r\nand do battle without ceasing.\r\nJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of\r\nOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at\r\nonce her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither\r\namid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the\r\ntopmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set\r\nherself to think how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed\r\nthat it would be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in rich\r\nattire, in the hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and\r\nwish to embrace her. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless\r\nsleep might be made to steal over his eyes and senses.\r\nShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made\r\nher, and the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a\r\nsecret key so that no other god could open them. Here she entered\r\nand closed the doors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her\r\nfair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil,\r\nambrosial, very soft, and scented specially for herself- if it were so\r\nmuch as shaken in the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervaded\r\nthe universe of heaven and earth. With this she anointed her\r\ndelicate skin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial locks that\r\nflowed in a stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She put\r\non the wondrous robe which Minerva had worked for her with\r\nconsummate art, and had embroidered with manifold devices; she\r\nfastened it about her bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself\r\nwith a girdle that had a hundred tassels: then she fastened her\r\nearrings, three brilliant pendants that glistened most beautifully,\r\nthrough the pierced lobes of her ears, and threw a lovely new veil\r\nover her head. She bound her sandals on to her feet, and when she\r\nhad arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction, she left her room\r\nand called Venus to come aside and speak to her. "My dear child," said\r\nshe, "will you do what I am going to ask of you, or will refuse me\r\nbecause you are angry at my being on the Danaan side, while you are on\r\nthe Trojan?"\r\nJove\'s daughter Venus answered, "Juno, august queen of goddesses,\r\ndaughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for\r\nat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all."\r\nThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, "I want you to endow me\r\nwith some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all\r\nthings mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world\'s end\r\nto visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys:\r\nthey received me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up,\r\nhaving taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn in\r\nthe depths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them that I\r\nmay make peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are so\r\nangry that they have not slept with one another this long while; if\r\nI can bring them round and restore them to one another\'s embraces,\r\nthey will be grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards."\r\nThereon laughter-loving Venus said, "I cannot and must not refuse\r\nyou, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king."\r\nAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered\r\ngirdle into which all her charms had been wrought- love, desire, and\r\nthat sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most\r\nprudent. She gave the girdle to Juno and said, "Take this girdle\r\nwherein all my charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will\r\nwear it I promise you that your errand, be it what it may, will not be\r\nbootless."\r\nWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the\r\ngirdle in her bosom.\r\nVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down\r\nfrom the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair\r\nEmathia, and went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the\r\nThracian horsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever\r\nsetting foot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the,\r\nwaves of the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas.\r\nThere she met Sleep, own brother to Death, and caught him by the hand,\r\nsaying, "Sleep, you who lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if\r\nyou ever did me a service in times past, do one for me now, and I\r\nshall be grateful to you ever after. Close Jove\'s keen eyes for me\r\nin slumber while I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give you\r\na beautiful golden seat, that can never fall to pieces; my\r\nclubfooted son Vulcan shall make it for you, and he shall give it a\r\nfootstool for you to rest your fair feet upon when you are at table."\r\nThen Sleep answered, "Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of\r\nmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without\r\ncompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all of\r\nthem proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep\r\nunless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what\r\nyou asked me, on the day when Jove\'s mighty son Hercules set sail from\r\nIlius after having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding I\r\nsuffused my sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laid\r\nhim to rest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and set\r\nthe blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took\r\nhim to the goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Jove was\r\nfurious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the\r\nhouse; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would have\r\nflung me down through space into the sea where I should never have\r\nbeen heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and gods\r\nprotected me. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me in\r\nspite of his being so angry, for he did not dare do anything to\r\ndisplease Night. And now you are again asking me to do something on\r\nwhich I cannot venture."\r\nAnd Juno said, "Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into\r\nyour head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans,\r\nas he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the\r\nyoungest of the Graces, and she shall be your own- Pasithea, whom\r\nyou have always wanted to marry."\r\nSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, "Then swear it\r\nto me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the\r\nbounteous earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all\r\nthe gods who dwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and\r\nsee that you really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces-\r\nPasithea, whom I have always wanted to marry."\r\nJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of\r\nthe nether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had\r\ncompleted her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist\r\nand sped lightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them.\r\nPresently they reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and\r\nLectum where they left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the\r\ntrees of the forest soughed under the going of their feet. Here\r\nSleep halted, and ere Jove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty\r\npine-tree- the tallest that reared its head towards heaven on all Ida.\r\nHe hid himself behind the branches and sat there in the semblance of\r\nthe sweet-singing bird that haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis\r\nby the gods, but men call it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the\r\ntopmost peak of Ida, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon\r\nher. As soon as he did so he became inflamed with the same\r\npassionate desire for her that he had felt when they had first enjoyed\r\neach other\'s embraces, and slept with one another without their dear\r\nparents knowing anything about it. He went up to her and said, "What\r\ndo you want that you have come hither from Olympus- and that too\r\nwith neither chariot nor horses to convey you?"\r\nThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, "I am going to the world\'s\r\nend, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother\r\nTethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, and\r\nbrought me up. I must go and see them that I may make peace between\r\nthem: they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have\r\nnot slept with one another this long time. The horses that will take\r\nme over land and sea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of\r\nmany-fountained Ida, and I have come here from Olympus on purpose to\r\nconsult you. I was afraid you might be angry with me later on, if I\r\nwent to the house of Oceanus without letting you know."\r\nAnd Jove said, "Juno, you can choose some other time for paying your\r\nvisit to Oceanus- for the present let us devote ourselves to love\r\nand to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so\r\noverpowered by passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at\r\nthis moment for yourself- not even when I was in love with the wife of\r\nIxion who bore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with\r\nDanae the daintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the\r\nfamed hero Perseus. Then there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore\r\nme Minos and Rhadamanthus: there was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes\r\nby whom I begot my lion-hearted son Hercules, while Semele became\r\nmother to Bacchus the comforter of mankind. There was queen Ceres\r\nagain, and lovely Leto, and yourself- but with none of these was I\r\never so much enamoured as I now am with you."\r\nJuno again answered him with a lying tale. "Most dread son of\r\nSaturn," she exclaimed, "what are you talking about? Would you have us\r\nenjoy one another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can\r\nbe seen? What if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping\r\ntogether, and tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when\r\nI had risen from your embraces I could never show myself inside your\r\nhouse again; but if you are so minded, there is a room which your\r\nson Vulcan has made me, and he has given it good strong doors; if\r\nyou would so have it, let us go thither and lie down."\r\nAnd Jove answered, "Juno, you need not be afraid that either god\r\nor man will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense\r\ngolden cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams\r\nshall not see through it."\r\nWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace;\r\nwhereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with\r\ndew-bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that\r\nit raised them well above the ground. Here they laid themselves down\r\nand overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from which\r\nthere fell glittering dew-drops.\r\nThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the\r\ncrest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his\r\nspouse in his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the\r\nAchaeans, to tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake.\r\nWhen he had found him he said, "Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans\r\nwith a will, and give them victory though it be only for a short\r\ntime while Jove is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet\r\nslumber, and Juno has beguiled him into going to bed with her."\r\nSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind,\r\nleaving Neptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted\r\nforward among the first ranks and shouted saying, "Argives, shall we\r\nlet Hector son of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and\r\ncovering himself with glory? This is what he says that he shall now\r\ndo, seeing that Achilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall get\r\non very well without him if we keep each other in heart and stand by\r\none another. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each\r\ntake the best and largest shield we can lay hold of, put on our\r\nhelmets, and sally forth with our longest spears in our hands; will\r\nlead you on, and Hector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to\r\nhold out against us. If any good staunch soldier has only a small\r\nshield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger one for\r\nhimself."\r\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of\r\nTydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the\r\nothers in array, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges\r\nof armour; the most valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse\r\nto the worse man. When they had donned their bronze armour they\r\nmarched on with Neptune at their head. In his strong hand he grasped\r\nhis terrible sword, keen of edge and flashing like lightning; woe to\r\nhim who comes across it in the day of battle; all men quake for fear\r\nand keep away from it.\r\nHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune\r\nand Hector waged fierce war on one another- Hector on the Trojan and\r\nNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces\r\nmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the\r\nAchaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when\r\ndriven before the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest\r\nfire roar more fiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor\r\ndoes the wind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through the\r\ntops of when it is blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout\r\nwhich the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.\r\nHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards\r\nhim, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands\r\npassed over his chest- the band of his shield and that of his\r\nsilver-studded sword- and these protected his body. Hector was angry\r\nthat his spear should have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under\r\ncover of his men. As he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon\r\nstruck him with a stone, of which there were many lying about under\r\nthe men\'s feet as they fought- brought there to give support to the\r\nships\' sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them\r\nand struck Hector above the rim of his shield close to his neck; the\r\nblow made him spin round like a top and reel in all directions. As\r\nan oak falls headlong when uprooted by the lightning flash of father\r\nJove, and there is a terrible smell of brimstone- no man can help\r\nbeing dismayed if he is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a\r\nvery awful thing- even so did Hector fall to earth and bite the\r\ndust. His spear fell from his hand, but his shield and helmet were\r\nmade fast about his body, and his bronze armour rang about him.\r\nThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,\r\nhoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,\r\nbut none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and\r\ncovered by the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain\r\nof the Lycians, and noble Glaucus: of the others, too, there was not\r\none who was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over\r\nhim to cover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore\r\nhim away from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting\r\nfor him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot;\r\nthese then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain.\r\nWhen they reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, begotten of\r\nImmortal Jove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on\r\nthe ground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed\r\nagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited\r\nblood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again\r\nclosed in darkness for he was still sturined by the blow.\r\nWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and\r\nset upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus\r\nbegan by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with his\r\nspear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding\r\ncattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came\r\nup to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce\r\nfight between Trojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas\r\nson of Panthous drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son of\r\nAreilycus on the right shoulder; the terrible spear went right through\r\nhis shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust.\r\nPolydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, "Again I take it that the\r\nspear has not sped in vain from the strong hand of the son of\r\nPanthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve him\r\nfor a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades."\r\nThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon\r\nwas more angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so he\r\naimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself\r\nby swerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for\r\nheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head\r\nsprings from the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed\r\nboth the tendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and\r\nnostrils reached the ground long before his legs and knees could do\r\nso, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying, "Think, Polydamas, and\r\ntell me truly whether this man is not as well worth killing as\r\nProthoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it may\r\nbe, or son of the knight Antenor, for he is very like him."\r\nBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.\r\nAcamas then bestrode his brother\'s body and wounded Promachus the\r\nBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother\'s\r\nbody away. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, "Argive archers,\r\nbraggarts that you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only,\r\nbut some of you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how\r\nPromachus now sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother\'s\r\nblood has not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful\r\nif he leaves a kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall."\r\nHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged\r\nthan any of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand\r\nhis ground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master\r\nPhorbas, whom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth\r\nthan any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos\r\nnow wounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball\r\nfrom its socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of\r\nthe neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him.\r\nPeneleos then drew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both\r\nhead and helmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear\r\nstill sticking in the eye; he then held up the head, as though it\r\nhad been a poppy-head, and showed it to the Trojans, vaunting over\r\nthem as he did so. "Trojans," he cried, "bid the father and mother\r\nof noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wife\r\nalso of Promachus son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by the\r\ncoming of her dear husband- when we Argives return with our ships from\r\nTroy."\r\nAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about to\r\nsee whither he might fly for safety.\r\nTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the\r\nArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the\r\nearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was\r\nfirst to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.\r\nAntilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys\r\nand Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son\r\nof Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank,\r\nand the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among\r\nthem; on this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where\r\nhe had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son of\r\nOileus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he\r\nto pursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XV\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'BUT when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set\r\nstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans\r\nmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear.\r\nJove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying with\r\ngolden-throned Juno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the\r\nTrojans and Achaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others\r\ndriving them pell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst.\r\nHe saw Hector lying on the ground with his comrades gathered round\r\nhim, gasping for breath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, for\r\nit was not the feeblest of the Achaeans who struck him.\r\nThe sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on\r\nJuno. "I see, Juno," said he, "you mischief- making trickster, that\r\nyour cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout\r\nof his host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will\r\nbe the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not\r\nremember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two\r\nanvils on to your feet, and bound your hands in a chain of gold\r\nwhich none might break, and you hung in mid-air among the clouds.\r\nAll the gods in Olympus were in a fury, but they could not reach you\r\nto set you free; when I caught any one of them I gripped him and\r\nhurled him from the heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to\r\nearth; yet even this did not relieve my mind from the incessant\r\nanxiety which I felt about noble Hercules whom you and Boreas had\r\nspitefully conveyed beyond the seas to Cos, after suborning the\r\ntempests; but I rescued him, and notwithstanding all his mighty\r\nlabours I brought him back again to Argos. I would remind you of\r\nthis that you may learn to leave off being so deceitful, and\r\ndiscover how much you are likely to gain by the embraces out of\r\nwhich you have come here to trick me."\r\nJuno trembled as he spoke, and said, "May heaven above and earth\r\nbelow be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and this\r\nis the most solemn oath that a blessed god can take- nay, I swear also\r\nby your own almighty head and by our bridal bed- things over which I\r\ncould never possibly perjure myself- that Neptune is not punishing\r\nHector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing of\r\nmine; it is all of his own mere motion because he was sorry to see the\r\nAchaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him, I should\r\ntell him to do as you bid him."\r\nThe sire of gods and men smiled and answered, "If you, Juno, were\r\nalways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune, like\r\nit or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. If,\r\nthen, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among the\r\nrank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the bow,\r\nthat I want them- Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tell\r\nNeptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he may\r\nsend Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he will\r\nthus forget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in\r\nconfusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus.\r\nAchilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and\r\nHector will kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain many\r\nwarriors, and among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill\r\nHector to avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it about\r\nthat the Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till\r\nthey fulfil the counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not\r\nstay my anger, nor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have\r\naccomplished the desire of the son of Peleus, according to the promise\r\nI made by bowing my head on the day when Thetis touched my knees and\r\nbesought me to give him honour."\r\nJuno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great\r\nOlympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast\r\ncontinents, and he says to himself, "Now I will be here, or there,"\r\nand he would have all manner of things- even so swiftly did Juno\r\nwing her way till she came to high Olympus and went in among the\r\ngods who were gathered in the house of Jove. When they saw her they\r\nall of them came up to her, and held out their cups to her by way of\r\ngreeting. She let the others be, but took the cup offered her by\r\nlovely Themis, who was first to come running up to her. "Juno," said\r\nshe, "why are you here? And you seem troubled- has your husband the\r\nson of Saturn been frightening you?"\r\nAnd Juno answered, "Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what\r\na proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to\r\ntable, where you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs\r\nwhich he has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be\r\nangered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting now."\r\nOn this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the\r\nhouse of Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with\r\ncare, and she spoke up in a rage. "Fools that we are," she cried,\r\n"to be thus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to\r\nhim and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and\r\ncares for nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any other\r\nof the immortals. Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he may\r\nchoose to send each one of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of\r\nthem already, for his son Ascalaphus has fallen in battle- the man\r\nwhom of all others he loved most dearly and whose father he owns\r\nhimself to be."\r\nWhen he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat of\r\nhis hands, and said in anger, "Do not blame me, you gods that dwell in\r\nheaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death of\r\nmy son, even though it end in my being struck by Jove\'s lightning\r\nand lying in blood and dust among the corpses."\r\nAs he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout,\r\nwhile he put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused to\r\nstill more fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals,\r\nhad not Minerva, ararmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her\r\nseat and hurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and the\r\nshield from his shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his\r\nstrong hand and set it on one side; then she said to Mars, "Madman,\r\nyou are undone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost all\r\njudgement and understanding; have you not heard what Juno has said\r\non coming straight from the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish\r\nto go through all kinds of suffering before you are brought back\r\nsick and sorry to Olympus, after having caused infinite mischief to\r\nall us others? Jove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans\r\nto themselves; he would come to Olympus to punish us, and would grip\r\nus up one after another, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside\r\nyour anger for the death of your son; better men than he have either\r\nbeen killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot protect\r\nevery one\'s whole family."\r\nWith these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno\r\ncalled Apollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. "Jove,"\r\nshe said to them, "desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when\r\nyou have seen him you are to do as he may then bid you."\r\nThereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris and\r\nApollo made all haste on their way. When they reached\r\nmany-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated\r\non topmost Gargarus with a fragrant cloud encircling his head as\r\nwith a diadem. They stood before his presence, and he was pleased with\r\nthem for having been so quick in obeying the orders his wife had given\r\nthem.\r\nHe spoke to Iris first. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, tell King\r\nNeptune what I now bid you- and tell him true. Bid him leave off\r\nfighting, and either join the company of the gods, or go down into the\r\nsea. If he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well\r\nwhether he is strong enough to hold his own against me if I attack\r\nhim. I am older and much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid\r\nto set himself up as on a level with myself, of whom all the other\r\ngods stand in awe."\r\nIris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or\r\nsnowflakes that fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas,\r\neven so did she wing her way till she came close up to the great\r\nshaker of the earth. Then she said, "I have come, O dark-haired king\r\nthat holds the world in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove.\r\nHe bids you leave off fighting, and either join the company of the\r\ngods or go down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed and\r\ndisobey him, he says he will come down here and fight you. He would\r\nhave you keep out of his reach, for he is older and much stronger than\r\nyou are, and yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a level\r\nwith himself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe."\r\nNeptune was very angry and said, "Great heavens! strong as Jove\r\nmay be, he has said more than he can do if he has threatened\r\nviolence against me, who am of like honour with himself. We were three\r\nbrothers whom Rhea bore to Saturn- Jove, myself, and Hades who rules\r\nthe world below. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, and\r\neach of us was to have an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to\r\nme to have my dwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took the\r\ndarkness of the realms under the earth, while air and sky and clouds\r\nwere the portion that fell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus are\r\nthe common property of all. Therefore I will not walk as Jove would\r\nhave me. For all his strength, let him keep to his own third share and\r\nbe contented without threatening to lay hands upon me as though I were\r\nnobody. Let him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters,\r\nwho must perforce obey him.\r\nIris fleet as the wind then answered, "Am I really, Neptune, to take\r\nthis daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider\r\nyour answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that\r\nthe Erinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person."\r\nNeptune answered, "Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in\r\nseason. It is well when a messenger shows so much discretion.\r\nNevertheless it cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke\r\nso angrily another who is his own peer, and of like empire with\r\nhimself. Now, however, I will give way in spite of my displeasure;\r\nfurthermore let me tell you, and I mean what I say- if contrary to the\r\ndesire of myself, Minerva driver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King\r\nVulcan, Jove spares steep Ilius, and will not let the Achaeans have\r\nthe great triumph of sacking it, let him understand that he will incur\r\nour implacable resentment."\r\nNeptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely\r\ndid the Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, "Go, dear\r\nPhoebus, to Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has\r\nnow gone down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure.\r\nHad he not done so those gods who are below with Saturn would have\r\ncome to hear of the fight between us. It is better for both of us that\r\nhe should have curbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I should\r\nhave had much trouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis,\r\nand shake it furiously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic;\r\ntake, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and\r\nrouse him to deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back\r\nto their ships and to the Hellespont. From that point I will think\r\nit well over, how the Achaeans may have a respite from their\r\ntroubles."\r\nApollo obeyed his father\'s saying, and left the crests of Ida,\r\nflying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He\r\nfound Hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he\r\nhad just come to himself again. He knew those who were about him,\r\nand the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the moment when the\r\nwill of aegis-bearing Jove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him\r\nand said, "Hector, son of Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you\r\nhere away from the others? Has any mishap befallen you?"\r\nHector in a weak voice answered, "And which, kind sir, of the gods\r\nare you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me on\r\nthe chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships of\r\nthe Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure that\r\nthis very day I should breathe my last and go down into the house of\r\nHades."\r\nThen King Apollo said to him, "Take heart; the son of Saturn has\r\nsent you a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even\r\nme, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian\r\nhitherto not only of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore,\r\norder your horsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in great\r\nmultitudes. I will go before your horses to smooth the way for them,\r\nand will turn the Achaeans in flight."\r\nAs he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his\r\npeople. And as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops\r\ngloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take his\r\nbath in the river- he tosses his head, and his mane streams over his\r\nshoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to\r\nthe pastures where the mares are feeding- even so Hector, when he\r\nheard what the god said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as\r\nfast as his limbs could take him. As country peasants set their hounds\r\non to a homed stag or wild goat- he has taken shelter under rock or\r\nthicket, and they cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom\r\ntheir shouts have roused stands in their path, and they are in no\r\nfurther humour for the chase- even so the Achaeans were still charging\r\non in a body, using their swords and spears pointed at both ends,\r\nbut when they saw Hector going about among his men they were afraid,\r\nand their hearts fell down into their feet.\r\nThen spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man\r\nwho could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,\r\nwhile few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. He\r\nthen with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: "What, in\r\nheaven\'s name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again?\r\nEvery one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but\r\nit seems that one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killed\r\nmany of us Danaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the hand\r\nof Jove must be with him or he would never dare show himself so\r\nmasterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us all\r\ndo as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall back\r\nupon the ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower of\r\nthe army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at the\r\npoint of our spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive that he\r\nwill then think better of it before he tries to charge into the\r\npress of the Danaans."\r\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who\r\nwere about Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of\r\nTeucer, Meriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best men\r\nabout them and sustained the fight against Hector and the Trojans, but\r\nthe main body fell back upon the ships of the Achaeans.\r\nThe Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding on\r\nat their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud\r\nabout his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its\r\nshaggy fringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to strike\r\nterror into the hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on the\r\nTrojans.\r\nThe Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of\r\nbattle rose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the\r\nbowstrings. Many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the\r\nbodies of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway,\r\nbefore they could taste of man\'s fair flesh and glut themselves with\r\nblood. So long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without\r\nshaking it, the weapons on either side took effect and the people\r\nfell, but when he shook it straight in the face of the Danaans and\r\nraised his mighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within them and they\r\nforgot their former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in the\r\ndead of night on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the\r\nherdsman is not there- even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for\r\nApollo filled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and the\r\nTrojans.\r\nThe fight then became more scattered and they killed one another\r\nwhere they best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one,\r\nleader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of\r\nMenestheus. Aeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard son\r\nto Oileus, and brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from\r\nhis own country, for he had killed a man, a kinsman of his\r\nstepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had married. Iasus had become a\r\nleader of the Athenians, and was son of Sphelus the son of Boucolos.\r\nPolydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites Echius, in the front of the\r\nbattle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris struck Deiochus from behind\r\nin the lower part of the shoulder, as he was flying among the\r\nforemost, and the point of the spear went clean through him.\r\nWhile they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the\r\nAchaeans were flying pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, and\r\nwere forced back within their wall. Hector then cried out to the\r\nTrojans, "Forward to the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any\r\nman keeping back on the other side the wall away from the ships I will\r\nhave him killed: his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues\r\nof fire, but dogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city."\r\nAs he spoke he laid his whip about his horses\' shoulders and\r\ncalled to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with\r\na cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with\r\nhis own. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks of\r\nthe deep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as\r\nbroad as the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. The\r\nTrojan battalions poured over the bridge, and Apollo with his\r\nredoubtable aegis led the way. He kicked down the wall of the Achaeans\r\nas easily as a child who playing on the sea-shore has built a house of\r\nsand and then kicks it down again and destroys it- even so did you,\r\nO Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with\r\npanic and confusion.\r\nThus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out to\r\none another and raising their hands with loud cries every man to\r\nheaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted up\r\nhis hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently\r\nthan any of them. "Father Jove," said he, "if ever any one in\r\nwheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer\r\nand prayed that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed your\r\nhead to him in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans\r\nto triumph thus over the Achaeans."\r\nAll counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of the\r\naged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove thunder they flung\r\nthemselves yet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking\r\nover the bulwarks of a ship when the sea runs high before a gale-\r\nfor it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so great- even so\r\ndid the Trojans spring over the wall with a shout, and drive their\r\nchariots onwards. The two sides fought with their double-pointed\r\nspears in hand-to-hand encounter-the Trojans from their chariots,\r\nand the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and wielding the long\r\npikes that were lying on the decks ready for use in a sea-fight,\r\njointed and shod with bronze.\r\nNow Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting\r\nabout the wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships,\r\nremained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him\r\nwith his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease his\r\npain. When, however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in\r\nthe wall, while the Achaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he\r\ncried aloud, and smote his two thighs with the flat of his hands.\r\n"Eurypylus," said he in his dismay, "I know you want me badly, but I\r\ncannot stay with you any longer, for there is hard fighting going\r\non; a servant shall take care of you now, for I must make all speed to\r\nAchilles, and induce him to fight if I can; who knows but with\r\nheaven\'s help I may persuade him. A man does well to listen to the\r\nadvice of a friend."\r\nWhen he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and\r\nresisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in\r\nnumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could\r\nthe Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among the\r\ntents and ships. As a carpenter\'s line gives a true edge to a piece of\r\nship\'s timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva has\r\ninstructed in all kinds of useful arts- even so level was the issue of\r\nthe fight between the two sides, as they fought some round one and\r\nsome round another.\r\nHector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about the\r\nsame ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor yet\r\ncould Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought him.\r\nThen Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear as\r\nhe was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground\r\nand the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen\r\nin front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,\r\n"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot,\r\nbut rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of his\r\narmour now that he has fallen."\r\nHe then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit\r\nLycophron a follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was living\r\nwith Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans.\r\nHector\'s spear struck him on the head below the ear, and he fell\r\nheadlong from the ship\'s prow on to the ground with no life left in\r\nhim. Ajax shook with rage and said to his brother, "Teucer, my good\r\nfellow, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came to\r\nlive with us from Cythera and whom we honoured as much as our own\r\nparents. Hector has just killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at\r\nonce and the bow which Phoebus Apollo gave you."\r\nTeucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver in\r\nhis hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and hit\r\nCleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son of\r\nPanthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his\r\nhorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,\r\ndoing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come\r\nupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert\r\nit, for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from his\r\nchariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside. King\r\nPolydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up to the\r\nhorses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, and\r\nordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He then\r\nwent back and took his place in the front ranks.\r\nTeucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have been\r\nno more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then\r\nand there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes\r\non Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his\r\nbowstring for him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim;\r\non this the arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands.\r\nTeucer shook with anger and said to his brother, "Alas, see how heaven\r\nthwarts us in all we do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the\r\nbow from my hand, though I strung it this selfsame morning that it\r\nmight serve me for many an arrow."\r\nAjax son of Telamon answered, "My good fellow, let your bow and your\r\narrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite the\r\nDanaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both\r\nfight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be\r\nsuccessful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find\r\nit a hard matter to take the ships."\r\nTeucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield\r\nfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set\r\nhis helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded\r\nmenacingly above it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and\r\nforthwith he was by the side of Ajax.\r\nWhen Hector saw that Teucer\'s bow was of no more use to him, he\r\nshouted out to the Trojans and Lycians, "Trojans, Lycians, and\r\nDardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your\r\nmettle here at the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their\r\nchieftains made useless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see when\r\nJove is helping people and means to help them still further, or\r\nagain when he is bringing them down and will do nothing for them; he\r\nis now on our side, and is going against the Argives. Therefore\r\nswarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is struck by spear or\r\nsword and loses his life, let him die; he dies with honour who dies\r\nfighting for his country; and he will leave his wife and children safe\r\nbehind him, with his house and allotment unplundered if only the\r\nAchaeans can be driven back to their own land, they and their ships."\r\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the\r\nother side exhorted his comrades saying, "Shame on you Argives, we are\r\nnow utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the\r\nenemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you\r\nwill be able to get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on his\r\nwhole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they\r\nare not at a dance but in battle? Our only course is to fight them\r\nwith might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, once\r\nfor all, than fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships by\r\nworse men than ourselves."\r\nWith these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then\r\nkilled Schedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajax\r\nkilled Laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas\r\nkilled Otus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of\r\nthe proud Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but\r\nPolydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo would not\r\nsuffer the son of Panthous to fall in battle; but the spear hit\r\nCroesmus in the middle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the\r\nground, and Meges stripped him of his armour. At that moment the\r\nvaliant soldier Dolops son of Lampus sprang upon Lampus was son of\r\nLaomedon and for his valour, while his son Dolops was versed in all\r\nthe ways of war. He then struck the middle of the son of Phyleus\'\r\nshield with his spear, setting on him at close quarters, but his\r\ngood corslet made with plates of metal saved him; Phyleus had\r\nbrought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his host, King\r\nEuphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect him. It now\r\nserved to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck the topmost\r\ncrest of Dolops\'s bronze helmet with his spear and tore away its plume\r\nof horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was it\r\ntumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting and\r\nconfident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got by the\r\nside of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder,\r\nfrom behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his\r\nchest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to\r\nstrip him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers for\r\nhelp, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon,\r\nwho erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before the\r\nwar broke out; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went back to\r\nIlius, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priam\r\nwho treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him and\r\nsaid, "Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note of the\r\ndeath of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying to\r\ntake Dolops\'s armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the Argives\r\nfrom a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till either\r\nwe kill them or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people."\r\nHe led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after.\r\nMeanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. "My\r\nfriends," he cried, "be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in\r\nbattle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect each\r\nother\'s good opinion are less likely to be killed than those who do\r\nnot, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory."\r\nThus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the\r\nTrojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with a\r\nwall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the\r\nloud battle-cry urged Antilochus on. "Antilochus," said he, "you are\r\nyoung and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more\r\nvaliant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and\r\nkill him."\r\nHe hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once\r\ndarted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking\r\ncarefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart\r\ndid not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus\r\nthe proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming\r\nforward, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily\r\nto the ground. Antilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn\r\nwhich a hunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and\r\nkilled it. Even so, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus spring\r\nupon you to strip you of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, and\r\ncame running up to him through the thick of the battle. Antilochus,\r\nbrave soldier though he was, would not stay to face him, but fled like\r\nsome savage creature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it\r\nhas killed a dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body\r\nof men can be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor\r\nfly, and the Trojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air\r\nshowered their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay his\r\nflight till he had reached his comrades.\r\nThe Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the\r\nships in fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them on\r\nto new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives\r\nand defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving\r\nglory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the\r\nships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had\r\nmade him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he should see the glare\r\nof a blazing ship. From that hour he was about so to order that the\r\nTrojans should be driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory to\r\nthe Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam, who\r\nwas cager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as that of\r\nMars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense forest\r\nupon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under\r\nhis terrible eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples by\r\nreason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with\r\nhim, and though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory\r\nand glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas\r\nMinerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands of\r\nthe son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the ranks\r\nof the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the goodliest\r\narmour; but do what he might he could not break through them, for they\r\nstood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from the\r\ngrey sea that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves that\r\nthunder up against it. He fell upon them like flames of fire from\r\nevery quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by wind and storm,\r\nbreaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar\r\nagainst the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and\r\nthey are saved but by a very little from destruction- even so were the\r\nhearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion\r\nattacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the\r\nlow-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore- the herdsman is at his\r\nwit\'s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now in the van\r\nand now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion springs into the\r\nthick of them and fastens on a cow so that they all tremble for\r\nfear- even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken by Hector and\r\nfather Jove. Nevertheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae; he\r\nwas son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders of King\r\nEurystheus to mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man than\r\nthe father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior,\r\nand in understanding ranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it\r\nwas who then afforded Hector a triumph, for as he was turning back\r\nhe stumbled against the rim of his shield which reached his feet,\r\nand served to keep the javelins off him. He tripped against this and\r\nfell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as he did\r\nso. Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear into\r\nhis chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. These, for all\r\ntheir sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves terribly\r\nafraid of Hector.\r\nThey had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had\r\nbeen drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans came\r\npouring after them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of\r\nships, but they made a stand by their tents without being broken up\r\nand scattered; shame and fear restrained them. They kept shouting\r\nincessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to\r\nthe Achaeans, was loudest in imploring every man by his parents, and\r\nbeseeching him to stand firm.\r\n"Be men, my friends," he cried, "and respect one another\'s good\r\nopinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, your\r\nproperty, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On their\r\nbehalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and\r\nnot to turn in flight."\r\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted\r\nthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon\r\nthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was\r\nraging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in the\r\nrear who were taking no part in the battle, and those who were\r\nfighting by the ships.\r\nAjax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but\r\nstrode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve\r\ncubits long and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of\r\nhorsemanship couples four horses together and comes tearing full speed\r\nalong the public way from the country into some large town- many\r\nboth men and women marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time\r\nchanging his horse, springing from one to another without ever missing\r\nhis feet while the horses are at a gallop- even so did Ajax go\r\nstriding from one ship\'s deck to another, and his voice went up into\r\nthe heavens. He kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans and\r\nexhorting them to defend their ships and tents; neither did Hector\r\nremain within the main body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle\r\nswoops down upon a flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, it\r\nmay be, or cranes, or long-necked swans- even so did Hector make\r\nstraight for a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for Jove\r\nwith his mighty hand impelled him forward, and roused his people to\r\nfollow him.\r\nAnd now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would\r\nhave thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely\r\ndid they fight; and this was the mind in which they were- the Achaeans\r\ndid not believe they should escape destruction but thought\r\nthemselves doomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat\r\nhigh with the hope of firing the ships and putting the Achaean\r\nheroes to the sword.\r\nThus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of\r\nthe good ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore him\r\nback to his native land. Round this ship there raged a close\r\nhand-to-hand fight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fight\r\nat a distance with bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at\r\none another in close combat with their mighty swords and spears\r\npointed at both ends; they fought moreover with keen battle-axes and\r\nwith hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted and scabbarded with\r\niron, fell from hand or shoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red\r\nwith blood. Hector, when he had seized the ship, would not loose his\r\nhold but held on to its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans,\r\n"Bring fire, and raise the battle-cry all of you with a single\r\nvoice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a day that will pay us for all the\r\nrest; this day we shall take the ships which came hither against\r\nheaven\'s will, and which have caused us such infinite suffering\r\nthrough the cowardice of our councillors, who when I would have done\r\nbattle at the ships held me back and forbade the host to follow me; if\r\nJove did then indeed warp our judgements, himself now commands me\r\nand cheers me on."\r\nAs he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the\r\nAchaeans, and Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by\r\nthe darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed.\r\nTherefore he left the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to\r\nthe seven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out,\r\nand with his spear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the\r\nships. All the time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice and\r\nexhorting the Danaans. "My friends," he cried, "Danaan heroes,\r\nservants of Mars, be men my friends, and fight with might and with\r\nmain. Can we hope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us\r\nmore surely than the one we have? There is no strong city within\r\nreach, whence we may draw fresh forces to turn the scales in our\r\nfavour. We are on the plain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind\r\nus, and far from our own country. Our salvation, therefore, is in\r\nthe might of our hands and in hard fighting."\r\nAs he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when\r\nany Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector\'s bidding, he\r\nwould be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long\r\nspear. Twelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the\r\nships.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XVI\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THUS did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus\r\ndrew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some\r\nspring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice.\r\nWhen Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said,\r\n"Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child that\r\ncomes running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried-\r\nshe catches hold of her mother\'s dress to stay her though she is in\r\na hurry, and looks tearfully up until her mother carries her- even\r\nsuch tears, Patroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything to\r\nsay to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthia\r\nwhich you alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still\r\nalive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons- men whose\r\nloss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the\r\nArgives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships, throu\r\ntheir own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell me\r\nthat both of us may know about it."\r\nThen, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered,\r\n"Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not be\r\nangry, but I weep for the disaster that has now befallen the\r\nArgives. All those who have been their champions so far are lying at\r\nthe ships, wounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has\r\nbeen hit with a spear, while famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have received\r\nsword-wounds; Eurypylus again has been struck with an arrow in the\r\nthigh; skilled apothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healing\r\nthem of their wounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it\r\nnever be my lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to the\r\nbaning of your own good name. Who in future story will speak well of\r\nyou unless you now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity;\r\nknight Peleus was not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey\r\nsea bore you and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel and\r\nremorseless are you. If however you are kept back through knowledge of\r\nsome oracle, or if your mother Thetis has told you something from\r\nthe mouth of Jove, at least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I\r\nmay bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your\r\narmour; the Trojans may thus mistake me for you and quit the field, so\r\nthat the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have breathing time-\r\nwhich while they are fighting may hardly be. We who are fresh might\r\nsoon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to their own city."\r\nHe knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own\r\ndestruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, "What, noble\r\nPatroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am\r\nheeding, nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove,\r\nbut I am cut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dare\r\nto rob me because he is more powerful than I am. This, after all\r\nthat I have gone through, is more than I can endure. The girl whom the\r\nsons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear\r\non having sacked a city- her has King Agamemnon taken from me as\r\nthough I were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no\r\nman may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till battle\r\nand the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my\r\narmour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the\r\ndark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the\r\nArgives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow space,\r\nand the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against\r\nthem, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near\r\nthem. Had they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor grip\r\nthat had not been filled with their dead as they fled back again.\r\nAnd so it would have been, if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairly\r\nby me. As it is the Trojans have beset our host. Diomed son of\r\nTydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the Danaans, neither\r\nhave I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hated\r\nhead, whereas that of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he gives\r\norders to the Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the\r\nwhole plain with their cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall\r\nupon them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent\r\nus from being able to return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that\r\nyou may win me great honour from all the Danaans, and that they may\r\nrestore the girl to me again and give me rich gifts into the\r\nbargain. When you have driven the Trojans from the ships, come back\r\nagain. Though Juno\'s thundering husband should put triumph within your\r\nreach, do not fight the Trojans further in my absence, or you will rob\r\nme of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of battle go on\r\nkilling the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of the\r\never-living gods from Olympus attack you- for Phoebus Apollo loves\r\nthem well: return when you have freed the ships from peril, and let\r\nothers wage war upon the plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and\r\nApollo, that not a single man of all the Trojans might be left\r\nalive, nor yet of the Argives, but that we two might be alone left\r\nto tear aside the mantle that veils the brow of Troy."\r\nThus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for\r\nthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and the\r\njavelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed\r\nabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles\r\nthat kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected\r\nhis face. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his\r\nshield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they\r\ncould not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the\r\nsweat rained from every pore of his body, he had not a moment\'s\r\nrespite, and on all sides he was beset by danger upon danger.\r\nAnd now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how\r\nfire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close up\r\nand let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. He\r\ncut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened on to the\r\nshaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headless\r\nspear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came ringing\r\ndown on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this, and was\r\ndismayed at seeing that Jove had now left him utterly defenceless\r\nand was willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and\r\nthe Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped in\r\nflame.\r\nThe fire was now flaring about the ship\'s stern, whereon Achilles\r\nsmote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, "Up, noble knight, for I\r\nsee the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy\r\nour ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on your\r\narmour at once while I call our people together."\r\nAs he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs\r\nwith greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver;\r\nafter this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid\r\nand studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his\r\nshoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his\r\nhelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded\r\nmenacingly above it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his\r\nhands, but he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and\r\nstrong, for none other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles\r\ncould do so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion,\r\nwhich Chiron had cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus,\r\nwherewith to deal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his\r\nhorses with all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour\r\nnext after Achilles, and on whose support in battle he could rely most\r\nfirmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius,\r\nsteeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy\r\nPodarge bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the\r\nwaters of the river Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horse\r\nPedasus, whom Achilles had brought away with him when he sacked the\r\ncity of Eetion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could take his\r\nplace along with those that were immortal.\r\nMeanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade\r\nhis Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves that\r\nare feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the\r\nmountains, and their jaws are red with blood- they go in a pack to lap\r\nwater from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they\r\nreek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is\r\nhunger drives them- even so did the leaders and counsellors of the\r\nMyrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant of\r\nAeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both men and\r\nhorses.\r\nFifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there\r\nwas a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom he\r\ncould trust, while he was himself commander over them all.\r\nMenesthius of the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius that\r\nstreams from heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair Polydora\r\ndaughter of Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius- a woman\r\nmated with a god- but he was called son of Borus son of Perieres, with\r\nwhom his mother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave great\r\nwealth to gain her. The second company was led by noble Eudorus, son\r\nto an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas the graceful\r\ndancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured of her as\r\nhe saw her among the singing women at a dance held in honour of\r\nDiana the rushing huntress of the golden arrows; he therefore-\r\nMercury, giver of all good- went with her into an upper chamber, and\r\nlay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudorus,\r\nsingularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess\r\nof the pains of child-birth brought him to the light of day, and he\r\nsaw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles son of Actor took the\r\nmother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain her, but her father\r\nPhylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting as fondly\r\nupon him as though he were his own son. The third company was led by\r\nPisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman among all the\r\nMyrmidons next to Achilles\' own comrade Patroclus. The old knight\r\nPhoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son of\r\nLaerceus of the fifth.\r\nWhen Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with\r\ntheir captains, he charged them straitly saying, "Myrmidons,\r\nremember your threats against the Trojans while you were at the\r\nships in the time of my anger, and you were all complaining of me.\r\n\'Cruel son of Peleus,\' you would say, \'your mother must have suckled\r\nyou on gall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here at the ships\r\nagainst our will; if you are so relentless it were better we went home\r\nover the sea.\' Often have you gathered and thus chided with me. The\r\nhour is now come for those high feats of arms that you have so long\r\nbeen pining for, therefore keep high hearts each one of you to do\r\nbattle with the Trojans."\r\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they\r\nserried their companies yet more closely when they heard the of\r\ntheir king. As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some\r\nhigh house which is to give shelter from the winds- even so closely\r\nwere the helmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield\r\npressed on shield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they\r\nthat the horse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets\r\ntouched each other as they bent their heads.\r\nIn front of them all two men put on their armour- Patroclus and\r\nAutomedon- two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then\r\nAchilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest\r\nwhich silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board ship, and\r\nwhich she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and\r\ngood thick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship,\r\nfrom which no man but himself might drink, nor would he make\r\noffering from it to any other god save only to father Jove. He took\r\nthe cup from the chest and cleansed it with sulphur; this done he\r\nrinsed it clean water, and after he had washed his hands he drew wine.\r\nThen he stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towards\r\nheaven, and making his drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of\r\nJove whose joy is in thunder. "King Jove," he cried, "lord of\r\nDodona, god of the Pelasgi, who dwellest afar, you who hold wintry\r\nDodona in your sway, where your prophets the Selli dwell around you\r\nwith their feet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground- if\r\nyou heard me when I prayed to you aforetime, and did me honour while\r\nyou sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe me now the fulfilment\r\nof yet this further prayer. I shall stay here where my ships are\r\nlying, but I shall send my comrade into battle at the head of many\r\nMyrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory may go with him; put\r\nyour courage into his heart that Hector may learn whether my squire is\r\nman enough to fight alone, or whether his might is only then so\r\nindomitable when I myself enter the turmoil of war. Afterwards when he\r\nhas chased the fight and the cry of battle from the ships, grant\r\nthat he may return unharmed, with his armour and his comrades,\r\nfighters in close combat."\r\nThus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part of\r\nit he did indeed vouchsafe him- but not the whole. He granted that\r\nPatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but\r\nrefused to let him come safely out of the fight.\r\nWhen he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles\r\nwent inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.\r\nThen he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce\r\nfight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.\r\nMeanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till\r\nthey sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out like\r\nwasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love to\r\ntease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung- or\r\nagain, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident,\r\nevery wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones-\r\neven with such rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their\r\nships, and their cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called\r\nout to his men at the top of his voice, "Myrmidons, followers of\r\nAchilles son of Peleus, be men my friends, fight with might and with\r\nmain, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far the\r\nforemost man at the ships of the Argives- he, and his close fighting\r\nfollowers. The son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his\r\nfolly in showing no respect to the bravest of the Achaeans."\r\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they\r\nfell in a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry\r\nwhich the Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of\r\nMenoetius and his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were\r\ndaunted and their battalions were thrown into confusion, for they\r\nthought the fleet son of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and\r\nhave been reconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, looked\r\nround about to see whither he might fly for safety.\r\nPatroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where men\r\nwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus.\r\nHe hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon\r\nand the broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the\r\nright shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on\r\nthis his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing their\r\nleader, who was the finest soldier among them, Patroclus struck\r\npanic into them all. He thus drove them from the ship and quenched the\r\nfire that was then blazing- leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where\r\nit was. The Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the\r\nskies, while the Danaans poured after them from their ships,\r\nshouting also without ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the\r\nthunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty\r\nmountain, and all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forest\r\nglades show out in the great light that flashes from the bursting\r\nheavens, even so when the Danaans had now driven back the fire from\r\ntheir ships, they took breath for a little while; but the fury of\r\nthe fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were not driven back in\r\nutter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted from their ground\r\nonly by sheer fighting.\r\nThe fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed\r\none another when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius\r\nfirst drove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was\r\nturning round; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so\r\nthat he fell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest,\r\nwhere it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The\r\nson of Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he could\r\ndo so took aim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are\r\nthicker than in any other part; the spear tore through all the\r\nsinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons\r\nof Nestor one, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point of\r\nthe spear through his throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang on\r\nAntilochus in hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode\r\nthe body spear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him,\r\nand in a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his\r\nblow; his aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the\r\nroot of his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell\r\nheavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did\r\nthese two noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain by the\r\ntwo sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodorus, who\r\nhad reared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax son of\r\nOileus sprang on Cleobulus and took him alive as he was entangled in\r\nthe crush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on the\r\nneck. The sword reeked with his blood, while dark death and the strong\r\nhand of fate gripped him and closed his eyes.\r\nPeneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed\r\neach other with their spears. They had both thrown without effect,\r\nso now they drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of\r\nPeneleos\' helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote\r\nLycon on the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the\r\nhead was held on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life\r\nleft in him. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him up\r\njust as he was about to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through\r\nhis right shoulder so that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyes\r\nwere closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the\r\nbronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain,\r\ncrashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth were\r\nall of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from\r\nboth his eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils,\r\nand the darkness of death enfolded him round about.\r\nThus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his\r\nman. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when\r\nthey are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock\r\nthrough the carelessness of the shepherd- and when the wolves see this\r\nthey pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves-\r\neven so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with\r\nill-omened cries in their panic and had no more fight left in them.\r\nMeanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,\r\nbut Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well\r\nunder cover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the\r\nwhizzing of the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well\r\nknew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood his\r\nground and tried to protect his comrades.\r\nAs when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a\r\nclear sky when Jove is brewing a gale- even with such panic stricken\r\nrout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going.\r\nHector\'s fleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and he\r\nleft the Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against their\r\nwill. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in\r\nthe trench and left their master\'s car behind them. Patroclus gave\r\nchase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against the\r\nTrojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the ways\r\nwith their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with the\r\nclouds of dust they raised, and the horses strained every nerve in\r\ntheir flight from the tents and ships towards the city.\r\nPatroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying\r\nin confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being\r\nsmashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from\r\nhis own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose\r\nimmortal steeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench\r\nat a bound as they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near\r\nHector, for he had set his heart on spearing him, but Hector\'s\r\nhorses were now hurrying him away. As the whole dark earth bows before\r\nsome tempest on an autumn day when Jove rains his hardest to punish\r\nmen for giving crooked judgement in their courts, and arriving justice\r\ntherefrom without heed to the decrees of heaven- all the rivers run\r\nfull and the torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong\r\nfrom the mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of\r\nmen- even such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their\r\nflight.\r\nPatroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and\r\ndrove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach\r\nthe city, but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between the\r\nriver and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then\r\navenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was\r\nexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground.\r\nNext he sprang on Thestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled up\r\nin his chariot, for he had lost his head and the reins had been torn\r\nout of his hands. Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear into\r\nhis right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled\r\nhim over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of some\r\njutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook and\r\na line- even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping from his\r\nchariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while falling.\r\nOn this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him full on the\r\nhead with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside his helmet,\r\nwhereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of death took\r\nhold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas,\r\nAmphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris,\r\nlpheus, Euippus and Polymelus son of Argeas.\r\nNow when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,\r\nbeing overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycians\r\nsaying. "Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle; I\r\nwill myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so\r\nmasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave\r\nman upon the ground."\r\nHe sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he saw\r\nthis, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one another\r\nwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream\r\nand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness.\r\nThe son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said to\r\nJuno who was his wife and sister, "Alas, that it should be the lot\r\nof Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of\r\nPatroclus. I am in two minds whether to catch him up out of the\r\nfight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or\r\nto let him now fall by the hand of the son of Menoetius."\r\nAnd Juno answered, "Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that\r\nyou are saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long\r\nbeen fated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not\r\nall of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to your\r\nheart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other of\r\nthe gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle, for\r\nthere are many sons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and you\r\nwill make every one jealous. If, however, you are fond of him and pity\r\nhim, let him indeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as soon as\r\nthe life is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him\r\noff the field and take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where his\r\nbrothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in due\r\nhonour to the dead."\r\nThe sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood\r\nupon the earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to kill\r\non the rich plain of Troy far from his home.\r\nWhen they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck\r\nThrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of the\r\nbelly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and\r\nmissed him, but he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and\r\nit screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life\r\nwent out of it. The other two horses began to plunge; the pole of\r\nthe chariot cracked and they got entangled in the reins through the\r\nfall of the horse that was yoked along with them; but Automedon knew\r\nwhat to do; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that\r\nhung by his sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the\r\nother two righted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went\r\ntogether into battle.\r\nSarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him,\r\nthe point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting\r\nhim. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from his\r\nhand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds the\r\never-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tall\r\npine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains to\r\nmake timber for ship-building- even so did he lie stretched at full\r\nlength in front of his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching at\r\nthe blood-stained dust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon a\r\nherd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which dies\r\nbellowing in its clutches- even so did the leader of the Lycian\r\nwarriors struggle in death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. He\r\ncalled on his trusty comrade and said, "Glaucus, my brother, hero\r\namong heroes, put forth all your strength, fight with might and\r\nmain, now if ever quit yourself like a valiant soldier. First go about\r\namong the Lycian captains and bid them fight for Sarpedon; then\r\nyourself also do battle to save my armour from being taken. My name\r\nwill haunt you henceforth and for ever if the Achaeans rob me of my\r\narmour now that I have fallen at their ships. Do your very utmost\r\nand call all my people together."\r\nDeath closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on his\r\nbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came out\r\nalong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon\'s soul at\r\nthe same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, who\r\nwere wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.\r\nGlaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,\r\nfor he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his other\r\nhand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer\'s arrow had\r\ngiven him when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was\r\nassailing it. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying,\r\n"Hear me O king from your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, or\r\nmay be in Troy, for in all places you can hear the prayer of one who\r\nis in distress, as I now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand is\r\naching with pain, there is no staunching the blood, and my whole arm\r\ndrags by reason of my hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go\r\namong my foes and fight them, thou our prince, Jove\'s son Sarpedon, is\r\nslain. Jove defended not his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me\r\nof my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the\r\nLycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who has\r\nfallen."\r\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,\r\nstaunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.\r\nGlaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had\r\nanswered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian\r\ncaptains, and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From\r\nthese he strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous\r\nand Agenor; he then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when he\r\nhad found them he said, "Hector, you have utterly forgotten your\r\nallies, who languish here for your sake far from friends and home\r\nwhile you do nothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian\r\nwarriors has fallen- he who was at once the right and might of\r\nLycia; Mars has laid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by\r\nhim, my friends, and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his\r\narmour, nor to treat his body with contumely in revenge for all the\r\nDanaans whom we have speared at the ships."\r\nAs he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable\r\ngrief; for Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main\r\nstays of their city, both as having much people with him, and\r\nhimself the foremost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated\r\nby the fall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans with\r\nall their might, while the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son of\r\nMenoetius cheered on the Achaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes,\r\nmen who needed no bidding. "Ajaxes," said he, "may it now please you\r\nto show youselves the men you have always been, or even better-\r\nSarpedon is fallen- he who was first to overleap the wall of the\r\nAchaeans; let us take the body and outrage it; let us strip the armour\r\nfrom his shoulders, and kill his comrades if they try to rescue his\r\nbody."\r\nHe spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,\r\ntherefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the\r\nMyrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions,\r\nand fought desperately about the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely\r\nthe while. Mighty was the din of their armour as they came together,\r\nand Jove shed a thick darkness over the fight, to increase the of\r\nthe battle over the body of his son.\r\nAt first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for one\r\nof the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of noble\r\nAgacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but\r\npresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took\r\nrefuge with Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noble\r\nsteeds to fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on\r\nthe head with a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, and\r\nhis brains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell\r\nface foremost upon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was\r\nenraged by the death of his comrade, and sped through the front\r\nranks as swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or\r\nstarlings. Even so swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you make\r\nstraight for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith\r\nhe struck Sthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone,\r\nand broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this\r\nHector and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man\r\ncan throw a javelin when competing for some prize, or even in\r\nbattle- so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans.\r\nGlaucus, captain of the Lycians, was the first to rally them, by\r\nkilling Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and was the\r\nrichest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly, just\r\nas Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him, and\r\ndrove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fell\r\nheavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled the\r\nAchaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were exultant, and came up\r\nin a body round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of\r\ntheir prowess, bore straight down upon them.\r\nMeriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus son\r\nof Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured by\r\nthe people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the\r\njaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of death\r\nlaid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping to\r\nhit him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw it\r\ncoming and stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew past\r\nhim and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on\r\nquivering till Mars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore, sped\r\nfrom Aeneas\'s hand in vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneas\r\nwas angry and said, "Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hit\r\nyou my spear would soon have made an end of you."\r\nAnd Meriones answered, "Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will not\r\nbe able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are\r\nonly a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle of\r\nyour shield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you may\r\nbe, I should soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to Hades\r\nof the noble steeds."\r\nOn this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, "Meriones, hero\r\nthough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good\r\nfriend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some\r\nof them must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words for\r\ncouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing."\r\nHe led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As\r\nthe sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains-\r\nand the thud of their axes is heard afar- even such a din now rose\r\nfrom earth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as\r\nmen smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at both\r\nends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered\r\nwas he from head to foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmed\r\nabout the body, as flies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring\r\nwhen they are brimming with milk- even so did they gather round\r\nSarpedon; nor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the\r\nfight, but kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling how\r\nbest to kill Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should be\r\nallowed to end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and\r\nstrip him of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further\r\ntrouble to the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the brave\r\nsquire of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans\r\nback towards the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he\r\nmade Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and\r\nfled, bidding the other Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales\r\nof Jove had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lycians\r\nstand firm; they were dismayed when they saw their king lying struck\r\nto the heart amid a heap of corpses- for when the son of Saturn made\r\nthe fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore\r\nstripped the gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son of\r\nMenoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord of\r\nthe storm-cloud said to Apollo, "Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and\r\ntake Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black blood\r\nfrom off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may wash\r\nhim in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortal\r\nraiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleet\r\nmessengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to the\r\nrich land of Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen will inter him, and\r\nwill raise both mound and pillar to his memory, in due honour to the\r\ndead."\r\nThus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father\'s saying, and came down from\r\nthe heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he took\r\nSarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way\r\noff, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia\r\nand clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to\r\nthe arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who\r\npresently set him down in the rich land of Lycia.\r\nMeanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to\r\nAutomedon, pursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and\r\nfoolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son\r\nof Peleus, he would have, escaped death and have been scatheless;\r\nbut the counsels of Jove pass man\'s understanding; he will put even\r\na brave man to flight and snatch victory from his grasp, or again he\r\nwill set him on to fight, as he now did when he put a high spirit into\r\nthe heart of Patroclus.\r\nWho then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when\r\nthe gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus,\r\nAutonous, Echeclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and\r\nMelanippus; after these he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes.\r\nThese he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight.\r\nThe sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands of\r\nPatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus\r\nApollo taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to\r\naid the Trojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the high\r\nwall, and thrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with\r\nhis own immortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god for\r\nyet a fourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said,\r\n"Draw back, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of\r\nthe Trojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is a\r\nfar better man than you are." On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew to\r\nsome distance and avoided the anger of Apollo.\r\nMeanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean\r\ngates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to\r\ncall the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo\r\ndrew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius,\r\nwho was Hector\'s uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of\r\nDymas who lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; in\r\nhis likeness Jove\'s son Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, "Hector,\r\nwhy have you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as\r\nmuch better a man than you, as I am worse, you should soon rue your\r\nslackness. Drive straight towards Patroclus, if so be that Apollo\r\nmay grant you a triumph over him, and you may rull him."\r\nWith this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade\r\nCebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them, and\r\nstruck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector and the\r\nTrojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, but\r\ndrove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his chariot to\r\nthe ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jagged\r\nstone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it,\r\nnor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not in\r\nvain, for the stone struck Cebriones, Hector\'s charioteer, a bastard\r\nson of Priam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone hit him\r\non the forehead and drove his brows into his head for the bone was\r\nsmashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He dropped\r\ndead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there was no\r\nmore life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight\r\nPatroclus, saying, "Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well\r\nhe dives. If we had been at sea this fellow would have dived from\r\nthe ship\'s side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could\r\nstomach, even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his\r\nchariot on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also\r\namong the Trojans."\r\nAs he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it\r\nwere, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck\r\nin the chest, and his courage is his own bane- even so furiously, O\r\nPatroclus, did you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from\r\nhis chariot to the ground. The pair then fought over the body of\r\nCebriones. As two lions fight fiercely on some high mountain over\r\nthe body of a stag that they have killed, even so did these two mighty\r\nwarriors, Patroclus son of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at\r\none another over the corpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let him\r\ngo when he had once got him by the head, while Patroclus kept fast\r\nhold of his feet, and a fierce fight raged between the other Danaans\r\nand Trojans. As the east and south wind buffet one another when they\r\nbeat upon some dense forest on the mountains- there is beech and ash\r\nand spreading cornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on one\r\nanother, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking- even so\r\ndid the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one another and lay about\r\neach other, and neither side would give way. Many a pointed spear fell\r\nto ground and many a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about the\r\nbody of Cebriones; many a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shield\r\nas they fought around his body, but there he lay in the whirling\r\nclouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now.\r\nSo long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of\r\neither side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went\r\ndown towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved\r\nto be beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of\r\nrange of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the\r\narmour from his shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce\r\nintent and a terrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill\r\nnine men; but as he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O\r\nPatroclus, was the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought\r\nyou in fell earnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about in\r\nthe crush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck\r\nhim from behind on his back and his broad shoulders with the flat of\r\nhis hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat the\r\nhelmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling off under the horses\'\r\nfeet, where its horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust and\r\nblood. Never indeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had served\r\nto protect the head and comely forehead of the godlike hero\r\nAchilles. Now, however, Zeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector.\r\nNevertheless the end of Hector also was near. The bronze-shod spear,\r\nso great and so strong, was broken in the hand of Patroclus, while his\r\nshield that covered him from head to foot fell to the ground as did\r\nalso the band that held it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of his\r\ncorslet.\r\nOn this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he\r\nstood as one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, the\r\nbest spearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest\r\nrunner, came behind him and struck him in the back with a spear,\r\nmidway between the shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had come\r\nup with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in\r\nall the arts of war- he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a\r\nweapon into you, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then\r\nran back into the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the\r\nwound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed\r\nthough he now was, to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the\r\nblow the god had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under\r\ncover of his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to\r\nbe wounded and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and\r\nwhen close up with him struck him in the lower part of the belly\r\nwith a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that he\r\nfell heavily to the ground to the great of the Achaeans. As when a\r\nlion has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him- the two fight\r\nfuriously upon the mountains over some little fountain at which they\r\nwould both drink, and the lion has beaten the boar till he can\r\nhardly breathe- even so did Hector son of Priam take the life of the\r\nbrave son of Menoetius who had killed so many, striking him from close\r\nat hand, and vaunting over him the while. "Patroclus," said he, "you\r\ndeemed that you should sack our city, rob our Trojan women of their\r\nfreedom, and carry them off in your ships to your own country. Fool;\r\nHector and his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defend\r\nthem. I am foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of\r\nbondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here.\r\nPoor wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; and\r\nyet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying, \'Come not\r\nback to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent the\r\nbloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body. Thus I ween did\r\nhe charge you, and your fool\'s heart answered him \'yea\' within you."\r\nThen, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight\r\nPatroclus: "Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn\r\nand Apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished\r\nme so easily, and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders;\r\nhad twenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would have\r\nfallen before my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered\r\nme, and among mortal men Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the\r\nkilling of me. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you too\r\nshall live but for a little season; death and the day of your doom are\r\nclose upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles\r\nson of Aeacus."\r\nWhen he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left\r\nhis body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad fate\r\nand bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead\r\nthough he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, "Patroclus, why\r\nshould you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of\r\nlovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and die before me?"\r\nAs he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his\r\nfoot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He\r\nthen went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet\r\ndescendant of Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal\r\nsteeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him\r\nswiftly from the field.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XVII\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'BRAVE Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had\r\nfallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armour\r\nto bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even so\r\ndid yellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his round\r\nshield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who\r\nshould dare face him. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body,\r\nand came up to Menelaus saying, "Menelaus, son of Atreus, draw back,\r\nleave the body, and let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of the\r\nTrojans and their brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, let\r\nme, therefore, have my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take\r\naim and kill you."\r\nTo this Menelaus answered in great anger "By father Jove, boasting\r\nis an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savage\r\nwild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures, than\r\nare the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out the days\r\nof his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming me the\r\nmeanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore him back to\r\ngladden his wife and parents. Even so shall I make an end of you\r\ntoo, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and do not\r\nface me, or it shall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise after\r\nthe event."\r\nEuphorbus would not listen, and said, "Now indeed, Menelaus, shall\r\nyou pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whose\r\nwife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief\r\nunspeakable on his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I\r\nbring your head and armour and place them in the hands of Panthous and\r\nnoble Phrontis. The time is come when this matter shall be fought\r\nout and settled, for me or against me."\r\nAs he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear did\r\nnot go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then took\r\naim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawing\r\nback, and Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning\r\nhis whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point\r\nwent clean through his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as\r\nhe fell heavily to the ground. His hair which was like that of the\r\nGraces, and his locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,\r\nwere all bedrabbled with blood. As one who has grown a fine young\r\nolive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water- the\r\nplant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every\r\nquarter it puts forth its white blossoms till the blasts of some\r\nfierce hurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground- even\r\nso did Menelaus strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after\r\nhe had slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the\r\npride of his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it\r\nis feeding- first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then\r\ngorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and\r\ncry against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close to\r\nhim, for they are pale with fear- even so no one had the courage to\r\nface valiant Menelaus. The son of Atreus would have then carried off\r\nthe armour of the son of Panthous with ease, had not Phoebus Apollo\r\nbeen angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of the Cicons incited\r\nHector to attack him. "Hector," said he, "you are now going after\r\nthe horses of the noble son of Aeacus, but you will not take them;\r\nthey cannot be kept in hand and driven by mortal man, save only by\r\nAchilles, who is son to an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son\r\nof Atreus has bestridden the body of Patroclus and killed the\r\nnoblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus son of Panthous, so that he can\r\nfight no more."\r\nThe god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of\r\nHector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranks\r\nand saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing\r\nfrom his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this he\r\nmade his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming\r\narmour, and crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard\r\nhim, he said to himself in his dismay, "Alas! what shall I do? I may\r\nnot let the Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen\r\nfighting on my behalf, lest some Danaan who sees me should cry shame\r\nupon me. Still if for my honour\'s sake I fight Hector and the\r\nTrojans single-handed, they will prove too many for me, for Hector\r\nis bringing them up in force. Why, however, should I thus hesitate?\r\nWhen a man fights in despite of heaven with one whom a god\r\nbefriends, he will soon rue it. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I\r\ngive place to Hector, for the hand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I\r\ncould find Ajax, the two of us would fight Hector and heaven too, if\r\nwe might only save the body of Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus.\r\nThis, of many evils would be the least."\r\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with\r\nHector at their head; he therefore drew back and left the body,\r\nturning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and\r\nmen from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is\r\ndaunted and slinks sulkily off- even so did Menelaus son of Atreus\r\nturn and leave the body of Patroclus. When among the body of his\r\nmen, he looked around for mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and presently\r\nsaw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on his men and\r\nexhorting them to keep on fighting, for Phoebus Apollo had spread a\r\ngreat panic among them. He ran up to him and said, "Ajax, my good\r\nfriend, come with me at once to dead Patroclus, if so be that we may\r\ntake the body to Achilles- as for his armour, Hector already has it."\r\nThese words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among the\r\nfront ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus of\r\nhis armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take the\r\nbody to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his\r\nshield like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter of\r\nhis men, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to the\r\nTrojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax,\r\ntherefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield and\r\nbestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have come\r\nupon him in a forest when he is with his little ones- in the pride and\r\nfierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they\r\ncover his eyes- even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, and\r\nby his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in\r\nhis heart.\r\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and\r\nrebuked him sternly. "Hector," said he, "you make a brave show, but in\r\nfight you are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to\r\nso great a reputation. Think how you may now save your town and\r\ncitadel by the hands of your own people born in Ilius; for you will\r\nget no Lycians to fight for you, seeing what thanks they have had\r\nfor their incessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do anything\r\nto help a man of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at once\r\nyour guest and comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey of the\r\nDanaans? So long as he lived he did good service both to your city and\r\nyourself; yet you had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. If\r\nthe Lycians will listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to its\r\nfate. If the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays\r\nhold of men who are fighting for their country and harassing those who\r\nwould attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Could\r\nwe get this dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, the\r\nArgives would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we should\r\nget his body to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is the\r\nforemost man at the ships of the Achaeans- he and his close-fighting\r\nfollowers. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor\r\nface him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he is a braver\r\nman than you are."\r\nHector scowled at him and answered, "Glaucus, you should know\r\nbetter. I have held you so far as a man of more understanding than any\r\nin all Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid of\r\nAjax. I fear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove\'s will\r\nis stronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man draw\r\nback and snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will set\r\nhim on to fight. Come hither then, my friend, stand by me and see\r\nindeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through as you\r\nsay, or whether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans from\r\nfighting round the body of Patroclus."\r\nAs he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, "Trojans,\r\nLycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends,\r\nand fight might and main, while I put on the goodly armour of\r\nAchilles, which I took when I killed Patroclus."\r\nWith this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men\r\nwho were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet got\r\nfar. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed\r\nhis armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to the\r\nTrojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus,\r\nwhich the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his son;\r\nbut the son did not grow old in his father\'s armour.\r\nWhen Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and\r\narming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his\r\nhead and muttered to himself saying, "A! poor wretch, you arm in the\r\narmour of a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck\r\nnothing of the doom that is already close upon you. You have killed\r\nhis comrade so brave and strong, but it was not well that you should\r\nstrip the armour from his head and shoulders. I do indeed endow you\r\nwith great might now, but as against this you shall not return from\r\nbattle to lay the armour of the son of Peleus before Andromache."\r\nThe son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted\r\nthe armour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and\r\nfilled his whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode in\r\namong the allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemed\r\nto all of them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about\r\namong them and cheered them on- Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon,\r\nThersilochus, Asteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippothous, Phorcys,\r\nChromius and Ennomus the augur. All these did he exhort saying,\r\n"Hear me, allies from other cities who are here in your thousands,\r\nit was not in order to have a crowd about me that I called you\r\nhither each from his several city, but that with heart and soul you\r\nmight defend the wives and little ones of the Trojans from the\r\nfierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress my people with your food and\r\nthe presents that make you rich. Therefore turn, and charge at the\r\nfoe, to stand or fall as is the game of war; whoever shall bring\r\nPatroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of the Trojans, and shall\r\nmake Ajax give way before him, I will give him one half of the\r\nspoils while I keep the other. He will thus share like honour with\r\nmyself."\r\nWhen he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans\r\nwith their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran high\r\nthat he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body- fools\r\nthat they were, for he was about to take the lives of many. Then\r\nAjax said to Menelaus, "My good friend Menelaus, you and I shall\r\nhardly come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for the\r\nbody of Patroclus, who will shortly become meat for the dogs and\r\nvultures of Troy, than for the safety of my own head and yours. Hector\r\nhas wrapped us round in a storm of battle from every quarter, and\r\nour destruction seems now certain. Call then upon the princes of the\r\nDanaans if there is any who can hear us."\r\nMenelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at\r\nthe top of his voice. "My friends," he cried, "princes and counsellors\r\nof the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at the\r\npublic cost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafes\r\nhim power and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannot\r\ndistinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, and\r\nthink it shame that Patroclus should become meat and morsel for Trojan\r\nhounds."\r\nFleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way\r\nthrough the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and\r\nMeriones his esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others that\r\ncame into the fight after these, who of his own self could name them?\r\nThe Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a\r\ngreat wave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born\r\nriver, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the\r\nbreakers that beat and buffet them- even with such a roar did the\r\nTrojans come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm\r\nabout the son of Menoetius, and fenced him with their bronze\r\nshields. Jove, moreover, hid the brightness of their helmets in a\r\nthick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the son of Menoetius\r\nwhile he was still alive and squire to the descendant of Aeacus;\r\ntherefore he was loth to let him fall a prey to the dogs of his foes\r\nthe Trojans, and urged his comrades on to defend him.\r\nAt first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew from\r\nthe dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing any\r\none, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not\r\nlose it long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of\r\nPeleus alike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and made\r\ntowards the front like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands\r\nat bay in the forest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that\r\nhave attacked him- even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in\r\namong the phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who had\r\nbestridden Patroclus and were most bent on winning glory by dragging\r\nhim off to their city. At this moment Hippothous brave son of the\r\nPelasgian Lethus, in his zeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging\r\nthe body off by the foot through the press of the fight, having\r\nbound a strap round the sinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon\r\nbefell him from which none of those could save him who would have\r\ngladly done so, for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote him on\r\nhis bronze-cheeked helmet. The plumed headpiece broke about the\r\npoint of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the strong\r\nhand of Ajax, so that the bloody brain came oozing out through the\r\ncrest-socket. His strength then failed him and he let Patroclus\'\r\nfoot drop from his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the body;\r\nthus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and never repaid\r\nhis parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life was cut short\r\nearly by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hector then took aim at Ajax with a\r\nspear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid it; the spear\r\npassed on and struck Schedius son of noble Iphitus, captain of the\r\nPhoceans, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over much people; it\r\nstruck him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronze point went\r\nright through him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and\r\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\r\nAjax in his turn struck noble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle of\r\nthe belly as he was bestriding Hippothous, and broke the plate of\r\nhis cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his entrails and he clutched\r\nthe ground in his palm as he fell to earth. Hector and those who\r\nwere in the front rank then gave ground, while the Argives raised a\r\nloud cry of triumph, and drew off the bodies of Phorcys and Hippothous\r\nwhich they stripped presently of their armour.\r\nThe Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and\r\ndriven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives,\r\nso great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a\r\ntriumph even against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not roused\r\nAeneas, in the likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant who\r\nhad grown old in the service of Aeneas\' aged father, and was at all\r\ntimes devoted to him. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, "Aeneas, can\r\nyou not manage, even though heaven be against us, to save high\r\nIlius? I have known men, whose numbers, courage, and self-reliance\r\nhave saved their people in spite of Jove, whereas in this case he\r\nwould much rather give victory to us than to the Danaans, if you would\r\nonly fight instead of being so terribly afraid."\r\nAeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to\r\nHector saying, "Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on us\r\nif we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through\r\nour own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me that\r\nJove the supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make for\r\nthe Danaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away dead\r\nPatroclus to the ships."\r\nAs he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then\r\nrallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son of\r\nArisbas, a valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved with\r\npity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared\r\nApisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under\r\nthe midriff, so that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was\r\nthe best man of them all after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward\r\nto avenge him and attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be,\r\ninasmuch as those about Patroclus were well covered by their\r\nshields, and held their spears in front of them, for Ajax had given\r\nthem strict orders that no man was either to give ground, or to\r\nstand out before the others, but all were to hold well together\r\nabout the body and fight hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them,\r\nand the earth ran red with blood as the corpses fell thick on one\r\nanother alike on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that of\r\nthe Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight though\r\nmany fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend\r\nand stand by one another.\r\nThus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though\r\nit had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden over\r\nall that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the dead\r\nson of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought at\r\ntheir ease in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them,\r\nand there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain.\r\nThese last moreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting, for\r\nthey were some distance apart and beyond the range of one another\'s\r\nweapons, whereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered both\r\nfrom battle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn out\r\nby the great weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes,\r\nThrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of\r\nPatroclus, and believed him to be still alive and leading the van\r\nagainst the Trojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against\r\nthe death or rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered\r\nwhen he sent them from the ships into battle.\r\nThus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the\r\nsweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their\r\nhands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of\r\nPeleus. It was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat\r\nto his men, and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in a\r\nring and tug till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for the\r\nmany that pull at it, and it is well stretched- even so did the two\r\nsides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass of but a\r\nlittle space- the Trojans steadfastly set on drag ing it into Ilius,\r\nwhile the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships; and\r\nfierce was the fight between them. Not Mars himself the lord of hosts,\r\nnor yet Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such a\r\nbattle.\r\nSuch fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordain\r\nround the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that he\r\nhad fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way off\r\nthe ships. He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead, and\r\ndeemed that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close up to\r\nthe gates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither with nor\r\nwithout himself, for his mother had often told him this when he had\r\nsat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels of\r\ngreat Jove. Now, however, she had not told him how great a disaster\r\nhad befallen him in the death of the one who was far dearest to him of\r\nall his comrades.\r\nThe others still kept on charging one another round the body with\r\ntheir pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, "My\r\nfriends, we can never again show our faces at the ships- better, and\r\ngreatly better, that earth should open and swallow us here in this\r\nplace, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearing\r\noff Patroclus to their city."\r\nThe Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying,\r\n"Friends, though we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink\r\nfrom fighting." With such words did they exhort each other. They\r\nfought and fought, and an iron clank rose through the void air to\r\nthe brazen vault of heaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacus\r\nstood out of the fight and wept when they heard that their driver\r\nhad been laid low by the hand of murderous Hector. Automedon,\r\nvaliant son of Diores, lashed them again and again; many a time did he\r\nspeak kindly to them, and many a time did he upbraid them, but they\r\nwould neither go back to the ships by the waters of the broad\r\nHellespont, nor yet into battle among the Achaeans; they stood with\r\ntheir chariot stock still, as a pillar set over the tomb of some\r\ndead man or woman, and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fell\r\nfrom their eyes as they mourned the loss of their charioteer, and\r\ntheir noble manes drooped all wet from under the yokestraps on\r\neither side the yoke.\r\nThe son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He\r\nwagged his head, and muttered to himself, saying, "Poor things, why\r\ndid we give you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are\r\nyourselves ageless and immortal? Was it that you might share the\r\nsorrows that befall mankind? for of all creatures that live and move\r\nupon the earth there is none so pitiable as he is- still, Hector son\r\nof Priam shall drive neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it.\r\nIt is enough that he should have the armour over which he vaunts so\r\nvainly. Furthermore I will give you strength of heart and limb to bear\r\nAutomedon safely to the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojans\r\ntriumph still further, and go on killing till they reach the ships;\r\nwhereon night shall fall and darkness overshadow the land."\r\nAs he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that\r\nthey shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariot\r\nswiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind\r\nthem fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture\r\namid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed he\r\ndashed amid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of his\r\npursuit he killed no man, for he could not wield his spear and keep\r\nhis horses in hand when alone in the chariot; at last, however, a\r\ncomrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of him\r\nand came up behind his chariot. "Automedon," said he, "what god has\r\nput this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind, that\r\nyou fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who was your\r\ncomrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed in the\r\narmour of the descendant of Aeacus."\r\nAutomedon son of Diores answered, "Alcimedon, there is no one else\r\nwho can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can, save\r\nonly Patroclus- while he was alive- peer of gods in counsel. Take then\r\nthe whip and reins, while I go down from the car and fight.\r\nAlcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and\r\nreins, while Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him he\r\nsaid to Aeneas who was near him, "Aeneas, counsellor of the\r\nmail-clad Trojans, I see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus come\r\ninto battle with weak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you think\r\nwell, that we might take them; they will not dare face us if we both\r\nattack them."\r\nThe valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair\r\nwent right on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dry\r\nox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also with\r\nthem, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill the\r\nmen and capture the horses- fools that they were, for they were not to\r\nreturn scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed to\r\nfather Jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strength\r\nabounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said,\r\n"Alcimedon, keep your horses so close up that I may feel their\r\nbreath upon my back; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son of\r\nPriam till he has killed us and mounted behind the horses; he will\r\nthen either spread panic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself\r\nbe killed among the foremost."\r\nOn this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, "Ajaxes\r\ncaptains of the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to them\r\nthat are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us\r\nliving; for Hector and Aeneas who are the two best men among the\r\nTrojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless\r\nthe issue lies on the lap of heaven, I will therefore hurl my spear\r\nand leave the rest to Jove."\r\nHe poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the round\r\nshield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed it\r\nnot, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part of his\r\nbelly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow behind\r\nthe horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck so\r\nthat it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus give one\r\nbound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body till\r\nit made an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but he\r\nsaw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew past\r\nhim and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on\r\nquivering till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have\r\nfought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their\r\nway through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and\r\nparted them for all their fury- for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius\r\nwere afraid and drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to the\r\nheart. Automedon, peer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of his\r\narmour and vaunted over him saying, "I have done little to assuage\r\nmy sorrow for the son of Menoetius, for the man I have killed is not\r\nso good as he was."\r\nAs he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon\r\nhis chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all\r\nsteeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.\r\nAnd now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, for\r\nMinerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command of\r\nfar-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage\r\nthe Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token to\r\nmankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men from\r\ntheir labour and plague the flocks- even so, wrapped in such radiant\r\nraiment, did Minerva go in among the host and speak man by man to\r\neach. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke to\r\nMenelaus son of Atreus, who was standing near her. "Menelaus," said\r\nshe, "it will be shame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noble\r\ncomrade of Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and\r\nurge your men to be so also."\r\nMenelaus answered, "Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva\r\nvouchsafe me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall I\r\nstand by Patroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but\r\nHector is as a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for\r\nJove is now granting him a time of triumph."\r\nMinerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the\r\nother gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders,\r\nand made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet\r\ncome again and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man\'s blood-\r\neven so bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus and\r\nthrew his spear. Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes,\r\nson of Eetion, who was both rich and valiant. Hector held him in the\r\nhighest honour for he was his comrade and boon companion; the spear of\r\nMenelaus struck this man in the girdle just as he had turned in\r\nflight, and went right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward,\r\nand Menelaus son of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the\r\nranks of his own people.\r\nApollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the\r\nlikeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the most\r\nfavoured of all Hector\'s guests. In his likeness Apollo said, "Hector,\r\nwho of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you have\r\nquailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?\r\nYet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, and\r\nhas slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podes\r\nson of Eetion.\r\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made\r\nhis way to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturn\r\nseized his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent\r\nforth his lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he\r\ngave victory to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans.\r\nThe panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping\r\nhis face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on\r\nthe upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed\r\nthe top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him\r\nfrom close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son of\r\nnoble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from\r\nfighting further. He looked about him in dismay, knowing that never\r\nagain should he wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hector\r\nwas in pursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate over\r\nhis chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and the\r\nTrojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deucalion\r\nas he was standing on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, but\r\nthe spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer of Meriones who\r\nhad come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships on foot\r\nand would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans if Coiranus had\r\nnot driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought life and rescue\r\nto Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of murderous Hector. For\r\nHector hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the spear drove\r\nout his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that he fell from\r\nhis chariot and let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones gathered\r\nthem up from the ground and took them into his own hands, then he said\r\nto Idomeneus, "Lay on, till you get back to the ships, for you must\r\nsee that the day is no longer ours."\r\nOn this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had taken\r\nhold upon him.\r\nAjax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour of\r\nthe Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. "Alas," said he, "even a\r\nfool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All their\r\nweapons strike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or a coward\r\nthat hurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one\r\nof them without effect. What, then, will be best both as regards\r\nrescuing the body, and our return to the joy of our friends who will\r\nbe grieving as they look hitherwards; for they will make sure that\r\nnothing can now check the terrible hands of Hector, and that he will\r\nfling himself upon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tell\r\nthe son of Peleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heard\r\nthe sad news that the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can see\r\nnot a man among the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots\r\nare alike hidden in darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from over\r\nthe sons of the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you\r\nwill that we perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight."\r\nFather Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwith\r\nhe chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out and\r\nall the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, "Look,\r\nMenelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him at\r\nonce to tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his\r\ncomrades has fallen."\r\nMenelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a\r\nstockyard- the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keep\r\nwatch the whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat of\r\ntheir herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain,\r\nfor darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt\r\nhim for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away- even\r\nso did Menelaus sorely against his will leave Patroclus, in great fear\r\nlest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall\r\ninto the hands of the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes\r\nstraitly saying, "Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now\r\nindeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while\r\nalive, bear it in mind now that he is dead."\r\nWith this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an\r\neagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird-\r\nhowever high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape\r\nhim by crouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it\r\nand make an end of it- even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes range\r\nround the mighty host of your followers to see if you could find the\r\nson of Nestor still alive. Presently Menelaus saw him on the extreme\r\nleft of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight\r\nboldly. Menelaus went up to him and said, "Antilochus, come here and\r\nlisten to sad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You must see\r\nwith your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans,\r\nand giving victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was the\r\nbravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run\r\ninstantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue\r\nthe body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector already\r\nhas it."\r\nAntilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was\r\nspeechless; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance,\r\nbut he did as Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had\r\ngiven his armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horses\r\nround, close beside him.\r\nThus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news\r\nto Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succour\r\nhis harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians- and\r\ngreatly did they miss him- but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and\r\nhimself went back to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxes\r\nand said, "I have sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, but\r\nrage against Hector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight\r\nwithout armour. What then will be our best plan both as regards\r\nrescuing the dead, and our own escape from death amid the battle-cries\r\nof the Trojans?"\r\nAjax answered, "Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and\r\nMeriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray,\r\nwhile we two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in\r\nheart as in name, and long used to fighting side by side with one\r\nanother."\r\nOn this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and\r\nlifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised a\r\nhue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body\r\naway, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at\r\nthe loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at him\r\nas though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns on\r\nthem in a fury, scaring and scattering them in all directions- even so\r\ndid the Trojans for a while charge in a body, striking with sword\r\nand with spears pointed ai both the ends, but when the two Ajaxes\r\nfaced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man dared\r\npress on to fight further about the dead.\r\nIn this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the\r\nbody to the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them like\r\nfierce flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city,\r\nand the houses fall in the glare of its burning- even such was the\r\nroar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore\r\nPatroclus from the field. Or as mules that put forth all their\r\nstrength to draw some beam or great piece of ship\'s timber down a\r\nrough mountain-track, and they pant and sweat as they, go even so\r\ndid Menelaus and pant and sweat as they bore the body of Patroclus.\r\nBehind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out. As some wooded\r\nmountain-spur that stretches across a plain will turn water and\r\ncheck the flow even of a great river, nor is there any stream strong\r\nenough to break through it- even so did the two Ajaxes face the\r\nTrojans and stern the tide of their fighting though they kept\r\npouring on towards them and foremost among them all was Aeneas son\r\nof Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock of daws or starlings\r\nfall to screaming and chattering when they see a falcon, foe to i\'ll\r\nsmall birds, come soaring near them, even so did the Achaean youth\r\nraise a babel of cries as they fled before Aeneas and Hector,\r\nunmindful of their former prowess. In the rout of the Danaans much\r\ngoodly armour fell round about the trench, and of fighting there was\r\nno end.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XVIII\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THUS then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the\r\nfleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached\r\nAchilles, and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that\r\nwhich was indeed too surely true. "Alas," said he to himself in the\r\nheaviness of his heart, "why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain\r\nand flocking towards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now\r\nbringing that sorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, saying\r\nthat while I was yet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fall\r\nbefore the Trojans, and see the light of the sun no longer. I fear the\r\nbrave son of Menoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet I\r\nbade him return to the ships as soon as he had driven back those\r\nthat were bringing fire against them, and not join battle with\r\nHector."\r\nAs he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and\r\ntold his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. "Alas," he cried,\r\n"son of noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that\r\nthey were untrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about\r\nhis naked body- for Hector holds his armour."\r\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled\r\nboth hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,\r\ndisfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his\r\nshirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at\r\nfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom\r\nAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,\r\nbeating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.\r\nAntilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands\r\nas he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into his\r\nown throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard him\r\nas she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,\r\nwhereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus that\r\ndwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There were\r\nGlauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and dark-eyed Halie,\r\nCymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and Agave,\r\nDoto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and\r\nCallianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea,\r\nNemertes, Apseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira\r\nand Ianassa, Maera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with\r\nother Nereids who dwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was\r\nfilled with their multitude and they all beat their breasts while\r\nThetis led them in their lament.\r\n"Listen," she cried, "sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may\r\nhear the burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I have\r\nborne the most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero\r\namong heroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plant\r\nin a goodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight\r\nthe Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house of\r\nPeleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is in\r\nheaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I\r\nwill go, that I may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallen\r\nhim though he is still holding aloof from battle."\r\nShe left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping\r\nafter, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached\r\nthe rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line\r\non to the sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons were\r\ndrawn up in close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother went\r\nup to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and\r\nspoke piteously, saying, "My son, why are you thus weeping? What\r\nsorrow has now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jove\r\nhas granted you the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands\r\nand besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up at\r\ntheir ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no longer with\r\nthem."\r\nAchilles groaned and answered, "Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed\r\nvouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me,\r\nseeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen- he whom I valued\r\nmore than all others, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have\r\nlost him; aye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous\r\narmour, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they\r\nlaid you in the couch of a mortal man. Would that you were still\r\ndwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to\r\nhimself some mortal bride. For now you shall have grief infinite by\r\nreason of the death of that son whom you can never welcome home-\r\nnay, I will not live nor go about among mankind unless Hector fall\r\nby my spear, and thus pay me for having slain Patroclus son of\r\nMenoetius."\r\nThetis wept and answered, "Then, my son, is your end near at hand-\r\nfor your own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector."\r\nThen said Achilles in his great grief, "I would die here and now, in\r\nthat I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home, and\r\nin his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is there\r\nfor me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought no\r\nsaving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so many\r\nhave been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless\r\nburden upon the earth, I, who in fight have no peer among the\r\nAchaeans, though in council there are better than I. Therefore, perish\r\nstrife both from among gods and men, and anger, wherein even a\r\nrighteous man will harden his heart- which rises up in the soul of a\r\nman like smoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops of\r\nhoney. Even so has Agamemnon angered me. And yet- so be it, for it\r\nis over; I will force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I\r\nwill go; I will pursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so\r\ndearly, and will then abide my doom when it may please Jove and the\r\nother gods to send it. Even Hercules, the best beloved of Jove- even\r\nhe could not escape the hand of death, but fate and Juno\'s fierce\r\nanger laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom\r\nawaits me. Till then I will win fame, and will bid Trojan and\r\nDardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both their\r\nhands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall they\r\nknow that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer.\r\nHold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shall\r\nnot move me."\r\nThen silver-footed Thetis answered, "My son, what you have said is\r\ntrue. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but your\r\narmour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph upon\r\nhis own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not be\r\nlasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the press\r\nof battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day I\r\nshall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King Vulcan."\r\nOn this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to\r\nthe sea-nymphs her sisters, "Dive into the bosom of the sea and go\r\nto the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as for\r\nme, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and ask\r\nhim to provide my son with a suit of splendid armour."\r\nWhen she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves,\r\nwhile silver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the\r\narmour for her son.\r\nThus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and\r\nmeanwhile the Achaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous\r\nHector till they reached the ships and the Hellespont, and they\r\ncould not draw the body of Mars\'s servant Patroclus out of reach of\r\nthe weapons that were showered upon him, for Hector son of Priam\r\nwith his host and horsemen had again caught up to him like the flame\r\nof a fiery furnace; thrice did brave Hector seize him by the feet,\r\nstriving with might and main to draw him away and calling loudly on\r\nthe Trojans, and thrice did the two Ajaxes, clothed in valour as\r\nwith a garment, beat him from off the body; but all undaunted he would\r\nnow charge into the thick of the fight, and now again he would stand\r\nstill and cry aloud, but he would give no ground. As upland\r\nshepherds that cannot chase some famished lion from a carcase, even so\r\ncould not the two Ajaxes scare Hector son of Priam from the body of\r\nPatroclus.\r\nAnd now he would even have dragged it off and have won\r\nimperishable glory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way\r\nas messenger from Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She\r\ncame secretly without the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for\r\nJuno sent her, and when she had got close to him she said, "Up, son of\r\nPeleus, mightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this\r\nfearful fight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another,\r\nthe Danaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans are\r\ntrying to hale it away, and take it to wind Ilius: Hector is the\r\nmost furious of them all; he is for cutting the head from the body and\r\nfixing it on the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no\r\nlonger; shrink from the thought that Patroclus may become meat for the\r\ndogs of Troy. Shame on you, should his body suffer any kind of\r\noutrage."\r\nAnd Achilles said, "Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you\r\nto me?"\r\nIris answered, "It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son of\r\nSaturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the\r\nimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus."\r\nThen fleet Achilles answered her saying, "How can I go up into the\r\nbattle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I should\r\nsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from\r\nVulcan; I know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of\r\nAjax son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front\r\nrank and wielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus."\r\nIris said, \'We know that your armour has been taken, but go as you\r\nare; go to the deep trench and show yourelf before the Trojans, that\r\nthey may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons of\r\nthe Achaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may\r\nhardly be."\r\nIris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove\r\narose, and Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong\r\nshoulders; she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which\r\nshe kindled a glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into\r\nheaven from some city that is being beleaguered on an island far out\r\nat sea- all day long do men sally from the city and fight their\r\nhardest, and at the going down of the sun the line of beacon-fires\r\nblazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near them to behold,\r\nif so be that they may come with their ships and succour them- even so\r\ndid the light flare from the head of Achilles, as he stood by the\r\ntrench, going beyond the wall- but he aid not join the Achaeans for he\r\nheeded the charge which his mother laid upon him.\r\nThere did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice\r\nfrom afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing as\r\nthe note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gates\r\nof a city, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus, and when\r\nthe Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the horses\r\nturned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, and their\r\ndrivers were awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyed\r\ngoddess had kindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.\r\nThrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,\r\nand thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into\r\nconfusion; whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath\r\nthe wheels of their chariots and perished by their own spears. The\r\nAchaeans to their great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the\r\nweapons, and laid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning round\r\nhim, and among them fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his\r\ntrue comrade lying dead upon his bier. He had sent him out with horses\r\nand chariots into battle, but his return he was not to welcome.\r\nThen Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters\r\nof Oceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and\r\nturmoil of war.\r\nNow the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their\r\nhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They\r\nkept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen\r\nupon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having held\r\naloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first to\r\nspeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both before\r\nand after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon the\r\nsame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed\r\nthem thus:-\r\n"Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to\r\nyour city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are\r\nfar from our walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon\r\nthe Achaeans were easier to deal with, and I would have gladly\r\ncamped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now I go in\r\ngreat fear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that he will\r\nnever bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight\r\nwith equal valour, but he will try to storm our city and carry off our\r\nwomen. Do then as I say, and let us retreat. For this is what will\r\nhappen. The darkness of night will for a time stay the son of\r\nPeleus, but if he find us here in the morning when he sallies forth in\r\nfull armour, we shall have knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad\r\nindeed will he be who can escape and get back to Ilius, and many a\r\nTrojan will become meat for dogs and vultures may I never live to hear\r\nit. If we do as I say, little though we may like it, we shall have\r\nstrength in counsel during the night, and the great gates with the\r\ndoors that close them will protect the city. At dawn we can arm and\r\ntake our stand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies from\r\nthe ships to fight us. He will go back when he has given his horses\r\ntheir fill of being driven all whithers under our walls, and will be\r\nin no mind to try and force his way into the city. Neither will he\r\never sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so."\r\nHector looked fiercely at him and answered, "Polydamas, your words\r\nare not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within the\r\ncity. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? In\r\nthe old-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over for its\r\nwealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of our\r\nhouses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia,\r\nfor the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,\r\nthat the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here\r\nand to hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this\r\nfool\'s wise among the people. You will have no man with you; it\r\nshall not be; do all of you as I now say;- take your suppers in your\r\ncompanies throughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful\r\nevery man of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let\r\nhim gather them and give them out among the people. Better let\r\nthese, rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm\r\nand fight about the ships; granted that Achilles has again come\r\nforward to defend them, let it be as he will, but it shall go hard\r\nwith him. I shall not shun him, but will fight him, to fall or\r\nconquer. The god of war deals out like measure to all, and the\r\nslayer may yet be slain."\r\nThus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted in\r\napplause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.\r\nThey gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words of\r\nPolydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout the\r\nhost, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned\r\nPatroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his\r\nmurderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again and\r\nagain as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed him\r\nof his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he is\r\nfurious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he can\r\nfind him, for he is mad with rage- even so with many a sigh did\r\nAchilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, "Alas! vain were the\r\nwords with which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said\r\nthat I would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had\r\nsacked Ilius and taken his share of the spoils- but Jove does not give\r\nall men their heart\'s desire. The same soil shall be reddened here\r\nat Troy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed\r\nhome by the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in\r\nthis place shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now\r\nthat I am left behind you, I will not bury you, till I have brought\r\nhither the head and armour of mighty Hector who has slain you.\r\nTwelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead before your bier to\r\navenge you; till I have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships,\r\nand fair women of Troy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with spear and\r\nstrength of arm when we sacked men\'s goodly cities, shall weep over\r\nyou both night and day."\r\nThen Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire\r\nthat they might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon they\r\nset a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw\r\nsticks on to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the\r\nflame played about the belly of the tripod. When the water in the\r\ncauldron was boiling they washed the body, anointed it with oil, and\r\nclosed its wounds with ointment that had been kept nine years. Then\r\nthey laid it on a bier and covered it with a linen cloth from head\r\nto foot, and over this they laid a fair white robe. Thus all night\r\nlong did the Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn Patroclus.\r\nThen Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, "So, Queen Juno, you have\r\ngained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think\r\nthat the Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood."\r\nAnd Juno answered, "Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this\r\nthing? May not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we\r\ndo, do what he can for another person? And shall not I- foremost of\r\nall goddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign in\r\nheaven- devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?"\r\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of\r\nVulcan, imperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in\r\nheaven, a house of bronze wrought by the lame god\'s own hands. She\r\nfound him busy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was\r\nmaking twenty tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, and\r\nhe set wheels of gold under them all that they might go of their own\r\nselves to the assemblies of the gods, and come back again- marvels\r\nindeed to see. They were finished all but the ears of cunning\r\nworkmanship which yet remained to be fixed to them: these he was now\r\nfixing, and he was hammering at the rivets. While he was thus at\r\nwork silver-footed Thetis came to the house. Charis, of graceful\r\nhead-dress, wife to the far-famed lame god, came towards her as soon\r\nas she saw her, and took her hand in her own, saying, "Why have you\r\ncome to our house, Thetis, honoured and ever welcome- for you do not\r\nvisit us often? Come inside and let me set refreshment before you."\r\nThe goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a\r\nrichly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also\r\nunder her feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, "Vulcan, come here,\r\nThetis wants you"; and the far-famed lame god answered, "Then it is\r\nindeed an august and honoured goddess who has come here; she it was\r\nthat took care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall which\r\nI had through my cruel mother\'s anger- for she would have got rid of\r\nme because I was lame. It would have gone hardly with me had not\r\nEurynome, daughter of the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, and\r\nThetis, taken me to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them,\r\nand many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups,\r\nand chains, did I make for them in their cave, with the roaring waters\r\nof Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever past it; and no one knew,\r\nneither of gods nor men, save only Thetis and Eurynome who took care\r\nof me. If, then, Thetis has come to my house I must make her due\r\nrequital for having saved me; entertain her, therefore, with all\r\nhospitality, while I put by my bellows and all my tools."\r\nOn this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs\r\nplying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and\r\ngathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and\r\nwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned\r\nhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door.\r\nThere were golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like\r\nreal young women, with sense and reason, voice also and strength,\r\nand all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves as\r\nthe king bade them, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon a\r\ngoodly seat, and took her hand in his own, saying, "Why have you\r\ncome to our house, Thetis honoured and ever welcome- for you do not\r\nvisit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for you at once if\r\nI can, and if it can be done at all."\r\nThetis wept and answered, "Vulcan, is there another goddess in\r\nOlympus whom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so much\r\naffliction as he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he\r\nmake subject to a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely\r\nagainst my will did I submit to the embraces of one who was but\r\nmortal, and who now stays at home worn out with age. Neither is this\r\nall. Heaven vouchsafed me a son, hero among heroes, and he shot up\r\nas a sapling. I tended him as a plant in a goodly garden and sent\r\nhim with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans, but never shall I\r\nwelcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to look\r\nupon the light of the sun, he is in heaviness, and though I go to\r\nhim I cannot help him; King Agamemnon has made him give up the\r\nmaiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded him, and he wastes\r\nwith sorrow for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed the Achaeans in at\r\ntheir ships\' sterns and would not let them come forth; the elders,\r\ntherefore, of the Argives besought Achilles and offered him great\r\ntreasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance to them himself, but\r\nput his own armour on Patroclus and sent him into the fight with\r\nmuch people after him. All day long they fought by the Scaean gates\r\nand would have taken the city there and then, had not Apollo\r\nvouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of Menoetius\r\nafter he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am suppliant at\r\nyour knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son, whose end is\r\nnear at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves fitted\r\nwith ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own when\r\nhis true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now lies\r\nstretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul."\r\nAnd Vulcan answered, "Take heart, and be no more disquieted about\r\nthis matter; would that I could hide him from death\'s sight when his\r\nhour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze\r\nthe eyes of all who behold it."\r\nWhen he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning\r\nthem towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows\r\nblew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some\r\nfierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as\r\nVulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper into\r\nthe fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its\r\nblock, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the\r\ntongs in the other.\r\nFirst he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over\r\nand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and\r\nthe baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five\r\nthicknesses, and with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.\r\nHe wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her\r\nfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face of\r\nheaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men\r\nalso call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing.\r\nOrion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.\r\nHe wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of\r\nmen. In the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were\r\ngoing about the city with brides whom they were escorting by\r\ntorchlight from their chambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the\r\nyouths danced to the music of flute and lyre, while the women stood\r\neach at her house door to see them.\r\nMeanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a\r\nquarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man\r\nwho had been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid\r\ndamages in full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was\r\ntrying to make his own case good, and the people took sides, each\r\nman backing the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them\r\nback, and the elders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn\r\ncircle, holding the staves which the heralds had put into their hands.\r\nThen they rose and each in his turn gave judgement, and there were two\r\ntalents laid down, to be given to him whose judgement should be deemed\r\nthe fairest.\r\nAbout the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming\r\narmour, and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and\r\naccept the half of what it contained. But the men of the city would\r\nnot yet consent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives\r\nand little children kept guard upon the walls, and with them were\r\nthe men who were past fighting through age; but the others sallied\r\nforth with Mars and Pallas Minerva at their head- both of them wrought\r\nin gold and clad in golden raiment, great and fair with their armour\r\nas befitting gods, while they that followed were smaller. When they\r\nreached the place where they would lay their ambush, it was on a\r\nriverbed to which live stock of all kinds would come from far and near\r\nto water; here, then, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some\r\nway off them there were two scouts who were on the look-out for the\r\ncoming of sheep or cattle, which presently came, followed by two\r\nshepherds who were playing on their pipes, and had not so much as a\r\nthought of danger. When those who were in ambush saw this, they cut\r\noff the flocks and herds and killed the shepherds. Meanwhile the\r\nbesiegers, when they heard much noise among the cattle as they sat\r\nin council, sprang to their horses, and made with all speed towards\r\nthem; when they reached them they set battle in array by the banks\r\nof the river, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one\r\nanother. With them were Strife and Riot, and fell Fate who was\r\ndragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound, and the other\r\nunwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging him along by\r\nhis heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men\'s blood. They went in and\r\nout with one another and fought as though they were living people\r\nhaling away one another\'s dead.\r\nHe wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed\r\nalready. Many men were working at the plough within it, turning\r\ntheir oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned\r\non reaching the headland a man would come up to them and give them a\r\ncup of wine, and they would go back to their furrows looking forward\r\nto the time when they should again reach the headland. The part that\r\nthey had ploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it\r\nwas of gold, still looked as if it were being ploughed- very curious\r\nto behold.\r\nHe wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were\r\nreaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to\r\nthe ground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound\r\nthem in bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind\r\nthem there were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept\r\non bringing them to be bound: among them all the owner of the land\r\nstood by in silence and was glad. The servants were getting a meal\r\nready under an oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were\r\nbusy cutting him up, while the women were making a porridge of much\r\nwhite barley for the labourers\' dinner.\r\nHe wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines\r\nwere loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the\r\nvines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal\r\nall round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one\r\npath to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gather\r\nthe vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried\r\nthe luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with them there went a\r\nboy who made sweet music with his lyre, and sang the Linus-song with\r\nhis clear boyish voice.\r\nHe wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold and\r\ntin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go and\r\nfeed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Along\r\nwith the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, and\r\ntheir nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had\r\nfastened on a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and\r\nbellow as he might they haled him, while the dogs and men gave\r\nchase: the lions tore through the bull\'s thick hide and were gorging\r\non his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen were afraid to do\r\nanything, and only hounded on their dogs; the dogs dared not fasten on\r\nthe lions but stood by barking and keeping out of harm\'s way.\r\nThe god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and large\r\nflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.\r\nFurthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made\r\nin Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and\r\nmaidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another\'s\r\nwrists. The maidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths well\r\nwoven shirts that were slightly oiled. The girls were crowned with\r\ngarlands, while the young men had daggers of gold that hung by\r\nsilver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly in a ring with\r\nmerry twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting at his work and\r\nmaking trial of his wheel to see whether it will run, and sometimes\r\nthey would go all in line with one another, and much people was\r\ngathered joyously about the green. There was a bard also to sing to\r\nthem and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in\r\nthe midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.\r\nAll round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream\r\nof the river Oceanus.\r\nThen when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made a\r\nbreastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made helmet,\r\nclose fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume\r\noverhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.\r\nLastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took\r\nit and set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like a\r\nfalcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming\r\narmour from the house of Vulcan.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XIX\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\r\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\r\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\r\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also\r\nof his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came\r\namong them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, "My son, grieve as\r\nwe may we must let this man lie, for it is by heaven\'s will that he\r\nhas fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly\r\narmour, which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders."\r\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out\r\nbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none\r\ndared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused\r\nto still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for\r\nhe was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had\r\nmade him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at\r\nit, he said to his mother, "Mother, the god has given me armour,\r\nmeet handiwork for an immortal and such as no living could have\r\nfashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon\r\nthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his\r\nbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot."\r\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, "My son, be not disquieted about this\r\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\r\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle.\r\nHe may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound\r\nas ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in\r\nassembly; unsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight\r\nwith might and main."\r\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she\r\nthen dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus,\r\nthat his body might suffer no change.\r\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called\r\non the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always\r\nat the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who\r\nwere about the ships and served out rations, all came to the place\r\nof assembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof\r\nso long from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of\r\nTydeus, came limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless\r\nthey came, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last\r\nof all came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of\r\nAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.\r\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, "Son\r\nof Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\r\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would\r\nhave been better, had Diana\'s arrow slain her at the ships on the\r\nday when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an\r\nAchaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the days\r\nof my anger. It has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the\r\nAchaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it\r\nbe, for it is over. If we have been angry, necessity has schooled\r\nour anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever;\r\ntherefore, bid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out against\r\nthe Trojans, and learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep by\r\nthe ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who may\r\nfly my spear when I wield it."\r\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\r\nhis anger.\r\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\r\nmiddle of the assembly. "Danaan heroes," said he, "servants of Mars,\r\nit is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not\r\nseemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised\r\nspeaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'orator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of\r\nPeleus, and do you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have\r\nthe Achaeans spoken to me of this matter and upbraided me, but it\r\nwas not I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in\r\ndarkness struck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I took\r\nfrom Achilles the meed that had been awarded to him. What could I\r\ndo? All things are in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest of\r\nJove\'s daughters, shuts men\'s eyes to their destruction. She walks\r\ndelicately, not on the solid earth, but hovers over the heads of men\r\nto make them stumble or to ensnare them.\r\n"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest\r\nwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him\r\non the day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair\r\ncity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, \'Hear me all\r\ngods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day\r\nshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man\r\nchild into the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him\r\nwho are of my blood and lineage.\' Then said Juno all crafty and full\r\nof guile, \'You will play false, and will not hold to your word.\r\nSwear me, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this\r\nday fall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that\r\ndwell about him who are of your blood and lineage.\'\r\n"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great\r\noath, to his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high\r\nsummit of Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew\r\nthat the noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being\r\nwith child and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth\r\nthough there was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring\r\nof Alcmena, and kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove\r\nthe son of Saturn, and said, \'Father Jove, lord of the lightning- I\r\nhave a word for your ear. There is a fine child born this day,\r\nEurystheus, son to Sthenelus the son of Perseus; he is of your\r\nlineage; it is well, therefore, that he should reign over the\r\nArgives.\'\r\n"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\r\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she\r\nagain invade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all.\r\nThen he whirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down\r\nfrom heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he\r\nwas ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel\r\nlabours that Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when\r\nmighty Hector was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time\r\nI kept thinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove\r\nrobbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much\r\ntreasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your\r\npeople with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you\r\nyesterday in your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you\r\nwould fain fight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my\r\nship, that you may see whether what I give you is enough."\r\nAnd Achilles answered, "Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you\r\ncan give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them:\r\nit is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not\r\nwell to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as\r\nyet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost,\r\nand laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of\r\nyou when he is fighting."\r\nThen Ulysses said, "Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the\r\nAchaeans thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the\r\nbattle will be no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has\r\nfilled both sides with fury; bid them first take food both bread and\r\nwine by the ships, for in this there is strength and stay. No man\r\ncan do battle the livelong day to the going down of the sun if he is\r\nwithout food; however much he may want to fight his strength will fail\r\nhim before he knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his\r\nlimbs will grow weary under him. But a man can fight all day if he\r\nis full fed with meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength\r\nwill stay till he has routed all his foes; therefore, send the\r\npeople away and bid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring\r\nout the gifts in presence of the assembly, that all may see them and\r\nyou may be satisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before the\r\nArgives that he has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor\r\nbeen with her after the manner of men and women; and do you, too, show\r\nyourself of a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in his\r\ntents with a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your\r\ndues in full. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteously\r\nin future; it is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends\r\nif he was wrong in the first instance."\r\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, "Son of Laertes, your words please me\r\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\r\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name\r\nof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain\r\nfight at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from\r\nmy tent and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge\r\nyou: take some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my\r\ntents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the\r\nwomen also; furthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those\r\nthat are with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to\r\nthe sun."\r\nThen said Achilles, "Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to\r\nthese matters at some other season, when there is breathing time and\r\nwhen I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those\r\nwhom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the\r\nplain? Let the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and\r\nwithout food, till we have avenged them; afterwards at the going\r\ndown of the sun let them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying\r\ndead in my tent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the door, and\r\nhis comrades are mourning round him. Therefore I can take thought of\r\nnothing save only slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throat\r\nof the dying."\r\nUlysses answered, "Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the\r\nAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a\r\nlittle, but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of\r\ngreater knowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is\r\na thing of which men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward,\r\nweighs the upshot, it may well prove that the straw which our\r\nsickles have reaped is far heavier than the grain. It may not be\r\nthat the Achaeans should mourn the dead with their bellies; day by day\r\nmen fall thick and threefold continually; when should we have\r\nrespite from our sorrow? Let us mourn our dead for a day and bury them\r\nout of sight and mind, but let those of us who are left eat and\r\ndrink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely. In that hour\r\nlet no man hold back, waiting for a second summons; such summons shall\r\nbode ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships; let us\r\nrather sally as one man and loose the fury of war upon the Trojans."\r\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with\r\nMeges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes,\r\nand Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The\r\nword was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out\r\nthe seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty\r\nmetal cauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought the women\r\nskilled in useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made\r\neight. Ulysses weighed out the ten talents of gold and then led the'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'way back, while the young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts,\r\nand laid them in the middle of the assembly.\r\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a\r\ngod came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife\r\nwhich he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by\r\ncutting off some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in\r\nprayer as he did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silent\r\nand orderly to hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of\r\nheaven and prayed saying, "I call Jove the first and mightiest of\r\nall gods to witness, I call also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who\r\ndwell below and take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that\r\nI have laid no hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to my\r\nbed nor otherwise, but that she has remained in my tents inviolate. If\r\nI swear falsely may heaven visit me with all the penalties which it\r\nmetes out to those who perjure themselves."\r\nHe cut the boar\'s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled\r\nit round his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the\r\nfishes. Then Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, "Father Jove,\r\nof a truth you blind men\'s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had\r\nnot else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken\r\nBriseis from me against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled\r\nthe destruction of many an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that we\r\nmay begin fighting."\r\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\r\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to the\r\nship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the\r\nstable-men drove the horses in among the others.\r\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of\r\nPatroclus, flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her\r\nbreast, her neck, and her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful\r\nas a goddess she wept and said, "Patroclus, dearest friend, when I\r\nwent hence I left you living; I return, O prince, to find you dead;\r\nthus do fresh sorrows multiply upon me one after the other. I saw\r\nhim to whom my father and mother married me, cut down before our city,\r\nand my three own dear brothers perished with him on the self-same day;\r\nbut you, Patroclus, even when Achilles slew my husband and sacked\r\nthe city of noble Mynes, told me that I was not to weep, for you\r\nsaid you would make Achilles marry me, and take me back with him to\r\nPhthia, we should have a wedding feast among the Myrmidons. You were\r\nalways kind to me and I shall never cease to grieve for you."\r\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making\r\nas though their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was\r\nweeping for her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round\r\nAchilles and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not\r\ndo so. "I pray you," said he, "if any comrade will hear me, bid me\r\nneither eat nor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay\r\nfasting even to the going down of the sun."\r\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\r\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\r\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his\r\nsorrow: but he would not be comforted till he should have flung\r\nhimself into the jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking\r\never of Patroclus. Then he said-\r\n"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\r\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were\r\nhasting to fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and\r\ndrink in my tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this\r\nI could not know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my\r\nfather, who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who\r\nam here fighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake\r\nof Helen, nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more- he\r\nwho is being brought up in Scyros- if indeed Neoptolemus is still\r\nliving. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy\r\naway from Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my son\r\nwith you in your own ship, and show him all my property, my\r\nbondsmen, and the greatness of my house- for Peleus must surely be\r\neither dead, or what little life remains to him is oppressed alike\r\nwith the infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he should\r\nhear the sad tidings of my death."\r\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each\r\nthought on what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn\r\nlooked down with pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, "My\r\nchild, you have quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out\r\nof your recollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for\r\nthe loss of his dear comrade, and though the others are gone to\r\ntheir dinner he will neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar\r\nand ambrosia into his breast, that he may know no hunger."\r\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\r\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing on\r\nhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\r\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and\r\nambrosia into Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his\r\nlimbs to fail him, she went back to the house of her mighty father.\r\nThick as the chill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on\r\nthe keen blasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming\r\nhelmets, the bossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the\r\nashen spears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the\r\nwhole land was radiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of\r\nthe tramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the midst\r\nof them all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes\r\ngleamed like fire, for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus,\r\nthen, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the\r\ngod, the armour that Vulcan had made him.\r\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and\r\nnext he did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the\r\nsilver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up\r\nthe shield so great and strong that shone afar with a splendour as\r\nof the moon. As the light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men\r\nhave lit a fire in their homestead high up among the mountains, but\r\nthe sailors are carried out to sea by wind and storm far from the\r\nhaven where they would be- even so did the gleam of Achilles\' wondrous\r\nshield strike up into the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet,\r\nand set it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and the\r\ngolden plumes which Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of the\r\nhelmet, waved all around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself in\r\nhis armour to see whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could\r\nplay freely under it, and it seemed to buoy him up as though it had\r\nbeen wings.\r\nHe also drew his father\'s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\r\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only\r\nAchilles had strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash\r\nfrom the topmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given\r\nto Peleus, fraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus\r\nbusied themselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the\r\nbands fast about them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the\r\nreins back towards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up\r\nbehind the horses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour,\r\nresplendent as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he\r\nchided with his father\'s horses saying, "Xanthus and Balius, famed\r\noffspring of Podarge- this time when we have done fighting be sure and\r\nbring your driver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do\r\nnot leave him dead on the plain as you did Patroclus."\r\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke- for white-armed Juno had\r\nendowed him with human speech- and he bowed his head till his mane\r\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. "Dread\r\nAchilles," said he, "we will indeed save you now, but the day of\r\nyour death is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be\r\nheaven and stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through\r\nany sloth or slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus\r\nof his armour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew\r\nhim as he fought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to\r\nHector. We two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest\r\nof all winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a\r\nman and of a god."\r\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\r\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, "Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\r\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\r\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\r\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of\r\nfighting."\r\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XX\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son\r\nof Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over\r\nagainst them armed upon the rise of the plain.\r\nMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis\r\ngather the gods in council, whereon she went about and called them\r\nto the house of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor\r\na single one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of\r\nrivers and meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of\r\ncloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades of\r\npolished marble which Vulcan with his consummate skill had made for\r\nfather Jove.\r\nIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove.\r\nNeptune also, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the\r\ngoddess, and came up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in\r\nthe midst of them, he asked what Jove\'s purpose might be. "Why,"\r\nsaid he, "wielder of the lightning, have you called the gods in\r\ncouncil? Are you considering some matter that concerns the Trojans and\r\nAchaeans- for the blaze of battle is on the point of being kindled\r\nbetween them?"\r\nAnd Jove answered, "You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and\r\nwherefore I have called you hither. I take thought for them even in\r\ntheir destruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt.\r\nOlympus and look on in peace, but do you others go about among Trojans\r\nand Achaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed.\r\nIf Achilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make no\r\nstand against him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, and\r\nnow that he is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will override\r\nfate itself and storm their city."\r\nThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took\r\ntheir several sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,\r\nearth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent\r\nin all cunning- all these joined the host that came from the ships;\r\nwith them also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his\r\nthin legs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the\r\nTrojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer\r\ngoddess Diana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.\r\nSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the\r\nAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight\r\nwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for\r\nfear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his\r\narmour, and looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians\r\ncame to take their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife,\r\nrouser of hosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by\r\nthe deep trench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all\r\nher might upon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out\r\nupon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on\r\nthe Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now\r\nspeeding up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hill\r\nCallicolone.\r\nThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce\r\ncontention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered\r\nfrom heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth,\r\nand bade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests of\r\nmany-fountained Ida quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and the\r\nships of the Achaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struck\r\nwith fear; he sprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud in\r\nterror lest Neptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the ground\r\nover his head, and lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight of\r\nmortals and immortals- mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods\r\nshudder to think of them. Such was the uproar as the gods came\r\ntogether in battle. Apollo with his arrows took his stand to face King\r\nNeptune, while Minerva took hers against the god of war; the'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'archer-goddess Diana with her golden arrows, sister of far-darting\r\nApollo, stood to face Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer of good luck\r\nfaced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men can Scamander, but\r\ngods Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan.\r\nThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the\r\nheart of Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was\r\nwith his blood that he longed above all things else to glut the\r\nstubborn lord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack\r\nthe son of Peleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with the\r\nvoice of Lycaon son of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said to\r\nAeneas, "Aeneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave\r\nwords with which you vaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes,\r\nsaying that you would fight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?"\r\nAnd Aeneas answered, "Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son\r\nof Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it\r\nwould not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Right\r\nfrom Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and\r\nPedasus; Jove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to\r\nfly, else had the fallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who\r\nwent before him to protect him and urged him to fall upon the\r\nLelegae and Trojans. No man may fight Achilles, for one of the gods is\r\nalways with him as his guardian angel, and even were it not so, his\r\nweapon flies ever straight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him\r\nwho is against him; if heaven would let me fight him on even terms\r\nhe should not soon overcome me, though he boasts that he is made of\r\nbronze."\r\nThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, "Nay, hero, pray to the\r\never-living gods, for men say that you were born of Jove\'s daughter\r\nVenus, whereas Achilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is\r\nchild to Jove, while Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea.\r\nBring, therefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare\r\nyou with his taunts and menaces."\r\nAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his\r\npeople, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost\r\nfighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed\r\nJuno, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called\r\nthe gods about her, and said, "Look to it, you two, Neptune and\r\nMinerva, and consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been\r\nsending Aeneas clad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn\r\nhim back at once, or shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him\r\nwith strength so that his heart fail not, and he may learn that the\r\nchiefs of the immortals are on his side, while the others who have all\r\nalong been defending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come\r\ndown from Olympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take\r\nno hurt at the hands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever\r\nfate may have spun out for him when he was begotten and his mother\r\nbore him. If Achilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, he\r\nmay come to fear presently when one of us meets him in battle, for the\r\ngods are terrible if they are seen face to face."\r\nNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, "Juno,\r\nrestrain your fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing\r\nthe other gods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our\r\nown side; let us take our places on some hill out of the beaten track,\r\nand let mortals fight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus\r\nApollo begin fighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot\r\nfight, we too, will at once raise the cry of battle, and in that\r\ncase they will soon leave the field and go back vanquished to\r\nOlympus among the other gods."\r\nWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high\r\nearth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the\r\nTrojans and Pallas Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster was\r\nchasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those\r\nthat were with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of\r\ndarkness; but the other gods seated themselves on the brow of\r\nCallicolone round you, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities.\r\nThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side\r\nwas willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat\r\non high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was\r\nalive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The\r\nearth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushed\r\ntowards each other, and two champions, by far the foremost of them\r\nall, met between the hosts to fight- to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises,\r\nand noble Achilles.\r\nAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet\r\ntossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his\r\nbreast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the\r\nother side sprang forth to meet him, fike some fierce lion that the\r\nwhole country-side has met to hunt and kill- at first he bodes no ill,\r\nbut when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches\r\nopenmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail\r\nfrom side to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs\r\nstraight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain\r\namong the foremost of his foes- even with such fury did Achilles\r\nburn to spring upon Aeneas.\r\nWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to\r\nspeak. "Aeneas," said he, "why do you stand thus out before the host\r\nto fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat\r\nof Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over\r\nto you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Or\r\nhave the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness,\r\nfair with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This\r\nyou shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you\r\nforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds\r\nhelter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to\r\nlook behind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the\r\ncity, and with the help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and\r\ncarried its women into captivity, though Jove and the other gods\r\nrescued you. You think they will protect you now, but they will not do\r\nso; therefore I say go back into the host, and do not face me, or\r\nyou will rue it. Even a fool may be wise after the event."\r\nThen Aeneas answered, "Son of Peleus, think not that your words\r\ncan scare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag\r\nand talk unseemly. We know one another\'s race and parentage as matters\r\nof common fame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I\r\nyours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and that your\r\nmother is Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble\r\nAnchises for my father, and Venus for my mother; the parents of one or\r\nother of us shall this day mourn a son, for it will be more than silly\r\ntalk that shall part us when the fight is over. Learn, then, my\r\nlineage if you will- and it is known to many.\r\n"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded\r\nDardania, for Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to\r\ndwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained\r\nIda. Dardanus had a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of\r\nall men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by the\r\nwater-meadows, they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamoured of\r\nthem as they were feeding, and covered them in the semblance of a\r\ndark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bear\r\nhim, and these, as they sped over the rich plain, would go bounding on\r\nover the ripe ears of corn and not break them; or again when they\r\nwould disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they could\r\ngallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius begat Tros, king of the\r\nTrojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and\r\nGanymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried\r\nhim off to be Jove\'s cupbearer, for his beauty\'s sake, that he might\r\ndwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and Laomedon begat\r\nTithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the stock of Mars.\r\nBut Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to Anchises, who was my\r\nfather, while Hector is son to Priam.\r\n"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove\r\ngives it or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let\r\nthere be no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were\r\nchildren. We could fling taunts without end at one another; a\r\nhundred-oared galley would not hold them. The tongue can run all\r\nwhithers and talk all wise; it can go here and there, and as a man\r\nsays, so shall he be gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hard\r\nlike women who when they fall foul of one another go out and wrangle\r\nin the streets, one half true and the other lies, as rage inspires\r\nthem? No words of yours shall turn me now that I am fain to fight-\r\ntherefore let us make trial of one another with our spears."\r\nAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of\r\nAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus\r\nheld the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid,\r\nfor he deemed that Aeneas\'s spear would go through it quite easily,\r\nnot reflecting that the god\'s glorious gifts were little likely to\r\nyield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas\'s spear did\r\nnot pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god,\r\nstayed the point. It went through two layers, but the god had made the\r\nshield in five, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and\r\none of gold; it was in this that the spear was stayed.\r\nAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas at\r\nthe very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian\r\nash went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was\r\nafraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him;\r\nthe spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the\r\nground, after having gone through both circles of the sheltering\r\nshield. Aeneas though he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded\r\nwith fear and grief because the weapon had gone so near him; then\r\nAchilles sprang furiously upon him, with a cry as of death and with\r\nhis keen blade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that\r\ntwo men, as men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas\r\nwielded it quite easily.\r\nAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards\r\nhim, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and\r\nAchilles would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword,\r\nhad not Neptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said\r\nforthwith to the immortals, "Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who\r\nwill now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of\r\nPeleus. Fool that he was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo.\r\nApollo will never save him from destruction. Why should this man\r\nsuffer when he is guiltless, to no purpose, and in another\'s\r\nquarrel? Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the\r\ngods that dwell in heaven? Let us then snatch him from death\'s jaws,\r\nlest the son of Saturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated,\r\nmoreover, that he should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whom\r\nJove loved above all the sons born to him of mortal women, shall not\r\nperish utterly without seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated the\r\nblood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he and\r\nhis children\'s children that shall be born hereafter."\r\nThen answered Juno, "Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and\r\nconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer\r\nhim, brave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of\r\nPeleus. For of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full\r\nmany a time before all the immortals, that never would we shield\r\nTrojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the\r\nflames that the Achaeans shall kindle."\r\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle\r\namid the clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and\r\nAeneas were. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son\r\nof Peleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of\r\nAeneas, and laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas\r\non high from off the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of\r\nmany a band of warriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god\'s\r\nhand sped him, till he came to the very fringe of the battle where the\r\nCauconians were arming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the\r\nearth, then came near to him and said, Aeneas, what god has egged\r\nyou on to this folly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a\r\nmightier man of valour and more beloved of heaven than you are? Give\r\nway before him whensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the\r\nhouse of Hades even though fate would have it otherwise. When Achilles\r\nis dead you may then fight among the foremost undaunted, for none\r\nother of the Achaeans shall slay you."\r\nThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at\r\nonce removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened\r\nthem wide indeed and said in great anger, "Alas! what marvel am I\r\nnow beholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him\r\nwhom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must\r\nbe under heaven\'s protection, although I had thought his boasting\r\nwas idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me\r\nfurther, seeing how narrowly he has missed being killed. I will now\r\ngive my orders to the Danaans and attack some other of the Trojans."\r\nHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did\r\nso. "Let not the Trojans," he cried, "keep you at arm\'s length,\r\nAchaeans, but go for them and fight them man for man. However\r\nvaliant I may be, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all of\r\nthem. Even Mars, who is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from\r\nflinging himself into the jaws of such a fight and laying about him;\r\nnevertheless, so far as in me lies I will show no slackness of hand or\r\nfoot nor want of endurance, not even for a moment; I will utterly\r\nbreak their ranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture within\r\nreach of my spear."\r\nThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans\r\nand declared that he would fight Achilles. "Be not afraid, proud\r\nTrojans," said he, "to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods\r\nmyself if the battle were one of words only, but they would be more\r\nthan a match for me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed\r\nof Achilles will fall somewhat short of his word; he will do in\r\npart, and the other part he will clip short. I will go up against\r\nhim though his hands be as fire- though his hands be fire and his\r\nstrength iron."\r\nThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the\r\nAchaeans, and raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into\r\nthe midst of their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and\r\nsaid, "Hector, on no account must you challenge Achilles to single\r\ncombat; keep a lookout for him while you are under cover of the others\r\nand away from the thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit you\r\nwith a spear or cut you down at close quarters."\r\nThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was\r\nafraid when he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then\r\nsprang upon the Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with\r\na garment. First he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much\r\npeople whom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities,\r\nin the land of Hyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles\r\nstruck him full on the head as he was coming on towards him, and split\r\nit clean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles\r\nvaunted over him saying, "You he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero;\r\nyour death is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your\r\nfather\'s estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying\r\nwaters of Hermus."\r\nThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The\r\nchariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him in\r\nthe front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a\r\nvaliant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple\r\nthrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the\r\nspear, but it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain\r\ninside was shed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended.\r\nThen he struck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from\r\nhis chariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his\r\nlast, bellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to\r\noffer him in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the\r\nearth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying.\r\nAchilles then went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his\r\nfather had always forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of\r\nhis sons, the one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his\r\nfolly and showing off the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about\r\namong front ranks until he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in\r\nthe middle of the back as he was darting past him: he struck him\r\njust at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the two pieces\r\nof the double breastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced\r\nhim through and came out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on\r\nto his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sank\r\nholding his entrails in his hands.\r\nWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands\r\nand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he\r\ncould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his\r\nspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When\r\nAchilles saw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, "This is he\r\nthat has wounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved\r\ncomrade. Not for long shall we two quail before one another on the\r\nhighways of war."\r\nHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, "Draw near, that you may meet\r\nyour doom the sooner." Hector feared him not and answered, "Son of\r\nPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a\r\nchild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are\r\na mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue\r\nlies in the the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may\r\nnot slay you with my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now."\r\nHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and\r\nthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going\r\ntowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet in\r\nfront of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,\r\nbent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, and\r\nhid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him\r\nspear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. When\r\nhe rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, he\r\nshouted aloud saying, "Hound, this time too you have escaped death-\r\nbut of a truth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom\r\nit seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved you;\r\nbut if I too have any friend among the gods I will surely make an\r\nend of you when I come across you at some other time. Now, however,\r\nI will pursue and overtake other Trojans."\r\nOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his\r\nneck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and\r\nstayed Demouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great\r\nstature, by hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him\r\nwith his sword and killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and\r\nDardanus, sons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the one\r\nwith a blow from a thrown spear, while the other he cut down in\r\nhand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of Alastor- he came up\r\nto Achilles and clasped his knees in the hope that he would spare\r\nhim and not kill him but let him go, because they were both of the\r\nsame age. Fool, he might have known that he should not prevail with\r\nhim, for the man was in no mood for pity or forbearance but was in\r\ngrim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid hold of his knees and sought\r\na hearing for his prayers, Achilles drove his sword into his liver,\r\nand the liver came rolling out, while his bosom was all covered with\r\nthe black blood that welled from the wound. Thus did death close his\r\neyes as he lay lifeless.\r\nAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a\r\nspear, and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He\r\nalso struck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which\r\nbecame warm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes\r\nof Echeclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded\r\nDeucalion in the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united,\r\nwhereon he waited Achilles\' onset with his arm hanging down and\r\ndeath staring him in the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow\r\nfrom his sword and flung it helmet and all away from him, and the\r\nmarrow came oozing out of his backbone as he lay. He then went in\r\npursuit of Rhigmus, noble son of Peires, who had come from fertile\r\nThrace, and struck him through the middle with a spear which fixed\r\nitself in his belly, so that he fell headlong from his chariot. He\r\nalso speared Areithous squire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turning\r\nhis horses in flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while the\r\nhorses were struck with panic.\r\nAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought- and the\r\ndense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of\r\nfire in every direction- even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding\r\nhis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom he\r\nwould slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\r\nbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor- and\r\nit is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle- even\r\nso did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of the\r\nslain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car were\r\nbespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses\' hoofs, and\r\nfrom the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to\r\nwin still further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XXI\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NOW when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,\r\nbegotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one\r\nhalf he chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that\r\nthe Achaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day\r\nwith Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and Juno\r\nsent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other half\r\nwere hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into it\r\nwith a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again,\r\nas they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirling\r\neddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire-\r\nthe flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they\r\nhuddle into the water- even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus\r\nfilled with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in\r\nconfusion before Achilles.\r\nForthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it\r\nagainst a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god,\r\narmed with his sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the\r\nTrojans down on every side. Their dying groans rose hideous as the\r\nsword smote them, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish fly\r\nscared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some\r\nfair haven- for he is sure to eat all he can catch- even so did the\r\nTrojans cower under the banks of the mighty river, and when\r\nAchilles\' arms grew weary with killing them, he drew twelve youths\r\nalive out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of\r\nMenoetius. He drew them out like dazed fawns, bound their hands behind\r\nthem with the girdles of their own shirts, and gave them over to his\r\nmen to take back to the ships. Then he sprang into the river,\r\nthirsting for still further blood.\r\nThere he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was\r\nescaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner\r\nwhen he was in his father\'s vineyard, having set upon him by night, as\r\nhe was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker\r\nsides of a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares,\r\nand sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him.\r\nBut a guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum,\r\nand sent him to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his\r\nfather\'s house. He had spent eleven days happily with his friends\r\nafter he had come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again\r\ndelivered him into the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the\r\nhouse of Hades sorely against his will. He was unarmed when Achilles\r\ncaught sight of him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he\r\nany spear, for he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank,\r\nand was sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that\r\nhis strength was now failing him.\r\nThen Achilles said to himself in his surprise, "What marvel do I see\r\nhere? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over into\r\nLemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising from\r\nthe world below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison\r\nhim, as they do many another whether he will or no? This time let\r\nhim taste my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth\r\nwho can keep even a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or\r\nwhether thence too he will return."\r\nThus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and\r\ntrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.\r\nAchilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon\r\nran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed\r\nover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for\r\nblood. With one hand he caught Achilles\' knees as he besought him, and\r\nwith the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go. Then\r\nhe said, "Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am your\r\nsuppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the day\r\nwhen you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold away\r\nto Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you the\r\nprice of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain my\r\nfreedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after much\r\nsuffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.\r\nSurely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you a\r\nsecond time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,\r\ndaughter of aged Altes- of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegae\r\nand holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his\r\ndaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,\r\nboth of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus as\r\nhe was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall\r\nme, for I fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has delivered\r\nme over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart,\r\nspare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your\r\nbrave and noble comrade."\r\nWith such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles;\r\nbut Achilles answered him sternly. "Idiot," said he, "talk not to me\r\nof ransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans\r\nquarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive;\r\nbut now not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my\r\nhands before the city of Ilius- and of all Trojans it shall fare\r\nhardest with the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall\r\ndie. Why should you whine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was a\r\nbetter man than you are. I too- see you not how I am great and goodly?\r\nI am son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, but\r\nthe hands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. The day\r\nwill come, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when one\r\nshall take my life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an\r\narrow sped from his bow."\r\nThus did he speak, and Lycaon\'s heart sank within him. He loosed his\r\nhold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles\r\ndrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; he\r\nplunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he\r\nlay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him\r\ntill the earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot and\r\nflung him into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him the\r\nwhile, and saying, "Lie there among the fishes, who will lick the\r\nblood from your wound and gloat over it; your mother shall not lay you\r\non any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall bear you\r\ninto the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on the\r\nfat of Lycaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the waters- so\r\nperish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius- you in\r\nflight, and I following after to destroy you. The river with its broad\r\nsilver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you\r\noffered him and all the horses that you flung living into his\r\nwaters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not a\r\nman of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and the\r\nhavoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I\r\nheld aloof from battle."\r\nSo spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and\r\npondered within himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles and\r\nsave the Trojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear\r\nin hand, sprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was\r\nson to the broad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of\r\nAcessamenus; for the river had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out\r\nof the water to face him with a spear in either hand, and Xanthus\r\nfilled him with courage, being angry for the death of the youths\r\nwhom Achilles was slaying ruthlessly within his waters. When they were\r\nclose up with one another Achilles was first to speak. "Who and whence\r\nare you," said he, "who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whose\r\nson stands up against me." And the son of Pelegon answered, "Great son\r\nof Peleus, why should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile land\r\nof far Paeonia, captain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven days\r\nthat I am at Ilius. I am of the blood of the river Axius- of Axius\r\nthat is the fairest of all rivers that run. He begot the famed warrior\r\nPelegon, whose son men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles."\r\nThus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.\r\nAsteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both hands\r\nalike; with the one spear he struck Achilles\' shield, but did not\r\npierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;\r\nwith the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right arm\r\ndrawing dark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed\r\nitself in the ground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles,\r\nfain to kill him, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit\r\nhim and struck the steep bank of the river, driving the spear half its\r\nlength into the earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and\r\nsprang furiously upon him. Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw\r\nAchilles\' spear out of the bank by main force; thrice did he tug at\r\nit, trying with all his might to draw it out, and thrice he had to\r\nleave off trying; the fourth time he tried to bend and break it, but\r\nere he could do so Achilles smote him with his sword and killed him.\r\nHe struck him in the belly near the navel, so that all his bowels came\r\ngushing out on to the ground, and the darkness of death came over\r\nhim as he lay gasping. Then Achilles set his foot on his chest and\r\nspoiled him of his armour, vaunting over him and saying, "Lie there-\r\nbegotten of a river though you be, it is hard for you to strive with\r\nthe offspring of Saturn\'s son. You declare yourself sprung from the\r\nblood of a broad river, but I am of the seed of mighty Jove. My father\r\nis Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aeacus was\r\nthe son of Jove. Therefore as Jove is mightier than any river that\r\nflows into the sea, so are his children stronger than those of any\r\nriver whatsoever. Moreover you have a great river hard by if he can be\r\nof any use to you, but there is no fighting against Jove the son of\r\nSaturn, with whom not even King Achelous can compare, nor the mighty\r\nstream of deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all\r\nsprings and deep wells proceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings of\r\ngreat Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing out of heaven."\r\nWith this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that\r\nhe had killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand,\r\nwith the dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy\r\nnibbling and gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he\r\nwent in chase of the Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of\r\nthe river in panic when they saw their leader slain by the hands of\r\nthe son of Peleus. Therein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus,\r\nMnesus, Thrasius, Oeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slain\r\nyet others, had not the river in anger taken human form, and spoken to\r\nhim from out the deep waters saying, "Achilles, if you excel all in\r\nstrength, so do you also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you\r\nto protect you: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to you\r\nto destroy all the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream,\r\nand do your grim work on land. My fair waters are now filled with\r\ncorpses, nor can I find any channel by which I may pour myself into\r\nthe sea for I am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilessly\r\nslaying. I am in despair, therefore, O captain of your host, trouble\r\nme no further."\r\nAchilles answered, "So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I\r\nwill never cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pent\r\nthem up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that I\r\nmay learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him."\r\nAs he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the\r\ngods. But the river said to Apollo, "Surely, son of Jove, lord of\r\nthe silver bow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged\r\nyou straitly that you should stand by the Trojans and defend them,\r\ntill twilight fades, and darkness is over an the earth."\r\nMeanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon the\r\nriver raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream\r\ninto a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain\r\nand left within his waters. These he cast out on to the land,\r\nbellowing like a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding\r\nthem in his mighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered\r\nabout Achilles, falling upon him and beating on his shield, so that he\r\ncould not keep his feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it\r\ncame up by the roots, and tore away the bank, damming the stream\r\nwith its thick branches and bridging it all across; whereby Achilles\r\nstruggled out of the stream, and fled full speed over the plain, for\r\nhe was afraid.\r\nBut the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him\r\nwith a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans\r\nfrom destruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear\'s throw from\r\nhim; swift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest\r\nand fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the\r\narmour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but the\r\nriver with a loud roar came tearing after. As one who would water\r\nhis garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, and\r\nall his ground-spade in hand he clears away the dams to free the\r\nchannels, and the little stones run rolling round and round with the\r\nwater as it goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow-\r\neven so did the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a\r\nfleet runner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he would\r\nstrive to stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in\r\nheaven were in league against him, so often would the mighty wave come\r\nbeating down upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying on\r\nand on in great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as it\r\nflowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet.\r\nThen the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, "Father\r\nJove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save\r\nme from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards. I\r\nblame none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do my\r\ndear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was to\r\nfall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would\r\nthat Hector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me; then\r\nshould I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems\r\nthat I shall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as\r\nthough I were some swineherd\'s boy, who gets carried down a torrent\r\nwhile trying to cross it during a storm."\r\nAs soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him in\r\nthe likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.\r\nNeptune spoke first. "Son of Peleus," said he, "be not so exceeding\r\nfearful; we are two gods, come with Jove\'s sanction to assist you,\r\nI, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river; he\r\nwill abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you,\r\nif you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting\r\ntill you have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius- as\r\nmany of them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the ships,\r\nfor we will vouchsafe you a triumph over him."\r\nWhen they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but\r\nAchilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge the\r\ngods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of\r\nwaters, and much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain was\r\nrifting about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against the\r\nstream, speeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him,\r\nfor Minerva had endowed him with great strength. Nevertheless\r\nScamander did not slacken in his pursuit, but was still more furious\r\nwith the son of Peleus. He lifted his waters into a high crest and\r\ncried aloud to Simois saying, "Dear brother, let the two of us unite\r\nto save this man, or he will sack the mighty city of King Priam, and\r\nthe Trojans will not hold out against him. Help me at once; fill\r\nyour streams with water from their sources, rouse all your torrents to\r\na fury; raise your wave on high, and let snags and stones come\r\nthundering down you that we may make an end of this savage creature\r\nwho is now lording it as though he were a god. Nothing shall serve him\r\nlonger, not strength nor comeliness, nor his fine armour, which\r\nforsooth shall soon be lying low in the deep waters covered over\r\nwith mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour tons of shingle round him,\r\nso that the Achaeans shall not know how to gather his bones for the\r\nsilt in which I shall have hidden him, and when they celebrate his\r\nfuneral they need build no barrow."\r\nOn this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles,\r\nseething as it was with foam and blood and the bo&ies of the dead. The\r\ndark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed\r\nthe son of Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept\r\naway in the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to\r\nVulcan her son. "Crook-foot," she cried, "my child, be up and doing,\r\nfor I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at\r\nonce, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the\r\nwhite south wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear\r\nthe flames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume\r\nthem, while you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and\r\nwrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither by\r\nfair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then\r\nyou may stay your flames."\r\nOn this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the\r\nplain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose\r\nbodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain\r\nwas dried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an\r\norchard that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and\r\nthe heart of the owner is glad- even so the whole plan was dried and\r\nthe dead bodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on to\r\nthe river. He burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus\r\nalso, with the rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the\r\nbanks of the river. The eels and fishes that go darting about\r\neverywhere in the water, these, too, were sorely harassed by the\r\nflames that cunning Vulcan had kindled, and the river himself was\r\nscalded, so that he spoke saying, "Vulcan, there is no god can hold\r\nhis own against you. I cannot fight you when you flare out your flames\r\nin this way; strive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive the\r\nTrojans out of city immediately. What have I to do with quarrelling\r\nand helping people?"\r\nHe was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a\r\ncauldron upon \'a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of\r\nsome fatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the\r\ndry faggots blaze under it- even so were the goodly waters of\r\nXanthus heated with the fire till they were boiling. He could flow\r\nno longer but stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts\r\nof fire which cunning Vulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno and\r\nbesought her saying, "Juno, why should your son vex my stream with\r\nsuch especial fury? I am not so much to blame as all the others are\r\nwho have been helping the Trojans. I will leave off, since you so\r\ndesire it, and let son leave off also. Furthermore I swear never again\r\nwill I do anything to save the Trojans from destruction, not even when\r\nall Troy is burning in the flames which the Achaeans will kindle."\r\nAs soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, "Son\r\nVulcan, hold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence\r\nagainst a god for the sake of mortals."\r\nWhen she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river\r\nwent back once more into his own fair bed.\r\nXanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno\r\nstayed them though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke\r\nout among the other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell\r\non one another with a mighty uproar- earth groaned, and the spacious\r\nfirmament rang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he was\r\nsitting on Olympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to\r\nblows among themselves. They were not long about beginning, and Mars\r\npiercer of shields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at\r\nonce upon Minerva and reviled her. "Why, vixen," said he, "have you\r\nagain set the gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your\r\nheart? Have you forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound\r\nme, and yourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurt\r\nof my fair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me."\r\nAs he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis- so\r\nterrible that not even can Jove\'s lightning pierce it. Here did\r\nmurderous Mars strike her with his great spear. She drew back and with\r\nher strong hand seized a stone that was lying on the plain- great\r\nand rugged and black- which men of old had set for the boundary of a\r\nfield. With this she struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down.\r\nNine roods did he cover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in\r\nthe dust, while his armour rang rattling round him. But Minerva\r\nlaughed and vaunted over him saying, "Idiot, have you not learned\r\nhow far stronger I am than you, but you must still match yourself\r\nagainst me? Thus do your mother\'s curses now roost upon you, for she\r\nis angry and would do you mischief because you have deserted the\r\nAchaeans and are helping the Trojans."\r\nShe then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove\'s\r\ndaughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all the\r\ntime, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come to\r\nhimself again. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, "Look,\r\ndaughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again\r\ntaking Mars through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at\r\nonce."\r\nThus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at\r\nher, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fell\r\nfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full\r\nlength. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, "May all who help the\r\nTrojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart\r\nas Venus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Had\r\nthis been so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking the\r\nstrong city of Ilius."\r\nJuno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo\r\nsaying, "Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm\'s length? it is\r\nnot well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be\r\ndisgraceful to us if we return to Jove\'s bronze-floored mansion on\r\nOlympus without having fought each other; therefore come on, you are\r\nthe younger of the two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am\r\nolder and have had more experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and\r\nforget how we two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius\r\nwhen we came from Jove\'s house and worked for Laomedon a whole year at\r\na stated wage and he gave us his orders. I built the Trojans the\r\nwall about their city, so wide and fair that it might be\r\nimpregnable, while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of\r\nmany valleyed Ida. When, however, the glad hours brought round the\r\ntime of payment, mighty Laomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent us\r\noff with nothing but abuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot and\r\nsell us over into some distant island. He tried, moreover, to cut\r\noff the ears of both of us, so we went away in a rage, furious about\r\nthe payment he had promised us, and yet withheld; in spite of all\r\nthis, you are now showing favour to his people, and will not join us\r\nin compassing the utter ruin of the proud Trojans with their wives and\r\nchildren."\r\nAnd King Apollo answered, "Lord of the earthquake, you would have no\r\nrespect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable\r\nmortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the\r\nfield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this\r\nfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves."\r\nHe turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the\r\nbrother of his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana,\r\npatroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, "So you\r\nwould fly, Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheap\r\nvaunt to boot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again\r\nhear you bragging in my father\'s house, as you have often done in\r\nthe presence of the immortals, that you would stand up and fight\r\nwith Neptune."\r\nApollo made her no answer, but Jove\'s august queen was angry and\r\nupbraided her bitterly. "Bold vixen," she cried, "how dare you cross\r\nme thus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own\r\nagainst me. Jove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill\r\nthem whenever you choose. You will And it better to chase wild\r\nbeasts and deer upon the mountains than to fight those who are\r\nstronger than you are. If you would try war, do so, and find out by\r\npitting yourself against me, how far stronger I am than you are."\r\nShe caught both Diana\'s wrists with her left hand as she spoke,\r\nand with her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as\r\nshe beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed\r\nunder her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she\r\nfled weeping from under Juno\'s hand as a dove that flies before a\r\nfalcon to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune\r\nto escape. Even so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and\r\narrows behind her.\r\nThen the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, "Leto, I\r\nshall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove\'s\r\nwives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you\r\nworsted me in fair fight."\r\nLeto then gathered up Diana\'s bow and arrows that had fallen about\r\namid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste\r\nafter her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove\'s bronze-floored\r\nmansion on Olympus, and sat herself down with many tears on the\r\nknees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all\r\nabout her. The son of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughing\r\npleasantly the while began to question her saying, "Which of the\r\nheavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating you in this cruel\r\nmanner, as though you had been misconducting yourself in the face of\r\neverybody?" and the fair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, "It\r\nwas your wife Juno, father, who has been beating me; it is always\r\nher doing when there is any quarrelling among the immortals."\r\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the\r\nstrong city of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not\r\nhold out and the Danaans should take the city then and there, before\r\nits hour had come; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back,\r\nsome angry and some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats\r\nbeside Jove lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on\r\ndealing out death alike on the Trojans and on their As when the\r\nsmoke from some burning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the\r\ngods has kindled it- there is then toil for all, and sorrow for not\r\na few- even so did Achilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.\r\nOld King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on\r\nhuge Achilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there\r\nwas none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and\r\nwith many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave\r\nwarders of the gate. "Keep the gates," said he, "wide open till the\r\npeople come flying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is\r\ndriving them in rout before him. I see we are in great peril. As\r\nsoon as our people are inside and in safety, close the strong gates\r\nfor I fear lest that terrible man should come bounding inside along\r\nwith the others."\r\nAs he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and\r\nwhen these were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans.\r\nApollo then came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect\r\nthem. Right for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and\r\ngrimy with dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his\r\nspear furiously behind them. For he was as one possessed, and was\r\nthirsting after glory.\r\nThen had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy if\r\nApollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor. He\r\nput courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him,\r\nleaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. When\r\nAgenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with\r\ncare. "Alas," said he to himself in his dismay, "if I fly before\r\nmighty Achilles, and go where all the others are being driven in rout,\r\nhe will none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How would\r\nit be were I to let Achilles drive the others before him, and then fly\r\nfrom the wall to the plain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs\r\nof Ida and can hide in the underwood that is thereon? I could then\r\nwash the sweat from off me in the river and in the evening return to\r\nIlius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he would\r\nsee me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and would\r\nspeed after me till he had caught me- I should stand no chance against\r\nhim, for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out and\r\nmeet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be\r\npierced by pointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and men\r\nsay that he is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son of\r\nSaturn vouchsafes him."\r\nSo saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now\r\nfain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert\r\nto attack a hunter- she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the\r\nbaying of the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and\r\nwound her either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has\r\npierced her she will not give in till she has either caught him in her\r\ngrip or been killed outright- even so did noble Agenor son of\r\nAntenor refuse to fly till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim\r\nat him with his spear, holding his round shield before him and\r\ncrying with a loud voice. "Of a truth," said he, "noble Achilles,\r\nyou deem that you shall this day sack the city of the proud Trojans.\r\nFool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there is many\r\na brave man of us still inside who will stand in front of our dear\r\nparents with our wives and children, to defend Ilius. Here\r\ntherefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you cue.\r\nAs he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the\r\nspear struck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly\r\nwrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him\r\nwhom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayed\r\nit. Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not\r\nvouchsafe him glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a\r\nthick mist, sending him out of the battle unmolested Then he\r\ncraftily drew the son of Peleus away from going after the host, for he\r\nput on the semblance of Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who ran\r\ntowards him to give him chase and pursued him over the corn lands of\r\nthe plain, turning him towards the deep waters of the river Scamander.\r\nApollo ran but a little way before him and beguiled Achilles by making\r\nhim think all the time that he was on the point of overtaking him.\r\nMeanwhile the rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within\r\nthe city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare\r\nwait for one another outside the city walls, to learn who had\r\nescaped and who were fallen in fight, but all whose feet and knees\r\ncould still carry them poured pell-mell into the town.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XXII\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat\r\nfrom off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the\r\ngoodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon\r\ntheir shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector\r\nstay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus\r\nApollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, "Why, son of Peleus, do you,\r\nwho are but man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yet\r\nfound out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not\r\nharass the Trojans whom you had routed, and now they are within\r\ntheir walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from them. Me you\r\ncannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me."\r\nAchilles was greatly angered and said, "You have baulked me,\r\nFar-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from\r\nthe wall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got\r\nwithin Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the\r\nTrojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I\r\nwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so."\r\nOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the\r\nwinning horse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is\r\nflying over the plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of\r\nAchilles bear him onwards. King Priam was first to note him as he\r\nscoured the plain, all radiant as the star which men call Orion\'s\r\nHound, and whose beams blaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantly\r\nthan those of any other that shines by night; brightest of them all\r\nthough he be, he yet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire and\r\nfever in his train- even so did Achilles\' armour gleam on his breast\r\nas he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry and beat his head with his\r\nhands as he lifted them up and shouted out to his dear son,\r\nimploring him to return; but Hector still stayed before the gates, for\r\nhis heart was set upon doing battle with Achilles. The old man reached\r\nout his arms towards him and bade him for pity\'s sake come within\r\nthe walls. "Hector," he cried, "my son, stay not to face this man\r\nalone and unsupported, or you will meet death at the hands of the\r\nson of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster that he is;\r\nwould indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do, for so, dogs\r\nand vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth, and a\r\nload of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a brave son\r\nhas he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them away in\r\nthe islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons from\r\namong the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon and\r\nPolydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be\r\nstill alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with\r\ngold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed\r\nhis daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the house\r\nof Hades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeit\r\nthe grief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perish\r\nat the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to be\r\nthe guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose\r\nyour own life and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have\r\npity also on your unhappy father while life yet remains to him- on me,\r\nwhom the son of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the\r\nthreshold of old age, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters\r\nhaled away as captives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children\r\ndashed to earth amid the rage of battle, and my sons\' wives dragged\r\naway by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will\r\ntear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the life\r\nout of my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fed\r\nat my own table to guard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and\r\nthen lie all distraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the\r\nsword in battle, he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly;\r\nlet what will be seen, all is honourable in death, but when an old man\r\nis slain there is nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs\r\nshould defile his grey hair and beard and all that men hide for\r\nshame."\r\nThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the\r\nheart of Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared\r\nher bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. "Hector,"\r\nshe cried, weeping bitterly the while, "Hector, my son, spurn not this\r\nbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort\r\nfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall\r\nto protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should the\r\nwretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever\r\nweep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs\r\nwill devour you at the ships of the Achaeans."\r\nThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved\r\nnot the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge\r\nAchilles as he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon the\r\nmountains, full fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of\r\nman- he is filled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes\r\nwrithing round his den- even so Hector leaned his shield against a\r\ntower that jutted out from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.\r\n"Alas," said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, "if I go\r\nwithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon\r\nme, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city\r\non that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would\r\nnot listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now\r\nthat my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and\r\nTrojan women in the face, lest a worse man should say, \'Hector has\r\nruined us by his self-confidence.\' Surely it would be better for me to\r\nreturn after having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die\r\ngloriously here before the city. What, again, if were to lay down my\r\nshield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up\r\nto noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who was\r\nthe fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrus\r\nbrought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans\r\ndivide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?\r\nI might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take a\r\nsolemn oath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into two\r\nshares all that is within the city- but why argue with myself in\r\nthis way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; he\r\nwould kill me then and there as easily as though I were a woman,\r\nwhen I had off my armour. There is no parleying with him from some\r\nrock or oak tree as young men and maidens prattle with one another.\r\nBetter fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe\r\nvictory."\r\nThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were\r\nMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he\r\nbrandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed\r\naround him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell\r\nupon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he\r\nwas but fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted\r\nafter him at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all\r\nbirds, swoops down upon some cowering dove- the dove flies before\r\nhim but the falcon with a shrill scream follows close after,\r\nresolved to have her- even so did Achilles make straight for Hector\r\nwith all his might, while Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as\r\nhis limbs could take him.\r\nOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the\r\nwall, past the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild\r\nfig-tree, till they came to two fair springs which feed the river\r\nScamander. One of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it\r\nas smoke from a burning fire, but the other even in summer is as\r\ncold as hail or snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by\r\nthe springs, are the goodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the\r\ntime of peace before the coming of the Achaeans the wives and fair\r\ndaughters of the Trojans used to wash their clothes. Past these did\r\nthey fly, the one in front and the other giving ha. behind him: good\r\nwas the man that fled, but better far was he that followed after,\r\nand swiftly indeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast for\r\nsacrifice or bullock\'s hide, as it might be for a common foot-race,\r\nbut they ran for the life of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speed\r\nround the turning-posts when they are running for some great prize-\r\na tripod or woman- at the games in honour of some dead hero, so did\r\nthese two run full speed three times round the city of Priam. All\r\nthe gods watched them, and the sire of gods and men was the first to\r\nspeak.\r\n"Alas," said he, "my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being\r\npursued round the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for\r\nHector, who has burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my\r\nhonour, at one while on the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the\r\ncitadel of Troy; and now I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him\r\nround the city of Priam. What say you? Consider among yourselves and\r\ndecide whether we shall now save him or let him fall, valiant though\r\nhe be, before Achilles, son of Peleus."\r\nThen Minerva said, "Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of\r\ncloud and storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom\r\nhas long been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we\r\nothers shall not be of a mind with you."\r\nAnd Jove answered, "My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not\r\nspeak in full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without\r\nlet or hindrance as you are minded."\r\nThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she\r\ndarted from the topmost summits of Olympus.\r\nAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a\r\nfawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and\r\nhunts through glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by\r\ncrouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and\r\nfollow her up until he gets her- even so there was no escape for\r\nHector from the fleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get\r\nnear the Dardanian gates and under the walls, that his people might\r\nhelp him by showering down weapons from above, Achilles would gain\r\non him and head him back towards the plain, keeping himself always\r\non the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to lay hands upon\r\nanother whom he is pursuing- the one cannot escape nor the other\r\novertake- even so neither could Achilles come up with Hector, nor\r\nHector break away from Achilles; nevertheless he might even yet have\r\nescaped death had not the time come when Apollo, who thus far had\r\nsustained his strength and nerved his running, was now no longer to\r\nstay by him. Achilles made signs to the Achaean host, and shook his\r\nhead to show that no man was to aim a dart at Hector, lest another\r\nmight win the glory of having hit him and he might himself come in\r\nsecond. Then, at last, as they were nearing the fountains for the\r\nfourth time, the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed a\r\ndoom in each of them, one for Achilles and the other for Hector. As he\r\nheld the scales by the middle, the doom of Hector fell down deep\r\ninto the house of Hades- and then Phoebus Apollo left him. Thereon\r\nMinerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said, "Noble\r\nAchilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to the\r\nships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lust\r\nof battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his father,\r\naegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here and take\r\nbreath, while I go up to him and persuade him to make a stand and\r\nfight you."\r\nThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,\r\nleaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him\r\nand went after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She\r\ncame close up to him and said, "Dear brother, I see you are hard\r\npressed by Achilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of\r\nPriam, let us await his onset and stand on our defence."\r\nAnd Hector answered, "Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to\r\nme of all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth\r\nI shall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured\r\noutside the wall for my sake when all the others remain inside."\r\nThen Minerva said, "Dear brother, my father and mother went down\r\non their knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain\r\ninside, so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an\r\nagony of grief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a\r\nstand and fight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve,\r\nthat we may learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our\r\nspoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before you."\r\nThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two\r\nwere now close to one another great Hector was first to speak. "I\r\nwill-no longer fly you, son of Peleus," said he, "as I have been doing\r\nhitherto. Three times have I fled round the mighty city of Priam,\r\nwithout daring to withstand you, but now, let me either slay or be\r\nslain, for I am in the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to\r\none another by our gods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians\r\nof all covenants; let it be agreed between us that if Jove\r\nvouchsafes me the longer stay and I take your life, I am not to\r\ntreat your dead body in any unseemly fashion, but when I have stripped\r\nyou of your armour, I am to give up your body to the Achaeans. And\r\ndo you likewise."\r\nAchilles glared at him and answered, "Fool, prate not to me about\r\ncovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and\r\nlambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out an\r\nthrough. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,\r\nnor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall\r\nfall and glut grim Mars with his life\'s blood. Put forth all your\r\nstrength; you have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier\r\nand man of war. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will\r\nforthwith vanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for\r\nthe grief you have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have\r\nkilled in battle."\r\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it\r\ncoming and avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew\r\nover his head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it\r\nup and gave it back to Achilles without Hector\'s seeing her; Hector\r\nthereon said to the son of Peleus, "You have missed your aim,\r\nAchilles, peer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the\r\nhour of my doom, though you made sure that he had done so. You were\r\na false-tongued liar when you deemed that I should forget my valour\r\nand quail before you. You shall not drive spear into the back of a\r\nrunaway- drive it, should heaven so grant you power, drive it into\r\nme as I make straight towards you; and now for your own part avoid\r\nmy spear if you can- would that you might receive the whole of it into\r\nyour body; if you were once dead the Trojans would find the war an\r\neasier matter, for it is you who have harmed them most."\r\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true\r\nfor he hit the middle of Achilles\' shield, but the spear rebounded\r\nfrom it, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that\r\nthe weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay\r\nfor he had no second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus and\r\nasked him for one, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and\r\nsaid to himself, "Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I\r\ndeemed that the hero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the\r\nwall, and Minerva has inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly\r\nnear at hand and there is no way out of it- for so Jove and his son\r\nApollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been\r\never ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then\r\ndie ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some\r\ngreat thing that shall be told among men hereafter."\r\nAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong\r\nby his side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like\r\na soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or\r\ntimid hare- even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon\r\nAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous\r\nshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four\r\nlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold\r\nwi which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the\r\nevening star that shines brighter than all others through the\r\nstillness of night, even such was the gleam of the spear which\r\nAchilles poised in his right hand, fraught with the death of noble\r\nHector. He eyed his fair flesh over and over to see where he could\r\nbest wound it, but all was protected by the goodly armour of which\r\nHector had spoiled Patroclus after he had slain him, save only the\r\nthroat where the collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders,\r\nand this is a most deadly place: here then did Achilles strike him\r\nas he was coming on towards him, and the point of his spear went right\r\nthrough the fleshy part of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe\r\nso that he could still speak. Hector fell headlong, and Achilles\r\nvaunted over him saying, "Hector, you deemed that you should come\r\noff scatheless when you were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not of\r\nmyself who was not with him. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade,\r\nmightier far than he, was still left behind him at the ships, and\r\nnow I have laid you low. The Achaeans shall give him all due funeral\r\nrites, while dogs and vultures shall work their will upon yourself."\r\nThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, "I pray you by\r\nyour life and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at\r\nthe ships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and\r\nbronze which my father and mother will offer you, and send my body\r\nhome, that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire\r\nwhen I am dead."\r\nAchilles glared at him and answered, "Dog, talk not to me neither of\r\nknees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able to\r\ncut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done me,\r\nas I am that nothing shall save you from the dogs- it shall not be,\r\nthough they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on\r\nthe spot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son of\r\nDardanus should bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so your\r\nmother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son she\r\nbore, but dogs and vultures shall eat you utterly up."\r\nHector with his dying breath then said, "I know you what you are,\r\nand was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as\r\niron; look to it that I bring not heaven\'s anger upon you on the day\r\nwhen Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you\r\nat the Scaean gates."\r\nWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his\r\nsoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting\r\nits sad fate that it should en\' youth and strength no longer. But\r\nAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, "Die; for my part I will\r\naccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it."\r\nAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one\r\nside; then he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector\'s\r\nshoulders while the other Achaeans came running up to view his\r\nwondrous strength and beauty; and no one came near him without\r\ngiving him a fresh wound. Then would one turn to his neighbour and\r\nsay, "It is easier to handle Hector now than when he was flinging fire\r\non to our ships" and as he spoke he would thrust his spear into him\r\nanew.\r\nWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among\r\nthe Argives and said, "My friends, princes and counsellors of the\r\nArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who\r\nhas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether\r\nwe should not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind\r\nthe Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert\r\ntheir city now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even\r\nthough he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in this\r\nway, while Patroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and\r\nunmourned- he Whom I can never forget so long as I am alive and my\r\nstrength fails not? Though men forget their dead when once they are\r\nwithin the house of Hades, yet not even there will I forget the\r\ncomrade whom I have lost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise\r\nthe song of victory and go back to the ships taking this man along\r\nwith us; for we have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble\r\nHector to whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though he\r\nwere a god."\r\nOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the\r\nsinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed\r\nthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the body\r\nfast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then when\r\nhe had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted,\r\nhe lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dust\r\nrose from Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all\r\nabroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove\r\nhad now delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outrage\r\nin his own land.\r\nThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His\r\nmother tore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as\r\nshe looked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and\r\nthroughout the city the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was\r\nas though the whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire.\r\nHardly could the people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rush\r\nwithout the gates of the city. He grovelled in the mire and besought\r\nthem, calling each one of them by his name. "Let be, my friends," he\r\ncried, "and for all your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed to\r\nthe ships of the Achaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man,\r\nif maybe he will respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and have\r\ncompassion on my old age. His own father is even such another as\r\nmyself- Peleus, who bred him and reared him to- be the bane of us\r\nTrojans, and of myself more than of all others. Many a son of mine has\r\nhe slain in the flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as I\r\nmay, I do so for one- Hector- more than for them all, and the\r\nbitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades.\r\nWould that he had died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred\r\nmother who bore him, and myself, should have had the comfort of\r\nweeping and mourning over him."\r\nThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city\r\njoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among\r\nthe Trojans. "Alas, my son," she cried, "what have I left to live\r\nfor now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in. you\r\nthroughout the city, for you were a tower of strength to all in\r\nTroy, and both men and women alike hailed you as a god. So long as you\r\nlived you were their pride, but now death and destruction have\r\nfallen upon you."\r\nHector\'s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to\r\ntell her that her husband had remained without the gates. She was at\r\nher loom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web,\r\nand embroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a\r\nlarge tripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector\r\nwhen he came out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now\r\nbeyond the reach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the\r\nhands of Achilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and\r\ntrembled in every limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she\r\nspoke to her waiting-women. "Two of you," she said, "come with me that\r\nI may learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my\r\nhusband\'s honoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would\r\ncome into my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great\r\nmisfortune for Priam\'s children must be at hand. May I never live to\r\nhear it, but I greatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of\r\nbrave Hector and has chased him on to the plain where he was\r\nsinglehanded; I fear he may have put an end to the reckless daring\r\nwhich possessed my husband, who would never remain with the body of\r\nhis men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in\r\nvalour."\r\nHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like a\r\nmaniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached the\r\nbattlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the\r\nwall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city- the horses\r\ndragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships of\r\nthe Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of\r\nnight and she fell fainting backwards. She tore the tiring from her\r\nhead and flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited\r\nband, and the veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when\r\nHector took her with him from the house of Eetion, after having\r\ngiven countless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband\'s sisters\r\nand the wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported her, for\r\nshe was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently\r\nbreathed and came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the\r\nTrojans saying, \'Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a\r\ncommon lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at\r\nThebes under the wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetion\r\nwho brought me up when I was a child- ill-starred sire of an\r\nill-starred daughter- would that he had never begotten me. You are now\r\ngoing into the house of Hades under the secret places of the earth,\r\nand you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom\r\nyou and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that\r\nyou are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.\r\nEven though he escape the horrors of this woful war with the Achaeans,\r\nyet shall his life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, for\r\nothers will seize his lands. The day that robs a child of his\r\nparents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his cheeks\r\nare wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the friends\r\nof his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by the shirt.\r\nSome one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the cup\r\nfor a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must not\r\ndrink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parents\r\nare alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.\r\n\'Out with you,\' he will say, \'you have no father here,\' and the\r\nchild will go crying back to his widowed mother- he, Astyanax, who\r\nerewhile would sit upon his father\'s knees, and have none but the\r\ndaintiest and choicest morsels set before him. When he had played till\r\nhe was tired and went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the arms\r\nof his nurse, on a soft couch, knowing neither want nor care,\r\nwhereas now that he has lost his father his lot will be full of\r\nhardship- he, whom the Trojans name Astyanax, because you, O Hector,\r\nwere the only defence of their gates and battlements. The wriggling\r\nwrithing worms will now eat you at the ships, far from your parents,\r\nwhen the dogs have glutted themselves upon you. You will lie naked,\r\nalthough in your house you have fine and goodly raiment made by\r\nhands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no use to you, for\r\nyou can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect shown\r\nyou by the Trojans both men and women."\r\nIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women\r\njoined in her lament.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XXIII\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THUS did they make their moan throughout the city, while the\r\nAchaeans when they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his\r\nown ship. But Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to\r\nhis brave comrades saying, "Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own\r\ntrusted friends, not yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse\r\nand chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour\r\nto the dead. When we have had full comfort of lamentation we will\r\nunyoke our horses and take supper all of us here."\r\nOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them in\r\ntheir lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing round\r\nthe body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning.\r\nThe sands of the seashore and the men\'s armour were wet with their\r\nweeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost.\r\nChief in all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his\r\nbloodstained hand on the breast of his friend. "Fare well," he\r\ncried, "Patroclus, even in the house of Hades. I will now do all\r\nthat I erewhile promised you; I will drag Hector hither and let dogs\r\ndevour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before\r\nyour pyre to avenge you."\r\nAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely,\r\nlaying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The\r\nothers then put off every man his armour, took the horses from their\r\nchariots, and seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of\r\nthe fleet descendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an\r\nabundant funeral banquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and\r\nbleating goat did they butcher and cut up; many a tusked boar\r\nmoreover, fat and well-fed, did they singe and set to roast in the\r\nflames of Vulcan; and rivulets of blood flowed all round the place\r\nwhere the body was lying.\r\nThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to\r\nAgamemnon, but hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so\r\nwroth was he for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached\r\nAgamemnon\'s tent they told the serving-men to set a large tripod\r\nover the fire in case they might persuade the son of Peleus \'to wash\r\nthe clotted gore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and swore\r\nit with a solemn oath, saying, "Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiest\r\nof all gods, it is not meet that water should touch my body, till I\r\nhave laid Patroclus on the flames, have built him a barrow, and shaved\r\nmy head- for so long as I live no such second sorrow shall ever draw\r\nnigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands,\r\nbut at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and\r\nprovide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm of\r\ndarkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner,\r\nand the people shall turn again to their own labours."\r\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste\r\nto prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so\r\nthat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat and\r\ndrink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son\r\nof Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the\r\nsounding sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in one\r\nafter another. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and eased\r\nthe burden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing\r\nHector round windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew\r\nnear him, like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of\r\nhis beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit\r\nhovered over his head and said-\r\n"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,\r\nbut now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all\r\nspeed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows\r\nof men that can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will not\r\nyet suffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander\r\nall desolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now your\r\nhand I pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire,\r\nnever shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore\r\nshall we sit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the\r\ncruel fate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around\r\nme- nay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the\r\nwall of the noble Trojans.\r\n"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my\r\nbones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we\r\nwere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought\r\nme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed\r\nthe son of Amphidamas- not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel\r\nover the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated\r\nme kindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones lie\r\nin but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by\r\nyour mother."\r\nAnd Achilles answered, "Why, true heart, are you come hither to\r\nlay these charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you have\r\nbidden me. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around\r\none another, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows."\r\nHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped\r\nhim in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a\r\nvapour, gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his\r\nfeet, smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, "Of a truth\r\neven in the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have\r\nno life in them; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has\r\nhovered over head making piteous moan, telling me what I am to do\r\nfor him, and looking wondrously like himself."\r\nThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning\r\nabout the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then\r\nKing Agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring\r\nwood, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They\r\nwent out with woodmen\'s axes and strong ropes in their hands, and\r\nbefore them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, by\r\nstraight ways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of\r\nmany-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a\r\ntall branching oak that came thundering down as they felled it. They\r\nsplit the trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wended\r\ntheir way as they best could through the thick brushwood on to the\r\nplain. All who had been cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire\r\nto Idomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a line\r\nupon the seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mighty\r\nmonument for Patroclus and for himself.\r\nWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole\r\nground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles\r\nordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke\r\neach man his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and\r\nmounted each his chariot- they and their charioteers with them. The\r\nchariots went before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud\r\nin their tens of thousands after. In the midst of them his comrades\r\nbore Patroclus and covered him with the locks of their hair which they\r\ncut off and threw upon his body. Last came Achilles with his head\r\nbowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the house of\r\nHades.\r\nWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they\r\nlaid the body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought\r\nhim of another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off\r\nthe yellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He\r\nlooked all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, "Spercheius,\r\nin vain did my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to\r\nmy loved native land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy\r\nhecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your\r\nsprings, where is your grove and your altar fragrant with\r\nburnt-offerings. Thus did my father vow, but you have not fulfilled\r\nhis prayer; now, therefore, that I shall see my home no more, I give\r\nthis lock as a keepsake to the hero Patroclus."\r\nAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and\r\nall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun\r\nwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently\r\nsaid to Agamemnon, "Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people\r\nwill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from\r\nmourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting\r\ntheir dinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is\r\nwanted here, and let the other princes also stay by me."\r\nWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their\r\nships, but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a\r\npyre a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all\r\nsorrowfully upon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep\r\nand oxen before the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and\r\nwrapped the body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed\r\ncarcases all round it. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars\r\nof honey and unguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon the\r\npyre, groaning the while he did so. The dead hero had had\r\nhouse-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre;\r\nhe also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid\r\nthem with the rest, for he was full of bitterness and fury. Then he\r\ncommitted all to the resistless and devouring might of the fire; he\r\ngroaned aloud and callid on his dead comrade by name. "Fare well,"\r\nhe cried, "Patroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now doing all\r\nthat I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall the\r\nflames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devour\r\nthe flesh of Hector son of Priam."\r\nThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector,\r\nfor Jove\'s daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and\r\nanointed him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be\r\ntorn when Achilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover\r\nsent a dark cloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the\r\nwhole place where Hector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch\r\nhis body.\r\nNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles\r\ntherefore bethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to\r\nthe two winds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He\r\nmade them many drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them\r\nto come and help him that the wood might make haste to kindle and\r\nthe dead bodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and\r\nstarted off to fetch the winds. They were holding high feast in the\r\nhouse of boisterous Zephyrus when Iris came running up to the stone\r\nthreshold of the house and stood there, but as soon as they set eyes\r\non her they all came towards her and each of them called her to him,\r\nbut Iris would not sit down. "I cannot stay," she said, "I must go\r\nback to the streams of Oceanus and the land of the Ethiopians who\r\nare offering hecatombs to the immortals, and I would have my share;\r\nbut Achilles prays that Boreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him,\r\nand he vows them goodly offerings; he would have you blow upon the\r\npyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are lamenting."\r\nWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent\r\nthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until\r\nthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when\r\nthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames\r\nroared under the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow\r\nhard and beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his\r\ndouble cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling\r\nupon the spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground\r\nuntil the earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning\r\nthe bones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of\r\nhis parents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of\r\nhis comrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and\r\nlamentation.\r\nAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light\r\nwhich saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the\r\nflames fell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond\r\nthe Thracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The\r\nson of Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome\r\nwith toil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who\r\nwere about the son of Atreus drew near in a body, and roused him\r\nwith the noise and tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said,\r\n"Son of Atreus, and all other princes of the Achaeans, first pour\r\nred wine everywhere upon the fire and quench it; let us then gather\r\nthe bones of Patroclus son of Menoetius, singling them out with\r\ncare; they are easily found, for they lie in the middle of the pyre,\r\nwhile all else, both men and horses, has been thrown in a heap and\r\nburned at the outer edge. We will lay the bones in a golden urn, in\r\ntwo layers of fat, against the time when I shall myself go down into\r\nthe house of Hades. As for the barrow, labour not to raise a great one\r\nnow, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards, let those Achaeans who may\r\nbe left at the ships when I am gone, build it both broad and high."\r\nThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First\r\nthey poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the\r\nfire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their\r\nloved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of\r\nfat: they then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside\r\nthe tent. They marked off the circle where the barrow should be,\r\nmade a foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the\r\nearth. When they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but\r\nAchilles stayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought\r\nprizes from the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble\r\noxen, women with fair girdles, and swart iron.\r\nThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races- a woman\r\nskilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had\r\nears for handles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the\r\nman who came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare,\r\nunbroken, and in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly\r\ncauldron that had never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as\r\nwhen it left the maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize\r\nwas two talents of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet\r\nunsoiled by smoke. Then he stood up and spoke among the Argives\r\nsaying-\r\n"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that\r\nlie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I\r\nshould carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you\r\nknow how far my steeds excel all others- for they are immortal;\r\nNeptune gave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to\r\nmyself; but I shall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost their\r\nbrave and kind driver, who many a time has washed them in clear\r\nwater and anointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weeping\r\nhere, with their manes trailing on the ground in the extremity of\r\ntheir sorrow. But do you others set yourselves in order throughout the\r\nhost, whosoever has confidence in his horses and in the strength of\r\nhis chariot."\r\nThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred\r\nthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son of\r\nAdmetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty\r\nDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken\r\nfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him,\r\nyellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet\r\nhorses, Agamemnon\'s mare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The mare\r\nhad been given to Agamemnon by echepolus son of Anchises, that he\r\nmight not have to follow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take\r\nhis ease; for Jove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in\r\nspacious Sicyon. This mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put\r\nunder the yoke.\r\nFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus,\r\nmade ready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came\r\nup to him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but\r\nlittle need. "Antilochus," said Nestor, "you are young, but Jove and\r\nNeptune have loved you well, and have made you an excellent\r\nhorseman. I need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You are\r\nskilful at wheeling your horses round the post, but the horses\r\nthemselves are very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your\r\nchances. The other drivers know less than you do, but their horses are\r\nfleeter; therefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some\r\nartifice whereby you may insure that the prize shall not slip\r\nthrough your fingers. The woodman does more by skill than by brute\r\nforce; by skill the pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea,\r\nand so by skill one driver can beat another. If a man go wide in\r\nrounding this way and that, whereas a man who knows what he is doing\r\nmay have worse horses, but he will keep them well in hand when he sees\r\nthe doubling-post; he knows the precise moment at which to pull the\r\nrein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him. I will give\r\nyou this certain token which cannot escape your notice. There is a\r\nstump of a dead tree-oak or pine as it may be- some six feet above the\r\nground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork of\r\nthe road; it has two white stones set one on each side, and there is a\r\nclear course all round it. It may have been a monument to some one\r\nlong since dead, or it may have been used as a doubling-post in days\r\ngone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark\r\nround which the chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but\r\nas you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on\r\nyour right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a loose\r\nrein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave of\r\nyour wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you\r\nwill wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces, which would\r\nbe sport for others but confusion for yourself. Therefore, my dear\r\nson, mind well what you are about, for if you can be first to round\r\nthe post there is no chance of any one giving you the goby later,\r\nnot even though you had Adrestus\'s horse Arion behind you horse\r\nwhich is of divine race- or those of Laomedon, which are the noblest\r\nin this country."\r\nWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in\r\nhis place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They then\r\nall mounted their chariots and cast lots.- Achilles shook the\r\nhelmet, and the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next\r\ncame that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of\r\nAtreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son\r\nof Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took their places in\r\nline; Achilles showed them the doubling-post round which they were\r\nto turn, some way off upon the plain; here he stationed his father\'s\r\nfollower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and report truly.\r\nAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck\r\nthem with the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They\r\nflew full speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from\r\nunder them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all\r\nflying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the\r\nground, and then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood\r\nerect, and their hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of\r\nvictory. Each kept calling on his horses, and the horses scoured the\r\nplain amid the clouds of dust that they raised.\r\nIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way\r\nback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and it\r\nwas seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres\r\nnow took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions\r\nof Diomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus\'s chariot, and\r\nhe could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad\r\nshoulders, for their heads were close to him as they flew over the\r\ncourse. Diomed would have now passed him, or there would have been a\r\ndead heat, but Phoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip.\r\nTears of anger fell from his eyes as he saw the mares going on\r\nfaster than ever, while his own horses lost ground through his\r\nhaving no whip. Minerva saw the trick which Apollo had played the\r\nson of Tydeus, so she brought him his whip and put spirit into his\r\nhorses; moreover she went after the son of Admetus in a rage and broke\r\nhis yoke for him; the mares went one to one side the course, and the\r\nother to the other, and the pole was broken against the ground.\r\nEumelus was thrown from his chariot close to the wheel; his elbows,\r\nmouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was bruised\r\nabove his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no\r\nutterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and shot\r\nfar ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into them and covered Diomed\r\nhimself with glory.\r\nMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called\r\nto his father\'s horses. "On with you both," he cried, "and do your\r\nvery utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of\r\nTydeus, for Minerva has put running into them, and has covered\r\nDiomed with glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of\r\nAtreus and not be left behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt\r\nyou. Why, my good fellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shall\r\nsurely be- Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of you\r\nto the sword, if we win any the worse a prize through your\r\ncarelessness, fly after them at your utmost speed; I will hit on a\r\nplan for passing them in a narrow part of the way, and it shall not\r\nfail me."\r\nThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went\r\nquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had\r\nsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter\'s rain had gathered and\r\nhad worn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was\r\nmaking towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but\r\nAntilochus turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little\r\non one side. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out,\r\n"Antilochus, you are driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road\r\nis too narrow here, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then;\r\nif you foul my chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief."\r\nBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had\r\nnot heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young\r\nman can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his\r\nstrength, and then Menelaus\'s mares drew behind, for he left off\r\ndriving for fear the horses should foul one another and upset the\r\nchariots; thus, while pressing on in quest of victory, they might both\r\ncome headlong to the ground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus and\r\nsaid, "There is no greater trickster living than you are; go, and\r\nbad luck go with you; the Achaeans say not well that you have\r\nunderstanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the prize\r\nwithout sworn protest on my part."\r\nThen he called on his horses and said to them, "Keep your pace,\r\nand slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner\r\nthan yours, for they are neither of them young."\r\nThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so\r\nthat they were soon nearly up with the others.\r\nMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses\r\nwent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.\r\nIdomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running,\r\nfor he was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most\r\ncommanding part of the ground. The driver was a long way off, but\r\nIdomeneus could hear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse\r\nquite plainly- a chestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on\r\nits forehead. He stood up and said among the Argives, "My friends,\r\nprinces and counsellors of the Argives, can you see the running as\r\nwell as I can? There seems to be another pair in front now, and\r\nanother driver; those that led off at the start must have been\r\ndisabled out on the plain. I saw them at first making their way\r\nround the doubling-post, but now, though I search the plain of Troy, I\r\ncannot find them. Perhaps the reins fell from the driver\'s hand so\r\nthat he lost command of his horses at the doubling-post, and could not\r\nturn it. I suppose he must have been thrown out there, and broken\r\nhis chariot, while his mares have left the course and gone off\r\nwildly in a panic. Come up and see for yourselves, I cannot make out\r\nfor certain, but the driver seems an Aetolian by descent, ruler over\r\nthe Argives, brave Diomed the son of Tydeus."\r\nAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, "Idomeneus,\r\nwhy should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the\r\nmares are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the\r\nyoungest, nor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always\r\nlaying down the law. You have no right to do so, for there are\r\nbetter men here than you are. Eumelus\'s horses are in front now, as\r\nthey always have been, and he is on the chariot holding the reins."\r\nThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, "Ajax you are an\r\nexcellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in much\r\nelse as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod or\r\ncauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are\r\nfirst. You will then know to your cost."\r\nAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there\r\nwould have been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles\r\nrisen in his place and said, "Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus;\r\nit is not you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the\r\nlike: sit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding\r\ntowards the winning-post and will be bere directly. You will then both\r\nof you know whose horses are first, and whose come after."\r\nAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his\r\nwhip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they\r\nflew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver,\r\nand the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet\r\nhorses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and\r\nthe horses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them in\r\nthe middle of the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests\r\nfell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his\r\ngoodly chariot, and leaned his whip against his horses\' yoke; brave\r\nSthenelus now lost no time, but at once brought on the prize, and gave\r\nthe woman and the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away.\r\nThen he unyoked the horses.\r\nNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had\r\npassed Menelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but\r\neven so Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the\r\nhorse that draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a\r\nhorse\'s tail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much\r\nspace between wheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus\r\nwas no further than this behind Antilochus, though at first he had\r\nbeen a full disc\'s throw behind him. He had soon caught him up\r\nagain, for Agamemnon\'s mare Aethe kept pulling stronger and\r\nstronger, so that if the course had been longer he would have passed\r\nhim, and there would not even have been a dead heat. Idomeneus\'s brave\r\nsquire Meriones was about a spear\'s cast behind Menelaus. His horses\r\nwere slowest of all, and he was the worst driver. Last of them all\r\ncame the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot and driving his horses\r\non in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry, and stood up among\r\nthe Argives saying, "The best man is coming in last. Let us give him a\r\nprize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second, but the first\r\nmust go to the son of Tydeus."\r\nThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying,\r\nand were for doing as he had said, but Nestor\'s son Antilochus stood\r\nup and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. "Achilles," said he,\r\n"I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me\r\nof my prize, because you think Eumelus\'s chariot and horses were\r\nthrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He should have\r\nprayed duly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he had\r\ndone so. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in\r\nyour tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something from\r\nthis store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you, and\r\ngive him a better prize even than that which you have now offered; but\r\nI will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her, let\r\nhim come on."\r\nAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus,\r\nwho was one of his dearest comrades. So he said-\r\n"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will\r\ngive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round it\r\nwhich I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him."\r\nHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent,\r\nand he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received\r\nit gladly.\r\nBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An\r\nattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep\r\nsilence: the hero then addressed them. "Antilochus," said he, "what is\r\nthis from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut a\r\npoor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front of\r\nthem, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O\r\nprinces and counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no\r\nfavour, lest one of the Achaeans say, \'Menelaus has got the mare\r\nthrough lying and corruption; his horses were far inferior to\r\nAntilochus\'s, but he has greater weight and influence.\' Nay, I will\r\ndetermine the matter myself, and no man will blame me, for I shall\r\ndo what is just. Come here, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is,\r\nwhip in hand before your chariot and horses; lay your hand on your\r\nsteeds, and swear by earth-encircling Neptune that you did not\r\npurposely and guilefully get in the way of my horses."\r\nAnd Antilochus answered, "Forgive me; I am much younger, King\r\nMenelaus, than you are; you stand higher than I do and are the\r\nbetter man of the two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into\r\nindiscretion; their tempers are more hasty and they have less\r\njudgement; make due allowances therefore, and bear with me; I will\r\nof my own accord give up the mare that I have won, and if you claim\r\nany further chattel from my own possessions, I would rather yield it\r\nto you, at once, than fall from your good graces henceforth, and do\r\nwrong in the sight of heaven."\r\nThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to\r\nMenelaus, whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a\r\nfield of ripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the\r\nharvest- even so, O Menelaus, was your heart made glad within you.\r\nHe turned to Antilochus and said, "Now, Antilochus, angry though I\r\nhave been, I can give way to you of my own free will; you have never\r\nbeen headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youth\r\nhas got the better of your judgement; be careful how you outwit your\r\nbetters in future; no one else could have brought me round so\r\neasily, but your good father, your brother, and yourself have all of\r\nyou had infinite trouble on my behalf; I therefore yield to your\r\nentreaty, and will give up the mare to you, mine though it indeed\r\nbe; the people will thus see that I am neither harsh nor vindictive."\r\nWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus\'s comrade Noemon,\r\nand then took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth,\r\ncarried off the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the\r\ntwo-handled urn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up\r\nto him among the assembled Argives and saying, "Take this, my good old\r\nfriend, as an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus- for\r\nyou shall see him no more among the Argives. I give you this prize\r\nthough you cannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight,\r\nand cannot enter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of\r\nage has been laid heavily upon you."\r\nSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and\r\nanswered, "My son, all that you have said is true; there is no\r\nstrength now in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from\r\neither shoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when\r\nthe Epeans were burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons\r\noffered prizes in his honour. There was then none that could vie\r\nwith me neither of the Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the\r\nAetolians. In boxing I overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in\r\nwrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron who had come forward against me.\r\nIphiclus was a good runner, but I beat him, and threw farther with\r\nmy spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus. In chariot-racing alone did\r\nthe two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding their horses in front\r\nof me, for they were angry at the way victory had gone, and at the\r\ngreater part of the prizes remaining in the place in which they had\r\nbeen offered. They were twins, and the one kept on holding the\r\nreins, and holding the reins, while the other plied the whip. Such was\r\nI then, but now I must leave these matters to younger men; I must\r\nbow before the weight of years, but in those days I was eminent\r\namong heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests in\r\nhonour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart\r\nrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill\r\ntowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all\r\nwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance."\r\nThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks of\r\nNestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and\r\npresently offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He\r\nbrought out a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the\r\ncrowd- a she-mule never yet broken, but six years old-  when it is\r\nhardest of all to break them: this was for the victor, and for the\r\nvanquished he offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said among\r\nthe Argives, "Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our\r\ntwo champion boxers to lay about them lustily and compete for these\r\nprizes. He to whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom\r\nthe Achaeans acknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back with\r\nhim to his own tent, while he that is vanquished shall have the double\r\ncup."\r\nAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and great\r\nstature, a skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand\r\non the mule and said, "Let the man who is to have the cup come hither,\r\nfor none but myself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all\r\nhere present, and none can beat me. Is it not enough that I should\r\nfall short of you in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good at\r\neverything. I tell you plainly, and it shall come true; if any man\r\nwill box with me I will bruise his body and break his bones; therefore\r\nlet his friends stay here in a body and be at hand to take him away\r\nwhen I have done with him."\r\nThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of\r\nMecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes\r\nafter the fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all\r\nthe people of Cadmus. The son of Tydeus was Euryalus\'s second,\r\ncheering him on and hoping heartily that he would win. First he put\r\na waistband round him and then he gave him some well-cut thongs of\r\nox-hide; the two men being now girt went into the middle of the\r\nring, and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did they punish one\r\nanother and lay about them with their brawny fists. One could hear the\r\nhorrid crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every pore of\r\ntheir skin. Presently Epeus came on and gave Euryalus a blow on the\r\njaw as he was looking round; Euryalus could not keep his legs; they\r\ngave way under him in a moment and he sprang up with a bound, as a\r\nfish leaps into the air near some shore that is all bestrewn with\r\nsea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the waves, and then falls\r\nback into deep water. But noble Epeus caught hold of him and raised\r\nhim up; his comrades also came round him and led him from the ring,\r\nunsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and spitting great\r\nclots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then went to fetch the\r\ndouble cup.\r\nThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest\r\nand showed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of\r\nwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting\r\nupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve\r\noxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\r\narts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the\r\nArgives, "Stand forward, you who will essay this contest."\r\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty\r\nUlysses, full of wiles rose also. The two girded themselves and went\r\ninto the middle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong\r\nhands like the rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof\r\nof a high house to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as\r\nthey tugged at one another with their mighty arms- and sweat rained\r\nfrom them in torrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and\r\nshoulders, but they kept on striving with might and main for victory\r\nand to win the tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him;\r\nUlysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire of\r\nwatching them, Ajax said to ulysses, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,\r\nyou shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between\r\nus."\r\nHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not\r\nforget his cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee,\r\nso that he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back with\r\nUlysses lying upon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then\r\nUlysses in turn lifted Ajax and stirred him a little from the ground\r\nbut could not lift him right off it, his knee sank under him, and\r\nthe two fell side by side on the ground and were all begrimed with\r\ndust. They now sprang towards one another and were for wrestling yet a\r\nthird time, but Achilles rose and stayed them. "Put not each other\r\nfurther," said he, "to such cruel suffering; the victory is with\r\nboth alike, take each of you an equal prize, and let the other\r\nAchaeans now compete."\r\nThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their\r\nshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.\r\nThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running- a\r\nmixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six\r\nmeasures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty;\r\nit was the work of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been brought\r\ninto port by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present\r\nof it to Thoas. Eueneus son of jason had given it to Patroclus in\r\nransom of Priam\'s son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize\r\nin honour of his comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For\r\nthe second prize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the\r\nlast there was to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said\r\namong the Argives, "Stand forward, you who will essay this contest."\r\nForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and\r\nNestor\'s son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of his\r\ntime. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. The\r\ncourse was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son of\r\nOileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him as\r\nthe shuttle is to a woman\'s bosom when she throws the woof across\r\nthe warp and holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was\r\nUlysses- treading in his footprints before the dust could settle\r\nthere, and Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he\r\nran swiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him\r\nstraining his utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when\r\nthey were now nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to\r\nMinerva. "Hear me," he cried, "and help my feet, O goddess." Thus\r\ndid he pray, and Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands\r\nand his feet feel light, and when the runners were at the point of\r\npouncing upon the prize, Ajax, through Minerva\'s spite slipped upon\r\nsome offal that was lying there from the cattle which Achilles had\r\nslaughtered in honour of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were\r\nall filled with cow dung. Ulysses therefore carried off the\r\nmixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax and came in first. But Ajax took\r\nthe ox and stood with his hand on one of its horns, spitting the\r\ndung out of his mouth. Then he said to the Argives, "Alas, the goddess\r\nhas spoiled my running; she watches over Ulysses and stands by him\r\nas though she were his own mother." Thus did he speak and they all\r\nof them laughed heartily.\r\nAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the\r\nbystanders, "You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown\r\ntheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and\r\nas for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in\r\nspite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him\r\nsave only Achilles."\r\nHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and\r\nAchilles answered, "Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no\r\npurpose; I shall give you an additional half talent of gold." He\r\nthen gave the half talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly.\r\nThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that\r\nhad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. He\r\nstood up and said among the Argives, "We bid two champions put on\r\ntheir armour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another in\r\nthe presence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound the\r\nflesh of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him\r\nwill I give this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which I\r\ntook from Asteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership,\r\nand I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own tent."\r\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty\r\nDiomed son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his\r\nown side of the ring, they both went into the middle eager to\r\nengage, and with fire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled\r\nas they beheld them, and when the two were now close up with one\r\nanother, thrice did they spring forward and thrice try to strike\r\neach other in close combat. Ajax pierced Diomed\'s round shield, but\r\ndid not draw blood, for the cuirass beneath the shield protected\r\nhim; thereon the son of Tydeus from over his huge shield kept aiming\r\ncontinually at Ajax\'s neck with the point of his spear, and the\r\nAchaeans alarmed for his safety bade them leave off fighting and\r\ndivide the prize between them. Achilles then gave the great sword to\r\nthe son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and the leathern belt with which\r\nto hang it.\r\nAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had\r\nerewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried\r\nit off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said\r\namong the Argives, "Stand forward, you who would essay this contest.\r\nHe who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years\r\nas they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town\r\nhis shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron,\r\nfor he will have a stock of it on his own premises."\r\nThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax\r\nson of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other\r\nand Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set\r\nall the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of\r\nMars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any\r\nmark that had been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoit\r\nhe hurled it as though it had been a stockman\'s stick which he sends\r\nflying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so far did\r\nhis throw out-distance those of the others. All who saw it roared\r\napplause, and his comrades carried the prize for him and set it on\r\nboard his ship.\r\nAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery- ten\r\ndouble-edged axes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship\'s mast,\r\nsome way off upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to\r\nit by the foot; this was what they were to aim at. "Whoever," he said,\r\n"can hit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with\r\nhim; he who hits the string without hitting the bird will have taken a\r\nworse aim and shall have the single-edged axes."\r\nThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of\r\nIdomeneus rose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot\r\nof Teucer fell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he\r\ndid not promise hecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and\r\nmissed his bird, for Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with\r\nwhich the bird was tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean\r\nthrough so that it hung down towards the ground, while the bird flew\r\nup into the sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who\r\nhad his arrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of\r\nhis hand, and at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of\r\nfirstling lambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon\r\nhigh up under the clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as\r\nshe was circling upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and\r\nfixed itself in the ground at Meriones\' feet, but the bird perched\r\non the ship\'s mast hanging her head and with all her feathers\r\ndrooping; the life went out of her, and she fell heavily from the\r\nmast. Meriones, therefore, took all ten double-edged axes, while\r\nTeucer bore off the single-edged ones to his ships.\r\nThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had\r\nnever been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a\r\npattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up- to\r\nwit the son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart\r\nsquire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, "Son of Atreus, we\r\nknow how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing the\r\njavelin; take the cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it so\r\nplease you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what I\r\nshould myself wish."\r\nKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones,\r\nand handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XXIV\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THE assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to his\r\nown ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethought\r\nthem of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for\r\nthinking of his dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow,\r\ncould take no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as he\r\nyearned after the might and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of all\r\nthey had done together, and all they had gone through both on the\r\nfield of battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on\r\nthese things he wept bitterly and lay now on his side, now on his\r\nback, and now face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as one\r\ndistraught to wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn\r\nbreaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and\r\nbound the body of Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice\r\ndid he drag it round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went\r\nback into his tent, leaving the body on the ground full length and\r\nwith its face downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be\r\ndisfigured, for he pitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore\r\nhe shielded him with his golden aegis continually, that he might\r\ntake no hurt while Achilles was dragging him.\r\nThus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the\r\nblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury,\r\nslayer of Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only\r\nJuno, Neptune, and Jove\'s grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the\r\nhate which they had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his\r\npeople; for they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in\r\ndisdaining the goddesses who came to him when he was in his\r\nsheepyards, and preferring her who had offered him a wanton to his\r\nruin.\r\nWhen, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come,\r\nPhoebus Apollo spoke among the immortals saying, "You gods ought to be\r\nashamed of yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not\r\nHector burn you thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And\r\nnow dare you not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon,\r\nwith his mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who would\r\nforthwith commit him to the flames, and give him his due funeral\r\nrites? So, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, who\r\nknows neither right nor ruth? He is like some savage lion that in\r\nthe pride of his great strength and daring springs upon men\'s flocks\r\nand gorges on them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all\r\nthat conscience which at once so greatly banes yet greatly boons him\r\nthat will heed it. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost-\r\na son, it may be, or a brother born from his own mother\'s womb; yet\r\nwhen he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it\r\ntakes much sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has\r\nslain noble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of his\r\ncomrade. It were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so,\r\nfor brave though he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent his\r\nfury upon dead clay."\r\nJuno spoke up in a rage. "This were well," she cried, "O lord of the\r\nsilver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;\r\nbut Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman\'s breast, whereas\r\nAchilles is the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared and\r\nbrought up. I married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to\r\nthe immortals; you gods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted\r\nalong with them yourself and brought your lyre- false, and fond of low\r\ncompany, that you have ever been."\r\nThen said Jove, "Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not be\r\nequal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,\r\nas also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my\r\naltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour of\r\nsacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body\r\nof mighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without\r\nAchilles coming to know it, for his mother keeps night and day\r\nbeside him. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I\r\nwill impart my counsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a\r\nransom from Priam, and give up the body."\r\nOn this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Down\r\nshe plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;\r\nthe waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the\r\nbottom as the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry\r\ndeath to fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the\r\nother sea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst\r\nof them weeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his own\r\nland, on the rich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said,\r\n"Rise Thetis; Jove, whose counsels fail not, bids you come to him."\r\nAnd Thetis answered, "Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in great\r\ngrief, and shrink from going in and out among the immortals. Still,\r\nI will go, and the word that he may speak shall not be spoken in\r\nvain."\r\nThe goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more\r\nsombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her. The\r\nwaves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shore\r\nthey flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing son\r\nof Saturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near him.\r\nMinerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side of\r\nfather Jove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoke\r\nto her in words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back the\r\ncup; and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\r\n"So, goddess," said he, "for all your sorrow, and the grief that I\r\nwell know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to\r\nOlympus, and I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days\r\npast the immortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster of\r\ncities and the body of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer of\r\nArgus steal the body, but in furtherance of our peace and amity\r\nhenceforward, I will concede such honour to your son as I will now\r\ntell you. Go, then, to the host and lay these commands upon him; say\r\nthat the gods are angry with him, and that I am myself more angry than\r\nthem all, in that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give him\r\nup. He may thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I will\r\nsend Iris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans,\r\nand ransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as may\r\ngive him satisfaction.\r\nSilver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith down\r\nshe darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her\r\nson\'s tents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty\r\ncomrades round him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which\r\nthey had killed a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him\r\nand caressed him with her hand saying, "My son, how long will you keep\r\non thus grieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart,\r\nand think neither of food nor of woman\'s embraces; and yet these too\r\nwere well, for you have no long time to live, and death with the\r\nstrong hand of fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed\r\nwhat I say, for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods\r\nare angry with you, and himself more angry than them all, in that\r\nyou keep Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let\r\nhim go, and accept a ransom for his body."\r\nAnd Achilles answered, "So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion\r\nthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away."\r\nThus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse\r\nwith one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the\r\nstrong city of Ilius. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, from the mansions of\r\nOlympus, and tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships\r\nof the Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take\r\nsuch gifts with him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he\r\nis to go alone, with no other Trojan, save only some honoured\r\nservant who may drive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body of\r\nhim whom noble Achilles has slain. Let him have no thought nor fear of\r\ndeath in his heart, for we will send the slayer of Argus to escort\r\nhim, and bring him within the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill\r\nhim nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin\r\nnot, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy."\r\nOn this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her\r\nmessage. She went to Priam\'s house, and found weeping and\r\nlamentation therein. His sons were seated round their father in the\r\nouter courtyard, and their raiment was wet with tears: the old man sat\r\nin the midst of them with his mantle wrapped close about his body, and\r\nhis head and neck all covered with the filth which he had clutched\r\nas he lay grovelling in the mire. His daughters and his sons\' wives\r\nwent wailing about the house, as they thought of the many and brave\r\nmen who lay dead, slain by the Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by\r\nPriam and spoke softly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so.\r\n"Take heart," she said, "Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and\r\nfear not. I bring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you. I\r\ncome as a messenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takes\r\nthought for you and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go and\r\nransom noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall give\r\nsatisfaction to Achilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan, save\r\nonly some honoured servant who may drive your mules and waggon, and\r\nbring back to the city the body of him whom noble Achilles has\r\nslain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of death, for Jove will\r\nsend the slayer of Argus to escort you. When he has brought you within\r\nAchilles\' tent, Achilles will not kill you nor let another do so,\r\nfor he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will entreat a\r\nsuppliant with all honourable courtesy."\r\nIris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his\r\nsons to get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon\r\nfast upon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant\r\nstore-room, high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many\r\ntreasures were kept, and he called Hecuba his wife. "Wife," said he,\r\n"a messenger has come to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the\r\nships of the Achaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts\r\nas shall give satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter?\r\nfor my own part I am greatly moved to pass through the of the Achaeans\r\nand go to their ships."\r\nHis wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, "Alas, what has\r\nbecome of that judgement for which you have been ever famous both\r\namong strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to\r\nthe ships of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain\r\nso many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the\r\ncruel savage sees you and lays hold on you, he will know neither\r\nrespect nor pity. Let us then weep Hector from afar here in our own\r\nhouse, for when I gave him birth the threads of overruling fate were\r\nspun for him that dogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, in\r\nthe house of that terrible man on whose liver I would fain fasten\r\nand devour it. Thus would I avenge my son, who showed no cowardice\r\nwhen Achilles slew him, and thought neither of Right nor of avoiding\r\nbattle as he stood in defence of Trojan men and Trojan women."\r\nThen Priam said, "I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a\r\nbird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it been\r\nsome mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines\r\nfrom sacrifice- I should have deemed him false and have given him no\r\nheed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face,\r\ntherefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be my\r\nfate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it;\r\nlet Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in my\r\narms and mourned him to my heart\'s comforting."\r\nSo saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve\r\ngoodly vestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve\r\nrugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed\r\nout ten talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods,\r\nfour cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given\r\nhim when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious,\r\nbut he grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of\r\nhis son. Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked\r\nthem with words of anger. "Out," he cried, "shame and disgrace to me\r\nthat you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come to\r\nplague me here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturn\r\nhas sent this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? Nay, you\r\nshall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will have\r\neasier work in killing you. As for me, let me go down within the house\r\nof Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of the city."\r\nHe drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old\r\nman sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus,\r\nParis, noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud\r\nbattle-cry, Deiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old\r\nman call near him. "Come to me at once," he cried, "worthless sons who\r\ndo me shame; would that you had all been killed at the ships rather\r\nthan Hector. Miserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in\r\nall Troy- noble Nestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hector\r\nwho was a god among men, so that one would have thought he was son\r\nto an immortal- yet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain them\r\nand those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light\r\nof foot, heroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your\r\nown people, why do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and\r\nput all these things upon it that I may set out on my way?"\r\nThus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father.\r\nThey brought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of\r\nthe waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on\r\nwhich it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and\r\nrings for the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band\r\neleven cubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on\r\nat the far end of the pole, and put the ring over the upright pin\r\nmaking it fast with three turns of the band on either side the knob,\r\nand bending the thong of the yoke beneath it. This done, they\r\nbrought from the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchase\r\nthe body of Hector, and they set it all orderly on the waggon; then\r\nthey yoked the strong harness-mules which the Mysians had on a time\r\ngiven as a goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yoked\r\nhorses which the old king had bred, and kept for own use.\r\nThus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their\r\ncars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with a\r\ngolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a\r\ndrink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of the horses\r\nand said, "Take this, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and\r\nsince you are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray that\r\nyou may come safely back from the hands of your enemies. Pray to the\r\nson of Saturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down\r\nover all Troy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your right\r\nhand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to him of\r\nall birds, that you may see it with your own eyes and trust it as\r\nyou go forth to the ships of the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will\r\nnot send you this messenger, however set upon it you may be, I would\r\nnot have you go to the ships of the Argives."\r\nAnd Priam answered, "Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well to\r\nlift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me."\r\nWith this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over\r\nhis hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He\r\nwashed his hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the\r\ndrink-offering and prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and\r\nturning his eyes to heaven. "Father Jove," he said, "that rulest\r\nfrom Ida, most glorious and most great, grant that I may be received\r\nkindly and compassionately in the tents of Achilles; and send your\r\nswift messenger upon my right hand, the bird of omen which is\r\nstrongest and most dear to you of all birds, that I may see it with my\r\nown eyes and trust it as I go forth to the ships of the Danaans."\r\nSo did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.\r\nForthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds\r\nthat fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His\r\nwings were spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and\r\nwell-bolted door of a rich man\'s chamber. He came to them flying\r\nover the city upon their right hands, and when they saw him they\r\nwere glad and their hearts took comfort within them. The old man\r\nmade haste to mount his chariot, and drove out through the inner\r\ngateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Before him\r\nwent the mules drawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise\r\nIdaeus; behind these were the horses, which the old man lashed with\r\nhis whip and drove swiftly through the city, while his friends\r\nfollowed after, wailing and lamenting for him as though he were on his\r\nroad to death. As soon as they had come down from the city and had\r\nreached the plain, his sons and sons-in-law who had followed him\r\nwent back to Ilius.\r\nBut Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not\r\nescape the ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man\r\nand pitied him; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, "Mercury,\r\nfor it is you who are the most disposed to escort men on their way,\r\nand to hear those whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to\r\nthe ships of the Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him\r\nnor take note of him until he reach the son of Peleus."\r\nThus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus,\r\ndid as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden\r\nsandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he\r\ntook the wand with which he seals men\'s eyes in sleep, or wakes them\r\njust as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to\r\nTroy and to the Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of\r\nnoble birth in the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down\r\njust coming upon his face.\r\nNow when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius,\r\nthey stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river,\r\nfor the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw\r\nMercury standing near them he said to Priam, "Take heed, descendant of\r\nDardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man\r\nwho I think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses,\r\nor at least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion\r\nupon us?\r\nWhen he heard this the old man\'s heart failed him, and he was in\r\ngreat fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on\r\nend over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him\r\nand took him by the hand, saying, "Whither, father, are you thus\r\ndriving your mules and horses in the dead of night when other men\r\nare asleep? Are you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard\r\nby you, so cruel and relentless? Should some one of them see you\r\nbearing so much treasure through the darkness of the flying night,\r\nwhat would not your state then be? You are no longer young, and he who\r\nis with you is too old to protect you from those who would attack you.\r\nFor myself, I will do you no harm, and I will defend you from any\r\none else, for you remind me of my own father."\r\nAnd Priam answered, "It is indeed as you say, my dear son;\r\nnevertheless some god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent\r\nsuch a wayfarer as yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are so\r\ncomely in mien and figure, and your judgement is so excellent that you\r\nmust come of blessed parents."\r\nThen said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "Sir, all that\r\nyou have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking\r\nthis rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be\r\nsafe, or are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your\r\nson has fallen who was the bravest man among you and was never lacking\r\nin battle with the Achaeans?"\r\nAnd Priam said, "Wo are you, my friend, and who are your parents,\r\nthat you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?"\r\nThe slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, "Sir, you\r\nwould prove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time\r\nhave I set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives\r\nto their ships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and\r\nmarvelled, for Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered\r\nus not to fight. I am his squire, and came with him in the same\r\nship. I am a Myrmidon, and my father\'s name is Polyctor: he is a\r\nrich man and about as old as you are; he has six sons besides\r\nmyself, and I am the seventh. We cast lots, and it fell upon me to\r\nsail hither with Achilles. I am now come from the ships on to the\r\nplain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set battle in array about\r\nthe city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so eager that their\r\nprinces cannot hold them back."\r\nThen answered Priam, "If you are indeed the squire of Achilles son\r\nof Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is my son still at the\r\nships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his\r\nhounds?"\r\n"Sir," replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "neither\r\nhounds nor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at\r\nthe tents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days\r\nthat he has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms\r\neaten him although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags\r\nhim cruelly round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him\r\nno hurt. You should come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew,\r\nwith the blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of them\r\nclosed though many pierced him with their spears. Such care have the\r\nblessed gods taken of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyond\r\nall measure."\r\nThe old man was comforted as he heard him and said, "My son, see\r\nwhat a good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals;\r\nfor as sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold\r\nOlympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept\r\ntherefore at my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with\r\nheaven\'s help guide me till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus."\r\nThen answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "Sir, you are\r\ntempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me,\r\nfor you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles\r\nwhom I fear and hold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evil\r\npresently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to\r\nArgos itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land,\r\nthat no one should attack you through making light of him who was with\r\nyou."\r\nThe bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and\r\nseizing the whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and\r\nhorses. When they reached the trench and the wall that was before\r\nthe ships, those who were on guard had just been getting their\r\nsuppers, and the slayer of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep.\r\nThen he drew back the bolts to open the gates, and took Priam inside\r\nwith the treasure he had upon his waggon. Ere long they came to the\r\nlofty dwelling of the son of Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cut\r\npine and which they had built for their king; when they had built it\r\nthey thatched it with coarse tussock-grass which they had mown out\r\non the plain, and all round it they made a large courtyard, which\r\nwas fenced with stakes set close together. The gate was barred with\r\na single bolt of pine which it took three men to force into its place,\r\nand three to draw back so as to open the gate, but Achilles could draw\r\nit by himself. Mercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in\r\nthe treasure that he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Then\r\nhe sprang from the chariot on to the ground and said, "Sir, it is I,\r\nimmortal Mercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me to\r\nescort you. I will now leave you, and will not enter into the presence\r\nof Achilles, for it might anger him that a god should befriend\r\nmortal men thus openly. Go you within, and embrace the knees of the\r\nson of Peleus: beseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and his\r\nson; thus you may move him."\r\nWith these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang\r\nfrom his chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge\r\nof the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house\r\nwhere Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him\r\nwith his men seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero\r\nAutomedon, and Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance\r\nabout his person, for he had but just done eating and drinking, and\r\nthe table was still there. King Priam entered without their seeing\r\nhim, and going right up to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed\r\nthe dread murderous hands that had slain so many of his sons.\r\nAs when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have\r\nkilled some one in his own country, and must fly to a great man\'s\r\nprotection in a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so\r\ndid Achilles marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to\r\nanother and marvelled also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, "Think\r\nof your father, O Achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I\r\nam, on the sad threshold of old age. It may be that those who dwell\r\nnear him harass him, and there is none to keep war and ruin from\r\nhim. Yet when he hears of you being still alive, he is glad, and his\r\ndays are full of hope that he shall see his dear son come home to\r\nhim from Troy; but I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest in all\r\nTroy for my sons, and there is not one of them left. I had fifty\r\nsons when the Achaeans came here; nineteen of them were from a\r\nsingle womb, and the others were borne to me by the women of my\r\nhousehold. The greater part of them has fierce Mars laid low, and\r\nHector, him who was alone left, him who was the guardian of the city\r\nand ourselves, him have you lately slain; therefore I am now come to\r\nthe ships of the Achaeans to ransom his body from you with a great\r\nransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven; think on your own\r\nfather and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for I\r\nhave steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled himself before\r\nme, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son."\r\nThus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he\r\nbethought him of his father. He took the old man\'s hand and moved\r\nhim gently away. The two wept bitterly- Priam, as he lay at\r\nAchilles\' feet, weeping for Hector, and Achilles now for his father\r\nand now for Patroclous, till the house was filled with their\r\nlamentation. But when Achilles was now sated with grief and had\r\nunburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he left his seat and\r\nraised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white hair and\r\nbeard; then he said, "Unhappy man, you have indeed been greatly\r\ndaring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of the\r\nAchaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so many of\r\nyour brave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat,\r\nand for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts, for\r\nweeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the lot\r\nthey spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove\'s palace\r\nthere stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other\r\nwith good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts\r\nhe sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to\r\nwhom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger\r\nof scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world,\r\nand he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by\r\ngods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him\r\nwith all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the\r\nMyrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal\r\nthough he was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him\r\ntoo did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal children\r\nborn to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die all\r\nuntimely; nor may I take care of him now that he is growing old, for I\r\nmust stay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children. And\r\nyou too, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy. They say\r\nthat in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed all that is in\r\nLesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that is more\r\ninland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from the\r\nday when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and\r\nslaughter have been about your city continually. Bear up against it,\r\nand let there be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may for\r\nyour brave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him from\r\nthe dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you."\r\nAnd Priam answered, "O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is\r\nstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom\r\nwhich I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look\r\nupon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land in\r\nsafety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look upon\r\nthe light of the sun."\r\nAchilles looked at him sternly and said, "Vex me, sir, no longer;\r\nI am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother,\r\ndaughter of the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me\r\ndeliver it to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot\r\nhide it, that some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans,\r\nfor else, no man however strong and in his prime would dare to come to\r\nour host; he could neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of\r\nmy gates thus easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sin\r\nagainst the word of Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though you\r\nare, within my tents."\r\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang\r\nlike a lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him\r\nwent his two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than\r\nany others of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These\r\nunyoked the horses and mules, and bade Priam\'s herald and attendant be\r\nseated within the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector\'s body from\r\nthe waggon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, that\r\nAchilles might wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home.\r\nThen he called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and\r\nanoint it, but he first took it to a place where Priam should not\r\nsee it, lest if he did so, he should break out in the bitterness of\r\nhis grief, and enrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sin\r\nagainst the word of Jove. When the servants had washed the body and\r\nanointed it, and had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles\r\nhimself lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the\r\nwaggon. He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear\r\ncomrade, "Be not angry with me, Patroclus," he said, "if you hear even\r\nin the house of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for a\r\nransom. It has been no unworthy one, and I will share it equitably\r\nwith you."\r\nAchilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the\r\nrichly inlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at\r\nright angles to the one against which Priam was sitting. "Sir," he\r\nsaid, "your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according to\r\ndesire; you shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for the\r\npresent let us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think\r\nabout eating, though her twelve children- six daughters and six\r\nlusty sons- had been all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons\r\nwith arrows from his silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the\r\ndaughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said\r\nLeto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne\r\nmany- whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lie\r\nweltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturn\r\nturned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in\r\nheaven themselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being worn\r\nout with weeping. They say that somewhere among the rocks on the\r\nmountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs live that haunt the\r\nriver Achelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nurses\r\nthe sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven. Therefore, noble sir,\r\nlet us two now take food; you can weep for your dear son hereafter\r\nas you are bearing him back to Ilius- and many a tear will he cost\r\nyou."\r\nWith this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of\r\nsilvery whiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in\r\ndue order. They cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted\r\nthem, and drew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedon\r\nbrought bread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while\r\nAchilles dealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good\r\nthings that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat\r\nand drink, Priam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strength\r\nand beauty of Achilles for he was as a god to see, and Achilles\r\nmarvelled at Priam as he listened to him and looked upon his noble\r\npresence. When they had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. "And\r\nnow, O king," he said, "take me to my couch that we may lie down and\r\nenjoy the blessed boon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed\r\nfrom the day your hands took the life of my son; I have grovelled\r\nwithout ceasing in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan and\r\nbrooding over my countless sorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten\r\nbread and drunk wine; hitherto I have tasted nothing."\r\nAs he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds\r\nin the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red\r\nrugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks\r\nfor Priam and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch\r\nand got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughingly\r\nto Priam, "Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of\r\nthose who in due course keep coming to advise with me should see you\r\nhere in the darkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon.\r\nThis might cause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me\r\nand tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral\r\nrites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and\r\nrestrain the host."\r\nAnd Priam answered, "Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son\r\nwith all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You\r\nknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch\r\nwood from the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days,\r\ntherefore, will we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we\r\nwill bury him and there shall be a public feast in his honour; on\r\nthe eleventh we will build a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth,\r\nif there be need, we will fight."\r\nAnd Achilles answered, "All, King Priam, shall be as you have\r\nsaid. I will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named."\r\nAs he spoke he laid his hand on the old man\'s right wrist, in\r\ntoken that he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his\r\nattendant sleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while\r\nAchilles lay in an inner room of the house, with fair Briseis by his\r\nside.\r\nAnd now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the\r\nlivelong night, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck,\r\nsleep could take no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get\r\nKing Priam away from the ships without his being seen by the strong\r\nforce of sentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam\'s head and said,\r\n"Sir, now that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear\r\nabout sleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a great\r\nransom, and have received the body of your son; were you still alive\r\nand a prisoner the sons whom you have left at home would have to\r\ngive three times as much to free you; and so it would be if\r\nAgamemnon and the other Achaeans were to know of your being here."\r\nWhen he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.\r\nMercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly\r\nthrough the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to\r\nthe ford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went\r\nback to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break\r\nover all the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the city\r\nlamenting and making moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. No\r\none neither man nor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as golden\r\nVenus standing on Pergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his\r\nchariot, and his servant that was the city\'s herald with him. Then she\r\nsaw him that was lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a\r\nloud cry she went about the city saying, "Come hither Trojans, men and\r\nwomen, and look on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from\r\nbattle when he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of our\r\ncity and all our people."\r\nAt this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a\r\nsorrow had possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he\r\nwas bringing in the body. Hector\'s wife and his mother were the\r\nfirst to mourn him: they flew towards the waggon and laid their\r\nhands upon his head, while the crowd stood weeping round them. They\r\nwould have stayed before the gates, weeping and lamenting the livelong\r\nday to the going down of the sun, had not Priam spoken to them from\r\nthe chariot and said, "Make way for the mules to pass you.\r\nAfterwards when I have taken the body home you shall have your fill of\r\nweeping."\r\nOn this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon.\r\nWhen they had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a\r\nbed and seated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women\r\njoined in the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them all\r\nAndromache led their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty\r\nHector in her embrace. "Husband," she cried, "you have died young, and\r\nleave me in your house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred\r\nparents is still a mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood.\r\nEre he can do so our city will be razed and overthrown, for you who\r\nwatched over it are no more- you who were its saviour, the guardian of\r\nour wives and children. Our women will be carried away captives to the\r\nships, and I among them; while you, my child, who will be with me will\r\nbe put to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be,\r\nsome Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to\r\navenge some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of them\r\nhave indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father\'s hand in\r\nbattle was no light one. Therefore do the people mourn him. You have\r\nleft, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my own grief\r\nis greatest of all, for you did not stretch forth your arms and\r\nembrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me any words that might have\r\nlived with me in my tears night and day for evermore."\r\nBitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.\r\nHecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. "Hector," she cried,\r\n"dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the\r\ngods loved you well, and even in death they have not been utterly\r\nunmindful of you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, he\r\nwould sell him beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos;\r\nand when he had slain you too with his sword, many a time did he\r\ndrag you round the sepulchre of his comrade- though this could not\r\ngive him life- yet here you lie all fresh as dew, and comely as one\r\nwhom Apollo has slain with his painless shafts."\r\nThus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and\r\nthen Helen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation.\r\n"Hector," said she, "dearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wife\r\nto Alexandrus who brought me hither to Troy- would that I had died ere\r\nhe did so- twenty years are come and gone since I left my home and\r\ncame from over the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or\r\nunkindness from you. When another would chide with me, as it might\r\nbe one of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers\' wives, or my\r\nmother-in-law- for Priam was as kind to me as though he were my own\r\nfather- you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness and\r\ngoodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappy\r\nself, for there is no one else in Troy who is kind to me, but all\r\nshrink and shudder as they go by me."\r\nShe wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round her\r\njoined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, "Bring\r\nwood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the\r\nArgives, for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me\r\nhis word that they should not attack us until the morning of the\r\ntwelfth day."\r\nForthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together\r\nbefore the city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps wood,\r\nand on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they took trave\r\nHector forth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and\r\nset the fire thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered\r\ndawn appeared on the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round\r\nthe pyre of mighty Hector. When they were got together, they first\r\nquenched the fire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his\r\nbrothers and comrades with many a bitter tear gathered his white\r\nbones, wrapped them in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden\r\nurn, which they placed in a grave and covered over with large stones\r\nset close together. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping\r\nguard on every side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they\r\nhad finished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back\r\nagain into the city, and being well assembled they held high feast\r\nin the house of Priam their king.\r\nThus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of\r\nhorses.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                          -THE END-\n"})}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:"XFIR\ufffd\x17MZ\ufffd"})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,h.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,h.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>a,x:()=>s});var o=t(96540);const h={},r=o.createContext(h);function a(e){const n=o.useContext(r);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(h):e.components||h:a(e.components),o.createElement(r.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
