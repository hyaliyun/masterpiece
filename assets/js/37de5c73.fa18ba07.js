A gush of tears at her mother's farewell\r\nkiss, a touch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flour\r\nmill where her father worked by the day, a pathetic sigh as the\r\nfamiliar green environs of the village passed in review, and the\r\nthreads which bound her so lightly to girlhood and home were\r\nirretrievably broken."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"To be sure there was always the next station, where one might\r\ndescend and return.

Warm with the fancies of youth, pretty with the\r\ninsipid prettiness of the formative period, possessed of a figure\r\npromising eventual shapeliness and an eye alight with certain\r\nnative intelligence, she was a fair example of the middle\r\nAmerican class--two generations removed from the emigrant.

A mind free of any consideration of the\r\nproblems or forces of the world and actuated not by greed, but an\r\ninsatiable love of variable pleasure.  His method was always\r\nsimple.  Its principal element was daring, backed, of course, by\r\nan intense desire and admiration for the sex.  Let him meet with\r\na young woman once and he would approach her with an air of\r\nkindly familiarity, not unmixed with pleading, which would result\r\nin most cases in a tolerant acceptance.  If she showed any\r\ntendency to coquetry he would be apt to straighten her tie, or if\r\nshe "took up" with him at all, to call her by her first name.  If\r\nhe visited a department store it was to lounge familiarly over\r\nthe counter and ask some leading questions.  In more exclusive\r\ncircles, on the train or in waiting stations, he went slower.  If\r\nsome seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attention--\r\nto pass the compliments of the day, to lead the way to the parlor\r\ncar, carrying her grip, or, failing that, to take a seat next her\r\nwith the hope of being able to court her to her destination.\r\nPillows, books, a footstool, the shade lowered; all these figured\r\nin the things which he could do.

Once an individual has\r\npassed this faint line on the way downward he will get no glance\r\nfrom her.  There is another line at which the dress of a man will\r\ncause her to study her own. This line the individual at her elbow\r\nnow marked for Carrie.

It was a city of over\r\n500,000, with the ambition, the daring, the activity of a\r\nmetropolis of a million.  Its streets and houses were already\r\nscattered over an area of seventy-five square miles.  Its\r\npopulation was not so much thriving upon established commerce as\r\nupon the industries which prepared for the arrival of others. The\r\nsound of the hammer engaged upon the erection of new structures\r\nwas everywhere heard.  Great industries were moving in.  The huge\r\nrailroad corporations which had long before recognised the\r\nprospects of the place had seized upon vast tracts of land for\r\ntransfer and shipping purposes.  Street-car lines had been\r\nextended far out into the open country in anticipation of rapid\r\ngrowth.  The city had laid miles and miles of streets and sewers\r\nthrough regions where, perhaps, one solitary house stood out\r\nalone--a pioneer of the populous ways to be.  There were regions\r\nopen to the sweeping winds and rain, which were yet lighted\r\nthroughout the night with long, blinking lines of gas-lamps,\r\nfluttering in the wind.

The presence of ample\r\nground made this possible.  It gave an imposing appearance to\r\nmost of the wholesale houses, whose offices were upon the ground\r\nfloor and in plain view of the street.  The large plates of\r\nwindow glass, now so common, were then rapidly coming into use,\r\nand gave to the ground floor offices a distinguished and\r\nprosperous look.

There was no disputing\r\nthat, whatever he might think of him as a good fellow, he felt a\r\ncertain amount of contempt for him as a lover.  He could hoodwink\r\nhim all right.  Why, if he would just let Carrie see one such\r\nlittle incident as that of Thursday, it would settle the matter.\r\nHe ran on in thought, almost exulting, the while he laughed and\r\nchatted, and Drouet felt nothing.

That young lady, under\r\nthe stress of her situation and the tutelage of her new friend,\r\nchanged effectively.  She had the aptitude of the struggler who\r\nseeks emancipation.  The glow of a more showy life was not lost\r\nupon her.  She did not grow in knowledge so much as she awakened\r\nin the matter of desire.  Mrs. Hale's extended harangues upon the\r\nsubjects of wealth and position taught her to distinguish between\r\ndegrees of wealth.\r\nMrs. Hale loved to drive in the afternoon in the sun when it was\r\nfine, and to satisfy her soul with a sight of those mansions and\r\nlawns which she could not afford.  On the North Side had been\r\nerected a number of elegant mansions along what is now known as\r\nthe North Shore Drive.  The present lake wall of stone and\r\ngranitoid was not then in place, but the road had been well laid\r\nout, the intermediate spaces of lawn were lovely to look upon,\r\nand the houses were thoroughly new and imposing.  When the winter\r\nseason had passed and the first fine days of the early spring\r\nappeared, Mrs. Hale secured a buggy for an afternoon and invited\r\nCarrie.  They rode first through Lincoln Park and on far out\r\ntowards Evanston, turning back at four and arriving at the north\r\nend of the Shore Drive at about five o'clock.  At this time of\r\nyear the days are still comparatively short, and the shadows of\r\nthe evening were beginning to settle down upon the great city.\r\nLamps were beginning to burn with that mellow radiance which\r\nseems almost watery and translucent to the eye.

She was ripened by it in spirit for many\r\nsuggestions.  As they drove along the smooth pavement an\r\noccasional carriage passed.  She saw one stop and the footman\r\ndismount, opening the door for a gentleman who seemed to be\r\nleisurely returning from some afternoon pleasure.  Across the\r\nbroad lawns, now first freshening into green, she saw lamps\r\nfaintly glowing upon rich interiors.  Now it was but a chair, now\r\na table, now an ornate corner, which met her eye, but it appealed\r\nto her as almost nothing else could.  Such childish fancies as\r\nshe had had of fairy palaces and kingly quarters now came back.\r\nShe imagined that across these richly carved entrance-ways, where\r\nthe globed and crystalled lamps shone upon panelled doors set\r\nwith stained and designed panes of glass, was neither care nor\r\nunsatisfied desire.  She was perfectly certain that here was\r\nhappiness.  If she could but stroll up yon broad walk, cross that\r\nrich entrance-way, which to her was of the beauty of a jewel, and\r\nsweep in grace and luxury to possession and command--oh! how\r\nquickly would sadness flee; how, in an instant, would the\r\nheartache end.

The glow of the palatial\r\ndoors was still in her eye, the roll of cushioned carriages still\r\nin her ears.  What, after all, was Drouet?  What was she?  At her\r\nwindow, she thought it over, rocking to and fro, and gazing out\r\nacross the lamp-lit park toward the lamp-lit houses on Warren and\r\nAshland avenues.  She was too wrought up to care to go down to\r\neat, too pensive to do aught but rock and sing.  Some old tunes\r\ncrept to her lips, and, as she sang them, her heart sank.  She\r\nlonged and longed and longed.  It was now for the old cottage\r\nroom in Columbia City, now the mansion upon the Shore Drive, now\r\nthe fine dress of some lady, now the elegance of some scene.  She\r\nwas sad beyond measure, and yet uncertain, wishing, fancying.\r\nFinally, it seemed as if all her state was one of loneliness and\r\nforsakenness, and she could scarce refrain from trembling at the\r\nlip.

He knew\r\nthat Carrie listened to him pleasurably, and, without the least\r\neffort, he fell into a train of observation which absorbed her\r\nfancy.  He drew up his chair and modulated his voice to such a\r\ndegree that what he said seemed wholly confidential.  He confined\r\nhimself almost exclusively to his observation of men and\r\npleasures.  He had been here and there, he had seen this and\r\nthat.  Somehow he made Carrie wish to see similar things, and all\r\nthe while kept her aware of himself.  She could not shut out the\r\nconsciousness of his individuality and presence for a moment.

Once he touched her hand for\r\nemphasis and she only smiled.  He seemed to radiate an atmosphere\r\nwhich suffused her being.  He was never dull for a minute, and\r\nseemed to make her clever.  At least, she brightened under his\r\ninfluence until all her best side was exhibited.  She felt that\r\nshe was more clever with him than with others.

Carrie was possessed of that sympathetic, impressionable\r\nnature which, ever in the most developed form, has been the glory\r\nof the drama.  She was created with that passivity of soul which\r\nis always the mirror of the active world.  She possessed an\r\ninnate taste for imitation and no small ability.  Even without\r\npractice, she could sometimes restore dramatic situations she had\r\nwitnessed by re-creating, before her mirror, the expressions of\r\nthe various faces taking part in the scene.  She loved to\r\nmodulate her voice after the conventional manner of the\r\ndistressed heroine, and repeat such pathetic fragments as\r\nappealed most to her sympathies.  Of late, seeing the airy grace\r\nof the ingenue in several well-constructed plays, she had been\r\nmoved to secretly imitate it, and many were the little movements\r\nand expressions of the body in which she indulged from time to\r\ntime in the privacy of her chamber.  On several occasions, when\r\nDrouet had caught her admiring herself, as he imagined, in the\r\nmirror, she was doing nothing more than recalling some little\r\ngrace of the mouth or the eyes which she had witnessed in\r\nanother.  Under his airy accusation she mistook this for vanity\r\nand accepted the blame with a faint sense of error, though, as a\r\nmatter of fact, it was nothing more than the first subtle\r\noutcroppings of an artistic nature, endeavouring to re-create the\r\nperfect likeness of some phase of beauty which appealed to her.\r\nIn such feeble tendencies, be it known, such outworking of desire\r\nto reproduce life, lies the basis of all dramatic art."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Now, when Carrie heard Drouet's laudatory opinion of her dramatic\r\nability, her body tingled with satisfaction.  Like the flame\r\nwhich welds the loosened particles into a solid mass, his words\r\nunited those floating wisps of feeling which she had felt, but\r\nnever believed, concerning her possible ability, and made them\r\ninto a gaudy shred of hope.  Like all human beings, she had a\r\ntouch of vanity.  She felt that she could do things if she only\r\nhad a chance.  How often had she looked at the well-dressed\r\nactresses on the stage and wondered how she would look, how\r\ndelightful she would feel if only she were in their place.  The\r\nglamour, the tense situation, the fine clothes, the applause,\r\nthese had lured her until she felt that she, too, could act--that\r\nshe, too, could compel acknowledgment of power.

Thoughts of all the\r\ncharming women she had seen in plays--every fancy, every illusion\r\nwhich she had concerning the stage--now came back as a returning\r\ntide after the ebb.

With his\r\nregard died his power to be attentive to her, and this, to a\r\nwoman, is much greater than outright crime toward another.  Our\r\nself-love dictates our appreciation of the good or evil in\r\nanother.  In Mrs. Hurstwood it discoloured the very hue of her\r\nhusband's indifferent nature.

For the privilege\r\nof six rooms and a bath, running in a straight line, they were\r\ncompelled to pay thirty-five dollars a month--an average, and yet\r\nexorbitant, rent for a home at the time.

It was not the time, however, after many failures\r\nto find what he wanted, to hesitate.  It looked as though a third\r\nwould pay a hundred a month now.

The\r\nfurniture for each room was appropriate, and in the so-called\r\nparlour, or front room, was installed a piano, because Carrie\r\nsaid she would like to learn to play.  She kept a servant and\r\ndeveloped rapidly in household tactics and information.  For the\r\nfirst time in her life she felt settled, and somewhat justified\r\nin the eyes of society as she conceived of it.  Her thoughts were\r\nmerry and innocent enough.  For a long while she concerned\r\nherself over the arrangement of New York flats, and wondered at\r\nten families living in one building and all remaining strange and\r\nindifferent to each other.  She also marvelled at the whistles of\r\nthe hundreds of vessels in the harbour--the long, low cries of\r\nthe Sound steamers and ferry-boats when fog was on.  The mere\r\nfact that these things spoke from the sea made them wonderful.\r\nShe looked much at what she could see of the Hudson from her west\r\nwindows and of the great city building up rapidly on either hand.\r\nIt was much to ponder over, and sufficed to entertain her for\r\nmore than a year without becoming stale."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"For another thing, Hurstwood was exceedingly interesting in his\r\naffection for her.  Troubled as he was, he never exposed his\r\ndifficulties to her.  He carried himself with the same self-\r\nimportant air, took his new state with easy familiarity, and\r\nrejoiced in Carrie's proclivities and successes.  Each evening he\r\narrived promptly to dinner, and found the little dining-room a\r\nmost inviting spectacle.  In a way, the smallness of the room\r\nadded to its luxury.  It looked full and replete.  The white-\r\ncovered table was arrayed with pretty dishes and lighted with a\r\nfour-armed candelabra, each light of which was topped with a red\r\nshade.  Between Carrie and the girl the steaks and chops came out\r\nall right, and canned goods did the rest for a while.  Carrie\r\nstudied the art of making biscuit, and soon reached the stage\r\nwhere she could show a plate of light, palatable morsels for her\r\nlabour."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In this manner the second, third, and fourth months passed.\r\nWinter came, and with it a feeling that indoors was best, so that\r\nthe attending of theatres was not much talked of.  Hurstwood made\r\ngreat efforts to meet all expenditures without a show of feeling\r\none way or the other.  He pretended that he was reinvesting his\r\nmoney in strengthening the business for greater ends in the\r\nfuture.  He contented himself with a very moderate allowance of\r\npersonal apparel, and rarely suggested anything for Carrie.  Thus\r\nthe first winter passed."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In the second year, the business which Hurstwood managed did\r\nincrease somewhat.  He got out of it regularly the $150 per month\r\nwhich he had anticipated.

Her state\r\nseemed satisfactory enough.  Once in a while they would go to a\r\ntheatre together, occasionally in season to the beaches and\r\ndifferent points about the city, but they picked up no\r\nacquaintances.  Hurstwood naturally abandoned his show of fine\r\nmanners with her and modified his attitude to one of easy\r\nfamiliarity.  There were no misunderstandings, no apparent\r\ndifferences of opinion.  In fact, without money or visiting\r\nfriends, he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy nor\r\ncomment.  Carrie rather sympathised with his efforts and thought\r\nnothing upon her lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed in\r\nChicago.  New York as a corporate entity and her flat temporarily\r\nseemed sufficient."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"However, as Hurstwood's business increased, he, as stated, began\r\nto pick up acquaintances.  He also began to allow himself more\r\nclothes.  He convinced himself that his home life was very\r\nprecious to him, but allowed that he could occasionally stay away\r\nfrom dinner.  The first time he did this he sent a message saying\r\nthat he would be detained.  Carrie ate alone, and wished that it\r\nmight not happen again.

With it came a feeling of satisfaction in\r\nhaving a wife who could thus be content, and this satisfaction\r\nworked its natural result.  That is, since he imagined he saw her\r\nsatisfied, he felt called upon to give only that which\r\ncontributed to such satisfaction.  He supplied the furniture, the\r\ndecorations, the food, and the necessary clothing.  Thoughts of\r\nentertaining her, leading her out into the shine and show of\r\nlife, grew less and less.  He felt attracted to the outer world,\r\nbut did not think she would care to go along.  Once he went to\r\nthe theatre alone.  Another time he joined a couple of his new\r\nfriends at an evening game of poker.  Since his money-feathers\r\nwere beginning to grow again he felt like sprucing about.  All\r\nthis, however, in a much less imposing way than had been his wont\r\nin Chicago.  He avoided the gay places where he would be apt to\r\nmeet those who had known him.\r\nNow, Carrie began to feel this in various sensory ways.  She was\r\nnot the kind to be seriously disturbed by his actions.  Not\r\nloving him greatly, she could not be jealous in a disturbing way.\r\nIn fact, she was not jealous at all.  Hurstwood was pleased with\r\nher placid manner, when he should have duly considered it.  When\r\nhe did not come home it did not seem anything like a terrible\r\nthing to her.  She gave him credit for having the usual\r\nallurements of men--people to talk to, places to stop, friends to\r\nconsult with.  She was perfectly willing that he should enjoy\r\nhimself in his way, but she did not care to be neglected herself.\r\nHer state still seemed fairly reasonable, however.  All she did\r\nobserve was that Hurstwood was somewhat different."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Some time in the second year of their residence in Seventy-eighth\r\nStreet the flat across the hall from Carrie became vacant, and\r\ninto it moved a very handsome young woman and her husband, with\r\nboth of whom Carrie afterwards became acquainted.

This useful\r\nelevator, by which fuel, groceries, and the like were sent up\r\nfrom the basement, and garbage and waste sent down, was used by\r\nboth residents of one floor; that is, a small door opened into it\r\nfrom each flat."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"If the occupants of both flats answered to the whistle of the\r\njanitor at the same time, they would stand face to face when they\r\nopened the dumb-waiter doors.

She was\r\nin a night-robe and dressing-gown, with her hair very much\r\ntousled, but she looked so pretty and good-natured that Carrie\r\ninstantly conceived a liking for her.  The newcomer did no more\r\nthan smile shamefacedly, but it was sufficient.

There was no\r\napparent slope downward, and distinctly none upward, so far as\r\nthe casual observer might have seen.  But psychologically there\r\nwas a change, which was marked enough to suggest the future very\r\ndistinctly indeed.  This was in the mere matter of the halt his\r\ncareer had received when he departed from Chicago.  A man's\r\nfortune or material progress is very much the same as his bodily\r\ngrowth.  Either he is growing stronger, healthier, wiser, as the\r\nyouth approaching manhood, or he is growing weaker, older, less\r\nincisive mentally, as the man approaching old age.  There are no\r\nother states.  Frequently there is a period between the cessation\r\nof youthful accretion and the setting in, in the case of the\r\nmiddle-aged man, of the tendency toward decay when the two\r\nprocesses are almost perfectly balanced and there is little doing\r\nin either direction.  Given time enough, however, the balance\r\nbecomes a sagging to the grave side.  Slowly at first, then with\r\na modest momentum, and at last the graveward process is in the\r\nfull swing.  So it is frequently with man's fortune.  If its\r\nprocess of accretion is never halted, if the balancing stage is\r\nnever reached, there will be no toppling.  Rich men are,\r\nfrequently, in these days, saved from this dissolution of their\r\nfortune by their ability to hire younger brains.  These younger\r\nbrains look upon the interests of the fortune as their own, and\r\nso steady and direct its progress.  If each individual were left\r\nabsolutely to the care of his own interests, and were given time\r\nenough in which to grow exceedingly old, his fortune would pass\r\nas his strength and will.  He and his would be utterly dissolved\r\nand scattered unto the four winds of the heavens."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"But now see wherein the parallel changes.  A fortune, like a man,\r\nis an organism which draws to itself other minds and other\r\nstrength than that inherent in the founder.  Beside the young\r\nminds drawn to it by salaries, it becomes allied with young\r\nforces, which make for its existence even when the strength and\r\nwisdom of the founder are fading.  It may be conserved by the\r\ngrowth of a community or of a state.  It may be involved in\r\nproviding something for which there is a growing demand.  This\r\nremoves it at once beyond the special care of the founder.  It\r\nneeds not so much foresight now as direction.  The man wanes, the\r\nneed continues or grows, and the fortune, fallen into whose hands\r\nit may, continues.  Hence, some men never recognise the turning\r\nin the tide of their abilities.  It is only in chance cases,\r\nwhere a fortune or a state of success is wrested from them, that\r\nthe lack of ability to do as they did formerly becomes apparent.\r\nHurstwood, set down under new conditions, was in a position to\r\nsee that he was no longer young.

The poisons\r\ngenerated by remorse inveigh against the system, and eventually\r\nproduce marked physical deterioration.
