The fragment is valuable:  first,\r\nbecause it shows us how early the taste for collecting Elzevirs was\r\nfully developed, and, secondly, because it contains very sound\r\ncriticism of the mania.  Already, in the seventeenth century, lovers\r\nof the tiny Elzevirian books waxed pathetic over dates, already they\r\nknew that a 'Caesar' of 1635 was the right 'Caesar,' already they\r\nwere fond of the red-lettered passages, as in the first edition of\r\nthe 'Virgil' of 1636.

I have met, in the works\r\nof a lady novelist (but not elsewhere), with an Elzevir\r\n\'Theocritus.\'  The late Mr. Hepworth Dixon introduced into one of\r\nhis romances a romantic Elzevir Greek Testament, "worth its weight\r\nin gold."  Casual remarks of this kind encourage a popular delusion\r\nthat all Elzevirs are pearls of considerable price.

In Booksellers\' Row and in Castle Street he "picks up," for a\r\nshilling or two, Elzevirs, real or supposed.  To the beginner, any\r\nbook with a sphere on the title-page is an Elzevir.  For the\r\nbeginner\'s instruction, two copies of spheres are printed here.  The\r\nsecond is a sphere, an ill-cut, ill-drawn sphere, which is not\r\nElzevirian at all.  The mark was used in the seventeenth century by\r\nmany other booksellers and printers.  The first, on the other hand,\r\nis a true Elzevirian sphere, from a play of Moliere\'s, printed in\r\n1675.

First, they\r\noccasionally reprinted the full title-page, publisher\'s name and\r\nall, of the book they pirated.  Secondly, when they printed books of\r\na "dangerous" sort, Jansenist pamphlets and so forth, they used\r\npseudonyms like "Nic. Schouter," on the \'Lettres Provinciales\' of\r\nPascal.  Thirdly, there are real pseudonyms employed by the\r\nElzevirs.  John and Daniel, printing at Leyden (1652-1655), used the\r\nfalse name "Jean Sambix."  The Elzevirs of Amsterdam often placed\r\nthe name "Jacques le Jeune" on their title-pages.  The collector who\r\nremembers these things must also see that his purchases have the\r\nright ornaments at the heads of chapters, the right tail-pieces at\r\nthe ends.  Two of the most frequently recurring ornaments are the\r\nso-called "Tete de Buffle" and the "Sirene."

Two of these, Matthew and\r\nBonaventure, kept on the business, dating ex officina Elzeviriana.\r\nIn 1625 Bonaventure and Abraham (son of Matthew) became partners.\r\nThe \"good dates\" of Elzevirian books begin from 1626.

"Men scarcely\r\nknow how beautiful fire is," says Shelley; and we may say that most\r\nmen hardly know how beautiful an Elzevir was in its uncut and\r\noriginal form.  The Elzevirs we have may be "dear," but they are\r\ncertainly "dumpy twelves."  Their fair proportions have been docked\r\nby the binder.  At the Beckford sale there was a pearl of a book, a\r\n\'Marot;\' not an Elzevir, indeed, but a book published by Wetstein, a\r\nfollower of the Elzevirs.  This exquisite pair of volumes, bound in\r\nblue morocco, was absolutely unimpaired, and was a sight to bring\r\nhappy tears into the eyes of the amateur of Elzevirs.  There was a\r\ngracious svelte elegance about these tomes, an appealing and\r\nexquisite delicacy of proportion, that linger like sweet music in\r\nthe memory.  I have a copy of the Wetstein \'Marot\' myself, not a bad\r\ncopy, though murderously bound in that ecclesiastical sort of brown\r\ncalf antique, which goes well with hymn books, and reminds one of\r\ncakes of chocolate.  But my copy is only some 128 millimetres in\r\nheight, whereas the uncut Beckford copy (it had belonged to the\r\ngreat Pixerecourt) was at least 130 millimetres high.

Dr. Lemuel Gulliver remarks that the King of\r\nLilliput was taller than any of his court by almost the breadth of a\r\nnail, and that his altitude filled the minds of all with awe.  Well,\r\nthe Philistine may think a few millimetres, more or less, in the\r\nheight of an Elzevir are of little importance.  When he comes to\r\nsell, he will discover the difference.  An uncut, or almost uncut,\r\ncopy of a good Elzevir may be worth fifty or sixty pounds or more;\r\nan ordinary copy may bring fewer pence.  The binders usually pare\r\ndown the top and bottom more than the sides.  I have a 'Rabelais' of\r\nthe good date, with the red title (1663), and some of the pages have\r\nnever been opened, at the sides.  But the height is only some 122\r\nmillimetres, a mere dwarf.  Anything over 130 millimetres is very\r\nrare.

We\r\nmay gossip about a few of the more famous Elzevirs, those without\r\nwhich no collection is complete.  Of all Elzevirs the most famous\r\nand the most expensive is an old cookery book, \"'Le Pastissier\r\nFrancois.'

Now this\r\nbook has no intrinsic value any more than a Tauchnitz reprint of any\r\nmodern volume on cooking.  The 'Pastissier' is cherished because it\r\nis so very rare.  The tract passed into the hands of cooks, and the\r\nhands of cooks are detrimental to literature.  Just as nursery\r\nbooks, fairy tales, and the like are destroyed from generation to\r\ngeneration, so it happens with books used in the kitchen.  The\r\n'Pastissier,' to be sure, has a good frontispiece, a scene in a Low\r\nCountry kitchen, among the dead game and the dainties.

In an early edition of the 'Manuel' (1821) Brunet says,\r\nwith a feigned brutality (for he dearly loved an Elzevir), \"Till now\r\nI have disdained to admit this book into my work, but I have yielded\r\nto the prayers of amateurs.  Besides, how could I keep out a volume\r\nwhich was sold for one hundred and one francs in 1819?\"  One hundred\r\nand one francs!

It would have\r\nbeen money in the ducal pockets of the house of Marlborough to have\r\nkept this volume till the general sale of all their portable\r\nproperty at which our generation is privileged to assist.  No wonder\r\nthe 'Pastissier' was thought rare.  Berard only knew two copies.\r\nPietiers, writing on the Elzevirs in 1843, could cite only five\r\n'Pastissiers,' and in his 'Annales' he had found out but five more.\r\nWillems, on the other hand, enumerates some thirty, not including\r\nMotteley's.  Motteley was an uncultivated, untaught enthusiast.  He\r\nknew no Latin, but he had a FLAIR for uncut Elzevirs.  \"Incomptis\r\ncapillis,\" he would cry (it was all his lore) as he gloated over his\r\ntreasures.

Ellis and White had for sale in Bond\r\nStreet in 1883.  The English booksellers asked, I think, about 1,500\r\nfrancs for their copy.  Sensier's was sold for 128 francs in April,\r\n1828; for 201 francs in 1837.  Then the book was gloriously bound by\r\nTrautz-Bauzonnet, and was sold with Potier's books in 1870, when it\r\nfetched 2,910 francs.  At the Benzon sale (1875) it fetched 3,255\r\nfrancs, and, falling dreadfully in price, was sold again in 1877 for\r\n2,200 francs.  M. Dutuit, at Rouen, has a taller copy, bound by\r\nBauzonnet.  Last time it was sold (1851) it brought 251 francs.

It is fair to say,\r\nhowever, that this example of the 'Pastissier' was then bound up\r\nwith another book, Vlacq's edition of 'Le Cuisinier Francois,' and\r\nso went cheaper than it would otherwise have done.  M. de Fontaine\r\nde Resbecq declares that a friend of his bought six original pieces\r\nof Moliere's bound up with an old French translation of Garth's\r\n'Dispensary.'

There was no indication of\r\nprice on the box where this jewel was lying; the book, though\r\nunbound, was perfectly clean within.  'How much?' said I to the\r\nbookseller.  'You can have it for six sous,' he answered; 'is it too\r\nmuch?'  'No,' said I, and, trembling a little, I handed him the\r\nthirty centimes he asked for the 'Pastissier Francois.'

To my own knowledge an English collector has bought an\r\noriginal play of Moliere's, in the original vellum, for\r\neighteenpence.  But no one has such luck any longer.  Not, at least,\r\nin London.  A more expensive 'Pastissier' than that which brought\r\nsix sous was priced in Bachelin-Deflorenne's catalogue at 240\r\npounds.  A curious thing occurred when two uncut 'Pastissiers'\r\nturned up simultaneously in Paris.  One of them Morgand and Fatout\r\nsold for 400 pounds.  Clever people argued that one of the twin\r\nuncut 'Pastissiers' must be an imitation, a facsimile by means of\r\nphotogravure, or some other process.

The villain of fiction dearly loves a parish\r\nregister:  he cuts out pages, inserts others, intercalates remarks\r\nin a different coloured ink, and generally manipulates the register\r\nas a Greek manages his hand at ecarte, or as a Hebrew dealer in\r\nMoabite bric-a-brac treats a synagogue roll.

The bill provides that every register earlier than\r\n1837 shall be committed to the care of the Master of the Rolls, and\r\nremoved to the Record Office.  Now the common villain of fiction\r\nwould feel sadly out of place in the Register Office, where a more\r\nwatchful eye than that of a comic parish clerk would be kept on his\r\nproceedings.  Villains and local antiquaries will, therefore, use\r\nall their parliamentary influence to oppose and delay this bill,\r\nwhich is certainly hard on the parish archaeologist.  The men who\r\ngrub in their local registers, and slowly compile parish or county\r\nhistory, deserve to be encouraged rather than depressed.  Mr.\r\nChester Waters, therefore, has suggested that copies of registers\r\nshould be made, and the comparatively legible copy left in the\r\nparish, while the crabbed original is conveyed to the Record Office\r\nin London.  Thus the local antiquary would really have his work made\r\nmore easy for him (though it may be doubted whether he would quite\r\nenjoy that condescension), while the villain of romance would be\r\nfoiled; for it is useless (as a novel of Mr. Christie Murray\'s\r\nproves) to alter the register in the keeping of the parish when the\r\noriginal document is safe in the Record Office.  But previous\r\nexamples of enforced transcription (as in 1603) do not encourage us\r\nto suppose that the copies would be very scrupulously made.  Thus,\r\nafter the Reformation, the prayers for the dead in the old registers\r\nwere omitted by the copyist, who seemed to think (as the contractor\r\nfor "sandwich men" said to the poor fellows who carried the letter\r\nH), "I don\'t want you, and the public don\'t want you, and you\'re no\r\nuse to nobody."  Again, when Laurence Fletcher was buried in St.\r\nSaviour\'s, Southwark, in 1608, the old register described him as "a\r\nplayer, the King\'s servant."  But the clerk, keeping a note-book,\r\nsimply called Laurence Fletcher "a man," and (in 1625) he also\r\nstyled Mr. John Fletcher "a man."  Now, the old register calls Mr.\r\nJohn Fletcher "a poet."  To copy all the parish registers in England\r\nwould be a very serious task, and would probably be but slovenly\r\nperformed.  If they were reproduced, again, by any process of\r\nphotography, the old difficult court hand would remain as hard as\r\never.

J.\r\nRoberts, Little Britain, E.C.), we proceed to appropriate such\r\nmatters of curiosity as may interest minds neither parochial nor\r\ndoggedly antiquarian.  Parish registers among the civilised peoples\r\nof antiquity do not greatly concern us.  It seems certain that many\r\nPolynesian races have managed to record (in verse, or by some rude\r\nmarks) the genealogies of their chiefs through many hundreds of\r\nyears.  These oral registers are accepted as fairly truthful by some\r\nstudents, yet we must remember that Pindar supposed himself to\r\npossess knowledge of at least twenty-five generations before his own\r\ntime, and that only brought him up to the birth of Jason.  Nobody\r\nbelieves in Jason and Medea, and possibly the genealogical records\r\nof Maoris and Fijians are as little trustworthy as those of Pindaric\r\nGreece.  However, to consider thus is to consider too curiously.  We\r\nonly know for certain that genealogy very soon becomes important,\r\nand, therefore, that records are early kept, in a growing\r\ncivilisation.  "After Nehemiah\'s return from the captivity in\r\nBabylon, the priests at Jerusalem whose register was not found were\r\nas polluted put from the priesthood."  Rome had her parish\r\nregisters, which were kept in the temple of Saturn.  But modern\r\nparish registers were "discovered" (like America) in 1497, when\r\nCardinal Ximenes found it desirable to put on record the names of\r\nthe godfathers and godmothers of baptised children.  When these\r\nrelations of "gossip," or God\'s kin (as the word literally means),\r\nwere not certainly known, married persons could easily obtain\r\ndivorces, by pretending previous spiritual relationship.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"But it was only during the reign of Mary, (called the Bloody) that\r\nthis rule of registering godfathers and godmothers prevailed in\r\nEngland.  Henry VIII. introduced the custom of parish registers when\r\nin a Protestant humour.  By the way, how curiously has Madame de\r\nFlamareil (la femme de quarante ans, in Charles de Bernard's novel)\r\nanticipated the verdict of Mr. Froude on Henry VIII.!  'On accuse\r\nHenri VIII.,' dit Madame de Flamareil, \"moi je le comprends, et je\r\nl'absous; c'etait un coeur genereux, lorsqu'il ne les aimait plus,\r\nil les tuait.'\"  The public of England mistrusted, in the matter of\r\nparish registers, the generous heart of Henry VIII.  It is the fixed\r\nconviction of the public that all novelties in administration mean\r\nnew taxes.  Thus the Croatian peasantry were once on the point of\r\nrevolting because they imagined that they were to be taxed in\r\nproportion to the length of their moustaches.  The English believed,\r\nand the insurgents of the famous Pilgrimage of Grace declared, that\r\nbaptism was to be refused to all children who did not pay a\r\n\"trybette\" (tribute) to the king.  But Henry, or rather his\r\nminister, Cromwell, stuck to his plan, and (September 29, 1538)\r\nissued an injunction that a weekly register of weddings,\r\nchristenings, and burials should be kept by the curate of every\r\nparish.  The cost of the book (twopence in the case of St.\r\nMargaret's, Westminster) was defrayed by the parishioners.  The\r\noldest extant register books are those thus acquired in 1597 or\r\n1603.

The law required\r\n(for purposes of protecting trade) that all the dead should be\r\nburied in woollen winding-sheets.  The price of the wool was the\r\nobolus paid to the Charon of the Revenue.  After March 25, 1667, no\r\nperson was to be "buried in any shirt, shift, or sheet other that\r\nshould be made of woole only."  Thus when the children in a little\r\nOxfordshire village lately beheld a ghost, "dressed in a long narrow\r\ngown of woollen, with bandages round the head and chin," it is clear\r\nthat the ghost was much more than a hundred years old, for the act\r\n"had fallen into disuse long before it was repealed in 1814."  But\r\nthis has little to do with parish registers.  The addition made to\r\nthe duties of the keeper of the register in 1678 was this--he had to\r\ntake and record the affidavit of a kinsman of the dead, to the\r\neffect that the corpse was actually buried in woollen fabric.  The\r\nupper classes, however, preferred to bury in linen, and to pay the\r\nfine of 5L.  When Mistress Oldfield, the famous actress, was\r\ninterred in 1730, her body was arrayed "in a very fine Brussels lace\r\nheaddress, a holland shift with a tucker and double ruffles of the\r\nsame lace, and a pair of new kid gloves."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'In 1694 an empty exchequer was replenished by a tax on marriages,\r\nbirths, and burials, the very extortion which had been feared by the\r\ninsurgents in the Pilgrimage of Grace.

An attempt\r\nto introduce the registration of births was made in 1753, but\r\nunsuccessfully.  The public had the old superstitious dread of\r\nanything like a census.  Moreover, the custom was denounced as\r\n"French," and therefore abominable.  In the same way it was thought\r\ntelling to call the cloture "the French gag" during some recent\r\ndiscussions of parliamentary rules.  In 1783 the parish register was\r\nagain made the instrument of taxation, and threepence was charged on\r\nevery entry.  Thus "the clergyman was placed in the invidious light\r\nof a tax collector, and as the poor were often unable or unwilling\r\nto pay the tax, the clergy had a direct inducement to retain their\r\ngood-will by keeping the registers defective."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'It is easy to imagine the indignation in Scotland when "bang went\r\nsaxpence" every time a poor man had twins!

In quite recent times (1832) it was thought worth\r\nwhile to record that Charity Morrell at her wedding had signed her\r\nname in the register with her right foot, and that the ring had been\r\nplaced on the fourth toe of her left foot; for poor Charity was born\r\nwithout arms.  Sometimes the time of a birth was recorded with much\r\nminuteness, that the astrologers might draw a more accurate\r\nhoroscope.  Unlucky children, with no acknowledged fathers, were\r\nentered in a variety of odd ways.  In Lambeth (1685), George\r\nSpeedwell is put down as "a merry begot;" Anne Twine is "filia\r\nuniuscujusque."  At Croydon, a certain William is "terraefilius"\r\n(1582), an autochthonous infant.

What does the spectre in\r\nthe tapestried chamber do when the house is NOT full, and no guest\r\nis put in the room to bury strangers in, the haunted room?

Only now and then is a guest placed\r\nin the "haunted room."  Then I like to fancy the glee of the lady in\r\ngreen or the radiant boy, or the headless man, or the old gentleman\r\nin snuff-coloured clothes, as he, or she, recognises the presence of\r\na spectator, and prepares to give his or her best effects in the\r\nfamiliar style.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Now in China and Japan certainly a ghost does not wait till people\r\nenter the haunted room:  a ghost, like a person of fashion, \"goes\r\neverywhere.\"  Moreover, he has this artistic excellence, that very\r\noften you don't know him from an embodied person.  He counterfeits\r\nmortality so cleverly that he (the ghost) has been known to\r\npersonate a candidate for honours, and pass an examination for him.\r\nA pleasing example of this kind, illustrating the limitations of\r\nghosts, is told in Mr. Giles's book.  A gentleman of Huai Shang\r\nnamed Chou-t'ien-i had arrived at the age of fifty, but his family\r\nconsisted of but one son, a fine boy, \"strangely averse from study,\"\r\nas if there were anything strange in THAT.  One day the son\r\ndisappeared mysteriously, as people do from West Ham.  In a year he\r\ncame back, said he had been detained in a Taoist monastery, and, to\r\nall men's amazement, took to his books.  Next year he obtained is\r\nB.A. degree, a First Class.  All the neighbourhood was overjoyed,\r\nfor Huai Shang was like Pembroke College (Oxford), where, according\r\nto the poet, \"First Class men are few and far between.\"  It was who\r\nshould have the honour of giving his daughter as bride to this\r\nintellectual marvel.  A very nice girl was selected, but most\r\nunexpectedly the B.A. would not marry.  This nearly broke his\r\nfather's heart.  The old gentleman knew, according to Chinese\r\nbelief, that if he had no grandchild there would be no one in the\r\nnext generation to feed his own ghost and pay it all the little\r\nneedful attentions.  \"Picture then the father naming and insisting\r\non the day;\" till K'o-ch'ang, B.A., got up and ran away.  His mother\r\ntried to detain him, when his clothes \"came off in her hand,\" and\r\nthe bachelor vanished!  Next day appeared the real flesh and blood\r\nson, who had been kidnapped and enslaved.  The genuine K'o-ch'ang\r\nwas overjoyed to hear of his approaching nuptials.  The rites were\r\nduly celebrated, and in less than a year the old gentleman welcomed\r\nhis much-longed-for grand child.  But, oddly enough, K'o-ch'ang,\r\nthough very jolly and universally beloved, was as stupid as ever,\r\nand read nothing but the sporting intelligence in the newspapers.\r\nIt was now universally admitted that the learned K'o-ch'ang had been\r\nan impostor, a clever ghost.

So much\r\nmay be gathered from the story of Chu and Lu.

Off went old Chu, and soon returned with the\r\naugust effigy (which wore \"a green face, a red beard, and a hideous\r\nexpression\") in his arms.

Next we come to playful frauds, or\r\nfrauds in their origin playful, like (perhaps) the Shakespearian\r\nforgeries of Ireland, the supercheries of Prosper Merimee, the sham\r\nantique ballads (very spirited poems in their way) of Surtees, and\r\nmany other examples.

Perhaps the most interesting of the poems of Orpheus to us\r\nwould have been his 'Inferno,' or [Greek text], in which the poet\r\ngave his own account of his descent to Hades in search of Eurydice.\r\nBut only a dubious reference to one adventure in the journey is\r\nquoted by Plutarch.

But of all these frauds the\r\ngreatest (according to the most \"advanced\" theory on the subject) is\r\nthe \"Forgery of the Iliad and Odyssey!\"  The opinions of the\r\nscholars who hold that the Iliad and Odyssey, which we know and\r\nwhich Plato knew, are not the epics known to Herodotus, but later\r\ncompositions, are not very clear nor consistent.  But it seems to be\r\nvaguely held that about the time of Pericles there arose a kind of\r\nGreek Macpherson.  This ingenious impostor worked on old epic\r\nmaterials, but added many new ideas of his own about the gods,\r\nconverting the Iliad (the poem which we now possess) into a kind of\r\nmocking romance, a Greek Don Quixote.  He also forged a number of\r\npseudo-archaic words, tenses, and expressions, and added the\r\nnumerous references to iron, a metal practically unknown, it is\r\nasserted, to Greece before the sixth century.  If we are to believe,\r\nwith Professor Paley, that the chief incidents of the Iliad and\r\nOdyssey were unknown to Sophocles, AEschylus, and the contemporary\r\nvase painters, we must also suppose that the Greek Macpherson\r\ninvented most of the situations in the Odyssey and Iliad.  According\r\nto this theory the 'cooker' of the extant epics was far the greatest\r\nand most successful of all literary impostors, for he deceived the\r\nwhole world, from Plato downwards, till he was exposed by Mr. Paley.\r\nThere are times when one is inclined to believe that Plato must have\r\nbeen the forger himself, as Bacon (according to the other\r\nhypothesis) was the author of Shakespeare's plays.  Thus \"Plato the\r\nwise, and large-browed Verulam,\" would be \"the first of those who\"\r\nforge!  Next to this prodigious imposture, no doubt, the false\r\n'Letters of Phalaris' are the most important of classical forgeries.\r\nAnd these illustrate, like most literary forgeries, the extreme\r\nworthlessness of literary taste as a criterion of the authenticity\r\nof writings.

The Institutes took\r\nexcellent care of Brahmans and cows, as the Decretals did of the\r\nPope and the clergy, and the earliest Popes had about as much hand\r\nin the Decretals as Vishnu had in his Institutes.

"The miracle\r\nwould be greater," said Pantagruel, "if they made bad wine taste\r\ngood."

The temporary but wide\r\nand turbulent success of the Ireland forgeries suggests the\r\ndisagreeable reflection that criticism and learning are (or a\r\nhundred years ago were) worth very little as literary touchstones.\r\nA polished and learned society, a society devoted to Shakespeare and\r\nto the stage, was taken in by a boy of eighteen.  Young Ireland not\r\nonly palmed off his sham prose documents, most makeshift imitations\r\nof the antique, but even his ridiculous verses on the experts.\r\nJames Boswell went down on his knees and thanked Heaven for the\r\nsight of them, and, feeling thirsty after these devotions, drank hot\r\nbrandy and water.  Dr. Parr was not less readily gulled, and\r\nprobably the experts, like Malone, who held aloof, were as much\r\ninfluenced by jealousy as by science.  The whole story of young\r\nIreland's forgeries is not only too long to be told here, but forms\r\nthe topic of a novel ('The Talk of the Town') by Mr. James Payn.\r\nThe frauds in his hands lose neither their humour nor their\r\ncomplicated interest of plot.  To be brief, then, Mr. Samuel Ireland\r\nwas a gentleman extremely fond of old literature and old books.  If\r\nwe may trust the 'Confessions' (1805) of his candid son, Mr. W. H.\r\nIreland, a more harmless and confiding old person than Samuel never\r\ncollected early English tracts.  Living in his learned society, his\r\nson, Mr. W. H. Ireland, acquired not only a passion for black\r\nletters, but a desire to emulate Chatterton.  His first step in\r\nguilt was the forgery of an autograph on an old pamphlet, with which\r\nhe gratified Samuel Ireland.  He also wrote a sham inscription on a\r\nmodern bust of Cromwell, which he represented as an authentic\r\nantique.  Finding that the critics were taken in, and attributed\r\nthis new bust to the old sculptor Simeon, Ireland conceived a very\r\nlow and not unjustifiable opinion of critical tact.  Critics would\r\nfind merit in anything which seemed old enough.  Ireland's next\r\nachievement was the forgery of some legal documents concerning\r\nShakespeare.  Just as the bad man who deceived the guileless Mr.\r\nShapira forged his 'Deuteronomy' on the blank spaces of old\r\nsynagogue rolls, so young Ireland used the cut-off ends of old rent\r\nrolls.  He next bought up quantities of old fly-leaves of books, and\r\non this ancient paper he indicted a sham confession of faith, which\r\nhe attributed to Shakespeare.  Being a strong \"evangelical,\" young\r\nMr. Ireland gave a very Protestant complexion to this edifying\r\ndocument.  And still the critics gaped and wondered and believed."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ireland's method was to write in an ink made by blending various\r\nliquids used in the marbling of paper for bookbinding.  This stuff\r\nwas supplied to him by a bookbinder's apprentice.  When people asked\r\nquestions as to whence all the new Shakespeare manuscripts came, he\r\nsaid they were presented to him by a gentleman who wished to remain\r\nanonymous.  Finally, the impossibility of producing this gentleman\r\nwas one of the causes of the detection of the fraud.  According to\r\nhimself, Ireland performed prodigies of acuteness.  Once he had\r\nforged, at random, the name of a contemporary of Shakespeare.  He\r\nwas confronted with a genuine signature, which, of course, was quite\r\ndifferent.  He obtained leave to consult his \"anonymous gentleman,\"\r\nrushed home, forged the name again on the model of what had been\r\nshown to him, and returned with this signature as a new gift from\r\nhis benefactor.  That nameless friend had informed him (he swore)\r\nthat there were two persons of the same name, and that both\r\nsignatures were genuine.  Ireland's impudence went the length of\r\nintroducing an ancestor of his own, with the same name as himself,\r\namong the companions of Shakespeare.  If 'Vortigern' had succeeded\r\n(and it was actually put on the stage with all possible pomp),\r\nIreland meant to have produced a series of pseudo-Shakespearian\r\nplays from William the Conqueror to Queen Elizabeth.  When busy with\r\n'Vortigern,' he was detected by a friend of his own age, who pounced\r\non him while he was at work, as Lasus pounced on Onomacritus.  The\r\ndiscoverer, however, consented to \"stand in\" with Ireland, and did\r\nnot divulge his secret.  At last, after the fiasco of 'Vortigern,'\r\nsuspicion waxed so strong, and disagreeable inquiries for the\r\nanonymous benefactor were so numerous, that Ireland fled from his\r\nfather's house.  He confessed all, and, according to his own\r\naccount, fell under the undying wrath of Samuel Ireland.  Any reader\r\nof Ireland's confessions will be likely to sympathise with old\r\nSamuel as the dupe of his son.  The whole story is told with a\r\ncurious mixture of impudence and humour, and with great\r\nplausibility.  Young Ireland admits that his \"desire for laughter\"\r\nwas almost irresistible, when people--learned, pompous, sagacious\r\npeople--listened attentively to the papers.  One feels half inclined\r\nto forgive the rogue for the sake of his youth, his cleverness, his\r\nhumour.  But the 'Confessions' are, not improbably, almost as\r\napocryphal as the original documents.  They were written for the\r\nsake of money, and it is impossible to say how far the same\r\nmercenary motive actuated Ireland in his forgeries.  Dr. Ingleby, in\r\nhis 'Shakespeare Fabrications,' takes a very rigid view of the\r\nconduct, not only of William, but of old Samuel Ireland.  Sam,\r\naccording to Dr. Ingleby, was a partner in the whole imposture, and\r\nthe confession was only one element in the scheme of fraud.  Old\r\nSamuel was the Fagin of a band of young literary Dodgers.  He\r\n\"positively trained his whole family to trade in forgery,\" and as\r\nfor Mr. W. H. Ireland, he was \"the most accomplished liar that ever\r\nlived,\" which is certainly a distinction in its way.  The point of\r\nthe joke is that, after the whole conspiracy exploded, people were\r\nanxious to buy examples of the forgeries.  Mr. W. H. Ireland was\r\nequal to the occasion.  He actually forged his own, or (according to\r\nDr. Ingleby) his father's forgeries, and, by thus increasing the\r\nsupply, he deluged the market with sham shams, with imitations of\r\nimitations.  If this accusation be correct, it is impossible not to\r\nadmire the colossal impudence of Mr. W. H. Ireland.  Dr. Ingleby, in\r\nthe ardour of his honest indignation, pursues William into his\r\nprivate life, which, it appears, was far from exemplary.  But\r\nliterary criticism should be content with a man's works; his\r\ndomestic life is matter, as Aristotle often says, \"for a separate\r\nkind of investigation.\"  Old Ritson used to say that \"every literary\r\nimpostor deserved hanging as much as a common thief.\"  W. H.\r\nIreland's merits were never recognised by the law."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"How old Ritson would have punished \"the old corrector,\" it is\r\n\"better only guessing,\" as the wicked say, according to Clough, in\r\nregard to their own possible chastisement.  The difficulty is to\r\nascertain who the apocryphal old corrector really was.  The story of\r\nhis misdeeds was recently brought back to mind by the death, at an\r\nadvanced age, of the learned Shakespearian, Mr. J. Payne Collier.\r\nMr. Collier was, to put it mildly, the Shapira of the old corrector.\r\nHe brought that artist's works before the public; but WHY? how\r\ndeceived, or how influenced, it is once more \"better only guessing.\"\r\nMr. Collier first introduced to the public notice his singular copy\r\nof a folio Shakespeare (second edition), loaded with ancient\r\nmanuscript emendations, in 1849.  His account of this book was\r\nsimple and plausible.  He chanced, one day, to be in the shop of Mr.\r\nRudd, the bookseller, in Great Newport Street, when a parcel of\r\nsecond-hand volumes arrived from the country.  When the parcel was\r\nopened, the heart of the Bibliophile began to sing, for the packet\r\ncontained two old folios, one of them an old folio Shakespeare of\r\nthe second edition (1632).  The volume (mark this) was \"much\r\ncropped,\" greasy, and imperfect.  Now the student of Mr. Hamilton's\r\n'Inquiry' into the whole affair is already puzzled.  In later days,\r\nMr. Collier said that his folio had previously been in the\r\npossession of a Mr. Parry.  On the other hand, Mr. Parry (then a\r\nvery aged man) failed to recognise his folio in Mr. Collier's, for\r\nHIS copy was \"cropped,\" whereas the leaves of Mr. Collier's example\r\nwere NOT mutilated.  Here, then ('Inquiry,' pp.  12, 61), we have\r\ntwo descriptions of the outward aspect of Mr. Collier's dubious\r\ntreasure.  In one account it is \"much cropped\" by the book-binder's\r\ncruel shears; in the other, its unmutilated condition is contrasted\r\nwith that of a copy which has been \"cropped.\"  In any case, Mr.\r\nCollier hoped, he says, to complete an imperfect folio he possessed,\r\nwith leaves taken from the folio newly acquired for thirty\r\nshillings.  But the volumes happened to have the same defects, and\r\nthe healing process was impossible.  Mr. Collier chanced to be going\r\ninto the country, when in packing the folio he had bought of Rudd he\r\nsaw it was covered with manuscript corrections in an old hand.\r\nThese he was inclined to attribute to one Thomas Perkins, whose name\r\nwas written on the fly-leaf, and who might have been a connection of\r\nRichard Perkins, the actor (flor. 1633)  The notes contained many\r\nvarious readings, and very numerous changes in punctuation.  Some of\r\nthese Mr. Collier published in his 'Notes and Emendations' (1852),\r\nand in an edition of the 'Plays.'  There was much discussion, much\r\ndoubt, and the folio of the old corrector (who was presumed to have\r\nmarked the book in the theatre during early performances) was\r\nexhibited to the Society of Antiquaries.  Then Mr. Collier presented\r\nthe treasure to the Duke of Devonshire, who again lent it for\r\nexamination to the British Museum.  Mr. Hamilton published in the\r\nTimes (July, 1859) the results of his examination of the old\r\ncorrector.  It turned out that the old corrector was a modern myth.\r\nHe had first made his corrections in pencil and in a modern hand,\r\nand then he had copied them over in ink, and in a forged ancient\r\nhand.  The same word sometimes recurred in both handwritings.  The\r\nink, which looked old, was really no English ink at all, not even\r\nIreland's mixture.  It seemed to be sepia, sometimes mixed with a\r\nlittle Indian ink.  Mr. Hamilton made many other sad discoveries.\r\nHe pointed out that Mr. Collier had published, from a Dulwich MS., a\r\nletter of Mrs. Alleyne's (the actor's wife), referring to\r\nShakespeare as \"Mr. Shakespeare of the Globe.\"  Now the Dulwich MS.\r\nwas mutilated and blank in the very place where this interesting\r\nreference should have occurred.  Such is a skeleton history of the\r\nold corrector, his works and ways.  It is probable that--thanks to\r\nhis assiduities--new Shakespearian documents will in future be\r\nreceived with extreme scepticism; and this is all the fruit, except\r\nacres of newspaper correspondence, which the world has derived from\r\nMr. Collier's greasy and imperfect but unique \"corrected folio.\""}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The recency and (to a Shakespearian critic) the importance of these\r\nforgeries obscures the humble merit of Surtees, with his ballads of\r\nthe 'Slaying of Antony Featherstonhaugh,' and of 'Bartram's Dirge.'\r\nSurtees left clever lacunae in these songs, 'collected from oral\r\ntradition,' and furnished notes so learned that they took in Sir\r\nWalter Scott.

There is\r\nsome difference of opinion among philologists about the derivation\r\nof bouquin, but all book-hunters know the meaning of the word.  The\r\nbouquin is the \"small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold,\"\r\nwhich lies among the wares of the stall-keeper, patient in rain and\r\ndust, till the hunter comes who can appreciate the quarry.  We like\r\nto think of Moliere lounging through the narrow streets in the\r\nevening, returning, perhaps, from some noble house where he has been\r\nreading the proscribed 'Tartuffe,' or giving an imitation of the\r\nrival actors at the Hotel Bourgogne.  Absent as the contemplateur\r\nis, a dingy book-stall wakens him from his reverie.  His lace\r\nruffles are soiled in a moment with the learned dust of ancient\r\nvolumes.  Perhaps he picks up the only work out of all his library\r\nthat is known to exist,--un ravissant petit Elzevir, 'De Imperio\r\nMagni Mogolis' (Lugd.  Bat. 1651).  On the title-page of this tiny\r\nvolume, one of the minute series of 'Republics' which the Elzevirs\r\npublished, the poet has written his rare signature, \"J. B. P.\r\nMoliere,\" with the price the book cost him, \"1 livre, 10 sols.\"  \"Il\r\nn'est pas de bouquin qui s'echappe de ses mains,\" says the author of\r\n'La Guerre Comique,' the last of the pamphlets which flew about\r\nduring the great literary quarrel about \"L'Ecole des Femmes.\"\r\nThanks to M. Soulie the catalogue of Moliere's library has been\r\nfound, though the books themselves have passed out of view.  There\r\nare about three hundred and fifty volumes in the inventory, but\r\nMoliere's widow may have omitted as valueless (it is the foible of\r\nher sex) many rusty bouquins, now worth far more than their weight\r\nin gold.

Many of Moliere's plays appearing first, separately, in\r\nsmall octavo, were adorned with frontispieces, illustrative of some\r\nscene in the comedy.  Thus, in the 'Misanthrope' (Rihou 1667) we see\r\nAlceste, green ribbons and all, discoursing with Philinte, or\r\nperhaps listening to the famous sonnet of Oronte; it is not easy to\r\nbe quite certain, but the expression of Alceste's face looks rather\r\nas if he were being baited with a sonnet.  From the close of the\r\nseventeenth century onwards, the taste for title-pages declined,\r\nexcept when Moreau or Gravelot drew vignettes on copper, with\r\nabundance of cupids and nymphs.  These were designed for very\r\nluxurious and expensive books; for others, men contented themselves\r\nwith a bald simplicity, which has prevailed till our own time.

He had always been a book-hunter,\r\never since, at an extremely early age, he had awakened to the errors\r\nof his ways as a collector of stamps and monograms.

He\r\nconstantly declined to believe that the devil came for that renowned\r\namateur of black letter, G. Steevens.  Dibdin himself, who tells the\r\nstory (with obvious anxiety and alarm), pretends to refuse credit to\r\nthe ghastly narrative.  "His language," says Dibdin, in his account\r\nof the book-hunter\'s end, "was, too frequently, the language of\r\nimprecation."  This is rather good, as if Dibdin thought a gentleman\r\nmight swear pretty often, but not "TOO frequently."  "Although I am\r\nnot disposed to admit," Dibdin goes on, "the WHOLE of the testimony\r\nof the good woman who watched by Steevens\'s bedside, although my\r\nprejudices (as they may be called) will not allow me to believe that\r\nthe windows shook, and that strange noises and deep groans were\r\nheard at midnight in his room, yet no creature of common sense (and\r\nthis woman possessed the quality in an eminent degree) could mistake\r\noaths for prayers;" and so forth.

We are all apt to hold favourable views of\r\nour own amusements, and, for my own part, I believe that trout and\r\nsalmon are incapable of feeling pain.  But the flimsiness of\r\nBlinton\'s theories must be apparent to every unbiassed moralist.\r\nHis "harmless taste" really involved most of the deadly sins, or at\r\nall events a fair working majority of them.  He coveted his\r\nneighbours\' books.  When he got the chance he bought books in a\r\ncheap market and sold them in a dear market, thereby degrading\r\nliterature to the level of trade.  He took advantage of the\r\nignorance of uneducated persons who kept book-stalls.  He was\r\nenvious, and grudged the good fortune of others, while he rejoiced\r\nin their failures.  He turned a deaf ear to the appeals of poverty.\r\nHe was luxurious, and laid out more money than he should have done\r\non his selfish pleasures, often adorning a volume with a morocco\r\nbinding when Mrs. Blinton sighed in vain for some old point\r\nd\'Alencon lace.

It is true that when he got home\r\nand consulted \'Willems,\' he found that he had got hold of the wrong\r\ncopy, in which the figures denoting the numbers of pages are printed\r\nright, and which is therefore worth exactly "nuppence" to the\r\ncollector.  But the intention is the thing, and Blinton\'s intention\r\nwas distinctly fraudulent.  When he discovered his error, then "his\r\nlanguage," as Dibdin says, "was that of imprecation."  Worse (if\r\npossible) than this, Blinton had gone to a sale, begun to bid for\r\n\'Les Essais de Michel, Seigneur de Montaigne\' (Foppens, MDCLIX.),\r\nand, carried away by excitement, had "plunged" to the extent of 15\r\npounds, which was precisely the amount of money he owed his plumber\r\nand gasfitter, a worthy man with a large family.  Then, meeting a\r\nfriend (if the book-hunter has friends), or rather an accomplice in\r\nlawless enterprise, Blinton had remarked the glee on the other\'s\r\nface.  The poor man had purchased a little old Olaus Magnus, with\r\nwoodcuts, representing were-wolves, fire-drakes, and other fearful\r\nwild-fowl, and was happy in his bargain.

Mr. Ernest Quentin\r\nBauchart has contributed to the discussion of this problem by\r\npublishing a bibliography, in two quarto volumes, of books which\r\nhave been in the libraries of famous beauties of old, queens and\r\nprincesses of France.  There can be no doubt that these ladies were\r\npossessors of exquisite printed books and manuscripts wonderfully\r\nbound, but it remains uncertain whether the owners, as a rule, were\r\nbibliophiles; whether their hearts were with their treasures.\r\nIncredible as it may seem to us now, literature was highly respected\r\nin the past, and was even fashionable.

Therefore, as Fashion gave her commands, we\r\ncannot hastily affirm that the ladies who obeyed were really book-\r\nlovers.  In our more polite age, Fashion has decreed that ladies\r\nshall smoke, and bet, and romp, but it would be premature to assert\r\nthat all ladies who do their duty in these matters are born romps,\r\nor have an unaffected liking for cigarettes.  History, however,\r\nmaintains that many of the renowned dames whose books are now the\r\nmost treasured of literary relics were actually inclined to study as\r\nwell as to pleasure, like Marguerite de Valois and the Comtesse de\r\nVerrue, and even Madame de Pompadour.  Probably books and arts were\r\nmore to this lady\'s liking than the diversions by which she beguiled\r\nthe tedium of Louis XV.; and many a time she would rather have been\r\nquiet with her plays and novels than engaged in conscientiously\r\nconducted but distasteful revels.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Like a true Frenchman, M.

In the same way, a studious girl or matron says, \"This is a\r\nbook,\" and reads it, if read she does, without caring about the\r\ndate, or the state, or the publisher's name, or even very often\r\nabout the author's.  I remember, before the publication of a novel\r\nnow celebrated, seeing a privately printed vellum-bound copy on\r\nlarge paper in the hands of a literary lady.  She was holding it\r\nover the fire, and had already made the vellum covers curl wide open\r\nlike the shells of an afflicted oyster."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"When I asked what the volume was, she explained that \"It is a book\r\nwhich a poor man has written, and he's had it printed to see whether\r\nsome one won't be kind enough to publish it.\"  I ventured, perhaps\r\npedantically, to point out that the poor man could not be so very\r\npoor, or he would not have made so costly an experiment on Dutch\r\npaper.  But the lady said she did not know how that might be, and\r\nshe went on toasting the experiment.  In all this there is a fine\r\ncontempt for everything but the spiritual aspect of literature;\r\nthere is an aversion to the mere coquetry and display of morocco and\r\nred letters, and the toys which amuse the minds of men.  Where\r\nladies have caught \"the Bibliomania,\" I fancy they have taken this\r\npretty fever from the other sex.  But it must be owned that the\r\nbooks they have possessed, being rarer and more romantic, are even\r\nmore highly prized by amateurs than examples from the libraries of\r\nGrolier, and Longepierre, and D'Hoym.  M. Bauchart's book is a\r\ncomplete guide to the collector of these expensive relics.  He\r\nbegins his dream of fair women who have owned books with the pearl\r\nof the Valois, Marguerite d'Angouleme, the sister of Francis I.  The\r\nremains of her library are chiefly devotional manuscripts.  Indeed,\r\nit is to be noted that all these ladies, however frivolous,\r\npossessed the most devout and pious books, and whole collections of\r\nprayers copied out by the pen, and decorated with miniatures.\r\nMarguerite's library was bound in morocco, stamped with a crowned M\r\nin interlacs sown with daisies, or, at least, with conventional\r\nflowers which may have been meant for daisies.  If one could choose,\r\nperhaps the most desirable of the specimens extant is 'Le Premier\r\nLivre du Prince des Poetes, Homere,' in Salel's translation.  For\r\nthis translation Ronsard writes a prologue, addressed to the manes\r\nof Salel, in which he complains that he is ridiculed for his poetry.\r\nHe draws a characteristic picture of Homer and Salel in Elysium,\r\namong the learned lovers:"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"qui parmi les fleurs devisent\r\nAu giron de leur dame."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Marguerite's manuscript copy of the First Book of the Iliad is a\r\nsmall quarto, adorned with daisies, fleurs de-lis, and the crowned\r\nM.

Her crescent shone not only on her books, but on the\r\npalace walls of France, in the Louvre, Fontainebleau, and Anet, and\r\nher initial D. is inextricably interlaced with the H. of her royal\r\nlover.  Indeed, Henri added the D to his own cypher, and this must\r\nhave been so embarrassing for his wife Catherine, that people have\r\ngood-naturedly tried to read the curves of the D's as C's.

The motto, in that case, would\r\nrun, "Expectata (lilia) non eludent."  As it stands, the feminine\r\nadjective, "expectata," in the singular, must apply either to the\r\nlady who owned the volumes, or to the "Margarita," her emblem, or to\r\nboth.  Yet the ungrammatical rendering is that which M. Bauchart\r\nsuggests.  Many of the books, Marguerite\'s or not, were sold at\r\nprices over 100 pounds in London, in 1884 and 1883.

But she was not unread in the old French poets, such as\r\nCoquillart; she condescended to Ariosto; she had that dubious\r\ncharacter, Theophile de Viaud, beautifully bound; she owned the\r\nRabelais of 1553; and, what is particularly interesting, M. de\r\nLignerolles possesses her copy of 'L'Eschole des Femmes, Comedie par\r\nJ.
