I have returned, and thank Heaven   sincerely I do not need to ask you for anything. My blessed girl   Julia has supported herself and little Jewel these years while   I've been feeding on husks. I don't see now how I was willing to   be so revoltingly cruel and cowardly as to leave her in the lurch,   but she has made friends and they have stood by her, and now I've   been back since September, doing all in my power to make up what I   can to her and Jewel, as we call little Julia. They were treasures   to return to such as I deserved to have lost forever; but Julia   treats me as if I'd been white to her right all along. I've lately   secured a position that I hope to keep. My wife has been   dressmaking, and this is something in the dry goods line that I   got through her. The firm want us to go to Europe to do some   buying. They will pay the expenses of both; but that leaves Jewel.   I've heard that Lawrence's wife and daughter are living with you.   I wondered if you'd let us bring Jewel as far as New York and drop   her with you for the six weeks that we shall be gone. If we had a   little more ahead we'd take the child with us. She is eight years   old and wouldn't be any trouble, but cash is scarce, and although   we could board her here with some friend, I'd like to have her   become acquainted with her grandfather, and I thought as Madge and   Eloise were with you, they would look after her if Mrs. Forbes is   no longer there. This has all come about very suddenly, and we   sail next Wednesday on the Scythia, so I'll be much obliged if you   will wire me.
