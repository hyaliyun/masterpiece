It will be rather hard for me, you must admit, when I confess to Nimmie Amee that I have come to marry her because it is my duty to do so, and therefore the fewer witnesses there are to our meeting the better for both of us. After I have found Nimmie Amee and she has managed to control her joy at our reunion, I shall take her to the Emerald City and introduce her to Ozma and Dorothy, and to Betsy Bobbin and Tiny Trot, and all our other friends; but, if I remember rightly, poor Nimmie Amee has a sharp tongue when angry, and she may be a trifle angry with me, at first, because I have been so long in coming to her."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"I can understand that," said Woot gravely.

Remember that you are transformed for good, since no magic on earth can break your enchantments. I am now going out for my morning walk, for each day after breakfast I walk sixteen times around my castle for exercise. Amuse yourselves while I am gone, and when I return I hope to find you all reconciled and happy."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'So the Giantess walked to the door by which our friends had entered the great hall and spoke one word: "Open!" Then the door swung open and after Mrs. Yoop had passed out it closed again with a snap as its powerful bolts shot into place.

I have been her prisoner, in this cage, for several weeks, and she hangs my cage in her bedroom every night, so that she can keep her eye on me," explained Polychrome the Canary. "Therefore I have discovered that it is the Magic Apron that opens the doors and windows, and nothing else can move them. when she goes to bed, Mrs. Yoop hangs her apron on the bedpost, and one morning she forgot to put it on when she commanded the door to open, and the door would not move. So then she put on the lace apron and the door obeyed her. That was how I learned the magic power of the apron."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"I see -- I see!" said the little Brown Bear, wagging his stuffed head.

"I\'ll try it this very night, if I can manage to steal into her bedroom."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"You mustn\'t think about it, though," warned the bird, "for she can read your thoughts whenever she cares to do so. And do not forget, before you escape, to take me with you. Once I am out of the power of the Giantess, I may discover a way to save us all."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"We won\'t forget our fairy friend," promised the boy; "but perhaps you can tell me how to get into the bedroom."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"No," declared Polychrome, "I cannot advise you as to that. You must watch for a chance, and slip in when Mrs. Yoop isn\'t looking."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"They talked it over for a while longer and then Mrs. Yoop returned.  When she entered, the door opened suddenly, at her command, and closed as soon as her huge form had passed through the doorway.

This pleased the Giantess and she would pause at times to pat the Monkey's head. The little Brown Bear curled up in a corner and lay still all day. The Owl and the Canary found they could converse together in the bird language, which neither the Giantess nor the Bear nor the Monkey could understand; so at times they twittered away to each other and passed the long, dreary day quite cheerfully."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After dinner Mrs. Yoop took a big fiddle from a big cupboard and played such loud and dreadful music that her prisoners were all thankful when at last she stopped and said she was going to bed."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After cautioning the Monkey and Bear and Owl to behave themselves during the night, she picked up the cage containing the Canary and, going to the door of her bedroom, commanded it to open. just then, however, she remembered she had left her fiddle lying upon a table, so she went back for it and put it away in the cupboard, and while her back was turned the Green Monkey slipped through the open door into her bedroom and hid underneath the bed. The Giantess, being sleepy, did not notice this, and entering her room she made the door close behind her and then hung the bird-cage on a peg by the window. Then she began to undress, first taking off the lace apron and laying it over the bedpost, where it was within easy reach of her hand."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As soon as Mrs. Yoop was in bed the lights all went out, and Woot the Monkey crouched under the bed and waited patiently until he heard the Giantess snoring.

By pushing against it with all his might, he found he could move the giant chair a few inches at a time. So he pushed and pushed until the chair was beneath the bird-cage, and then he sprang noiselessly upon the seat -- for his monkey form enabled him to jump higher than he could do as a boy -- and from there to the back of the chair, and so managed to reach the cage and take it off the peg. Then down he sprang to the floor and made his way to the door. "Open!" he commanded, and at once the door obeyed and swung open, But his voice wakened Mrs. Yoop, who gave a wild cry and sprang out of bed with one bound. The Green Monkey dashed through the doorway, carrying the cage with him, and before the Giantess could reach the door it slammed shut and imprisoned her in her own bed-chamber!'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The noise she made, pounding upon the door, and her yells of anger and dreadful threats of vengeance, filled all our friends with terror, and Woot the Monkey was so excited that in the dark he could not find the outer door of the hall. But the Tin Owl could see very nicely in the dark, so he guided his friends to the right place and when all were grouped before the door Woot commanded it to open. The Magic Apron proved as powerful as when it had been worn by the Giantess, so a moment later they had rushed through the passage and were standing in the fresh night air outside the castle, free to go wherever they willed."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Chapter Eight"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Menace of the Forest"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Quick!" cried Polychrome the Canary; "we must hurry, or Mrs. Yoop may find some way to recapture us, even now.

The Green Monkey could run over the ground very swiftly, and he carried with him the bird-cage containing Polychrome the Rain-bow's Daughter. Also the Tin Owl could skip and fly along at a good rate of speed, his feathers rattling against one another with a tinkling sound as he moved.

"She has six magic hairpins, which she wears in her hair, and a magic ring which she wears on her thumb and which is invisible to all eyes except those of a fairy, and magic bracelets on both her ankles. So I am positive that she will manage to find a way out of her prison."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"She might transform the door into an archway," suggested the little Brown Bear.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"That would be easy for her," said the Tin Owl; "but I\'m glad she was too angry to think of that before we got out of her Valley."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Well, we have escaped the big woman, to be sure," remarked the Green Monkey, "but we still wear the awful forms the cruel yookoohoo gave us. How are we going to get rid of these shapes, and become ourselves again?"'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"None could answer that question. They sat around the cage, brooding over the problem, until the Monkey fell asleep. Seeing this, the Canary tucked her head under her wing and also slept, and the Tin Owl and the Brown Bear did not disturb them until morning came and it was broad daylight."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"I\'m hungry," said Woot, when he wakened, for his knapsack of food had been left behind at the castle.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Then let us travel on until we can find something for you to eat," returned the Scarecrow Bear.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"There is no use in your lugging my cage any farther," declared the Canary.

At first she flew high in the air and made great circles overhead, but after a time she returned and perched beside them."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"At the east in the direction we were following," announced the Canary, "there is a fine forest, with a brook running through it. In the forest there may be fruits or nuts growing, or berry bushes at its edge, so let us go that way."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"They agreed to this and promptly set off, this time moving more deliberately. The Tin Owl, which had guided their way during the night, now found the sunshine very trying to his big eyes, so he shut them tight and perched upon the back of the little Brown Bear, which carried the Owl's weight with ease. The Canary sometimes perched upon the Green Monkey's shoulder and sometimes fluttered on ahead of the party, and in this manner they traveled in good spirits across that valley and into the next one to the east of it."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This they found to be an immense hollow, shaped like a saucer, and on its farther edge appeared the forest which Polychrome had seen from the sky."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Come to think of it," said the Tin Owl, waking up and blinking comically at his friends, "there\'s no object, now, in our traveling to the Munchkin Country.

But tell me, since you are a fairy, and have a fairy wisdom: do you think we shall be able to break these enchantments?"'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Queer things happen in the Land of Oz," replied the Canary, again perching on the Green Monkey\'s shoulder and turning one bright eye thoughtfully toward her questioner. "Mrs. Yoop has declared that none of her transformations can ever be changed, even by herself, but I believe that if we could get to Glinda the Good Sorceress, she might find a way to restore us to our natural shapes. Glinda, as you know, is the most powerful Sorceress in the world, and there are few things she cannot do if she tries."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"In that case," said the Little Brown Bear, "let us return southward and try to get to Glinda\'s castle. It lies in the Quadling Country, you know, so it is a good way from here."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"First, however, let us visit the forest and search for something to eat," pleaded Woot. So they continued on to the edge of the forest, which consisted of many tall and beautiful trees.

Instantly they all took alarm. The Tin Owl shrieked: "Hoot -- hoot!" and flew straight up to the branch of a tall tree, although he could scarcely see where he was going. The Canary swiftly darted to a place beside the Owl, and the Green Monkey sprang up, caught a limb, and soon scrambled to a high perch of safety.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Jaguar crouched low and with hungry eyes regarded the little Brown Bear, which slowly got upon its feet and asked reproachfully:"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"For goodness\' sake, Beast, what were you trying to do?"'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Trying to get my breakfast," answered the Jaguar with a snarl, "and I believe I\'ve succeeded. You ought to make a delicious meal -- unless you happen to be old and tough."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"I\'m worse than that, considered as a breakfast," said the Bear, "for I\'m only a skin stuffed with straw, and therefore not fit to eat."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Indeed!" cried the Jaguar, in a disappointed voice; "then you must be a magic Bear, or enchanted, and I must seek my breakfast from among your companions."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"With this he raised his lean head to look up at the Tin Owl and the Canary and the Monkey, and he lashed his tail upon the ground and growled as fiercely as any jaguar could."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"My friends are enchanted, also," said the little Brown Bear.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"All of them?" asked the Jaguar.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Yes.

But presently Woot got his feet tangled in the Lace Apron, which he was still wearing, and that tripped him in his flight and made him fall to the ground, where the Jaguar placed one huge paw upon him and said grimly:  I\'ve got you, now!" The fact that the Apron had tripped him made Woot remember its magic powers, and in his terror he cried out: "Open!" without stopping to consider how this command might save him. But, at the word, the earth opened at the exact spot where he lay under the Jaguar\'s paw, and his body sank downward, the earth closing over it again.

But Ozma punished the rash girl, and afterward Jinjur and I became fast friends. Now Jinjur lives peacefully on a farm, near here, and raises fields of cream-puffs, chocolate-caramels and macaroons. They say she's a pretty good farmer, and in addition to that she's an artist, and paints pictures so perfect that one can scarcely tell them from nature.

One day, however, I met an old lady who was a fairy, or a witch, or something of the sort, and she said if I would run an errand for her -- to carry some magic medicine to another old woman -- she would grant me just one Wish, whatever the Wish happened to be. Of course I consented and, taking the medicine, I hurried away. It was a long distance, mostly up hill, and my legs began to grow weary.

And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"From that moment no one in Oz ever died. Those who were old remained old; those who were young and strong did not change as years passed them by; the children remained children always, and played and romped to their hearts' content, while all the babies lived in their cradles and were tenderly cared for and never grew up. So people in Oz stopped counting how old they were in years, for years made no difference in their appearance and could not alter their station. They did not get sick, so there were no doctors among them. Accidents might happen to some, on rare occasions, it is true, and while no one could die naturally, as other people do, it was possible that one might be totally destroyed. Such incidents, however, were very unusual, and so seldom was there anything to worry over that the Oz people were as happy and contented as can be."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another strange thing about this fairy Land of Oz was that whoever managed to enter it from the outside world came under the magic spell of the place and did not change in appearance as long as they lived there.

Also, when Oz first became a fairyland, it harbored several witches and magicians and sorcerers and necromancers, who were scattered in various parts, but most of these had been deprived of their magic powers, and Ozma had issued a royal edict forbidding anyone in her dominions to work magic except Glinda the Good and the Wizard of Oz.

So today, when Dorothy tired of her embroidery, she drew the curtains from before the Magic Picture and wished to see what her friend Button Bright was doing. Button Bright, she saw, was playing ball with Ojo, the Munchkin boy, so Dorothy next wished to see what her Aunt Em was doing.
