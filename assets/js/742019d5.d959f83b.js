Many cities did he visit,\r\nand many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was\r\nacquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save\r\nhis own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he\r\ncould not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer\r\nfolly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god\r\nprevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all\r\nthese things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may\r\nknow them.\r\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got\r\nsafely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to\r\nhis wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got\r\nhim into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by,\r\nthere came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to\r\nIthaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his\r\ntroubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to\r\npity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing\r\nand would not let him get home.\r\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world\'s\r\nend, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.\r\nHe had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was\r\nenjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the\r\nhouse of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At\r\nthat moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by\r\nAgamemnon\'s son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:\r\n"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all\r\nnothing but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make\r\nlove to Agamemnon\'s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though\r\nhe knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him\r\nnot to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to\r\ntake his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury\r\ntold him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has\r\npaid for everything in full."\r\nThen Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it\r\nserved Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he\r\ndid; but Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that\r\nmy heart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely\r\nsea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an\r\nisland covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a\r\ngoddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after\r\nthe bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep\r\nheaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of\r\npoor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment\r\nto make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks\r\nof nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys.\r\nYou, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy\r\ndid he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should\r\nyou keep on being so angry with him?"\r\nAnd Jove said, "My child, what are you talking about? How can I\r\nforget Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor\r\nmore liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in\r\nheaven? Bear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with\r\nUlysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the\r\nCyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter\r\nto the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will not kill Ulysses\r\noutright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home.\r\nStill, let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to\r\nreturn; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are all of a mind\r\nhe can hardly stand out against us."\r\nAnd Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then,\r\nthe gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send\r\nMercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our\r\nminds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca,\r\nto put heart into Ulysses\' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call\r\nthe Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother\r\nPenelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I\r\nwill also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear\r\nanything about the return of his dear father- for this will make\r\npeople speak well of him."\r\nSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals,\r\nimperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea;\r\nshe grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and\r\nstrong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased\r\nher, and down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus,\r\nwhereon forthwith she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses\' house,\r\ndisguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held\r\na bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors\r\nseated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and\r\nplaying draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages were\r\nbustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the\r\nmixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and\r\nlaying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.\r\nTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting\r\nmoodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how\r\nhe would send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to\r\nhis own again and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as\r\nhe sat among them, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the\r\ngate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for\r\nadmittance. He took her right hand in his own, and bade her give him\r\nher spear. "Welcome," said he, "to our house, and when you have\r\npartaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for."\r\nHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were\r\nwithin he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a\r\nstrong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy\r\nfather, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he\r\nthrew a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,\r\nand he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors,\r\nthat she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and\r\ninsolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.\r\nA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer\r\nand poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and\r\nshe drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\r\nbread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the\r\nhouse, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set\r\ncups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and\r\npoured it out for them.\r\nThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and\r\nseats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids\r\nwent round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls\r\nwith wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things\r\nthat were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink\r\nthey wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments\r\nof a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they\r\ncompelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and\r\nbegan to sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close\r\nto hers that no man might hear.\r\n"I hope, sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what I\r\nam going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,\r\nand all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in\r\nsome wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were\r\nto see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs\r\nrather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he,\r\nalas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say\r\nthat he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him\r\nagain. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where\r\nyou come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship\r\nyou came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation\r\nthey declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by land. Tell\r\nme also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house,\r\nor have you been here in my father\'s time? In the old days we had many\r\nvisitors for my father went about much himself."\r\nAnd Minerva answered, "I will tell you truly and particularly all\r\nabout it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the\r\nTaphians. I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men\r\nof a foreign tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I\r\nshall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the\r\nopen country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the\r\nwooded mountain Neritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as old\r\nLaertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. They say,\r\nhowever, that he never comes to town now, and lives by himself in\r\nthe country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him and\r\nget his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering about\r\nhis vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was\r\nwhy I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he\r\nis not dead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on some\r\nsea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are\r\ndetaining him against his will I am no prophet, and know very little\r\nabout omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and\r\nassure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man of\r\nsuch resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find\r\nsome means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can\r\nUlysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are\r\nindeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were close\r\nfriends before he set sail for Troy where the flower of all the\r\nArgives went also. Since that time we have never either of us seen the\r\nother."\r\n"My mother," answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses,\r\nbut it is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were\r\nson to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you\r\nask me, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they\r\ntell me is my father."\r\nAnd Minerva said, "There is no fear of your race dying out yet,\r\nwhile Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell\r\nme true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these\r\npeople? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a\r\nwedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing any\r\nprovisions of his own? And the guests- how atrociously they are\r\nbehaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to\r\ndisgust any respectable person who comes near them."\r\n"Sir," said Telemachus, "as regards your question, so long as my\r\nfather was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods\r\nin their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him\r\naway more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have\r\nborne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his\r\nmen before Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days\r\nof his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a\r\nmound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his\r\nrenown; but now the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not\r\nwither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him,\r\nand I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply\r\nwith grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon\r\nme of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands,\r\nDulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all the\r\nprincipal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the\r\npretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither point\r\nblank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so\r\nthey are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so also\r\nwith myself."\r\n"Is that so?" exclaimed Minerva, "then you do indeed want Ulysses\r\nhome again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and if\r\nhe is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking\r\nand making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally\r\nsuitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was\r\nthen coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his\r\narrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods\r\nand would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he\r\nwas very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these\r\nsuitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.\r\n"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to\r\nreturn, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however,\r\nurge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take\r\nmy advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your\r\ncase before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors\r\ntake themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother\'s\r\nmind is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will\r\nfind her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so\r\ndear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you\r\nto take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go\r\nin quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may\r\ntell you something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\r\nheaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask\r\nNestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home\r\nlast of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on\r\nhis way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make\r\nfor yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his\r\ndeath, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due\r\npomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry\r\nagain. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind\r\nhow, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own\r\nhouse. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard\r\nhow people are singing Orestes\' praises for having killed his father\'s\r\nmurderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your\r\nmettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I\r\nmust go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I\r\nkeep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and\r\nremember what I have said to you."\r\n"Sir," answered Telemachus, "it has been very kind of you to talk to\r\nme in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you\r\ntell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a\r\nlittle longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I\r\nwill then give you a present, and you shall go on your way\r\nrejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake\r\nsuch as only dear friends give to one another."\r\nMinerva answered, "Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way\r\nat once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it\r\ntill I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give\r\nme a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in\r\nreturn."\r\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had\r\ngiven Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever\r\nabout his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that\r\nthe stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the\r\nsuitors were sitting.\r\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he\r\ntold the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had\r\nlaid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his\r\nsong from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not\r\nalone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the\r\nsuitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the\r\nroof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She\r\nheld a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\r\n"Phemius," she cried, "you know many another feat of gods and\r\nheroes, such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one\r\nof these, and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad\r\ntale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost\r\nhusband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great\r\nover all Hellas and middle Argos."\r\n"Mother," answered Telemachus, "let the bard sing what he has a mind\r\nto; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who\r\nmakes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his\r\nown good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the\r\nill-fated return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the\r\nlatest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses\r\nis not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many another\r\nwent down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy\r\nyourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the\r\nordering of your servants; for speech is man\'s matter, and mine\r\nabove all others- for it is I who am master here."\r\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\'s saying in\r\nher heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,\r\nshe mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her\r\neyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters,\r\nand prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.\r\nThen Telemachus spoke, "Shameless," he cried, "and insolent suitors,\r\nlet us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it\r\nis a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has;\r\nbut in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal\r\nnotice to depart, and feast at one another\'s houses, turn and turn\r\nabout, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in\r\nspunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with\r\nyou in full, and when you fall in my father\'s house there shall be\r\nno man to avenge you."\r\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the\r\nboldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, "The\r\ngods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may\r\nJove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\r\nyou."\r\nTelemachus answered, "Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god\r\nwilling, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you\r\ncan think of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings\r\nboth riches and honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many\r\ngreat men in Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the\r\nlead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and\r\nwill rule those whom Ulysses has won for me."\r\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, "It rests with heaven\r\nto decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\r\nown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man\r\nin Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good\r\nfellow, I want to know about this stranger. What country does he\r\ncome from? Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he\r\nbrought you news about the return of your father, or was he on\r\nbusiness of his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so\r\nsuddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know\r\nhim."\r\n"My father is dead and gone," answered Telemachus, "and even if some\r\nrumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed\r\nsometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his\r\nprophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of\r\nAnchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father\'s." But\r\nin his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\r\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the\r\nevening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to\r\nbed each in his own abode. Telemachus\'s room was high up in a tower\r\nthat looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and\r\nfull of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the\r\nson of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.\r\nLaertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he\r\ngave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to\r\nher in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did\r\nnot take her to his bed for he feared his wife\'s resentment. She it\r\nwas who now lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better\r\nthan any of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him\r\nwhen he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down\r\nupon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good old\r\nwoman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by\r\nhis bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver\r\ncatch, and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. But Telemachus as\r\nhe lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through\r\nof his intended voyage of the counsel that Minerva had given him.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK II.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NOW when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\r\nTelemachus rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his\r\ncomely feet, girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room\r\nlooking like an immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call\r\nthe people in assembly, so they called them and the people gathered\r\nthereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the place of\r\nassembly spear in hand- not alone, for his two hounds went with him.\r\nMinerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all\r\nmarvelled at him as he went by, and when he took his place\' in his\r\nfather\'s seat even the oldest councillors made way for him.\r\nAegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience,\r\nthe first to speak His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,\r\nland of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when\r\nthey were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner\r\nfor him, He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their\r\nfather\'s land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors;\r\nnevertheless their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and\r\nwas still weeping for him when he began his speech.\r\n"Men of Ithaca," he said, "hear my words. From the day Ulysses\r\nleft us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who\r\nthen can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to\r\nconvene us? Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish\r\nto warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?\r\nI am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him\r\nhis heart\'s desire."\r\nTelemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he\r\nwas bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the\r\nassembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,\r\nturning to Aegyptius, "Sir," said he, "it is I, as you will shortly\r\nlearn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I\r\nhave not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn\r\nyou, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would\r\nspeak. My grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two great\r\nmisfortunes which have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the\r\nloss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present,\r\nand was like a father to every one of you; the second is much more\r\nserious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of\r\nall the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them\r\nagainst her will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius,\r\nasking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage\r\ngifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my\r\nfather\'s house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their\r\nbanquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of\r\nwine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no\r\nUlysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own\r\nagainst them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was,\r\nstill I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I\r\ncannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced\r\nand ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to\r\npublic opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should\r\nbe displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is\r\nthe beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends,\r\nand leave me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulysses\r\ndid some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by\r\naiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out\r\nof house and home at all, I had rather you did the eating\r\nyourselves, for I could then take action against you to some\r\npurpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got\r\npaid in full, whereas now I have no remedy."\r\nWith this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into\r\ntears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no\r\none ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who\r\nspoke thus:\r\n"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to\r\nthrow the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother\'s fault not ours,\r\nfor she is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on\r\nfour, she has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each\r\none of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what\r\nshe says. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set\r\nup a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous\r\npiece of fine needlework. \'Sweet hearts,\' said she, \'Ulysses is indeed\r\ndead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for I\r\nwould not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have\r\ncompleted a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against\r\nthe time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women\r\nof the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.\'\r\n"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her\r\nworking on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick\r\nthe stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for\r\nthree years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she\r\nwas now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was\r\ndoing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so\r\nshe had to finish it whether she would or no. The suitors,\r\ntherefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may\r\nunderstand-\'Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her\r\nown and of her father\'s choice\'; for I do not know what will happen if\r\nshe goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on\r\nthe score of the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because\r\nshe is so clever. We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all\r\nabout Tyro, Alcmena, Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they\r\nwere nothing to your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of her\r\nto treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind with\r\nwhich heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up\r\nyour estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she gets\r\nall the honour and glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she.\r\nUnderstand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neither\r\nhere nor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married some\r\none or other of us."\r\nTelemachus answered, "Antinous, how can I drive the mother who\r\nbore me from my father\'s house? My father is abroad and we do not know\r\nwhether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay\r\nIcarius the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his\r\ndaughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but\r\nheaven will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house\r\nwill calf on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be a\r\ncreditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you\r\nchoose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at\r\none another\'s houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on\r\nthe other hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one man,\r\nheaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you\r\nfall in my father\'s house there shall be no man to avenge you."\r\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and\r\nthey flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own\r\nlordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly\r\nthey wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and\r\nglaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting\r\nfiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right\r\nover the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each\r\nother what an this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best\r\nprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in\r\nall honesty, saying:\r\n"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the\r\nsuitors, for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going\r\nto be away much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death\r\nand destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who live\r\nin Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this\r\nwickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord;\r\nit will be better for them, for I am not prophesying without due\r\nknowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the\r\nArgives set out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going\r\nthrough much hardship and losing all his men he should come home again\r\nin the twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this\r\nis coming true."\r\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, "Go home, old man, and prophesy\r\nto your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these\r\nomens myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about\r\nin the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything.\r\nUlysses has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead\r\nalong with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to\r\nthe anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you\r\nthink he will give you something for your family, but I tell you-\r\nand it shall surely be- when an old man like you, who should know\r\nbetter, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the\r\nfirst place his young friend will only fare so much the worse- he will\r\ntake nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- and in the\r\nnext, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will\r\nat all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. As for\r\nTelemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother\r\nback to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with\r\nall the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till we shall go\r\non harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither\r\nfor him, with all his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of\r\nyours. You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate\r\nyou the more. We shall go back and continue to eat up Telemachus\'s\r\nestate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves off\r\ntormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of\r\nexpectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such\r\nrare perfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we\r\nshould marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us."\r\nThen Telemachus said, "Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall\r\nsay no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people\r\nof Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of\r\ntwenty men to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta\r\nand to Pylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing.\r\nSome one may tell me something, or (and people often hear things in\r\nthis way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him\r\nas alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste you\r\nsuitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other\r\nhand I hear of his death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral\r\nrites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make my\r\nmother marry again."\r\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend of\r\nUlysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority\r\nover the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty\r\naddressed them thus:\r\n"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\r\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I\r\nhope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for\r\nthere is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as\r\nthough he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors,\r\nfor if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their\r\nhearts, and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can\r\ntake the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am\r\nshocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying to\r\nstop such scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, for\r\nyou are many and they are few."\r\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, "Mentor, what\r\nfolly is all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is\r\na hard thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even\r\nthough Ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in\r\nhis house, and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so\r\nvery badly, would have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood\r\nwould be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds. There\r\nis no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you\r\npeople go about your business, and let his father\'s old friends,\r\nMentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at\r\nall- which I do not think he will, for he is more likely to stay where\r\nhe is till some one comes and tells him something."\r\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\r\nabode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.\r\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands\r\nin the grey waves, and prayed to Minerva.\r\n"Hear me," he cried, "you god who visited me yesterday, and bade\r\nme sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been\r\nmissing. I would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the\r\nwicked suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so."\r\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness\r\nand with the voice of Mentor. "Telemachus," said she, "if you are made\r\nof the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward\r\nhenceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work\r\nhalf done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be\r\nfruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in\r\nyour veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom\r\nas good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better;\r\nstill, as you are not going to be either fool or coward\r\nhenceforward, and are not entirely without some share of your father\'s\r\nwise discernment, I look with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you\r\nnever make common cause with any of those foolish suitors, for they\r\nhave neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to death and to the\r\ndoom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shall\r\nperish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long\r\ndelayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find\r\nyou a ship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return\r\nhome, and go about among the suitors; begin getting provisions ready\r\nfor your voyage; see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the\r\nbarley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I\r\ngo round the town and beat up volunteers at once. There are many ships\r\nin Ithaca both old and new; I will run my eye over them for you and\r\nwill choose the best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea\r\nwithout delay."\r\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time\r\nin doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found the\r\nsuitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous\r\ncame up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,\r\nsaying, "Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood\r\nneither in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do.\r\nThe Achaeans will find you in everything- a ship and a picked crew\r\nto boot- so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of\r\nyour noble father."\r\n"Antinous," answered Telemachus, "I cannot eat in peace, nor take\r\npleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough\r\nthat you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet\r\na boy? Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger,\r\nand whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do\r\nyou all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain\r\nthough, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own,\r\nand must be passenger not captain."\r\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile\r\nthe others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering\r\nat him tauntingly as they did so.\r\n"Telemachus," said one youngster, "means to be the death of us; I\r\nsuppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or\r\nagain from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to\r\nEphyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?"\r\nAnother said, "Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will\r\nbe like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we\r\nshould have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property\r\namongst us: as for the house we can let his mother and the man who\r\nmarries her have that."\r\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty\r\nand spacious store-room where his father\'s treasure of gold and bronze\r\nlay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes\r\nwere kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant\r\nolive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit\r\nfor a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses\r\nshould come home again after all. The room was closed with well-made\r\ndoors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper\r\nEuryclea, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of\r\neverything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room\r\nand said:\r\n"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you\r\nare keeping for my father\'s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should\r\nescape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have\r\ntwelve jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some\r\nwell-sewn leathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures in\r\nall. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing about\r\nit. I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother\r\nhas gone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos\r\nto see if I can hear anything about the return of my dear father.\r\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to\r\nhim, saying, "My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as\r\nthat into your head? Where in the world do you want to go to- you, who\r\nare the one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in\r\nsome foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is\r\nturned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of\r\nthe way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay\r\nwhere you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and\r\nworrying your life out on the barren ocean."\r\n"Fear not, nurse," answered Telemachus, "my scheme is not without\r\nheaven\'s sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all\r\nthis to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days,\r\nunless she hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want\r\nher to spoil her beauty by crying."\r\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she\r\nhad completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars,\r\nand getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went\r\nback to the suitors.\r\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape,\r\nand went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to\r\nmeet at the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of\r\nPhronius, and asked him to let her have a ship- which he was very\r\nready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was over all the\r\nland, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board her\r\nthat ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the\r\nharbour. Presently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke\r\nencouragingly to each of them.\r\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the\r\nsuitors into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them,\r\nand made them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of\r\nsitting over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with\r\ntheir eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and\r\nvoice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside.\r\n"Telemachus," said she, "the men are on board and at their oars,\r\nwaiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off."\r\nOn this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps.\r\nWhen they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water\r\nside, and Telemachus said, "Now my men, help me to get the stores on\r\nboard; they are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does\r\nnot know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one."\r\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after.\r\nWhen they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on\r\nboard, Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of\r\nthe vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the\r\nhawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair\r\nwind from the West, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon\r\nTelemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and\r\nthey did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross\r\nplank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they\r\nhoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As\r\nthe sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep\r\nblue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.\r\nThen they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls\r\nto the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are\r\nfrom everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of\r\nJove.\r\nThus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the\r\nnight from dark till dawn.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK III.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'BUT as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of\r\nheaven to shed Blight on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the\r\ncity of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore\r\nto offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.\r\nThere were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were\r\nnine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and\r\nburning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,\r\nTelemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their\r\nship to anchor, and went ashore.\r\nMinerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,\r\n"Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have\r\ntaken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried\r\nand how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may\r\nsee what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and\r\nhe will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person."\r\n"But how, Mentor," replied Telemachus, "dare I go up to Nestor,\r\nand how am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding\r\nlong conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning\r\none who is so much older than myself."\r\n"Some things, Telemachus," answered Minerva, "will be suggested to\r\nyou by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am\r\nassured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth\r\nuntil now."\r\nShe then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps\r\ntill they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were\r\nassembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his\r\ncompany round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces\r\nof meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they saw\r\nthe strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and\r\nbade them take their places. Nestor\'s son Pisistratus at once\r\noffered his hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft\r\nsheepskins that were lying on the sands near his father and his\r\nbrother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them their portions of the inward\r\nmeats and poured wine for them into a golden cup, handing it to\r\nMinerva first, and saluting her at the same time.\r\n"Offer a prayer, sir," said he, "to King Neptune, for it is his\r\nfeast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your\r\ndrink-offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also.\r\nI doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live\r\nwithout God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is\r\nmuch of an age with myself, so I he handed I will give you the\r\nprecedence."\r\nAs he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and\r\nproper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began\r\npraying heartily to Neptune. "O thou," she cried, "that encirclest the\r\nearth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon\r\nthee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor and\r\non his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some\r\nhandsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. Lastly,\r\ngrant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter\r\nthat has brought us in our to Pylos."\r\nWhen she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to\r\nTelemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats\r\nwere roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave\r\nevery man his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon\r\nas they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene,\r\nbegan to speak.\r\n"Now," said he, "that our guests have done their dinner, it will\r\nbe best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you,\r\nand from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail\r\nthe seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man\'s\r\nhand against you?"\r\nTelemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask\r\nabout his father and get himself a good name.\r\n"Nestor," said he, "son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you\r\nask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under\r\nNeritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not\r\npublic import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said\r\nto have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what\r\nfate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as\r\nregards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he\r\nis dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished,\r\nnor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at\r\nsea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your\r\nknees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end,\r\nwhether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other\r\ntraveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things\r\nout of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what\r\nyou saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either\r\nby word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans,\r\nbear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all."\r\n"My friend," answered Nestor, "you recall a time of much sorrow to\r\nmy mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while\r\nprivateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city\r\nof king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there- Ajax, Achilles,\r\nPatroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a\r\nman singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered\r\nmuch more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole\r\nstory? Though you were to stay here and question me for five years, or\r\neven six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you\r\nwould turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long\r\nyears did we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was\r\nagainst us; during all this time there was no one who could compare\r\nwith your father in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- I can\r\nhardly believe my eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one would\r\nsay that people of such different ages could speak so much alike. He\r\nand I never had any kind of difference from first to last neither in\r\ncamp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose we advised\r\nthe Argives how all might be ordered for the best.\r\n"When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting\r\nsail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex\r\nthe Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been either\r\nwise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the\r\ndispleasure of Jove\'s daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel\r\nbetween the two sons of Atreus.\r\n"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should\r\nbe, for it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they\r\nexplained why they had called- the people together, it seemed that\r\nMenelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased\r\nAgamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered\r\nhecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he\r\nmight have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods\r\nhave made up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the two\r\nstood bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet\r\nwith a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what they\r\nshould do.\r\n"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching\r\nmischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into\r\nthe water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,\r\nabout half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We- the other\r\nhalf- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had\r\nsmoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the\r\ngods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did not\r\nyet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the\r\ncourse of which some among us turned their ships back again, and\r\nsailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I,\r\nand all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that\r\nmischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with me, and\r\nhis crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found\r\nus making up our minds about our course- for we did not know whether\r\nto go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our\r\nleft, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of Mimas. So\r\nwe asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that we\r\nshould be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across the open\r\nsea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up\r\nwhich gave us a quick passage during the night to Geraestus, where\r\nwe offered many sacrifices to Neptune for having helped us so far on\r\nour way. Four days later Diomed and his men stationed their ships in\r\nArgos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from the\r\nday when heaven first made it fair for me.\r\n"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing\r\nanything about the others. I know neither who got home safely nor\r\nwho were lost but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve\r\nthe reports that have reached me since I have been here in my own\r\nhouse. They say the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles\' son\r\nNeoptolemus; so also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes.\r\nIdomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his followers who\r\nescaped death in the field got safe home with him to Crete. No\r\nmatter how far out of the world you live, you will have heard of\r\nAgamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of Aegisthus- and\r\na fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what a good thing\r\nit is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes did, who\r\nkilled false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You too,\r\nthen- for you are a tall, smart-looking fellow- show your mettle and\r\nmake yourself a name in story."\r\n"Nestor son of Neleus," answered Telemachus, "honour to the\r\nAchaean name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live\r\nthrough all time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that\r\nheaven might grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the\r\nwicked suitors, who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but\r\nthe gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father,\r\nso we must bear it as best we may."\r\n"My friend," said Nestor, "now that you remind me, I remember to\r\nhave heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed\r\ntowards you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this\r\ntamely, or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who\r\nknows but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these\r\nscoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans\r\nbehind him? If Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she\r\ndid to Ulysses when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet\r\nsaw the gods so openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your\r\nfather), if she would take as good care of you as she did of him,\r\nthese wooers would soon some of them him, forget their wooing."\r\nTelemachus answered, "I can expect nothing of the kind; it would\r\nbe far too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even\r\nthough the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall\r\nme."\r\nOn this Minerva said, "Telemachus, what are you talking about?\r\nHeaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were\r\nme, I should not care how much I suffered before getting home,\r\nprovided I could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this,\r\nthan get home quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon\r\nwas by the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is\r\ncertain, and when a man\'s hour is come, not even the gods can save\r\nhim, no matter how fond they are of him."\r\n"Mentor," answered Telemachus, "do not let us talk about it any\r\nmore. There is no chance of my father\'s ever coming back; the gods\r\nhave long since counselled his destruction. There is something else,\r\nhowever, about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much\r\nmore than any one else does. They say he has reigned for three\r\ngenerations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me,\r\ntherefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die\r\nin that way? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus\r\nto kill so far better a man than himself? Was Menelaus away from\r\nAchaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took\r\nheart and killed Agamemnon?"\r\n"I will tell you truly," answered Nestor, "and indeed you have\r\nyourself divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back\r\nfrom Troy had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would\r\nhave been no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead,\r\nbut he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures,\r\nand not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of\r\ngreat wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and\r\nAegisthus who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos,\r\ncajoled Agamemnon\'s wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.\r\n"At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for\r\nshe was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bard\r\nwith her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for\r\nTroy, that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had\r\ncounselled her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert\r\nisland and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- after\r\nwhich she went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he\r\noffered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many\r\ntemples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond\r\nhis expectations.\r\n"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good\r\nterms with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of\r\nAthens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the\r\nsteersman of Menelaus\' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a\r\nvessel in rough weather) so that he died then and there with the\r\nhelm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press\r\nforward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due\r\nfuneral rites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and\r\nhad sailed on as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against\r\nhim and made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here\r\nhe divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the\r\nCydonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus. There is\r\na high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place\r\ncalled Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaestus\r\nthe sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter\r\nPhaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make\r\na great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the\r\nrocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. As\r\nfor the other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to\r\nEgypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of\r\nan alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil\r\ndeed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in\r\nMycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year\r\nOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the\r\nmurderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his\r\nmother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and\r\non that very day Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as his\r\nships could carry.\r\n"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far\r\nfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in\r\nyour house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you\r\nwill have been on a fool\'s errand. Still, I should advise you by all\r\nmeans to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among\r\nsuch distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from,\r\nwhen the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning;\r\neven birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and\r\nterrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by\r\nsea, and take your own men with you; or if you would rather travel\r\nby land you can have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my\r\nsons who can escort you to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him\r\nto speak the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is an\r\nexcellent person."\r\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,\r\n"Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the\r\ntongues of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make\r\ndrink-offerings to Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go to\r\nbed, for it is bed time. People should go away early and not keep late\r\nhours at a religious festival."\r\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men\r\nservants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled\r\nthe mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\r\nevery man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the\r\nvictims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings.\r\nWhen they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he\r\nwas minded, Minerva and Telemachus were forgoing on board their\r\nship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.\r\n"Heaven and the immortal gods," he exclaimed, "forbid that you\r\nshould leave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so\r\npoor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be\r\nunable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let\r\nme tell you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit\r\nthe son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship-\r\nnot while I live- nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep\r\nopen house as have done."\r\nThen Minerva answered, "Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be\r\nmuch better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore,\r\nshall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to\r\ngive orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only\r\nolder person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus\' own\r\nage, who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to\r\nthe ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the\r\nCauconians where I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As\r\nfor Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a\r\nchariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased also to\r\nprovide him with your best and fleetest horses."\r\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and\r\nall marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took\r\nTelemachus by the hand. "My friend," said he, "I see that you are\r\ngoing to be a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus\r\nwhile you are still so young. This can have been none other of those\r\nwho dwell in heaven than Jove\'s redoubtable daughter, the\r\nTrito-born, who showed such favour towards your brave father among the\r\nArgives." "Holy queen," he continued, "vouchsafe to send down thy\r\ngrace upon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I will\r\noffer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old,\r\nunbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her\r\nhorns, and will offer her up to you in sacrifice."\r\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the\r\nway to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. When\r\nthey had got there and had taken their places on the benches and\r\nseats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old\r\nwhen the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he\r\nmixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to Minerva,\r\ndaughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their\r\ndrink-offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the\r\nothers went home to bed each in his own abode; but Nestor put\r\nTelemachus to sleep in the room that was over the gateway along with\r\nPisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left him. As for\r\nhimself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the queen his\r\nwife by his side.\r\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\r\nNestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and\r\npolished marble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat\r\nNeleus, peer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone\r\nto the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand,\r\nas guardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their rooms\r\ngathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and\r\nThrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined\r\nthem they made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.\r\n"My sons," said he, "make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish\r\nfirst and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who\r\nmanifested herself visibly to me during yesterday\'s festivities. Go,\r\nthen, one or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me\r\nout a heifer, and come on here with it at once. Another must go to\r\nTelemachus\'s ship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in\r\ncharge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the\r\ngoldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you\r\nwhere you are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent\r\ndinner, and to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering.\r\nTell them also- to bring me some clear spring water."\r\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was\r\nbrought in from the plain, and Telemachus\'s crew came from the ship;\r\nthe goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he\r\nworked his gold, and Minerva herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor\r\ngave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that\r\nthe goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and\r\nEchephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the\r\nhouse in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand\r\nhe held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a\r\nsharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.\r\nThen Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley\r\nmeal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock\r\nfrom the heifer\'s head upon the fire.\r\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal\r\nThrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a\r\nstroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon\r\nthe daughters and daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife\r\nEurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with\r\ndelight. Then they lifted the heifer\'s head from off the ground, and\r\nPisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite\r\ndead, they cut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course,\r\nwrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw\r\nmeat on the top of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire\r\nand poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with\r\nfive-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were burned and\r\nthey had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up\r\nsmall, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.\r\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor\'s youngest daughter, washed\r\nTelemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she\r\nbrought him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he\r\ncame from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the\r\nouter meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to\r\ndinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept\r\npouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had\r\nhad enough to eat and drink Nestor said, "Sons, put Telemachus\'s\r\nhorses to the chariot that he may start at once."\r\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the\r\nfleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a\r\nprovision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of\r\nprinces. Then Telemachus got into the chariot, while Pisistratus\r\ngathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the\r\nhorses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country,\r\nleaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they\r\ntravel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and\r\ndarkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles\r\nlived, who was son to Ortilochus and grandson to Alpheus. Here they\r\npassed the night and Diocles entertained them hospitably. When the\r\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared, they again yoked their\r\nhorses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing\r\ngatehouse. Pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward\r\nnothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands Of the open\r\ncountry, and in the course of time completed their journey, so well\r\ndid their steeds take them.\r\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK IV.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THEY reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon them where they\r\ndrove straight to the of abode Menelaus [and found him in his own\r\nhouse, feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his\r\nson, and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that\r\nvaliant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to\r\nhim while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the\r\nmarriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses to\r\nthe city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles\' son was reigning. For\r\nhis only son he had found a bride from Sparta, daughter of Alector.\r\nThis son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven\r\nvouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who\r\nwas fair as golden Venus herself.\r\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making\r\nmerry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his\r\nlyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them\r\nwhen the man struck up with his tune.]\r\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,\r\nwhereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw\r\nthem ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went\r\nclose up to him and said, "Menelaus, there are some strangers come\r\nhere, two men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we\r\ntake their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as\r\nthey best can?"\r\nMenelaus was very angry and said, "Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you\r\nnever used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their\r\nhorses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have\r\nsupper; you and I have stayed often enough at other people\'s houses\r\nbefore we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in\r\npeace henceforward."\r\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. They\r\ntook their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to the\r\nmangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they\r\nleaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led\r\nthe way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished\r\nwhen they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon;\r\nthen, when they had admired everything to their heart\'s content,\r\nthey went into the bath room and washed themselves.\r\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they\r\nbrought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats\r\nby the side of Menelaus. A maidservant brought them water in a\r\nbeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to\r\nwash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper\r\nservant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of\r\nwhat there was in the house, while the carver fetched them plates of\r\nall manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.\r\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, "Fall to, and welcome; when you\r\nhave done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such\r\nmen as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of\r\nsceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you\r\nare."\r\nOn this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set\r\nnear him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the\r\ngood things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to\r\neat and drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head\r\nso close that no one might hear, "Look, Pisistratus, man after my\r\nown heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, and\r\nsilver. Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of\r\nOlympian Jove. I am lost in admiration."\r\nMenelaus overheard him and said, "No one, my sons, can hold his\r\nown with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but\r\namong mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth as\r\nI have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much\r\nand have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before\r\nI could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the\r\nEgyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the\r\nErembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are\r\nborn, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that\r\ncountry, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good\r\nmilk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was\r\ntravelling and getting great riches among these people, my brother was\r\nsecretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked\r\nwife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth.\r\nWhoever your parents may be they must have told you about all this,\r\nand of my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and\r\nmagnificently furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now\r\nhave so that I had stayed at home, and all those were living who\r\nperished on the plain of Troy, far from Argos. I of grieve, as I sit\r\nhere in my house, for one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for\r\nsorrow, but presently I leave off again, for crying is cold comfort\r\nand one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for\r\none man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him without\r\nloathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one\r\nof all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He\r\ntook nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for\r\nhe has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or\r\ndead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son\r\nTelemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged\r\nin grief on his account."\r\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he\r\nbethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard\r\nhim thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with\r\nboth hands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him\r\nchoose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and find\r\nwhat it was all about.\r\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted\r\nand perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought\r\nher a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the\r\nsilver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her.\r\nPolybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the\r\nwhole world; he gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two\r\ntripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave\r\nHelen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a\r\nsilver work-box that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the top\r\nof it. Phylo now placed this by her side, full of fine spun yarn,\r\nand a distaff charged with violet coloured wool was laid upon the\r\ntop of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon the\r\nfootstool, and began to question her husband.\r\n"Do we know, Menelaus," said she, "the names of these strangers\r\nwho have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?-but I\r\ncannot help saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or\r\nwoman so like somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know\r\nwhat to think) as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left\r\nas a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in\r\nyour hearts, on account of my most shameless self."\r\n"My dear wife," replied Menelaus, "I see the likeness just as you\r\ndo. His hands and feet are just like Ulysses\'; so is his hair, with\r\nthe shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I\r\nwas talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my\r\naccount, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle."\r\nThen Pisistratus said, "Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in\r\nthinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and\r\nis ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one\r\nwhose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My\r\nfather, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know\r\nwhether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always\r\ntrouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without\r\nsupporters; and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father\r\nis absent, and there is no one among his own people to stand by him."\r\n"Bless my heart," replied Menelaus, "then I am receiving a visit\r\nfrom the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for\r\nmy sake. I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked\r\ndistinction when heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the\r\nseas. I should have founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a\r\nhouse. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son,\r\nand all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of the\r\nneighbouring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seen\r\none another continually, and nothing but death could have\r\ninterrupted so close and happy an intercourse. I suppose, however,\r\nthat heaven grudged us such great good fortune, for it has prevented\r\nthe poor fellow from ever getting home at all."\r\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,\r\nTelemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his\r\neyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom\r\nthe son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\r\n"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told\r\nme you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it\r\nbe possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I\r\nam getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the\r\nforenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone.\r\nThis is all we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads\r\nfor them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died\r\nat Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure to\r\nhave known him- his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him\r\nmyself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight\r\nvaliant."\r\n"Your discretion, my friend," answered Menelaus, "is beyond your\r\nyears. It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a\r\nman is son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and\r\noffspring- and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his\r\ndays, giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him\r\nwho are both we disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore\r\nto all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be\r\npoured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another\r\nfully in the morning."\r\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their\r\nhands and they laid their hands on the good things that were before\r\nthem.\r\nThen Jove\'s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She\r\ndrugged the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and\r\nill humour. Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear\r\nall the rest of the day, not even though his father and mother both of\r\nthem drop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces\r\nbefore his very eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue,\r\nhad been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt,\r\nwhere there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into the\r\nmixing-bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole\r\ncountry is a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon.\r\nWhen Helen had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to\r\nserve the wine round, she said:\r\n"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of\r\nhonourable men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of\r\ngood and evil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will,\r\nand listen while I tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name\r\nevery single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did\r\nwhen he was before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts of\r\ndifficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed\r\nhimself all in rags, and entered the enemy\'s city looking like a\r\nmenial or a beggar. and quite different from what he did when he was\r\namong his own people. In this disguise he entered the city of Troy,\r\nand no one said anything to him. I alone recognized him and began to\r\nquestion him, but he was too cunning for me. When, however, I had\r\nwashed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I had\r\nsworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got\r\nsafely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all that\r\nthe Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans and got much\r\ninformation before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things\r\nthe Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, for\r\nmy heart was beginning to oam after my home, and I was unhappy about\r\nwrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from my\r\ncountry, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no\r\nmeans deficient either in person or understanding."\r\nThen Menelaus said, "All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is\r\ntrue. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes,\r\nbut I have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too,\r\nand what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the\r\nbravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and\r\ndestruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some\r\ngod who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and\r\nyou had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our\r\nhiding place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name,\r\nand mimicked all our wives -Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats\r\ninside heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our\r\nminds whether to spring out then and there, or to answer you from\r\ninside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all\r\nexcept Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped\r\nhis two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was\r\nthis that saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took\r\nyou away again."\r\n"How sad," exclaimed Telemachus, "that all this was of no avail to\r\nsave him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to\r\nsend us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of\r\nsleep."\r\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that\r\nwas in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and\r\nspread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests\r\nto wear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds,\r\nto which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus,\r\nthen, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt,\r\nwhile the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by\r\nhis side.\r\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus\r\nrose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely\r\nfeet, girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room\r\nlooking like an immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he\r\nsaid:\r\n"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to\r\nLacedaemon? Are you on public or private business? Tell me all about\r\nit."\r\n"I have come, sir replied Telemachus, "to see if you can tell me\r\nanything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my\r\nfair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who\r\nkeep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of\r\npaying their addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your\r\nknees if haply you may tell me about my father\'s melancholy end,\r\nwhether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other\r\ntraveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things\r\nout of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly\r\nwhat you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service\r\neither by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the\r\nTrojans, bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all."\r\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. "So," he\r\nexclaimed, "these cowards would usurp a brave man\'s bed? A hind\r\nmight as well lay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then\r\ngo off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when\r\nhe comes back to his lair will make short work with the pair of\r\nthem- and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva,\r\nand Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled\r\nwith Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the\r\nAchaeans cheered him- if he is still such and were to come near\r\nthese suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.\r\nAs regards your questions, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive\r\nyou, but will tell you without concealment all that the old man of the\r\nsea told me.\r\n"I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt,\r\nfor my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods\r\nare very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far\r\nas a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there\r\nis an island called Pharos- it has a good harbour from which vessels\r\ncan get out into open sea when they have taken in water- and the\r\ngods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair\r\nwind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions\r\nand my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me\r\nand saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old\r\nman of the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.\r\n"She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for\r\nthe men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the\r\nhope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of\r\nhunger. \'Stranger,\' said she, \'it seems to me that you like starving\r\nin this way- at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you\r\nstick here day after day, without even trying to get away though\r\nyour men are dying by inches.\'\r\n"\'Let me tell you,\' said I, \'whichever of the goddesses you may\r\nhappen to be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must\r\nhave offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for\r\nthe gods know everything. which of the immortals it is that is\r\nhindering me in this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so\r\nas to reach my home.\'\r\n"\'Stranger,\' replied she, \'I will make it all quite clear to you.\r\nThere is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and\r\nwhose name is Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my\r\nfather; he is Neptune\'s head man and knows every inch of ground all\r\nover the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight,\r\nhe will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take,\r\nand how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also\r\ntell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house\r\nboth good and bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous\r\njourney.\'\r\n"\'Can you show me,\' said I, \'some stratagem by means of which I\r\nmay catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out?\r\nFor a god is not easily caught- not by a mortal man.\'\r\n"\'Stranger,\' said she, \'I will make it all quite clear to you. About\r\nthe time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of\r\nthe sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind\r\nthat furs the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies\r\ndown, and goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals-\r\nHalosydne\'s chickens as they call them- come up also from the grey\r\nsea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and\r\nfish-like smell do they bring with them. Early to-morrow morning I\r\nwill take you to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out,\r\ntherefore, the three best men you have in your fleet, and I will\r\ntell you all the tricks that the old man will play you.\r\n"\'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then,\r\nwhen he has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go\r\nto sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see\r\nthat he is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold\r\nhim fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He will\r\nturn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and\r\nwill become also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and\r\ngrip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and\r\ncomes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may\r\nslacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the\r\ngods it is that is angry with you, and what you must do to reach\r\nyour home over the seas.\'\r\n"Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back\r\nto the place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart\r\nwas clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got\r\nsupper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.\r\n"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I took the\r\nthree men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went\r\nalong by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the\r\ngoddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea,\r\nall of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her\r\nfather. Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to\r\nwait till we should come up. When we were close to her, she made us\r\nlie down in the pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over\r\neach of us. Our ambuscade would have been intolerable, for the\r\nstench of the fishy seals was most distressing- who would go to bed\r\nwith a sea monster if he could help it?-but here, too, the goddess\r\nhelped us, and thought of something that gave us great relief, for she\r\nput some ambrosia under each man\'s nostrils, which was so fragrant\r\nthat it killed the smell of the seals.\r\n"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the\r\nseals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the\r\nold man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he\r\nwent over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,\r\nand he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as\r\nsoon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and\r\nseized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed\r\nhimself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he\r\nbecame a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was\r\nrunning water, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck\r\nto him and never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature\r\nbecame distressed, and said, Which of the gods was it, Son of\r\nAtreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing\r\nme against my will? What do you want?\'\r\n"\'You know that yourself, old man,\' I answered, \'you will gain\r\nnothing by trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so\r\nlong in this island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I\r\nam losing all heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything,\r\nwhich of the immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also\r\nhow I may sail the sea so as to reach my home?\'\r\n"Then,\' he said, \'if you would finish your voyage and get home\r\nquickly, you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods\r\nbefore embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to\r\nyour friends, and to your own house, till you have returned to the\r\nheaven fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal\r\ngods that reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you\r\nfinish your voyage.\'\r\n"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long\r\nand terrible voyage to Egypt; nevertheless, I answered, \'I will do\r\nall, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me\r\ntrue, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when\r\nwe set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them\r\ncame to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends\r\nwhen the days of his fighting were done.\'\r\n"\'Son of Atreus,\' he answered, \'why ask me? You had better not\r\nknow what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have\r\nheard my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone,\r\nbut many still remain, and only two of the chief men among the\r\nAchaeans perished during their return home. As for what happened on\r\nthe field of battle- you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader\r\nis still at sea, alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked,\r\nfor Neptune drove him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he\r\nlet him get safe out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva\'s\r\nhatred he would have escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by\r\nboasting. He said the gods could not drown him even though they had\r\ntried to do so, and when Neptune heard this large talk, he seized\r\nhis trident in his two brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in\r\ntwo pieces. The base remained where it was, but the part on which Ajax\r\nwas sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he\r\ndrank salt water and was drowned.\r\n"\'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but\r\nwhen he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was\r\ncaught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely\r\nagainst his will, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to\r\ndwell, but where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it\r\nseemed as though he was to return safely after all, for the gods\r\nbacked the wind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon\r\nAgamemnon kissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding\r\nhimself in his own country.\r\n"\'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the\r\nwatch, and to whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had\r\nbeen looking out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did\r\nnot give him the slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw\r\nAgamemnon go by, he went and told Aegisthus who at once began to lay a\r\nplot for him. He picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them\r\nin ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite side he\r\nprepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to\r\nAgamemnon, and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He\r\ngot him there, all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and\r\nkilled him when the banquet was over as though he were butchering an\r\nox in the shambles; not one of Agamemnon\'s followers was left alive,\r\nnor yet one of Aegisthus\', but they were all killed there in the\r\ncloisters.\'\r\n"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I\r\nsat down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer\r\nbear to live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had\r\nhad my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of\r\nthe sea said, \'Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying\r\nso bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast\r\nas ever you can, for Aegisthus be still alive, and even though Orestes\r\nhas beforehand with you in kilting him, you may yet come in for his\r\nfuneral.\'\r\n"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, \'I\r\nknow, then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man\r\nof whom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get\r\nhome? or is he dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.\'\r\n"\'The third man,\' he answered, \'is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I\r\ncan see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the\r\nnymph Calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his\r\nhome for he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As\r\nfor your own end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods\r\nwill take you to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world.\r\nThere fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life\r\nthan any where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain,\r\nnor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that\r\nsings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This\r\nwill happen to you because you have married Helen, and are Jove\'s\r\nson-in-law.\'\r\n"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to\r\nthe ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as\r\nI went along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night\r\nwas falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of\r\nmorning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the\r\nwater, and put our masts and sails within them; then we went on\r\nboard ourselves, took our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea\r\nwith our oars. I again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream\r\nof Egypt, and offered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When\r\nI had thus appeased heaven\'s anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of\r\nAgamemnon that his name might live for ever, after which I had a quick\r\npassage home, for the gods sent me a fair wind.\r\n"And now for yourself- stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and\r\nI will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present\r\nof a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful\r\nchalice that so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make\r\na drink-offering to the immortal gods."\r\n"Son of Atreus," replied Telemachus, "do not press me to stay\r\nlonger; I should be contented to remain with you for another twelve\r\nmonths; I find your conversation so delightful that I should never\r\nonce wish myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left\r\nat Pylos are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As\r\nfor any present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it\r\nshould he a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me to\r\nIthaca, but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have\r\nmuch flat ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also\r\nmeadowsweet and wheat and barley, and oats with their white and\r\nspreading ears; whereas in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor\r\nracecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than horses, and\r\nI like it the better for that. None of our islands have much level\r\nground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all."\r\nMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus\'s hand within his own. "What you\r\nsay," said he, "shows that you come of good family. I both can, and\r\nwill, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most\r\nprecious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl by\r\nVulcan\'s own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid\r\nwith gold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the\r\ncourse of a visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my\r\nhomeward journey. I will make you a present of it."\r\nThus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king\'s\r\nhouse. They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread\r\nfor them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in\r\nthe courts].\r\nMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a\r\nmark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses\' house, and were\r\nbehaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who\r\nwere their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were\r\nsitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to\r\nAntinous,\r\n"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from\r\nPylos? He has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis:\r\nI have twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side\r\nnot yet broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break\r\nhim."\r\nThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure\r\nthat Telemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he\r\nwas only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or\r\nwith the swineherd; so Antinous said, "When did he go? Tell me\r\ntruly, and what young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or\r\nhis own bondsmen- for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did\r\nyou let him have the ship of your own free will because he asked\r\nyou, or did he take it without yourleave?"\r\n"I lent it him," answered Noemon, "what else could I do when a man\r\nof his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige\r\nhim? I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him\r\nthey were the best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board\r\nas captain- or some god who was exactly like him. I cannot\r\nunderstand it, for I saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet\r\nhe was then setting out for Pylos."\r\nNoemon then went back to his father\'s house, but Antinous and\r\nEurymachus were very angry. They told the others to leave off playing,\r\nand to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,\r\nAntinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with\r\nrage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:\r\n"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter;\r\nwe had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow\r\nhas got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be\r\ngiving us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full\r\ngrown. Find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I\r\nwill lie in wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he\r\nwill then rue the day that he set out to try and get news of his\r\nfather."\r\nThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then\r\nall of them went inside the buildings.\r\nIt was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were\r\nplotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the\r\nouter court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell\r\nhis mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:\r\n"Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the\r\nmaids to leave their master\'s business and cook dinner for them? I\r\nwish they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor\r\nanywhere else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you\r\nall make of my son\'s estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you\r\nwere children how good Ulysses had been to them- never doing\r\nanything high-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say\r\nthings sometimes, and they may take a fancy to one man and dislike\r\nanother, but Ulysses never did an unjust thing by anybody- which shows\r\nwhat bad hearts you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude\r\nleft in this world."\r\nThen Medon said, "I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are\r\nplotting something much more dreadful now- may heaven frustrate\r\ntheir design. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is\r\ncoming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news\r\nof his father."\r\nThen Penelope\'s heart sank within her, and for a long time she was\r\nspeechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no\r\nutterance. At last, however, she said, "Why did my son leave me?\r\nWhat business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages\r\nover the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving\r\nany one behind him to keep up his name?"\r\n"I do not know," answered Medon, "whether some god set him on to it,\r\nor whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if\r\nhis father was dead, or alive and on his way home."\r\nThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of\r\ngrief. There were plenty of seats in the house, but she. had no\r\nheart for sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself\r\non the floor of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the\r\nhouse, both old and young, gathered round her and began to cry too,\r\ntill at last in a transport of sorrow she exclaimed,\r\n"My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction\r\nthan any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave\r\nand lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and\r\nwhose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my\r\ndarling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my\r\nhaving heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was\r\nnot one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my\r\nbed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I\r\nhad known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give it\r\nup, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse\r\nbehind him- one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old\r\nDolius, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my\r\ngardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to Laertes, who may\r\nbe able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side,\r\nas against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and that\r\nof Ulysses."\r\nThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, "You may kill me, Madam, or\r\nlet me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell\r\nyou the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he\r\nwanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn\r\noath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,\r\nunless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did\r\nnot want you to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your\r\nface, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer\r\nprayers to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save\r\nhim even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he\r\nhas trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate\r\ndie race of the race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there will\r\nbe a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house and the\r\nfair fields that lie far all round it."\r\nWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried\r\nthe tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her\r\ndress, and went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised\r\nbarley into a basket and began praying to Minerva.\r\n"Hear me," she cried, "Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove,\r\nunweariable. If ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh\r\nbones of sheep or heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and\r\nsave my darling son from the villainy of the suitors."\r\nShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;\r\nmeanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered\r\ncloister, and one of them said:\r\n"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.\r\nLittle does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die."\r\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going to\r\nhappen. Then Antinous said, "Comrades, let there be no loud talking,\r\nlest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in\r\nsilence, about which we are all of a mind."\r\nHe then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and to\r\nthe sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and\r\nsails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted\r\nthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails\r\naloft, while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then\r\nthey made the ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got\r\ntheir suppers, and waited till night should fall.\r\nBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink,\r\nand wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by\r\nthe wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen\r\nhemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank\r\ninto a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.\r\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in\r\nthe likeness of Penelope\'s sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had\r\nmarried Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to\r\nthe house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it\r\ncame into her room by the hole through which the thong went for\r\npulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying,\r\n"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer\r\nyou to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will\r\nyet come back to you."\r\nPenelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland,\r\nanswered, "Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often,\r\nbut I suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I,\r\nthen, to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that\r\ntorture me? I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who\r\nhad every good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all\r\nHellas and middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on\r\nboard of a ship- a foolish fellow who has never been used to\r\nroughing it, nor to going about among gatherings of men. I am even\r\nmore anxious about him than about my husband; I am all in a tremble\r\nwhen I think of him, lest something should happen to him, either\r\nfrom the people among whom he has gone, or by sea, for he has many\r\nenemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing him\r\nbefore he can return home."\r\nThen the vision said, "Take heart, and be not so much dismayed.\r\nThere is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to\r\nhave stand by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion\r\nupon you, and who has sent me to bear you this message."\r\n"Then," said Penelope, "if you are a god or have been sent here by\r\ndivine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one- is he\r\nstill alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?"\r\nAnd the vision said, "I shall not tell you for certain whether he is\r\nalive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation."\r\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was\r\ndissipated into thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed\r\nand comforted, so vivid had been her dream.\r\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the\r\nsea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called\r\nAsteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos,\r\nand there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here\r\nthen the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK V.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'AND NOW, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus- harbinger of\r\nlight alike to mortals and immortals- the gods met in council and with\r\nthem, Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva\r\nbegan to tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied\r\nhim away there in the house of the nymph Calypso.\r\n"Father Jove," said she, "and all you other gods that live in\r\neverlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind\r\nand well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I\r\nhope they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not\r\none of his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as\r\nthough he were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an\r\nisland where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he\r\ncannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships\r\nnor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are\r\nnow trying to murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home\r\nfrom Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news\r\nof his father."\r\n"What, my dear, are you talking about?" replied her father, "did you\r\nnot send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses\r\nto get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to\r\nprotect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the\r\nsuitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him."\r\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, "Mercury, you\r\nare our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed\r\nthat poor Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by\r\ngods nor men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft\r\nhe is to reach fertile Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who are\r\nnear of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were one\r\nof ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and\r\nwill give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have\r\nbrought back from Troy, if he had had had all his prize money and\r\nhad got home without disaster. This is how we have settled that he\r\nshall return to his country and his friends."\r\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did\r\nas he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals\r\nwith which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the\r\nwand with which he seals men\'s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as\r\nhe pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he\r\nswooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of the\r\nsea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing\r\nevery hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in\r\nthe spray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last\r\nhe got to the island which was his journey\'s end, he left the sea\r\nand went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso\r\nlived.\r\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the\r\nhearth, and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning\r\ncedar and sandal wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom,\r\nshooting her golden shuttle through the warp and singing\r\nbeautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar,\r\nand sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds had\r\nbuilt their nests- owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy\r\ntheir business in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained\r\nand grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also four\r\nrunning rills of water in channels cut pretty close together, and\r\nturned hither and thither so as to irrigate the beds of violets and\r\nluscious herbage over which they flowed. Even a god could not help\r\nbeing charmed with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still and\r\nlooked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went inside\r\nthe cave.\r\nCalypso knew him at once- for the gods all know each other, no\r\nmatter how far they live from one another- but Ulysses was not within;\r\nhe was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean\r\nwith tears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow.\r\nCalypso gave Mercury a seat and said: "Why have you come to see me,\r\nMercury- honoured, and ever welcome- for you do not visit me often?\r\nSay what you want; I will do it for be you at once if I can, and if it\r\ncan be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before\r\nyou.\r\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and\r\nmixed him some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had\r\nenough, and then said:\r\n"We are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, and\r\nyou ask me why I have come here, and I will tell you truly as you\r\nwould have me do. Jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could\r\npossibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are no\r\ncities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs?\r\nNevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross\r\nJove, nor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the most\r\nill-starred of alf those who fought nine years before the city of King\r\nPriam and sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On\r\ntheir way home they sinned against Minerva, who raised both wind and\r\nwaves against them, so that all his brave companions perished, and\r\nhe alone was carried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are\r\nto let this by man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall not\r\nperish here, far from his own people, but shall return to his house\r\nand country and see his friends again."\r\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, "You gods," she\r\nexclaimed, to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and\r\nhate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with\r\nhim in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to\r\nOrion, you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and\r\nkilled him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion,\r\nand yielded to him in a thrice ploughed fallow field, Jove came to\r\nhear of it before so long and killed Iasion with his thunder-bolts.\r\nAnd now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found\r\nthe poor creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had\r\nstruck his ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all\r\nhis crew were drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves\r\non to my island. I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my\r\nheart on making him immortal, so that he should never grow old all his\r\ndays; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing;\r\ntherefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas\r\nagain; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither\r\nships nor men who can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him\r\nsuch advice, in all good faith, as will be likely to bring him\r\nsafely to his own country."\r\n"Then send him away," said Mercury, "or Jove will be angry with\r\nyou and punish you"\'\r\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses,\r\nfor she had heard Jove\'s message. She found him sitting upon the beach\r\nwith his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer\r\nhome-sickness; for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was\r\nforced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he,\r\nthat would have it so. As for the day time, he spent it on the rocks\r\nand on the sea-shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and\r\nalways looking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him\r\nsaid:\r\n"My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting\r\nyour life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free\r\nwill; so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft\r\nwith an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will\r\nput bread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I\r\nwill also give you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take\r\nyou home, if the gods in heaven so will it- for they know more about\r\nthese things, and can settle them better than I can."\r\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. "Now goddess," he answered,\r\n"there is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to\r\nhelp me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on\r\na raft. Not even a well-found ship with a fair wind could venture on\r\nsuch a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall mage me go\r\non board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no\r\nmischief."\r\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: "You know a\r\ngreat deal," said she, "but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above\r\nand earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx-\r\nand this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take- that\r\nI mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly\r\nwhat I should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite\r\nstraightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry\r\nfor you."\r\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and\r\nUlysses followed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on\r\nand on till they came to Calypso\'s cave, where Ulysses took the seat\r\nthat Mercury had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of\r\nthe food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar\r\nfor herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were\r\nbefore them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,\r\nCalypso spoke, saying:\r\n"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your\r\nown land at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know\r\nhow much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own\r\ncountry, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and\r\nlet me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this\r\nwife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day;\r\nyet I flatter myself that at am no whit less tall or well-looking than\r\nshe is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should\r\ncompare in beauty with an immortal."\r\n"Goddess," replied Ulysses, "do not be angry with me about this. I\r\nam quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so\r\nbeautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an\r\nimmortal. Nevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing\r\nelse. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and\r\nmake the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and\r\nsea already, so let this go with the rest."\r\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired\r\ninto the inner part of the cave and went to bed.\r\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses put\r\non his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light\r\ngossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden\r\ngirdle about her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set\r\nherself to think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave\r\nhim a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both\r\nsides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it.\r\nShe also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\r\nthe island where the largest trees grew- alder, poplar and pine,\r\nthat reached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail\r\nlight for him in the water. Then, when she had shown him where the\r\nbest trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which\r\nhe soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them\r\nsmooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile\r\nCalypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and\r\nfitted the timbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as\r\nbroad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he\r\nfiled a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He\r\nalso made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He\r\nfenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protection\r\nagainst the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and\r\nby Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made these\r\ntoo, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of\r\nall, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.\r\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth\r\nCalypso sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some\r\nclean clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and\r\nanother larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of\r\nprovisions, and found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the\r\nwind fair and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail\r\nbefore it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means of\r\nthe rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the\r\nPleiads, on late-setting Bootes, and on the Bear- which men also\r\ncall the wain, and which turns round and round where it is, facing\r\nOrion, and alone never dipping into the stream of Oceanus- for Calypso\r\nhad told him to keep this to his left. Days seven and ten did he\r\nsail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines of the\r\nmountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared,\r\nrising like a shield on the horizon.\r\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught\r\nsight of Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi.\r\nHe could see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry,\r\nso he wagged his head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the\r\ngods have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away\r\nin Ethiopia, and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians,\r\nwhere it is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that have\r\nbefallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he\r\nhas done with it."\r\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident,\r\nstirred it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that\r\nblows till earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night\r\nsprang forth out of the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and\r\nWest fell upon him all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got\r\nup, so that Ulysses\' heart began to fail him. "Alas," he said to\r\nhimself in his dismay, "what ever will become of me? I am afraid\r\nCalypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea before\r\nI got back home. It is all coming true. How black is Jove making\r\nheaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds are raising from\r\nevery quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest and thrice blest\r\nwere those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause of the sons of\r\nAtreus. Would that had been killed on the day when the Trojans were\r\npressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for then I\r\nshould have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured my\r\nname; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end."\r\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the\r\nraft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let\r\ngo the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke\r\nthe mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea.\r\nFor a long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to\r\nrise to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him\r\nweighed him down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out\r\nthe bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite\r\nof all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as\r\nfast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board\r\nagain so as to escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it\r\nabout as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road.\r\nIt was as though the South, North, East, and West winds were all\r\nplaying battledore and shuttlecock with it at once.\r\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called\r\nLeucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had\r\nbeen since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what\r\ngreat distress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and,\r\nrising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.\r\n"My poor good man," said she, "why is Neptune so furiously angry\r\nwith you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his\r\nbluster he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do\r\nthen as I bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind,\r\nand swim to the Phaecian coast where better luck awaits you. And here,\r\ntake my veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can\r\ncome to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take\r\nit off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then go away\r\nagain." With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then\r\nshe dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark\r\nblue waters.\r\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. "Alas," he said to himself\r\nin his dismay, "this is only some one or other of the gods who is\r\nluring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. At any rate I\r\nwill not do so at present, for the land where she said I should be\r\nquit of all troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know what\r\nI will do- I am sure it will be best- no matter what happens I will\r\nstick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when the\r\nsea breaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any\r\nbetter than this."\r\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave\r\nthat seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the\r\nraft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry\r\nchaff tossed about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank\r\nand rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off the\r\nclothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino\'s veil under his arms, and\r\nplunged into the sea- meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched\r\nhim as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and\r\nsaying, "\'There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in\r\nwith well-to-do people. I do not think you will be able to say that\r\nI have let you off too lightly." On this he lashed his horses and\r\ndrove to Aegae where his palace is.\r\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all\r\nthe winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused\r\na good stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till\r\nUlysses reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.\r\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water,\r\nwith a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but\r\nwhen the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm\r\nwithout so much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell\r\nhe looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as\r\nchildren rejoice when their dear father begins to get better after\r\nhaving for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry\r\nspirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful\r\nwhen he again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength\r\nthat he might once more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he\r\ngot within earshot, he began to hear the surf thundering up against\r\nthe rocks, for the swell still broke against them with a terrific\r\nroar. Everything was enveloped in spray; there were no harbours\r\nwhere a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but only\r\nheadlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.\r\nUlysses\' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to\r\nhimself, "Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that\r\nI had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the\r\ncoast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer\r\nfrom the sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot\r\nclimb out for want of foothold. I am afraid some great wave will\r\nlift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the\r\nwater- which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I\r\nswim further in search of some shelving beach or harbour, a\r\nhurricane may carry me out to sea again sorely against my will, or\r\nheaven may send some great monster of the deep to attack me; for\r\nAmphitrite breeds many such, and I know that Neptune is very angry\r\nwith me."\r\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with\r\nsuch force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and\r\ntorn to pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold\r\nof the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till\r\nthe wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave\r\ncame on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearing\r\nhis hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it\r\nfrom its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did the\r\nrocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew\r\nhim deep down under the water.\r\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his\r\nown destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him.\r\nHe swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating\r\nagainst the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the\r\nshore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take\r\nthe waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of\r\na river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were\r\nno rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there\r\nwas a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:\r\n"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger\r\nof the sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who\r\nhas lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods,\r\nwherefore in my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to\r\nthe knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare\r\nmyself your suppliant."\r\nThen the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all\r\ncalm before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the\r\nriver. Here at last Ulysses\' knees and strong hands failed him, for\r\nthe sea had completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his\r\nmouth and nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he\r\ncould neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer\r\nexhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came to\r\nhimself again, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him and\r\nthrew it back into the salt stream of the river, whereon Ino\r\nreceived it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her.\r\nThen he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and kissed\r\nthe bounteous earth.\r\n"Alas," he cried to himself in his dismay, "what ever will become of\r\nme, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed\r\nthrough the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the\r\nbitter cold and damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrise\r\nthere will be a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other\r\nhand, I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in\r\nsome thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night\'s rest,\r\nbut some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me."\r\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found\r\none upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept\r\nbeneath two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock- the one\r\nan ungrafted sucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind,\r\nhowever squally, could break through the cover they afforded, nor\r\ncould the sun\'s rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them, so\r\nclosely did they grow into one another. Ulysses crept under these\r\nand began to make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great\r\nlitter of dead leaves lying about- enough to make a covering for two\r\nor three men even in hard winter weather. He was glad enough to see\r\nthis, so he laid himself down and heaped the leaves all round him.\r\nThen, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any neighbor,\r\nhides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having to\r\nget a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up with\r\nleaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his\r\neyelids, and made him lose all memories of his sorrows.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK VI.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'SO HERE Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva\r\nwent off to the country and city of the Phaecians- a people who used\r\nto live in the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now\r\nthe Cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them, so their king\r\nNausithous moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all\r\nother people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and\r\ntemples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and\r\ngone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were\r\ninspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did\r\nMinerva hie in furtherance of the return of Ulysses.\r\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which\r\nthere slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa,\r\ndaughter to King Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her,\r\nboth very pretty, one on either side of the doorway, which was\r\nclosed with well-made folding doors. Minerva took the form of the\r\nfamous sea captain Dymas\'s daughter, who was a bosom friend of\r\nNausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl\'s bedside\r\nlike a breath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:\r\n"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy\r\ndaughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are\r\ngoing to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well\r\ndressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend\r\nyou. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your\r\nfather and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a\r\nwashing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that\r\nyou may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best\r\nyoung men among your own people are courting you, and you are not\r\ngoing to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to\r\nhave a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs,\r\nrobes, and girdles; and you can ride, too, which will be much\r\npleasanter for you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way\r\nfrom the town."\r\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they\r\nsay is the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly,\r\nand neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting\r\nsunshine and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed\r\ngods are illumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which\r\nthe goddess went when she had given instructions to the girl.\r\nBy and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering\r\nabout her dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to\r\ntell her father and mother all about it, and found them in their own\r\nroom. Her mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple\r\nyarn with her maids around her, and she happened to catch her father\r\njust as he was going out to attend a meeting of the town council,\r\nwhich the Phaeacian aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:\r\n"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I\r\nwant to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are\r\nthe chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean\r\nshirt when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five\r\nsons at home, two of them married, while the other three are\r\ngood-looking bachelors; you know they always like to have clean\r\nlinen when they go to a dance, and I have been thinking about all\r\nthis."\r\nShe did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like\r\nto, but her father knew and said, "You shall have the mules, my\r\nlove, and whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and\r\nthe men shall get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will\r\nhold all your clothes."\r\nOn this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon\r\nout, harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought\r\nthe clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon.\r\nHer mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of\r\ngood things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the\r\nwaggon, and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she\r\nand her women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and\r\nreins and lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs\r\nclattered on the road. They pulled without flagging, and carried not\r\nonly Nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were\r\nwith her.\r\nWhen they reached the water side they went to the\r\nwashing-cisterns, through which there ran at all times enough pure\r\nwater to wash any quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they\r\nunharnessed the mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy\r\nherbage that grew by the water side. They took the clothes out of\r\nthe waggon, put them in the water, and vied with one another in\r\ntreading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After they had washed\r\nthem and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side,\r\nwhere the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set about\r\nwashing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil. Then\r\nthey got their dinner by the side of the stream, and waited for the\r\nsun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done dinner they threw\r\noff the veils that covered their heads and began to play at ball,\r\nwhile Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes forth upon\r\nthe mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer,\r\nand the wood-nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sport\r\nalong with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a full\r\nhead taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole\r\nbevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.\r\nWhen it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the\r\nclothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider\r\nhow Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to\r\nconduct him to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore,\r\nthrew a ball at one of the maids, which missed her and fell into\r\ndeep water. On this they all shouted, and the noise they made woke\r\nUlysses, who sat up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it\r\nmight all be.\r\n"Alas," said he to himself, "what kind of people have I come\r\namongst? Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable and\r\nhumane? I seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound\r\nlike those of the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of\r\nrivers and meadows of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of\r\nmen and women. Let me try if I cannot manage to get a look at them."\r\nAs he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a\r\nbough covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked\r\nlike some lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his\r\nstrength and defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls\r\nin quest of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare\r\nbreak even into a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep-\r\neven such did Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them\r\nall naked as he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so\r\nunkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off\r\nalong the spits that jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of\r\nAlcinous stood firm, for Minerva put courage into her heart and took\r\naway all fear from her. She stood right in front of Ulysses, and he\r\ndoubted whether he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and\r\nembrace her knees as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her\r\nto give him some clothes and show him the way to the town. In the\r\nend he deemed it best to entreat her from a distance in case the\r\ngirl should take offence at his coming near enough to clasp her knees,\r\nso he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive language.\r\n"O queen," he said, "I implore your aid- but tell me, are you a\r\ngoddess or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in\r\nheaven, I can only conjecture that you are Jove\'s daughter Diana,\r\nfor your face and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other\r\nhand you are a mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your\r\nfather and mother- thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters;\r\nhow proud and delighted they must feel when they see so fair a scion\r\nas yourself going out to a dance; most happy, however, of all will\r\nhe be whose wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes you\r\nto his own home. I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor\r\nwoman, and am lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare\r\nyou to a young palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing\r\nnear the altar of Apollo- for I was there, too, with much people after\r\nme, when I was on that journey which has been the source of all my\r\ntroubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out of the ground\r\nas that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I now\r\nadmire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am\r\nin great distress; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been\r\ntossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves have taken me all\r\nthe way from the Ogygian island, and now fate has flung me upon this\r\ncoast that I may endure still further suffering; for I do not think\r\nthat I have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven has\r\nstill much evil in store for me.\r\n"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I\r\nhave met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to\r\nyour town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither\r\nto wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your\r\nheart\'s desire- husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for\r\nthere is nothing better in this world than that man and wife should be\r\nof one mind in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the\r\nhearts of their friends glad, and they themselves know more about it\r\nthan any one."\r\nTo this Nausicaa answered, "Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\r\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives\r\nprosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take\r\nwhat he has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now,\r\nhowever, that you have come to this our country, you shall not want\r\nfor clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may\r\nreasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and will\r\ntell you the name of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am\r\ndaughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested."\r\nThen she called her maids and said, "Stay where you are, you\r\ngirls. Can you not see a man without running away from him? Do you\r\ntake him for a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can\r\ncome here to do us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods,\r\nand live apart on a land\'s end that juts into the sounding sea, and\r\nhave nothing to do with any other people. This is only some poor man\r\nwho has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for strangers and\r\nforeigners in distress are under Jove\'s protection, and will take what\r\nthey can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow\r\nsomething to eat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place\r\nthat is sheltered from the wind."\r\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one\r\nanother back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa\r\nhad told them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought\r\nhim the little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in the\r\nstream. But Ulysses said, "Young women, please to stand a little on\r\none side that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself\r\nwith oil, for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil\r\nupon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am\r\nashamed to strip before a number of good-looking young women."\r\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses\r\nwashed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back\r\nand from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself,\r\nand had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil,\r\nand put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made\r\nhim look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair\r\ngrow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like\r\nhyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a\r\nskilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and\r\nMinerva enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it- and his work\r\nis full of beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon the\r\nbeach, looking quite young and handsome, and the girl gazed on him\r\nwith admiration; then she said to her maids:\r\n"Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who\r\nlive in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first\r\nsaw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of\r\nthe gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be\r\njust such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to\r\ngo away. However, give him something to eat and drink."\r\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and\r\ndrank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.\r\nMeanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen\r\nfolded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she\r\ntook her seat, she called Ulysses:\r\n"Stranger," said she, "rise and let us be going back to the town;\r\nI will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I\r\ncan tell you that you will meet all the best people among the\r\nPhaecians. But be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a\r\nsensible person. As long as we are going past the fields- and farm\r\nlands, follow briskly behind the waggon along with the maids and I\r\nwill lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to the\r\ntown, where you will find a high wall running all round it, and a good\r\nharbour on either side with a narrow entrance into the city, and the\r\nships will be drawn up by the road side, for every one has a place\r\nwhere his own ship can lie. You will see the market place with a\r\ntemple of Neptune in the middle of it, and paved with large stones\r\nbedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship\'s gear of all kinds,\r\nsuch as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars are\r\nmade, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know\r\nnothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pride\r\nthemselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far\r\nover the sea.\r\n"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot\r\nagainst me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and\r\nsome low fellow, if he met us, might say, \'Who is this fine-looking\r\nstranger that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she End him? I\r\nsuppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor\r\nwhom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no\r\nneighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to\r\nher prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her\r\nlife. It would be a good thing if she would take herself of I for sh\r\nand find a husband somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the\r\nmany excellent young Phaeacians who are in with her.\' This is the kind\r\nof disparaging remark that would be made about me, and I could not\r\ncomplain, for I should myself be scandalized at seeing any other\r\ngirl do the like, and go about with men in spite of everybody, while\r\nher father and mother were still alive, and without having been\r\nmarried in the face of all the world.\r\n"If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help\r\nyou home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars\r\nby the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a\r\nmeadow all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground,\r\nabout as far from the town as a man\' voice will carry. Sit down\r\nthere and wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town\r\nand reach my father\'s house. Then, when you think we must have done\r\nthis, come into the town and ask the way to the house of my father\r\nAlcinous. You will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will\r\npoint it out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything\r\nlike such a fine house as he has. When you have got past the gates and\r\nthrough the outer court, go right across the inner court till you come\r\nto my mother. You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her\r\npurple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans\r\nback against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind\r\nher. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sits\r\nand topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my\r\nmother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home\r\nquickly. If you can gain her over, you may hope to see your own\r\ncountry again, no matter how distant it may be."\r\nSo saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the\r\nriver. The mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon the\r\nroad. She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who\r\nwere following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip\r\nwith judgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred\r\ngrove of Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the\r\nmighty daughter of Jove.\r\n"Hear me," he cried, "daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable,\r\nhear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was\r\nwrecking me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may\r\nfind friends and be hospitably received by the Phaecians."\r\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not\r\nshow herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune,\r\nwho was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting\r\nhome.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK VII.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THUS, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to\r\nthe town. When she reached her father\'s house she drew up at the\r\ngateway, and her brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her,\r\ntook the mules out of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the\r\nhouse, while she went to her own room, where an old servant,\r\nEurymedusa of Apeira, lit the fire for her. This old woman had been\r\nbrought by sea from Apeira, and had been chosen as a prize for\r\nAlcinous because he was king over the Phaecians, and the people obeyed\r\nhim as though he were a god. She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had\r\nnow lit the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into her\r\nown room.\r\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed\r\na thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud\r\nPhaecians who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was.\r\nThen, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in the\r\nlikeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front\r\nof him, and Ulysses said:\r\n"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king\r\nAlcinous? I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know\r\none in your town and country."\r\nThen Minerva said, "Yes, father stranger, I will show you the\r\nhouse you want, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I\r\nwill go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and\r\ndo not look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here\r\ncannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some other\r\nplace. They are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of\r\nNeptune in ships that glide along like thought, or as a bird in the\r\nair."\r\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but\r\nnot one of the Phaecians could see him as he passed through the city\r\nin the midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will\r\ntowards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired\r\ntheir harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of\r\nthe city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking,\r\nand when they reached the king\'s house Minerva said:\r\n"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show\r\nyou. You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do\r\nnot be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely\r\nhe is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the\r\nqueen. Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her\r\nhusband Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune, who was\r\nfather to Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea\r\nwas the youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over\r\nthe giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life\r\nto boot.\r\n"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by\r\nhim, the great Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaecians.\r\nNausithous had two sons Rhexenor and Alcinous; Apollo killed the first\r\nof them while he was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he\r\nleft a daughter Arete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no\r\nother woman is honoured of all those that keep house along with\r\ntheir husbands.\r\n"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\r\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look\r\nupon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city,\r\nfor she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when\r\nany women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to\r\nsettle their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have\r\nevery hope of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to\r\nyour home and country."\r\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to\r\nMarathon and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\r\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\r\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the\r\nthreshold of bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that\r\nof the sun or moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end\r\nto end, and the cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and\r\nhung on pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while\r\nthe lintel was silver and the hook of the door was of gold.\r\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan,\r\nwith his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch\r\nover the palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could\r\nnever grow old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there\r\nfrom one end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the\r\nwomen of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaecians\r\nused to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons;\r\nand there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in\r\ntheir hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those\r\nwho were at table. There are fifty maid servants in the house, some of\r\nwhom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others\r\nwork at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwards\r\nand forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is\r\nso closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaecians are the\r\nbest sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving,\r\nfor Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are\r\nvery intelligent.\r\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about\r\nfour acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees-\r\npears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious\r\nfigs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail\r\nall the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so\r\nsoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows\r\non pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the\r\ngrapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a\r\npart of this, the grapes are being made into raisins; in another\r\npart they are being gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs,\r\nothers further on have shed their blossom and are beginning to show\r\nfruit, others again are just changing colour. In the furthest part\r\nof the ground there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that\r\nare in bloom all the year round. Two streams go through it, the one\r\nturned in ducts throughout the whole garden, while the other is\r\ncarried under the ground of the outer court to the house itself, and\r\nthe town\'s people draw water from it. Such, then, were the\r\nsplendours with which the gods had endowed the house of king Alcinous.\r\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when\r\nhe had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\r\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among\r\nthe Phaecians making their drink-offerings to Mercury, which they\r\nalways did the last thing before going away for the night. He went\r\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in\r\nwhich Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\r\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at\r\nthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\r\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\r\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition.\r\n"Queen Arete," he exclaimed, "daughter of great Rhexenor, in my\r\ndistress I humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests\r\n(whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they\r\nleave their possessions to their children, and all the honours\r\nconferred upon them by the state) to help me home to my own country as\r\nsoon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my\r\nfriends."\r\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held\r\ntheir peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an\r\nexcellent speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in\r\nall honesty addressed them thus:\r\n"Alcinous," said he, "it is not creditable to you that a stranger\r\nshould be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is\r\nwaiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and\r\ntake a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix\r\nsome wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Jove the lord\r\nof thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under his\r\nprotection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of\r\nwhatever there may be in the house."\r\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him\r\nfrom the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had\r\nbeen sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant\r\nthen brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a\r\nsilver basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table\r\nbeside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many\r\ngood things of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank.\r\nThen Alcinous said to one of the servants, "Pontonous, mix a cup of\r\nwine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove the\r\nlord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposed\r\nsuppliants."\r\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after\r\ngiving every man his drink-offering. When they had made their\r\nofferings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\r\n"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\r\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\r\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a\r\nsacrificial banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the\r\nquestion of his escort, and consider how we may at once send him\r\nback rejoicing to his own country without trouble or inconvenience\r\nto himself, no matter how distant it may be. We must see that he comes\r\nto no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once at\r\nhome he will have to take the luck he was born with for better or\r\nworse like other people. It is possible, however, that the stranger is\r\none of the immortals who has come down from heaven to visit us; but in\r\nthis case the gods are departing from their usual practice, for\r\nhitherto they have made themselves perfectly clear to us when we\r\nhave been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts\r\njust like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to\r\nstumble upon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment,\r\nfor we are as near of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savage\r\ngiants are."\r\nThen Ulysses said: "Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\r\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\r\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most\r\nafflicted. Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit\r\nto lay upon me, you would say that I was still worse off than they\r\nare. Nevertheless, let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach\r\nis a very importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man\'s notice no\r\nmatter how dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists\r\nthat I shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows\r\nand dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves,\r\ndo as you propose, and at break of day set about helping me to get\r\nhome. I shall be content to die if I may first once more behold my\r\nproperty, my bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house."\r\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he\r\nshould have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when\r\nthey had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much as\r\nhe was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode,\r\nleaving Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the\r\nservants were taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first\r\nto speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that\r\nUlysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she\r\nsaid, "Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I\r\nshould like to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you\r\nthose clothes? Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?"\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, "It would be a long story Madam, were I to\r\nrelate in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven\r\nhas been laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an\r\nisland far away in the sea which is called \'the Ogygian.\' Here\r\ndwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas.\r\nShe lives by herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune,\r\nhowever, me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my\r\nship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave\r\ncomrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and\r\nwas carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at\r\nlast during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the\r\nOgygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in\r\nand treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make\r\nme immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me\r\nto let her do so.\r\n"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered\r\nthe good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time;\r\nbut at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of\r\nher own free will, either because Jove had told her she must, or\r\nbecause she had changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a\r\nraft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover\r\nshe gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both\r\nwarm and fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on\r\nthe eighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains\r\nupon your coast- and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them.\r\nNevertheless there was still much trouble in store for me, for at this\r\npoint Neptune would let me go no further, and raised a great storm\r\nagainst me; the sea was so terribly high that I could no longer keep\r\nto my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I had\r\nto swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your shores.\r\n"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and\r\nthe waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea\r\nand swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing\r\nplace, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.\r\nHere, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses together\r\nagain. Night was coming on, so I left the river, and went into a\r\nthicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and presently\r\nheaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I\r\nslept among the leaves all night, and through the next day till\r\nafternoon, when I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your\r\ndaughter\'s maid servants playing upon the beach, and your daughter\r\namong them looking like a goddess. I besought her aid, and she\r\nproved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than could be\r\nexpected from so young a person- for young people are apt to be\r\nthoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had\r\nhad me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you\r\nsee me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have\r\ntold you the whole truth."\r\nThen Alcinous said, "Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter\r\nnot to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing\r\nthat she was the first person whose aid you asked."\r\n"Pray do not scold her," replied Ulysses; "she is not to blame.\r\nShe did tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed\r\nand afraid, for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw\r\nme. Every human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable."\r\n"Stranger," replied Alcinous, "I am not the kind of man to get angry\r\nabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father\r\nJove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are,\r\nand how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my\r\ndaughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a\r\nhouse and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here\r\nagainst your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will\r\nattend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep during\r\nthe whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth\r\nwaters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though it\r\nbe a long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people who\r\nsaw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son\r\nof Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and yet they did the\r\nwhole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, and\r\ncame back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\r\nexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are."\r\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, "Father Jove, grant\r\nthat Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an\r\nimperishable name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return\r\nto my country."\r\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in\r\nthe room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs,\r\nand to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for\r\nUlysses to wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their\r\nhands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and\r\nsaid, "Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,"\r\nand glad indeed was he to go to his rest.\r\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;\r\nbut Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his\r\nwife by his side.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK VIII.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NOW when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\r\nAlcinous and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the\r\nPhaecian place of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got\r\nthere they sat down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while\r\nMinerva took the form of one of Alcinous\' servants, and went round the\r\ntown in order to help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the\r\ncitizens, man by man, and said, "Aldermen and town councillors of\r\nthe Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the\r\nstranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of King\r\nAlcinous; he looks like an immortal god."\r\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to\r\nthe assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every\r\none was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had\r\nbeautified him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller\r\nand stouter than he really was, that he might impress the Phaecians\r\nfavourably as being a very remarkable man, and might come off well\r\nin the many trials of skill to which they would challenge him. Then,\r\nwhen they were got together, Alcinous spoke:\r\n"Hear me," said he, "aldermen and town councillors of the\r\nPhaeacians, that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger,\r\nwhoever he may be, has found his way to my house from somewhere or\r\nother either East or West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the\r\nmatter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we have done for\r\nothers before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has\r\nbeen able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough.\r\nLet us draw a ship into the sea- one that has never yet made a voyage-\r\nand man her with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then\r\nwhen you have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the ship\r\nand come to my house to prepare a feast. I will find you in\r\neverything. I am giving will these instructions to the young men who\r\nwill form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town\r\ncouncillors, you will join me in entertaining our guest in the\r\ncloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have Demodocus to sing\r\nto us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may choose to sing\r\nabout."\r\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a\r\nservant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went\r\nto the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they\r\ndrew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound\r\nthe oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in\r\ndue course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a\r\nlittle way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house\r\nof King Alcinous. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts were\r\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young;\r\nand Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two\r\noxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent\r\nbanquet.\r\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the\r\nmuse had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil,\r\nfor though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had\r\nrobbed him of his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the\r\nguests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him\r\non a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it\r\nwith his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals\r\nby his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he\r\nwas so disposed.\r\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were\r\nbefore them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\r\nthe muse inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more\r\nespecially a matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit,\r\nthe quarrel between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that\r\nthey heaped on one another as they gat together at a banquet. But\r\nAgamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one\r\nanother, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the\r\nstone floor to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the\r\nevil that by the will of Jove fell both Danaans and Trojans.\r\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head\r\nand covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see\r\nthat he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears\r\nfrom his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a\r\ndrink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed\r\nDemodocus to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then\r\nUlysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. No\r\none noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him,\r\nand heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said,\r\n"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough\r\nnow, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due\r\naccompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so\r\nthat our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends\r\nhow much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers,\r\nand runners."\r\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A\r\nservant hung Demodocus\'s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the\r\ncloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the\r\nchief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of\r\nseveral thousands of people followed them, and there were many\r\nexcellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus,\r\nNauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon,\r\nAnabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was\r\nalso Euryalus son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was\r\nthe best looking man among the Phaecians except Laodamas. Three sons\r\nof Alcinous, Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\r\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from\r\nthe starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all\r\nflew forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long\r\nway; he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow\r\nthat a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. They then\r\nturned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be\r\nthe best man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at\r\nthrowing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus.\r\nAlcinous\'s son Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who\r\npresently said, when they had all been diverted with the games, "Let\r\nus ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems\r\nvery powerfully built; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are of\r\nprodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much\r\nlately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man,\r\nno matter how strong he is."\r\n"You are quite right, Laodamas," replied Euryalus, "go up to your\r\nguest and speak to him about it yourself."\r\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the\r\ncrowd and said to Ulysses, "I hope, Sir, that you will enter\r\nyourself for some one or other of our competitions if you are\r\nskilled in any of them- and you must have gone in for many a one\r\nbefore now. There is nothing that does any one so much credit all\r\nhis life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands and\r\nfeet. Have a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from\r\nyour mind. Your return home will not be long delayed, for the ship\r\nis already drawn into the water, and the crew is found."\r\nUlysses answered, "Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my\r\nmind is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through\r\ninfinite trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying\r\nyour king and people to further me on my return home."\r\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, "I gather, then, that\r\nyou are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight\r\nin. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in\r\nships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of\r\ntheir outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be\r\nmuch of the athlete about you."\r\n"For shame, Sir," answered Ulysses, fiercely, "you are an insolent\r\nfellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in\r\nspeech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence,\r\nbut heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he\r\ncharms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his\r\nhearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his\r\nfellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as\r\nhandsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.\r\nThis is your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you\r\nare, but you are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me\r\nexceedingly angry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in a\r\ngreat many athletic exercises; indeed, so long as I had youth and\r\nstrength, I was among the first athletes of the age. Now, however, I\r\nam worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much both on\r\nthe field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite\r\nof all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the\r\nquick."\r\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a\r\ndisc, larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the\r\nPhaeacians when disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging it\r\nback, he threw it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in\r\nthe air as he did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of\r\nits flight as it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any\r\nmark that had been made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and\r\nmarked the place where it had fallen. "A blind man, Sir," said she,\r\n"could easily tell your mark by groping for it- it is so far ahead\r\nof any other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no\r\nPhaeacian can come near to such a throw as yours."\r\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,\r\nso he began to speak more pleasantly. "Young men," said he, "come up\r\nto that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or\r\neven heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come\r\non, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do\r\nnot care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but\r\nnot with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one\'s\r\nown personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a\r\nsensible thing for a guest to challenge his host\'s family at any game,\r\nespecially when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground\r\nfrom under his own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards\r\nany one else, for I want to have the matter out and know which is\r\nthe best man. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport known\r\namong mankind. I am an excellent archer. In battle I am always the\r\nfirst to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more are\r\ntaking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who\r\ncould shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy\r\nand in practice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of\r\nthose who still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but I should not\r\nlike to shoot against the mighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus\r\nthe Cechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This in\r\nfact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was angry\r\nwith him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. I\r\ncan throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. Running\r\nis the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the\r\nPhaecians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea;\r\nmy provisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak."\r\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, "Sir,\r\nwe have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from\r\nwhich I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as\r\nhaving been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been\r\nmade to you by one of our athletes, and which could never have been\r\nuttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you\r\nwill apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any be one of your\r\nchief men who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get\r\nhome, that we have an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all\r\nkinds. We are not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as\r\nwrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent\r\nsailors. We are extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing; we\r\nalso like frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds, so\r\nnow, please, some of you who are the best dancers set about dancing,\r\nthat our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends\r\nhow much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers,\r\nminstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or\r\nother of you and fetch it for him."\r\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king\'s\r\nhouse, and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward.\r\nIt was their business to manage everything connected with the\r\nsports, so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the\r\ndancers. Presently the servant came back with Demodocus\'s lyre, and he\r\ntook his place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in\r\nthe town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was\r\ndelighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.\r\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and\r\nhow they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars\r\nmade Venus many presents, and defiled King Vulcan\'s marriage bed, so\r\nthe sun, who saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very\r\nangry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy\r\nbrooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to\r\nforge some chains which none could either unloose or break, so that\r\nthey might stay there in that place. When he had finished his snare he\r\nwent into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains\r\nlike cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the\r\nceiling. Not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle were\r\nthey. As soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made as\r\nthough he were setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of\r\nall places in the world was the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept\r\nno blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his\r\nhouse, burning with love for Venus.\r\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and\r\nwas about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, an said as\r\nhe took her hand in his own, "Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he\r\nis not at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose\r\nspeech is barbarous."\r\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their\r\nrest, whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had\r\nspread for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but\r\nfound too late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to\r\nthem, for he had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout\r\nthe sun told him what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and\r\nstood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all\r\nthe gods.\r\n"Father Jove," he cried, "and all you other blessed gods who live\r\nfor ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight\r\nthat I will show you. Jove\'s daughter Venus is always dishonouring\r\nme because I am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and\r\nclean built, whereas I am a cripple- but my parents are to blame for\r\nthat, not I; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the\r\npair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them.\r\nThey are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie\r\nthere longer than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep\r\nmuch; there, however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me\r\nthe sum I gave him for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but\r\nnot honest."\r\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling\r\nNeptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but\r\nthe goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of\r\nall good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with\r\ninextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,\r\nwhereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:\r\n"Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how\r\nlimping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god\r\nin heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages."\r\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury,\r\n"Messenger Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how\r\nstrong the chains were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?"\r\n"King Apollo," answered Mercury, "I only wish I might get the\r\nchance, though there were three times as many chains- and you might\r\nlook on, all of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if I\r\ncould."\r\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but\r\nNeptune took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set\r\nMars free again. "Let him go," he cried, "and I will undertake, as you\r\nrequire, that he shall pay you all the damages that are held\r\nreasonable among the immortal gods."\r\n"Do not," replied Vulcan, "ask me to do this; a bad man\'s bond is\r\nbad security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should\r\ngo away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?"\r\n"Vulcan," said Neptune, "if Mars goes away without paying his\r\ndamages, I will pay you myself." So Vulcan answered, "In this case I\r\ncannot and must not refuse you."\r\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they\r\nwere free they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus\r\nto Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant\r\nwith burnt offerings. Here the Graces hathed her, and anointed her\r\nwith oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they\r\nclothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.\r\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians\r\nwere charmed as they heard him.\r\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was\r\nno one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had\r\nmade for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it\r\nup towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground\r\nand caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had\r\ndone throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance,\r\nand at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one\r\nanother, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a\r\ngreat stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:\r\n"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in\r\nthe world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was\r\nastonished as I saw them."\r\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaecians\r\n"Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of\r\nsingular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as\r\nhe may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and\r\ncounting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean\r\ncloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in\r\na lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with\r\na light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology\r\nand a present too, for he has been rude."\r\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying,\r\nand sent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said,\r\n"King Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you\r\nrequire. He shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt,\r\nwhich is of silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn\r\nivory into which it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him."\r\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said,\r\n"Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss\r\nmay the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a\r\nsafe return, for I understand you have been long away from home, and\r\nhave gone through much hardship."\r\nTo which Ulysses answered, "Good luck to you too my friend, and\r\nmay the gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the\r\nsword you have given me along with your apology."\r\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards\r\nsundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants\r\nof the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here\r\nhis sons received them, and placed them under their mother\'s charge.\r\nThen Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take\r\ntheir seats.\r\n"Wife," said he, turning to Queen Arete, "Go, fetch the best chest\r\nwe have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper\r\non the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath;\r\nsee also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble\r\nPhaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper\r\nand the singing that will follow. I shall myself give him this\r\ngolden goblet- which is of exquisite workmanship- that he may be\r\nreminded of me for the rest of his life whenever he makes a\r\ndrink-offering to Jove, or to any of the gods."\r\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as\r\nfast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to\r\na clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water\r\nbecame hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.\r\nMeanwhile Arete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside\r\nit she packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the\r\nPhaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from\r\nAlcinous, and said to Ulysses:\r\n"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once,\r\nfor fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your\r\nship."\r\nWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast\r\nwith a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an\r\nupper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was\r\nvery glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him\r\never since he left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained\r\nwith her had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god.\r\nWhen the servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had\r\ngiven him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined\r\nthe guests who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood\r\nby one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof if the cloister, and\r\nadmired him as she saw him pass. "Farewell stranger," said she, "do\r\nnot forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me first\r\nthat you owe a ransom for having saved your life."\r\nAnd Ulysses said, "Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove\r\nthe mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall I\r\nbless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved\r\nme."\r\nWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was\r\nthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the\r\nfavourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company,\r\nnear one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might\r\nlean against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with\r\nplenty of fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said\r\nto a servant, "Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell\r\nhim to eat it; for all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute\r\nhim none the less; bards are honoured and respected throughout the\r\nworld, for the muse teaches them their songs and loves them."\r\nThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who\r\ntook it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the\r\ngood things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to\r\neat and drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, "Demodocus, there is no\r\none in the world whom I admire more than I do you. You must have\r\nstudied under the Muse, Jove\'s daughter, and under Apollo, so\r\naccurately do you sing the return of the Achaeans with all their\r\nsufferings and adventures. If you were not there yourself, you must\r\nhave heard it all from some one who was. Now, however, change your\r\nsong and tell us of the wooden horse which Epeus made with the\r\nassistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got by stratagem into the\r\nfort of Troy after freighting it with the men who afterwards sacked\r\nthe city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all the\r\nworld how magnificently heaven has endowed you."\r\nThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where\r\nsome of the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while\r\nothers, hidden within the horse, were waiting with Ulysses in the\r\nTrojan place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the\r\nhorse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in\r\ncouncil round it, and were in three minds as to what they should do.\r\nSome were for breaking it up then and there; others would have it\r\ndragged to the top of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then\r\nthrown down the precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain\r\nas an offering and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they\r\nsettled it in the end, for the city was doomed when it took in that\r\nhorse, within which were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to\r\nbring death and destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the\r\nsons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town,\r\nbreaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they over ran the\r\ncity hither and thither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging\r\nlike Mars along with Menelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It was\r\nthere that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Minerva\'s\r\nhelp he was victorious.\r\nAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and\r\nhis cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she\r\nthrows herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his\r\nown city and people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and\r\nchildren. She screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies\r\ngasping for breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind\r\nabout the back and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a\r\nlife of labour and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks-\r\neven so piteously did Ulysses weep, but none of those present\r\nperceived his tears except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and\r\ncould hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving. The king,\r\ntherefore, at once rose and said:\r\n"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus\r\ncease his song, for there are those present who do not seem to like\r\nit. From the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to\r\nsing, our guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is\r\nevidently in great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all\r\nenjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it\r\nshould be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents\r\nthat we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honour,\r\nand any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he\r\nought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own\r\nbrother.\r\n"Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment\r\nnor reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more\r\npolite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which\r\nyour father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which\r\nyou were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is\r\nno one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name\r\nwhatever, for people\'s fathers and mothers give them names as soon\r\nas they are born. Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that\r\nour ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there.\r\nFor the Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as\r\nthose of other nations have, but the ships themselves understand\r\nwhat it is that we are thinking about and want; they know all the\r\ncities and countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just\r\nas well even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there\r\nis no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do\r\nremember hearing my father say that Neptune was angry with us for\r\nbeing too easy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He said\r\nthat one of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was\r\nreturning from having escorted some one, and bury our city under a\r\nhigh mountain. This is what my used to say, but whether the god will\r\ncarry out his threat or no is a matter which he will decide for\r\nhimself.\r\n"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering,\r\nand in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples\r\nthemselves, and of their cities- who were hostile, savage and\r\nuncivilized, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell\r\nus also why you are made unhappy on hearing about the return of the\r\nArgive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them\r\ntheir misfortunes in order that future generations might have\r\nsomething to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your\r\nwife\'s when you were before Troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law- which\r\nare the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood?\r\nor was it some brave and kindly-natured comrade- for a good friend\r\nis as dear to a man as his own brother?"'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK IX.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"AND ULYSSES answered, \"King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a\r\nbard with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better\r\nor more delightful than when a whole people make merry together,\r\nwith the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded\r\nwith bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his\r\ncup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see.\r\nNow, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows,\r\nand rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how\r\nto begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand\r\nof heaven has been laid heavily upon me.\r\n\"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it,\r\nand one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my there\r\nguests though I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son\r\nof Laertes, reknowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so\r\nthat my fame ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a\r\nhigh mountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from\r\nit there is a group of islands very near to one another- Dulichium,\r\nSame, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the\r\nhorizon, all highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the\r\nothers lie away from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it\r\nbreeds brave men, and my eyes know none that they better love to\r\nlook upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and\r\nwanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess\r\nCirce; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there is\r\nnothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, and\r\nhowever splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be far\r\nfrom father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I will\r\ntell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove's will I met\r\nwith on my return from Troy.\r\n\"When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which\r\nis the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the\r\npeople to the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we\r\ndivided equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to\r\ncomplain. I then said that we had better make off at once, but my\r\nmen very foolishly would not obey me, so they stayed there drinking\r\nmuch wine and killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea\r\nshore. Meanwhile the Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons who\r\nlived inland. These were more in number, and stronger, and they were\r\nmore skilled in the art of war, for they could fight, either from\r\nchariots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, therefore,\r\nthey came as thick as leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of\r\nheaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. They set the\r\nbattle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed their\r\nbronze-shod spears at one another. So long as the day waxed and it was\r\nstill morning, we held our own against them, though they were more\r\nin number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the time when men\r\nloose their oxen, the Cicons got the better of us, and we lost half\r\na dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those that\r\nwere left.\r\n\"Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have\r\nescaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till\r\nwe had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by\r\nthe hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us\r\ntill it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick\r\nclouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships\r\nrun before the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to\r\ntatters, so we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our\r\nhardest towards the land. There we lay two days and two nights\r\nsuffering much alike from toil and distress of mind, but on the\r\nmorning of the third day we again raised our masts, set sail, and took\r\nour places, letting the wind and steersmen direct our ship. I should\r\nhave got home at that time unharmed had not the North wind and the\r\ncurrents been against me as I was doubling Cape Malea, and set me\r\noff my course hard by the island of Cythera.\r\n\"I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the\r\nsea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eater,\r\nwho live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to\r\ntake in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore\r\nnear the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company\r\nto see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they\r\nhad a third man under them. They started at once, and went about among\r\nthe Lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the\r\nlotus, which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring\r\nabout home, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened\r\nto them, but were for staying and munching lotus with the\r\nLotus-eater without thinking further of their return; nevertheless,\r\nthough they wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and made\r\nthem fast under the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board at\r\nonce, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting\r\nto get home, so they took their places and smote the grey sea with\r\ntheir oars.\r\n\"We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the\r\nland of the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither\r\nplant nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat,\r\nbarley, and grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their\r\nwild grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them.\r\nThey have no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on\r\nthe tops of high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and\r\nthey take no account of their neighbours.\r\n\"Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not\r\nquite close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is\r\noverrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are\r\nnever disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen- who as a rule will\r\nsuffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices- do not\r\ngo there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a\r\nwilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no living\r\nthing upon it but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor\r\nyet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore\r\ngo from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another's country as\r\npeople who have ships can do; if they had had these they would have\r\ncolonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yield\r\neverything in due season. There are meadows that in some places come\r\nright down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious\r\ngrass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land for\r\nploughing, and it would always yield heavily at harvest time, for\r\nthe soil is deep. There is a good harbour where no cables are\r\nwanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to\r\ndo is to beach one's vessel and stay there till the wind becomes\r\nfair for putting out to sea again. At the head of the harbour there is\r\na spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars\r\ngrowing all round it.\r\n\"Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must\r\nhave brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick\r\nmist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of\r\nclouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked\r\nfor it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in\r\nshore before we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however,\r\nwe had beached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and\r\ncamped upon the beach till daybreak.\r\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admired\r\nthe island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove's daughters\r\nroused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On\r\nthis we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and\r\ndividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven\r\nsent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got\r\nnine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day\r\nto the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we had\r\nplenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full\r\nwhen we sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out.\r\nWhile we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of\r\nthe Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble\r\nfires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of\r\ntheir sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark,\r\nwe camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.\r\n\"'Stay here, my brave fellows,' said I, 'all the rest of you,\r\nwhile I go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see\r\nif they are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane race.'\r\n\"I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the\r\nhawsers; so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their\r\noars. When we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face\r\nof a cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It\r\nwas a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there\r\nwas a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built\r\ninto the ground and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode\r\nof a huge monster who was then away from home shepherding his\r\nflocks. He would have nothing to do with other people, but led the\r\nlife of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like a human being at\r\nall, but resembling rather some crag that stands out boldly against\r\nthe sky on the top of a high mountain.\r\n\"I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were,\r\nall but the twelve best among them, who were to go along with\r\nmyself. I also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been\r\ngiven me by Maron, Apollo son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo\r\nthe patron god of Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of\r\nthe temple. When we were sacking the city we respected him, and spared\r\nhis life, as also his wife and child; so he made me some presents of\r\ngreat value- seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with\r\ntwelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite\r\nflavour. Not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but only\r\nhimself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed\r\ntwenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the\r\nmixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from\r\ndrinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full\r\nof provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to\r\ndeal with some savage who would be of great strength, and would\r\nrespect neither right nor law.\r\n\"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went\r\ninside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks\r\nwere loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens\r\ncould hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the\r\nhoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very\r\nyoung ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all\r\nthe vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming\r\nwith whey. When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them\r\nfirst steal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they\r\nwould then return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board\r\nand sail away with them. It would have been indeed better if we had\r\ndone so but I would not listen to them, for I wanted to see the\r\nowner himself, in the hope that he might give me a present. When,\r\nhowever, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal with.\r\n\"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others\r\nof them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his\r\nsheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry\r\nfirewood to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such\r\na noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear\r\nat the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes\r\ninside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving\r\nthe males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he\r\nrolled a huge stone to the mouth of the cave- so huge that two and\r\ntwenty strong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it from\r\nits place against the doorway. When he had so done he sat down and\r\nmilked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of\r\nthem have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside\r\nin wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that he\r\nmight drink it for his supper. When he had got through with all his\r\nwork, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said:\r\n\"'Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do\r\nyou sail the as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every\r\nman's hand against you?'\r\n\"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and\r\nmonstrous form, but I managed to say, 'We are Achaeans on our way home\r\nfrom Troy, but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have\r\nbeen driven far out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son\r\nof Atreus, who has won infinite renown throughout the whole world,\r\nby sacking so great a city and killing so many people. We therefore\r\nhumbly pray you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise make us\r\nsuch presents as visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellency\r\nfear the wrath of heaven, for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes\r\nall respectable travellers under his protection, for he is the avenger\r\nof all suppliants and foreigners in distress.'\r\n\"To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 'you\r\nare a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me,\r\nindeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do\r\nnot care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so\r\nmuch stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your\r\ncompanions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for\r\ndoing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you\r\ncame on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off\r\nthe land?'\r\n\"He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught\r\nin that way, so I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent my\r\nship on to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it.\r\nWe were driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who are\r\nwith me escaped the jaws of death.'\r\n\"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a\r\nsudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down\r\nupon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were\r\nshed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then\r\nhe tore them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up\r\nlike a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails,\r\nwithout leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our\r\nhands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know\r\nwhat else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch,\r\nand had washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk,\r\nhe stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep,\r\nand went to sleep. I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it,\r\nand drive it into his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we\r\nshould all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift the\r\nstone which the monster had put in front of the door. So we stayed\r\nsobbing and sighing where we were till morning came.\r\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he again\r\nlit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then\r\nlet each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with\r\nall his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them\r\nfor his morning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the\r\nstone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put\r\nit back again- as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid\r\non to a quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted,\r\nand cried 'Shoo, shoo,' after his sheep to drive them on to the\r\nmountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and\r\ncovering myself with glory.\r\n\"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. The\r\nCyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;\r\nit was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it\r\nfor a staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we\r\ncould only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of\r\nlarge burden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this\r\nclub and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the\r\nmen and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they\r\nproceeded to do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring\r\nthe end in the fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it\r\nunder dung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told the\r\nmen to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself to\r\nlift it and bore it into the monster's eye while he was asleep. The\r\nlot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myself\r\nmade five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and\r\ndrove his flocks into the cave- this time driving them all inside, and\r\nnot leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken\r\nhim, or a god must have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put\r\nthe stone back to its place against the door, he sat down, milked\r\nhis ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her\r\nown young one; when he had got through with all this work, he\r\ngripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them. So I went\r\nup to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:\r\n\"'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great deal\r\nof man's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see\r\nwhat kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to\r\nyou as a drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion\r\nupon me and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go\r\non ramping and raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed\r\nyourself; how can you expect people to come see you any more if you\r\ntreat them in this way?'\r\n\"He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the\r\ntaste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be so\r\nkind,' he said, 'as to give me some more, and tell me your name at\r\nonce. I want to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We\r\nhave wine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the\r\nsun ripens them, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.'\r\n\"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,\r\nand three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when\r\nI saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as\r\nplausibly as I could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it\r\nyou; give me, therefore, the present you promised me; my name is\r\nNoman; this is what my father and mother and my friends have always\r\ncalled me.'\r\n\"But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comrades\r\nbefore Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the\r\npresent that I will make him.'\r\nAs he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the\r\nground. His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took\r\nhold upon him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and\r\nthe gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was\r\nvery drunk. Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat\r\nit, and encouraged my men lest any of them should turn\r\nfaint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze,\r\nI drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round\r\nme, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. We drove the\r\nsharp end of the beam into the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with\r\nall my weight I kept turning it round and round as though I were\r\nboring a hole in a ship's plank with an auger, which two men with a\r\nwheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even\r\nthus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood\r\nbubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam\r\nfrom the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the\r\nroots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe\r\nor hatchet into cold water to temper it- for it is this that gives\r\nstrength to the iron- and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even\r\nthus did the Cyclops' eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his\r\nhideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but\r\nhe plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and\r\nhurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so\r\nto the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so\r\nthey gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him\r\ncrying, and asked what was the matter with him.\r\n\"'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a\r\nnoise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from\r\nbeing able to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep?\r\nSurely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?\r\n\"But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, 'Noman is\r\nkilling me by fraud! Noman is killing me by force!'\r\n\"'Then,' said they, 'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill;\r\nwhen Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had\r\nbetter pray to your father Neptune.'\r\n\"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my\r\nclever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,\r\nfelt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the\r\ndoor; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of\r\nit to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be\r\nfoolish enough to attempt this.\r\n\"As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save\r\nmy own life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as\r\none who knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very\r\ngreat. In the end I deemed that this plan would be the best. The\r\nmale sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I\r\nbound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on\r\nwhich the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under\r\nthe middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so\r\nthat there were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram\r\nfiner than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back,\r\nesconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and flung on\r\npatiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all\r\nthe time.\r\n\"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came,\r\nbut when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the\r\nmale sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about\r\nthe pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting;\r\nbut their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the\r\nsheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out\r\nthat the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was going\r\nout, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my\r\ncrafty self; Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:\r\n\"'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave\r\nthis morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead\r\nthe mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and\r\nare the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of\r\nall. Is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are\r\nsorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him\r\ndown in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If\r\nyou could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is\r\nhiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all\r\nover the cave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm a\r\nthis no-good Noman has done me.'\r\n\"As spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way\r\nout from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly,\r\nand then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat,\r\nby constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to\r\ndrive them down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those\r\nof us who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the\r\nCyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding and\r\nfrowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all\r\nthe sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard,\r\ntook their places, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then,\r\nwhen I had got as far out as my voice would reach, I began to jeer\r\nat the Cyclops.\r\n\"'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of your\r\nman before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up\r\nyour visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin\r\nwould find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished\r\nyou.'\r\n\"He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top\r\nfrom off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so\r\nthat it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The\r\nsea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it\r\nraised carried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the\r\nshore. But I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making\r\nsigns to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for their\r\nlives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far\r\nas we were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men\r\nbegged and prayed of me to hold my tongue.\r\n\"'Do not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough to provoke this savage\r\ncreature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove\r\nus back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the\r\ndeath of us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would\r\nhave pounded our heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with the\r\nrugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a\r\nlong way.'\r\n\"But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my\r\nrage, 'Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out\r\nand spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son\r\nof Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.'\r\n\"On this he groaned, and cried out, 'Alas, alas, then the old\r\nprophecy about me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one\r\ntime, a man both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus,\r\nwho was an excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the\r\nCyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me\r\nsome day, and said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I\r\nhave been all along expecting some one of imposing presence and\r\nsuperhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant\r\nweakling, who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in\r\nmy drink; come here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to\r\nshow my hospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward on your\r\njourney- for Neptune and I are father and son. He, if he so will,\r\nshall heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can do.'\r\n\"Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and\r\nsending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more\r\nthan Neptune to cure that eye of yours.'\r\n\"On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and\r\nprayed, saying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own\r\ntrue-begotten son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home\r\nalive; or if he must get back to his friends at last, let him do so\r\nlate and in sore plight after losing all his men [let him reach his\r\nhome in another man's ship and find trouble in his house.']\r\n\"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a\r\nrock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with\r\nprodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a\r\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock\r\nfell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on\r\nour way towards the shore of the island.\r\n\"When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our\r\nships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting\r\nour return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on\r\nto the sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops' sheep, and divided\r\nthem equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to\r\ncomplain. As for the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it\r\nas an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its\r\nthigh bones to Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my\r\nsacrifice, and only thought how he might destroy my ships and my\r\ncomrades.\r\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we\r\nfeasted our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and\r\nit came on dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of\r\nmorning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I bade my men on board and\r\nloose the hawsers. Then they took their places and smote the grey\r\nsea with their oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, but\r\nglad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK X.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"THENCE we went on to the Aeoli island where lives Aeolus son of\r\nHippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as\r\nit were) upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,\r\nAeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry\r\nthe daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,\r\nfeasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long\r\nthe atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting\r\nmeats till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on\r\ntheir well-made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the\r\nblankets. These were the people among whom we had now come.\r\n\"Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the\r\ntime about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I\r\ntold him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must\r\ngo, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of\r\ndifficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a\r\nprime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut\r\nup in the hide as in a sack- for Jove had made him captain over the\r\nwinds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his\r\nown pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so\r\ntightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind\r\ncould blow from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did\r\nhe alone let blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were\r\nlost through our own folly.\r\n\"Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our\r\nnative land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could\r\nsee the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell\r\ninto a light sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own\r\nhands, that we might get home the faster. On this the men fell to\r\ntalking among themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and silver\r\nin the sack that Aeolus had given me. 'Bless my heart,' would one turn\r\nto his neighbour, saying, 'how this man gets honoured and makes\r\nfriends to whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he\r\nis taking home from Troy, while we, who have travelled just as far\r\nas he has, come back with hands as empty as we set out with- and now\r\nAeolus has given him ever so much more. Quick- let us see what it\r\nall is, and how much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave\r\nhim.'\r\n\"Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,\r\nwhereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that\r\ncarried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I\r\nawoke, and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on\r\nand make the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay\r\ndown in the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce\r\nwinds bore our fleet back to the Aeolian island.\r\n\"When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined\r\nhard by the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of\r\nmy men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him\r\nfeasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the\r\nthreshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, 'Ulysses,\r\nwhat brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took\r\ngreat pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever\r\nit was that you wanted to go to.'\r\n\"Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, 'My men have\r\nundone me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend\r\nme this mischief, for you can if you will.'\r\n\"I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their\r\nfather answered, 'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the\r\nisland; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for\r\nyou come here as one abhorred of heaven. \"And with these words he sent\r\nme sorrowing from his door.\r\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long\r\nand fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them.\r\nSix days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached\r\nthe rocky stronghold of Lamus- Telepylus, the city of the\r\nLaestrygonians, where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and\r\ngoats [to be milked] salutes him who is driving out his flock [to\r\nfeed] and this last answers the salute. In that country a man who\r\ncould do without sleep might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of\r\ncattle, and another as a shepherd, for they work much the same by\r\nnight as they do by day.\r\n\"When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep\r\ncliffs, with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took\r\nall their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for\r\nthere was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was\r\nalways dead calm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a\r\nrock at the very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock to\r\nreconnoitre, but could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, only\r\nsome smoke rising from the ground. So I sent two of my company with an\r\nattendant to find out what sort of people the inhabitants were.\r\n\"The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the\r\npeople draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till\r\npresently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch\r\nwater, and who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She\r\nwas going to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their\r\nwater, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who\r\nthe king of that country might be, and over what kind of people he\r\nruled; so she directed them to her father's house, but when they got\r\nthere they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,\r\nand they were horrified at the sight of her.\r\n\"She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of\r\nassembly, and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up\r\none of them, and began to make his dinner off him then and there,\r\nwhereon the other two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they\r\ncould. But Antiphates raised a hue and cry after them, and thousands\r\nof sturdy Laestrygonians sprang up from every quarter- ogres, not men.\r\nThey threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though they had been\r\nmere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching up\r\nagainst one another, and the death cries of my men, as the\r\nLaestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eat\r\nthem. While they were thus killing my men within the harbour I drew my\r\nsword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to row with alf\r\ntheir might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid out\r\nfor their lives, and we were thankful enough when we got into open\r\nwater out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. As for the others\r\nthere was not one of them left.\r\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we\r\nhad lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe\r\nlives a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician\r\nAeetes- for they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is\r\ndaughter to Oceanus. We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a\r\nword, for some god guided us thither, and having landed we there for\r\ntwo days and two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning\r\nof the third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from\r\nthe ship to reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human\r\nhandiwork, or hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a\r\nhigh look-out I espied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwards\r\namid a dense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether,\r\nhaving seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more,\r\nbut in the end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men\r\ntheir dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.\r\n\"When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my\r\nsolitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my\r\npath. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the\r\nriver, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck\r\nhim in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went\r\nclean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went\r\nout of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound,\r\nand laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted\r\nthem into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the\r\nfour feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung him\r\nround my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for\r\nthe stag was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my\r\nshoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of\r\nthe ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each\r\nof them. 'Look here my friends,' said I, 'we are not going to die so\r\nmuch before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve\r\nso long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.' On this\r\nthey uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag,\r\nfor he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their\r\neyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to\r\ncook him for dinner.\r\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we\r\nstayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went\r\ndown and it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child\r\nof morning, fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said,\r\n'My friends, we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to\r\nme. We have no idea where the sun either sets or rises, so that we\r\ndo not even know East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless,\r\nwe must try and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as\r\nhigh as I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to\r\nthe horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising\r\nfrom out of a thick forest of trees.'\r\n\"Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they\r\nhad been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage\r\nogre Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was\r\nnothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies\r\nand set a captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I\r\ntook command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and\r\nthe lot fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men,\r\nand they wept, as also did we who were left behind.\r\n\"When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut\r\nstones, on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the\r\nforest. There were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round\r\nit- poor bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments\r\nand drugged into subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged\r\ntheir great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly\r\nagainst them. As hounds crowd round their master when they see him\r\ncoming from dinner- for they know he will bring them something- even\r\nso did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men,\r\nbut the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.\r\nPresently they reached the gates of the goddess's house, and as they\r\nstood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully\r\nas she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of\r\nsuch dazzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave. On this\r\nPolites, whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men,\r\nsaid, 'There is some one inside working at a loom and singing most\r\nbeautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and see\r\nwhether she is woman or goddess.'\r\n\"They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade\r\nthem enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except\r\nEurylochus, who suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she had\r\ngot them into her house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed\r\nthem a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian but she drugged\r\nit with wicked poisons to make them forget their homes, and when\r\nthey had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand,\r\nand shut them up in her pigsties. They were like pigs-head, hair,\r\nand all, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses were the\r\nsame as before, and they remembered everything.\r\n\"Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some\r\nacorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back\r\nto tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with\r\ndismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do\r\nso; his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at\r\nlast we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had\r\nhappened to the others.\r\n\"'We went,' said he, as you told us, through the forest, and in\r\nthe middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a\r\nplace that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she\r\nwas a goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men\r\nshouted to her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened\r\nthe door, and invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief\r\nso they followed her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for I\r\nthought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them\r\nno more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time\r\nwatching for them.'\r\n\"Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I\r\nalso took my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and show me\r\nthe way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke\r\npiteously, saying, 'Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me\r\nstay here, for I know you will not bring one of them back with you,\r\nnor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot\r\nescape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may still\r\nsave our lives.'\r\n\"'Stay where you are, then, 'answered I, 'eating and drinking at the\r\nship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.'\r\n\"With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through\r\nthe charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress\r\nCirce, I met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in\r\nthe hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his\r\nface. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, 'My\r\npoor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top,\r\nalone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe's\r\npigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not\r\nfancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never\r\nget back and will have to stay there with the rest of them. But\r\nnever mind, I will protect you and get you out of your difficulty.\r\nTake this herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep it about you\r\nwhen you go to Circe's house, it will be a talisman to you against\r\nevery kind of mischief.\r\n\"'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will\r\ntry to practise upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and\r\nshe will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be\r\nable to charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you\r\nwill prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it.\r\nWhen Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring\r\nupon her as though you were goings to kill her. She will then be\r\nfrightened and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must\r\nnot point blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions\r\nfree, and to take good care also of yourself, but you make her swear\r\nsolemnly by all the blessed that she will plot no further mischief\r\nagainst you, or else when she has got you naked she will unman you and\r\nmake you fit for nothing.'\r\n\"As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed me\r\nwhat it was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as\r\nmilk; the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but\r\nthe gods can do whatever they like.\r\n\"Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded\r\nisland; but I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was\r\nclouded with care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood\r\nthere and called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came\r\ndown, opened the door, and asked me to come in; so I followed her-\r\nmuch troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid\r\nwith silver, there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed a\r\nmess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for she\r\nmeant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it\r\nwithout its charming me, she struck she, struck me with her wand.\r\n'There now,' she cried, 'be off to the pigsty, and make your lair with\r\nthe rest of them.'\r\n\"But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,\r\nwhereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke\r\npiteously, saying, 'Who and whence are you? from what place and people\r\nhave you come? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?\r\nNever yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I\r\ngave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than\r\nthe bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some\r\nday with his ship while on his way home form Troy; so be it then;\r\nsheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends\r\nand learn to trust each other.'\r\n\"And I answered, 'Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with\r\nyou when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that\r\nyou have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to\r\ngo to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I\r\nshall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will\r\nfirst take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.'\r\n\"So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had\r\ncompleted her oath then I went to bed with her.\r\n\"Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about\r\ntheir work. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and\r\nof the holy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a\r\nfair purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it.\r\nAnother brought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them with\r\nbaskets of gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a\r\nsilver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth\r\nshe brought in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a\r\ngood fire which she had lighted. When the water in the cauldron was\r\nboiling, she poured cold into it till it was just as I liked it, and\r\nthen she set me in a bath and began washing me from the cauldron about\r\nthe head and shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of my\r\nlimbs. As soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil,\r\nshe arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richly\r\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under my\r\nfeet. A maid servant then brought me water in a beautiful golden\r\newer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands, and\r\nshe drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought me bread\r\nand offered me many things of what there was in the house, and then\r\nCirce bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what was\r\nbefore me, still moody and suspicious.\r\n\"When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,\r\nshe came to me and said, 'Ulysses, why do you sit like that as\r\nthough you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both\r\nmeat and drink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not\r\nto be, for I have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.'\r\n\"And I said, 'Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can\r\nthink of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set\r\nhis friends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and\r\ndrink, you must free my men and bring them to me that I may see them\r\nwith my own eyes.'\r\n\"When I had said this she went straight through the court with her\r\nwand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. My men came out like\r\nso many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about\r\namong them and anointed each with a second drug, whereon the\r\nbristles that the bad drug had given them fell off, and they became\r\nmen again, younger than they were before, and much taller and better\r\nlooking. They knew me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and\r\nwept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of their\r\nhullabalooing, and Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came\r\nup to me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once\r\nto the sea where you have left your ship, and first draw it on to\r\nthe land. Then, hide all your ship's gear and property in some cave,\r\nand come back here with your men.'\r\n\"I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the\r\nmen at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me\r\nthe silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break\r\nout and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home\r\nto be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead\r\nresounds with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though\r\nthey had got back to their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born\r\nand bred. 'Sir,' said the affectionate creatures, 'we are as glad to\r\nsee you back as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all\r\nabout the fate of our comrades.'\r\n\"I spoke comfortingly to them and said, 'We must draw our ship on to\r\nthe land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave;\r\nthen come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house,\r\nwhere you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst\r\nof great abundance.'\r\n\"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus\r\ntried to hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are,\r\nwhat will become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of\r\nCirce, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall\r\nhave to keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us\r\nwhen our comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It\r\nwas all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'\r\n\"When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the\r\nkeen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in\r\nspite of his being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded\r\nfor him and said, 'Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and\r\nmind the ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe's house.'\r\n\"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind\r\nafter all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe\r\nreprimand that I had given him.\r\n\"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left\r\nbehind were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given\r\nthem woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all\r\ncomfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each\r\nother face to face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried\r\naloud till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me\r\nand said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men to leave off\r\ncrying; I know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how\r\nill you have fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is\r\nover now, so stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as\r\nstrong and hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you\r\nare weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking\r\nof the hardships- you have suffered during your travels, so that you\r\nhave no more cheerfulness left in you.'\r\n\"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a\r\nwhole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and\r\nwine. But when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long\r\ndays had come round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is time\r\nyou began to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared\r\nto see your house and native country at all.'\r\n\"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong\r\nday to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine,\r\nbut when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves\r\ndown to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got\r\ninto bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess\r\nlistened to what I had got to say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please to keep\r\nthe promise you made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I\r\nwant to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering me with\r\ntheir complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.'\r\n\"And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall\r\nnone of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is\r\nanother journey which you have got to take before you can sail\r\nhomewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine\r\nto consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias whose\r\nreason is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his\r\nunderstanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit about\r\naimlessly.'\r\n\"I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and\r\nwould gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but\r\npresently when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I\r\nsaid, 'And who shall guide me upon this voyage- for the house of Hades\r\nis a port that no ship can reach.'\r\n\"'You will want no guide,' she answered; 'raise you mast, set your\r\nwhite sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there\r\nof itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you\r\nwill reach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves\r\nof tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach\r\nyour ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark\r\nabode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers\r\nPyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx)\r\nflow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two\r\nroaring rivers run into one another.\r\n\"'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a\r\ncubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a\r\ndrink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then\r\nwine, and in the third place water-sprinkling white barley meal over\r\nthe whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble\r\nghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will\r\nsacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load\r\nthe pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that\r\nTeiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all\r\nyour flocks.\r\n\"'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers,\r\noffer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards\r\nErebus; but yourself turn away from them as though you would make\r\ntowards the river. On this, many dead men's ghosts will come to you,\r\nand you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just\r\nkilled, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades\r\nand to Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to\r\nprevent any other poor ghost from coming near the split blood before\r\nTeiresias shall have answered your questions. The seer will\r\npresently come to you, and will tell you about your voyage- what\r\nstages you are to make, and how you are to sail the see so as to reach\r\nyour home.'\r\n\"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she\r\ndressed me in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful\r\nlight gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden\r\ngirdle round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I\r\nwent about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke\r\nkindly to each of them man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here any\r\nlonger,' said I to them, 'we must be going, for Circe has told me\r\nall about it.' And this they did as I bade them.\r\n\"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure.\r\nWe had with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable\r\nfor sense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top\r\naway from the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool.\r\nWhen he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a\r\nsudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so he\r\ntumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul went\r\ndown to the house of Hades.\r\n\"When I had got the men together I said to them, 'You think you\r\nare about to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that\r\ninstead of this, we have got to go to the house of Hades and\r\nProserpine to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.'\r\n\"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw\r\nthemselves on the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did\r\nnot mend matters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and\r\nlamenting our fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made\r\nthem fast hard by the ship. She passed through the midst of us without\r\nour knowing it, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if\r\nthe god does not wish to be seen?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XI.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"THEN, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into\r\nthe water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep\r\non board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind.\r\nCirce, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew\r\ndead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the time\r\nwell filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear and\r\nlet her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails\r\nwere full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went\r\ndown and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep\r\nwaters of the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the\r\nCimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays\r\nof the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down\r\nagain out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long\r\nmelancholy night. When we got there we beached the ship, took the\r\nsheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came\r\nto the place of which Circe had told us.\r\n\"Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my\r\nsword and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering\r\nto all the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and\r\nthirdly with water, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the\r\nwhole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promising\r\nthem that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren\r\nheifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with good\r\nthings. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a\r\nblack sheep to himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayed\r\nsufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let\r\nthe blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts came trooping up\r\nfrom Erebus- brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil,\r\nmaids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been\r\nkilled in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they\r\ncame from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange\r\nkind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw\r\nthem coming I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the\r\ntwo dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the same\r\ntime to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I sat where I\r\nwas with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless ghosts\r\ncome near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my questions.\r\n\"The first ghost 'that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he\r\nhad not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body\r\nunwaked and unburied in Circe's house, for we had had too much else to\r\ndo. I was very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: 'Elpenor,'\r\nsaid I, 'how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness?\r\nYou have here on foot quicker than I have with my ship.'\r\n\"'Sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my own\r\nunspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe's\r\nhouse, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase\r\nbut fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul down to\r\nthe house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have\r\nleft behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father\r\nwho brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is the\r\none hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that\r\nwhen you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean\r\nisland. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you,\r\nor I may bring heaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whatever\r\narmour I have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell\r\npeople in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant\r\nover my grave the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and with\r\nmy messmates.' And I said, 'My poor fellow, I will do all that you\r\nhave asked of me.'\r\n\"Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the\r\none side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the\r\nghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then\r\ncame the ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I\r\nhad left her alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when\r\nI saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come\r\nnear the blood till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.\r\n\"Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden\r\nsceptre in his hand. He knew me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son of\r\nLaertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down\r\nto visit the dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and\r\nwithdraw your sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your\r\nquestions truly.'\r\n\"So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of\r\nthe blood he began with his prophecy.\r\n\"You want to know,' said he, 'about your return home, but heaven\r\nwill make this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the\r\neye of Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for\r\nhaving blinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home\r\nif you can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship\r\nreaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and\r\ncattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything.\r\nIf you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting\r\nhome, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm\r\nthem, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and\r\nof your men. Even though you may yourself escape, you will return in\r\nbad plight after losing all your men, [in another man's ship, and\r\nyou will find trouble in your house, which will be overrun by\r\nhigh-handed people, who are devouring your substance under the pretext\r\nof paying court and making presents to your wife.\r\n\"'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and\r\nafter you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you\r\nmust take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a\r\ncountry where the people have never heard of the sea and do not even\r\nmix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships, and\r\noars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain\r\ntoken which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and\r\nwill say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your\r\nshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a\r\nram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune. Then go home and offer hecatombs\r\nto an the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death\r\nshall come to you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very\r\ngently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your people\r\nshall bless you. All that I have said will come true].'\r\n\"'This,' I answered, 'must be as it may please heaven, but tell me\r\nand tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother's ghost close by\r\nus; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am\r\nher own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir,\r\nhow I can make her know me.'\r\n\"'That,' said he, 'I can soon do Any ghost that you let taste of the\r\nblood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not\r\nlet them have any blood they will go away again.'\r\n\"On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for\r\nhis prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was\r\nuntil my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once\r\nand spoke fondly to me, saying, 'My son, how did you come down to this\r\nabode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for\r\nthe living to see these places, for between us and them there are\r\ngreat and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no man can\r\ncross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all\r\nthis time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never\r\nyet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?'\r\n\"'Mother,' said I, 'I was forced to come here to consult the ghost\r\nof the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the\r\nAchaean land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing\r\nbut one long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I\r\nset out with Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight\r\nthe Trojans. But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?\r\nDid you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy\r\npassage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the son whom\r\nI left behind me; is my property still in their hands, or has some one\r\nelse got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it?\r\nTell me again what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is;\r\ndoes she live with my son and guard my estate securely, or has she\r\nmade the best match she could and married again?'\r\n\"My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but she\r\nis in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both\r\nnight and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property,\r\nand Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain\r\nlargely, as of course he must, considering his position as a\r\nmagistrate, and how every one invites him; your father remains at\r\nhis old place in the country and never goes near the town. He has no\r\ncomfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in\r\nfront of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in\r\nsummer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the\r\nvineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground. He\r\ngrieves continually about your never having come home, and suffers\r\nmore and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this\r\nwise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house,\r\nnor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear\r\npeople out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing\r\nand the force of my affection for you- this it was that was the\r\ndeath of me.'\r\n\"Then I tried to find some way of embracing my mother's ghost.\r\nThrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but\r\neach time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom,\r\nand being touched to the quick I said to her, 'Mother, why do you\r\nnot stay still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms\r\naround one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our\r\nsorrows even in the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a\r\nstill further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom\r\nonly?'\r\n\"'My son,' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not\r\nProserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when\r\nthey are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;\r\nthese perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has\r\nleft the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now,\r\nhowever, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note\r\nall these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.'\r\n\"Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the\r\nwives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in\r\ncrowds about the blood, and I considered how I might question them\r\nseverally. In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the\r\nkeen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all\r\ndrinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other, and\r\neach one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage.\r\n\"The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of\r\nCretheus the son of Aeolus. She fell in love with the river Enipeus\r\nwho is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she\r\nwas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her\r\nlover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave\r\narched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god,\r\nwhereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.\r\nWhen the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in\r\nhis own and said, 'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the\r\ngods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time\r\ntwelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go\r\nhome, but hold your tongue and do not tell any one.'\r\n\"Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias\r\nand Neleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might.\r\nPelias was a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other\r\nlived in Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely,\r\nAeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.\r\n\"Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of\r\nhaving slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two\r\nsons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates,\r\nand built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they\r\ncould not hold Thebes till they had walled it.\r\n\"Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove\r\nindomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,\r\nand married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.\r\n\"I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king OEdipodes whose awful lot\r\nit was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her\r\nafter having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole\r\nstory to the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief\r\nfor the spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house\r\nof the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the\r\navenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother- to his ruing\r\nbitterly thereafter.\r\n\"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having\r\ngiven priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion\r\nson of Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos.\r\nShe bore Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that\r\nmarvellously lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country\r\nround; but Neleus would only give her to him who should raid the\r\ncattle of Iphicles from the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a\r\nhard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a certain\r\nexcellent seer, but the will of heaven was against him, for the\r\nrangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless\r\nwhen a full year had passed and the same season came round again,\r\nIphicles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of\r\nheaven. Thus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished.\r\n\"And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous\r\nsons, Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both\r\nthese heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive,\r\nfor by a special dispensation of Jove, they die and come to life\r\nagain, each one of them every other day throughout all time, and\r\nthey have the rank of gods.\r\n\"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace\r\nof Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were\r\nshort lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this\r\nworld, and the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years\r\nold they were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the\r\nchest. They threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried\r\nto set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the\r\ntop of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would\r\nhave done it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto,\r\nkilled both of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair\r\nupon their cheeks or chin.\r\n\"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the\r\nmagician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens,\r\nbut he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her\r\nin the island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.\r\n\"I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own\r\nhusband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name\r\nevery single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw,\r\nand it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew,\r\nor here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.\"\r\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and\r\nspeechless throughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:\r\n\"What do you think of this man, O Phaecians? Is he not tall and good\r\nlooking, and is he not Clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of\r\nyou share in the distinction. Do not he a hurry to send him away,\r\nnor niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great\r\nneed, for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.\"\r\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men\r\namong them, \"My friends,\" said he, \"what our august queen has just\r\nsaid to us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be\r\npersuaded by it; but the decision whether in word or deed rests\r\nultimately with King Alcinous.\"\r\n\"The thing shall be done,\" exclaimed Alcinous, \"as surely as I still\r\nlive and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious\r\nto get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until\r\nto-morrow, by which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum\r\nthat I mean to give him. As regards- his escort it will be a matter\r\nfor you all, and mine above all others as the chief person among you.\"\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to\r\nstay here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way,\r\nloaded with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would\r\nredound greatly to my advantage, for I should return fuller-handed\r\nto my own people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all\r\nwho see me when I get back to Ithaca.\"\r\n\"Ulysses,\" replied Alcinous, \"not one of us who sees you has any\r\nidea that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many\r\npeople going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very\r\nhard to see through them, but there is a style about your language\r\nwhich assures me of your good disposition. Moreover you have told\r\nthe story of your own misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though\r\nyou were a practised bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether\r\nyou saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same time\r\nwith yourself, and perished there. The evenings are still at their\r\nlongest, and it is not yet bed time- go on, therefore, with your\r\ndivine story, for I could stay here listening till to-morrow\r\nmorning, so long as you will continue to tell us of your adventures.\"\r\n\"Alcinous,\" answered Ulysses, \"there is a time for making\r\nspeeches, and a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so\r\ndesire, I will not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of\r\nthose of my comrades who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but\r\nperished on their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.\r\n\"When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all\r\ndirections, the ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up tome,\r\nsurrounded by those who had perished with him in the house of\r\nAegisthus. As soon as he had tasted the blood he knew me, and\r\nweeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me;\r\nbut he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept and\r\npitied him as I beheld him. 'How did you come by your death,' said\r\nI, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against\r\nyou when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you on\r\nthe mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or\r\nwhile they were fighting in defence of their wives and city?'\r\n\"'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, was not lost at\r\nsea in any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me\r\nupon the mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death\r\nof me between them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then\r\nbutchered me most miserably as though I were a fat beast in a\r\nslaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like sheep\r\nor pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of\r\nsome great nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either\r\nin a general engagement, or in single combat, but you never saw\r\nanything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in that\r\ncloister, with the mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying all\r\nabout, and the ground reeking with our-blood. I heard Priam's daughter\r\nCassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I lay\r\ndying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands to\r\nkill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she\r\nwould not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there\r\nis nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman when she\r\nhas fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her own\r\nhusband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by my children\r\nand my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on\r\nherself and all women who shall come after- even on the good ones.'\r\n\"And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first\r\nto last in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of us\r\nfell for Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched\r\nmischief against too during your absence.'\r\n\"'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be too friendly\r\neven with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly\r\nwell yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about\r\nthe rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for\r\nPenelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We\r\nleft her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out\r\nfor Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man's estate,\r\nand he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one\r\nanother as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did\r\nnot even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed\r\nme ere I could do so. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to your\r\nheart- do not tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca,\r\nbut steal a march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting\r\nwomen. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news\r\nof my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at\r\nSparta with Menelaus- for I presume that he is still living.'\r\n\"And I said, 'Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether\r\nyour son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does\r\nnot know.'\r\n\"As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the\r\nghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax\r\nwho was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the\r\nson of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke\r\npiteously, saying, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring\r\nwill you undertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades\r\namong us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no\r\nmore?'\r\n\"And I said, 'Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the\r\nAchaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me\r\nabout my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to\r\nget near the Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have\r\nbeen in trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever\r\nyet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were\r\nadored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you\r\nare here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore,\r\ntake it so much to heart even if you are dead.'\r\n\"'Say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; I would rather\r\nbe a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than\r\nking of kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he gone\r\nto the wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me\r\nalso if you have heard anything about my father Peleus- does he\r\nstill rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect\r\nthroughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail\r\nhim? Could I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same\r\nstrength that I had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the\r\nplain of Troy- could I but be as I then was and go even for a short\r\ntime to my father's house, any one who tried to do him violence or\r\nsupersede him would soon me it.'\r\n\"'I have heard nothing,' I answered, 'of Peleus, but I can tell\r\nyou all about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from\r\nScyros with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was\r\nalways first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I\r\nwere the only two who could surpass him; and when it came to\r\nfighting on the plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body\r\nof his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in\r\nvalour. Many a man did he kill in battle- I cannot name every single\r\none of those whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives,\r\nbut will only say how he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of\r\nTelephus, who was the handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many\r\nothers also of the Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman's\r\nbribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the Argives went inside\r\nthe horse that Epeus had made, and it was left to me to settle when we\r\nshould either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it, though\r\nall the other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying\r\ntheir eyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn pale\r\nnor wipe a tear from his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break\r\nout from the horse- grasping the handle of his sword and his\r\nbronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the foe. Yet when we had\r\nsacked the city of Priam he got his handsome share of the prize\r\nmoney and went on board (such is the fortune of war) without a wound\r\nupon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for the\r\nrage of Mars is a matter of great chance.'\r\n\"When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a\r\nmeadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning\r\nthe prowess of his son.\r\n\"The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own\r\nmelancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof-\r\nstill angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about\r\nthe armour of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the\r\nTrojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never\r\ngained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who\r\nwas foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in\r\nstature and prowess.\r\n\"When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will you\r\nnot forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about\r\nthat hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear\r\nenough to lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We\r\nmourned you as much as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself,\r\nnor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which Jove bore\r\nagainst the Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your\r\ndestruction- come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into\r\nsubjection, and hear what I can tell you.'\r\n\"He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other\r\nghosts; nevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of\r\nhis being so angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only that\r\nthere were still others among the dead whom I desired to see.\r\n\"Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand\r\nsitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting\r\nand standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his\r\nsentences upon them.\r\n\"After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the\r\nghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and\r\nhe had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\r\n\"And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and\r\ncovering some nine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him\r\nwere digging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat\r\nthem off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove's\r\nmistress Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.\r\n\"I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake\r\nthat reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could\r\nnever reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to\r\ndrink, it dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry\r\nground- parched by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees,\r\nmoreover, that shed their fruit over his head- pears, pomegranates,\r\napples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature\r\nstretched out his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back\r\nagain to the clouds.\r\n\"And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone\r\nwith both his hands. With hands and feet he' tried to roll it up to\r\nthe top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over\r\non to the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and the\r\npitiless stone would come thundering down again on to the plain.\r\nThen he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran\r\noff him and the steam rose after him.\r\n\"After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for\r\nhe is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to\r\nwife, who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming\r\nround him like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as\r\nnight with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,\r\nglaring around as though ever on the point of taking aim. About his\r\nbreast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous\r\nfashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there\r\nwas also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what\r\nhe might, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew\r\nme at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, my poor\r\nUlysses, noble son of Laertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind\r\nof life that I did when I was above ground? I was son of Jove, but I\r\nwent through an infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman to one\r\nwho was far beneath me- a low fellow who set me all manner of labours.\r\nHe once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound- for he did not think\r\nhe could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound\r\nout of Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped\r\nme.'\r\n\"On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I\r\nstayed where I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come\r\nto me. And I should have seen still other of them that are gone\r\nbefore, whom I would fain have seen- Theseus and Pirithous glorious\r\nchildren of the gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me\r\nand uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest\r\nProserpine should send up from the house of Hades the head of that\r\nawful monster Gorgon. On this I hastened back to my ship and ordered\r\nmy men to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so they\r\nembarked and took their places, whereon the ship went down the\r\nstream of the river Oceanus. We had to row at first, but presently a\r\nfair wind sprang up."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XII.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"\"AFTER we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into\r\nthe open sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there\r\nis dawn and sunrise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to\r\nthe sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep\r\nand waited till day should break.\r\n\"Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I\r\nsent some men to Circe's house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut\r\nfirewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and\r\nafter we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral\r\nrites. When his body and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised\r\na cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the\r\noar that he had been used to row with.\r\n\"While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got\r\nback from the house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast\r\nas she could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread,\r\nmeat, and wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said, 'You\r\nhave done a bold thing in going down alive to the house of Hades,\r\nand you will have died twice, to other people's once; now, then,\r\nstay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with\r\nyour voyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will\r\ntell Ulysses about your course, and will explain everything to him\r\nso as to prevent your suffering from misadventure either by land or\r\nsea.'\r\n\"We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong\r\nday to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came\r\non dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables\r\nof the ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away\r\nfrom the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all\r\nabout our adventures.\r\n\"'So far so good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now pay\r\nattention to what I am about to tell you- heaven itself, indeed,\r\nwill recall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens\r\nwho enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too\r\nclose and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children\r\nwill never welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and\r\nwarble him to death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great\r\nheap of dead men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still\r\nrotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your\r\nmen's ears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you\r\ncan listen yourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you\r\nstand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must\r\nlash the rope's ends to the mast itself, that you may have the\r\npleasure of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose you,\r\nthen they must bind you faster.\r\n\"'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you\r\ncoherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; I will\r\nlay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them for\r\nyourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against\r\nwhich the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the\r\nblessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird\r\nmay pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father\r\nJove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father\r\nJove has to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever\r\nyet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves and\r\nwhirlwinds of fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies\r\nof dead men. The only vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the\r\nfamous Argo on her way from the house of Aetes, and she too would have\r\ngone against these great rocks, only that Juno piloted her past them\r\nfor the love she bore to Jason.\r\n\"'Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost\r\nin a dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never\r\nclear not even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty\r\nhands and twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for\r\nit runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the\r\nmiddle of it there is a large cavern, looking West and turned\r\ntowards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is so\r\nhigh up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it.\r\nInside it Scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be\r\nthat of a young hound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no\r\none- not even a god- could face her without being terror-struck. She\r\nhas twelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the most prodigious\r\nlength; and at the end of each neck she has a frightful head with\r\nthree rows of teeth in each, all set very close together, so that they\r\nwould crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep within\r\nher shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,\r\nfishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can\r\ncatch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever\r\nyet got past her without losing some men, for she shoots out all her\r\nheads at once, and carries off a man in each mouth.\r\n\"'You will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so close\r\ntogether that there is not more than a bowshot between them. [A\r\nlarge fig tree in full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies the\r\nsucking whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she\r\nvomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down again; see\r\nthat you be not there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune\r\nhimself could not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive\r\nship by as fast as you can, for you had better lose six men than\r\nyour whole crew.'\r\n\"'Is there no way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at the\r\nsame time keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?'\r\n\"'You dare-devil,' replied the goddess, you are always wanting to\r\nfight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten\r\neven by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is\r\nsavage, extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is no help for\r\nit; your best chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can,\r\nfor if you dawdle about her rock while you are putting on your armour,\r\nshe may catch you with a second cast of her six heads, and snap up\r\nanother half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full\r\nspeed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla's dam, bad\r\nluck to her; she will then stop her from making a second raid upon\r\nyou.\r\n\"'You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will\r\nsee many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god-\r\nseven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in\r\neach flock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, and\r\nthey are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who are\r\nchildren of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she\r\nhad borne them and had done suckling them sent them to the\r\nThrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and look\r\nafter their father's flocks and herds. If you leave these flocks\r\nunharmed, and think of nothing but getting home, you may yet after\r\nmuch hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn\r\nyou of the destruction both of your ship and of your comrades; and\r\neven though you may yourself escape, you will return late, in bad\r\nplight, after losing all your men.'\r\n\"Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,\r\nwhereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to\r\nloose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, took\r\ntheir places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars.\r\nPresently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a\r\nfair wind that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping our\r\nsails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear,\r\nand let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.\r\n\"Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, 'My friends,\r\nit is not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies\r\nthat Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so\r\nthat whether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she\r\nsaid we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most\r\nbeautifully in a field of flowers; but she said I might hear them\r\nmyself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind me to\r\nthe crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright,\r\nwith a bond so fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash the\r\nrope's ends to the mast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me\r\nfree, then bind me more tightly still.'\r\n\"I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we\r\nreached the island of the two Sirens, for the wind had been very\r\nfavourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a\r\nbreath of wind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the\r\nsails and stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the\r\nwater with the foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large\r\nwheel of wax and cut it up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax\r\nin my strong hands till it became soft, which it soon did between\r\nthe kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I\r\nstopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to\r\nthe mast as I stood upright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowing\r\nthemselves. When we had got within earshot of the land, and the ship\r\nwas going at a good rate, the Sirens saw that we were getting in shore\r\nand began with their singing.\r\n\"'Come here,' they sang, 'renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean\r\nname, and listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without\r\nstaying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song- and he who\r\nlistens will go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know\r\nall the ills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before\r\nTroy, and can tell you everything that is going to happen over the\r\nwhole world.'\r\n\"They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear\r\nthem further I made by frowning to my men that they should set me\r\nfree; but they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes\r\nbound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of\r\nthe Sirens' voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and\r\nunbound me.\r\n\"Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave\r\nfrom which spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men\r\nwere so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the\r\nwhole sea resounded with the rushing of the waters, but the ship\r\nstayed where it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round,\r\ntherefore, and exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.\r\n\"'My friends,' said I, 'this is not the first time that we have been\r\nin danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the\r\nCyclops shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise\r\ncounsel saved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as\r\nwell. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on\r\nwith might and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders;\r\nattend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from\r\nthese steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the\r\nslip and be over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be\r\nthe death of us.'\r\n\"So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful\r\nmonster Scylla, for I knew the men would not on rowing if I did, but\r\nwould huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey\r\nCirce's strict instructions- I put on my armour. Then seizing two\r\nstrong spears I took my stand on the ship Is bows, for it was there\r\nthat I expected first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my\r\nmen so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I\r\nstrained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over\r\n\"Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one\r\nhand was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up\r\nthe salt water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a\r\ncauldron when it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray\r\nreached the top of the rocks on either side. When she began to suck\r\nagain, we could see the water all inside whirling round and round, and\r\nit made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could\r\nsee the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the\r\nmen were at their wit's ends for fear. While we were taken up with\r\nthis, and were expecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced\r\ndown suddenly upon us and snatched up my six best men. I was looking\r\nat once after both ship and men, and in a moment I saw their hands and\r\nfeet ever so high above me, struggling in the air as Scylla was\r\ncarrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one last\r\ndespairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some\r\njutting rock throws bait into the water to deceive the poor little\r\nfishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with which his spear is\r\nshod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches them one by\r\none- even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on her rock and\r\nmunch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and\r\nstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the\r\nmost sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.\r\n\"When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and\r\nterrible Charybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god,\r\nwhere were the goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun\r\nHyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing\r\nas they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I\r\nremembered what the blind Theban prophet Teiresias had told me, and\r\nhow carefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of the\r\nblessed sun-god. So being much troubled I said to the men, 'My men,\r\nI know you are hard pressed, but listen while I tell you the\r\nprophecy that Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe warned\r\nme to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for it was here, she\r\nsaid, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship, therefore,\r\naway from the island.'\r\n\"The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me\r\nan insolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very\r\nstrong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,\r\nand now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,\r\nyou will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this\r\nisland, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on\r\nthrough the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the winds\r\nblow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one of\r\nthose sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so often\r\nwreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now,\r\ntherefore, let us obey the of night and prepare our supper here hard\r\nby the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board again and put out\r\nto sea.'\r\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that\r\nheaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me to yield, for you\r\nare many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his\r\nsolemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock\r\nof sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either,\r\nbut will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.'\r\n\"They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their\r\noath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of\r\nfresh water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon\r\nas they had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about\r\ntheir poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set\r\nthem weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound\r\nsleep.\r\n\"In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their\r\nplaces, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that\r\nland and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth\r\nout of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,\r\nappeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein\r\nthe sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men\r\ntogether in council.\r\n\"'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us\r\nmind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for\r\nit; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees\r\nand gives ear to everything. And again they promised that they would\r\nobey.\r\n\"For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and\r\nthere was no other wind, but only South and East. As long as corn\r\nand wine held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were\r\nhungry; when, however, they had eaten all there was in the ship,\r\nthey were forced to go further afield, with hook and line, catching\r\nbirds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands on; for they\r\nwere starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that I might\r\npray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone far\r\nenough to be clear of all my men, and had found a place that was\r\nwell sheltered from the wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all\r\nthe gods in Olympus till by and by they sent me off into a sweet\r\nsleep.\r\n\"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men,\r\n'Listen to me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad\r\nenough but there is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive\r\nin the best of these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the\r\nimmortal Rods? If we ever get back to Ithaca, we can build a fine\r\ntemple to the sun-god and enrich it with every kind of ornament; if,\r\nhowever, he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for these\r\nhomed cattle, and the other gods are of the same mind, I for one would\r\nrather drink salt water once for all and have done with it, than be\r\nstarved to death by inches in such a desert island as this is.'\r\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the\r\ncattle, so fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the\r\nmen, therefore drove in the best of them, and they all stood round\r\nthem saying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of\r\nbarley-meal, for there was no barley left. When they had done\r\npraying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out\r\nthe thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some\r\npieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make\r\ndrink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so they\r\nkept pouring on a little water from time to time while the inward\r\nmeats were being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and\r\nthey had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and put\r\nthe pieces upon the spits.\r\n\"By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the\r\nship and to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast\r\nmeat, so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,' I\r\nexclaimed, 'and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss,\r\nyou have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have\r\nsent me; see what fine work these men of mine have been making in my\r\nabsence.'\r\n\"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had\r\nbeen killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said\r\nto the immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in\r\neverlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship:\r\nthey have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one\r\nthing I loved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down\r\nagain. If they do not square accounts with me about my cows, I will go\r\ndown to Hades and shine there among the dead.'\r\n\"'Sun,' said Jove, 'go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over\r\nthe fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a\r\nbolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.'\r\n\"I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from\r\nthe mouth of Mercury.\r\n\"As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked\r\neach one of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for\r\nthe cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to\r\nshow signs and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled\r\nabout, and the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the\r\nmeat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.\r\n\"For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon\r\nthem, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the\r\nfury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,\r\nspread sail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from the\r\nisland, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn\r\nraised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath\r\nit. We not get on much further, for in another moment we were caught\r\nby a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the\r\nmast so that it fell aft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about at\r\nthe bottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the\r\nhelmsman in the ship's stern, so that the bones of his head were\r\ncrushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving,\r\nwith no more life left in him.\r\n\"Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round\r\nand round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning\r\nstruck it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in\r\nthe water round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the\r\ngod presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again.\r\n\"I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel\r\n(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in\r\nthe direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout\r\nox-thong still hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast and\r\nkeel together, and getting astride of them was carried wherever the\r\nwinds chose to take me.\r\n\"[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got\r\ninto the South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken\r\nback to the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what\r\nactually happened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, and\r\nby sunrise had reacfied the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was\r\nthen sucking down the salt sea water, but I was carried aloft toward\r\nthe fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I\r\ncould not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the\r\nroots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole\r\npool were too high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reach\r\nthem; so I hung patiently on, waiting till the pool should discharge\r\nmy mast and raft again- and a very long while it seemed. A juryman\r\nis not more glad to get home to supper, after having been long\r\ndetained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my raft\r\nbeginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go\r\nwith my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, bard by my raft\r\non to which I then got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla,\r\nthe father of gods and men would not let her get further sight of\r\nme- otherwise I should have certainly been lost.]\r\n\"Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the\r\ngods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and\r\npowerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I\r\nneed say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all\r\nabout it yesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over\r\nagain.\""}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XIII.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THUS did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the\r\ncovered cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently\r\nAlcinous began to speak.\r\n"Ulysses," said he, "now that you have reached my house I doubt\r\nnot you will get home without further misadventure no matter how\r\nmuch you have suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come\r\nhere night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my\r\nbard, I would insist as follows. Our guest has already packed up the\r\nclothes, wrought gold, and other valuables which you have brought\r\nfor his acceptance; let us now, therefore, present him further, each\r\none of us, with a large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup\r\nourselves by the levy of a general rate; for private individuals\r\ncannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present."\r\nEvery one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in\r\nhis own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,\r\nappeared, they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons\r\nwith them. Alcinous went on board and saw everything so securely\r\nstowed under the ship\'s benches that nothing could break adrift and\r\ninjure the rowers. Then they went to the house of Alcinous to get\r\ndinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who is the\r\nlord of all. They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent\r\ndinner, after which the inspired bard, Demodocus, who was a\r\nfavourite with every one, sang to them; but Ulysses kept on turning\r\nhis eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his setting, for he\r\nwas longing to be on his way. As one who has been all day ploughing\r\na fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supper\r\nand is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for it is\r\nall his legs can do to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when the\r\nsun went down, and he at once said to the Phaecians, addressing\r\nhimself more particularly to King Alcinous:\r\n"Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send\r\nme on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart\'s desire by\r\ngiving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I\r\nmay turn to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace\r\namong friends, and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction to\r\nyour wives and children; may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace,\r\nand may no evil thing come among your people."\r\nThus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and\r\nagreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken\r\nreasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant, "Pontonous, mix\r\nsome wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer\r\nto father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way."\r\nPontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the\r\nothers each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed\r\ngods that live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup\r\nin the hands of queen Arete.\r\n"Farewell, queen," said he, "henceforward and for ever, till age and\r\ndeath, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take\r\nmy leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people,\r\nand with king Alcinous."\r\nAs he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to\r\nconduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some\r\nmaid servants with him- one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to\r\ncarry his strong-box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to\r\nthe water side the crew took these things and put them on board,\r\nwith all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a\r\nlinen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the\r\nship. Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but the\r\ncrew took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced\r\nstone to which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing\r\nout to sea, Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike\r\nslumber.\r\nThe ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot\r\nflies over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curveted\r\nas it were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water\r\nseethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a\r\nfalcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her.\r\nThus, then, she cut her way through the water. carrying one who was as\r\ncunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of\r\nall that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the\r\nwaves of the weary sea.\r\nWhen the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to\r\nshow. the ship drew near to land. Now there is in Ithaca a haven of\r\nthe old merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the\r\nline of the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the\r\nstorms of wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within\r\nit, a ship may lie without being even moored. At the head of this\r\nharbour there is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fine\r\noverarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. There\r\nare mixing-bowls within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive\r\nthere. Moreover, there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs\r\nweave their robes of sea purple- very curious to see- and at all times\r\nthere is water within it. It has two entrances, one facing North by\r\nwhich mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes from\r\nthe South and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by\r\nit, it is the way taken by the gods.\r\nInto this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the\r\nplace, She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length\r\non to the shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thing\r\nthey did was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the\r\nship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took\r\nout the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give\r\nhim when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these\r\nall together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for\r\nfear some passer by might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke;\r\nand then they made the best of their way home again.\r\nBut Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already\r\nthreatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove. "Father Jove,"\r\nsaid he, "I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you\r\ngods, if mortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and\r\nblood, show such small regard for me. I said I would Ulysses get\r\nhome when he had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should\r\nnever get home at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head\r\nabout it, and promised that he should do so; but now they have brought\r\nhim in a ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after\r\nloading him with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and\r\nraiment than he would ever have brought back from Troy, if he had\r\nhad his share of the spoil and got home without misadventure."\r\nAnd Jove answered, "What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you\r\ntalking about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It\r\nwould be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as\r\nyou are. As regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in\r\ninsolence and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with\r\nyourself to deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as you\r\nplease."\r\n"I should have done so at once," replied Neptune, "if I were not\r\nanxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore,\r\nI should like to wreck the Phaecian ship as it is returning from its\r\nescort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and I\r\nshould also like to bury their city under a huge mountain."\r\n"My good friend," answered Jove, "I should recommend you at the very\r\nmoment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,\r\nto turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This\r\nwill astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the\r\nmountain."\r\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where\r\nthe Phaecians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making\r\nrapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it into\r\nstone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in\r\nthe ground. After this he went away.\r\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would\r\nturn towards his neighbour, saying, "Bless my heart, who is it that\r\ncan have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port?\r\nWe could see the whole of her only moment ago."\r\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and\r\nAlcinous said, "I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He\r\nsaid that Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one so\r\nsafely over the sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it\r\nwas returning from an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain.\r\nThis was what my old father used to say, and now it is all coming\r\ntrue. Now therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must\r\nleave off giving people escorts when they come here, and in the next\r\nlet us sacrifice twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy\r\nupon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain." When the\r\npeople heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.\r\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaecians to king Neptune,\r\nstanding round his altar; and at the same time Ulysses woke up once\r\nmore upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not\r\nknow it again; moreover, Jove\'s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy\r\nday, so that people might not know of his having come, and that she\r\nmight tell him everything without either his wife or his fellow\r\ncitizens and friends recognizing him until he had taken his revenge\r\nupon the wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different\r\nto him- the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and\r\nthe goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked\r\nupon his native land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his\r\nhands and cried aloud despairingly.\r\n"Alas," he exclaimed, "among what manner of people am I fallen?\r\nAre they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? Where\r\nshall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I\r\nhad stayed over there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to\r\nsome other great chief who would have been good to me and given me\r\nan escort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I\r\ncannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it.\r\nIn good truth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been\r\ndealing fairly by me, and have left me in the wrong country; they said\r\nthey would take me back to Ithaca and they have not done so: may\r\nJove the protector of suppliants chastise them, for he watches over\r\neverybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I suppose I must\r\ncount my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of them."\r\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his\r\nclothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about\r\nnot being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of\r\nthe sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up to\r\nhim disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,\r\nwith a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals\r\non her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad\r\nwhen he saw her, and went straight up to her.\r\n"My friend," said he, "you are the first person whom I have met with\r\nin this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be will\r\ndisposed towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I\r\nembrace your knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell\r\nme, then, and tell me truly, what land and country is this? Who are\r\nits inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of some\r\ncontinent?"\r\nMinerva answered, "Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have\r\ncome from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this\r\nis. It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and\r\nWest. It is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no\r\nmeans a bid island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of\r\ncorn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it\r\nbreeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there\r\nare watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the\r\nname of Ithaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to\r\nbe a long way off from this Achaean country."\r\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own\r\ncountry, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and\r\nmade up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\r\n"I heard of Ithaca," said he, "when I was in Crete beyond the\r\nseas, and now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I\r\nhave left as much more behind me for my children, but am flying\r\nbecause I killed Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in\r\nCrete. I killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had\r\ngot from Troy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of\r\nbattle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served his\r\nfather loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an\r\nindependent ruler, so I lay in wait for him and with one of my\r\nfollowers by the road side, and speared him as he was coming into town\r\nfrom the country. my It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it\r\nwas not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but as soon as I\r\nhad done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were\r\nPhoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis\r\nwhere the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.\r\nThey meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and\r\nwe sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to\r\nget inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though\r\nwe wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we\r\nwere. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goods\r\nout of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon\r\nthe sand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in\r\ngreat distress of mind."\r\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her\r\nhand. Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise,\r\n"He must be indeed a shifty lying fellow," said she, "who could\r\nsurpass you in all manner of craft even though you had a god for\r\nyour antagonist. Dare-devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in\r\ndeceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood,\r\neven now that you are in your own country again? We will say no\r\nmore, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive upon\r\noccasion- you are the most accomplished counsellor and orator among\r\nall mankind, while I for diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among\r\nthe gods. Did you not know Jove\'s daughter Minerva- me, who have\r\nbeen ever with you, who kept watch over you in all your troubles,\r\nand who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you? And now,\r\nagain, I am come here to talk things over with you, and help you to\r\nhide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you\r\nabout the troubles that await you in your own house; you have got to\r\nface them, but tell no one, neither man nor woman, that you have\r\ncome home again. Bear everything, and put up with every man\'s\r\ninsolence, without a word."\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, "A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but\r\nyou are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets\r\nyou it is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This\r\nmuch, however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as\r\nlong as we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on\r\nwhich we went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and\r\nheaven dispersed us- from that day, Minerva, I saw no more of you, and\r\ncannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a\r\ndifficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods\r\ndelivered me from evil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where\r\nyou encouraged me and took me into the town. And now, I beseech you in\r\nyour father\'s name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am\r\nreally back in Ithaca. I am in some other country and you are\r\nmocking me and deceiving me in all you have been saying. Tell me\r\nthen truly, have I really got back to my own country?"\r\n"You are always taking something of that sort into your head,"\r\nreplied Minerva, "and that is why I cannot desert you in your\r\nafflictions; you are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but\r\nyourself on returning from so long a voyage would at once have gone\r\nhome to see his wife and children, but you do not seem to care about\r\nasking after them or hearing any news about them till you have\r\nexploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you,\r\nand having no peace night or day for the tears she sheds on your\r\nbehalf. As for my not coming near you, I was never uneasy about you,\r\nfor I was certain you would get back safely though you would lose\r\nall your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with my uncle Neptune, who\r\nnever forgave you for having blinded his son. I will now, however,\r\npoint out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps\r\nbelieve me. This is the haven of the old merman Phorcys, and here is\r\nthe olive tree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave\r\nsacred to the Naiads;] here too is the overarching cavern in which you\r\nhave offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is\r\nthe wooded mountain Neritum."\r\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared.\r\nThen Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and\r\nkissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the\r\nnymphs, saying, "Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I\r\nwas never again to see you, now therefore I greet you with all\r\nloving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days,\r\nif Jove\'s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to\r\nmanhood."\r\n"Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that," rejoined\r\nMinerva, "let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the\r\ncave, where they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage\r\nit all."\r\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest\r\nhiding places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold,\r\nbronze, and good clothing which the Phaecians had given him. They\r\nstowed everything carefully away, and Minerva set a stone against\r\nthe door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the root of the great\r\nolive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked\r\nsuitors.\r\n"Ulysses," said Minerva, "noble son of Laertes, think how you can\r\nlay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in\r\nyour house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding\r\npresents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence,\r\ngiving hope and sending your encouraging messages to every one of\r\nthem, but meaning the very opposite of all she says\'\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, "In good truth, goddess, it seems I should\r\nhave come to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did,\r\nif you had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall\r\nbest avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my\r\nheart as on the day when we loosed Troy\'s fair diadem from her brow.\r\nHelp me now as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if\r\nyou, goddess, will be with me."\r\n"Trust me for that," said she, "I will not lose sight of you when\r\nonce we set about it, and I would imagine that some of those who are\r\ndevouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their\r\nblood and brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no human\r\nbeing shall know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you\r\nshall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that\r\nshall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes\r\nfor you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the\r\nsuitors, of your wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then\r\ngo at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been\r\nalways well affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and\r\nyour son; you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is\r\ncalled Raven by the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on\r\nbeechmast and spring water after their manner. Stay with him and\r\nfind out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see\r\nyour son, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try\r\nand find out whether you are still alive."\r\n"But why," said Ulysses, "did you not tell him, for you knew all\r\nabout it? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of\r\nhardship while others are eating up his estate?"\r\nMinerva answered, "Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be\r\nwell spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but is\r\nstaying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with\r\nabundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying\r\nin wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I\r\ndo not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who\r\nare now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves."\r\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him\r\nwith wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh\r\nover his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very\r\nfine ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap\r\nabout him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she\r\nalso gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and\r\nfurnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted\r\nthong for him to sling it over his shoulder.\r\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess\r\nwent straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XIV.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'ULYSSES now left the haven, and took the rough track up through\r\nthe wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he\r\nreached the place where Minerva had said that he would find the\r\nswineherd, who was the most thrifty servant he had. He found him\r\nsitting in front of his hut, which was by the yards that he had\r\nbuilt on a site which could be seen from far. He had made them\r\nspacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs all round them;\r\nhe had built them during his master\'s absence, of stones which he\r\nhad gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to Penelope or\r\nLaertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside\r\nthe yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set\r\npretty close together, while inside lie had built twelve sties near\r\none another for the sows to lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in\r\neach sty, all of them breeding sows; but the boars slept outside and\r\nwere much fewer in number, for the suitors kept on eating them, and\r\ndie swineherd had to send them the best he had continually. There were\r\nthree hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman\'s four hounds,\r\nwhich were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. The\r\nswineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals from a good\r\nstout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place\r\nor another, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he had\r\nbeen forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and\r\nhave their fill of meat.\r\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew\r\nat him, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his\r\nhold of the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been\r\ntorn by them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox\r\nhide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the\r\ndogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to\r\nUlysses, "Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work of\r\nyou, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have\r\ngiven me quite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best\r\nof masters, and am in continual grief on his account. I have to attend\r\nswine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the\r\nlight of day, is starving in some distant land. But come inside, and\r\nwhen you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you\r\ncome from, and all about your misfortunes."\r\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit\r\ndown. He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the\r\ntop of this he threw the shaggy chamois skin- a great thick one- on\r\nwhich he used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made\r\nthus welcome, and said "May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods\r\ngrant you your heart\'s desire in return for the kind way in which\r\nyou have received me."\r\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "Stranger, though a still\r\npoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult\r\nhim, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what\r\nyou can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they\r\nhave young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for\r\nheaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always\r\ngood to me and given me something of my own- a house, a piece of land,\r\na good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a\r\nservant who has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have\r\nprospered as they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my\r\nmaster had grown old here he would have done great things by me, but\r\nhe is gone, and I wish that Helen\'s whole race were utterly destroyed,\r\nfor she has been the death of many a good man. It was this matter that\r\ntook my master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the\r\nTrojans in the cause of kin Agamemnon."\r\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the sties\r\nwhere the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he\r\nbrought back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and\r\nspitted on them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set\r\nit before Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses\r\nsprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed\r\nwine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told\r\nhim to begin.\r\n"Fall to, stranger," said he, "on a dish of servant\'s pork. The\r\nfat pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or\r\nscruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and\r\nrespect those who do what is lawful and right. Even the fierce\r\nfree-booters who go raiding on other people\'s land, and Jove gives\r\nthem their spoil- even they, when they have filled their ships and got\r\nhome again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement;\r\nbut some god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead\r\nand gone; they will not, therefore, go back to their own homes and\r\nmake their offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate\r\nby force, without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of\r\nheaven, but they sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and they\r\ntake the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly rich. No other\r\ngreat man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he\r\nhad as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had.\r\nThere are twelve herds of cattle upon the mainland, and as many flocks\r\nof sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men\r\nand hired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats.\r\nHere in Ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats on the far end of\r\nthe island, and they are in the charge of excellent goatherds. Each\r\none of these sends the suitors the best goat in the flock every day.\r\nAs for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you see here, and I\r\nhave to keep picking out the best I have and sending it to them."\r\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking\r\nravenously without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten\r\nenough and was satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he\r\nusually drank, filled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was\r\npleased, and said as he took it in his hands, "My friend, who was this\r\nmaster of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich and so\r\npowerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King\r\nAgamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such a\r\nperson. Jove and the other gods know, but I may be able to give you\r\nnews of him, for I have travelled much."\r\nEumaeus answered, "Old man, no traveller who comes here with news\r\nwill get Ulysses\' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless,\r\ntramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of\r\nlies, and not a word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca\r\ngoes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them\r\nin, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions,\r\ncrying all the time as women will when they have lost their\r\nhusbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would\r\ndoubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of\r\nprey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the\r\nsea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand upon\r\nsome foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is\r\nfor all his friends- for me especially; go where I may I shall never\r\nfind so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother\r\nand father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care,\r\nhowever, about my parents now, though I should dearly like to see them\r\nagain in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me\r\nmost; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is here no\r\nlonger, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me that\r\nwhereever he may be I shall always honour his memory."\r\n"My friend," replied Ulysses, "you are very positive, and very\r\nhard of belief about your master\'s coming home again, nevertheless I\r\nwill not merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me\r\nanything for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a\r\nshirt and cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I\r\nwill not take anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I\r\nhate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear\r\nby king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of\r\nUlysses to which I have now come, that all will surely happen as I\r\nhave said it will. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with\r\nthe end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here\r\nto do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife and son."\r\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "Old man, you will\r\nneither get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come\r\nhome; drink you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else.\r\nDo not keep on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any\r\none speaks about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it\r\nalone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father\r\nLaertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about\r\nthis same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade\r\nfare to be no worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some\r\none, either god or man, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone\r\noff to Pylos to try and get news of his father, and the suitors are\r\nlying in wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope of leaving the\r\nhouse of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca. But let us say no more\r\nabout him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the son\r\nof Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man,\r\ntell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you\r\nare and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what\r\nmanner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from\r\nwhat country they professed to come- for you cannot have come by\r\nland."\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, "I will tell you all about it. If there were\r\nmeat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing\r\nto do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I\r\ncould easily talk on for a whole twelve months without ever\r\nfinishing the story of the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to\r\nvisit me.\r\n"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who had\r\nmany sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he\r\nhad purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of\r\nHylax (whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour\r\namong the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his\r\nsons) put me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in\r\nwedlock. When, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons\r\ndivided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave\r\na holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry\r\ninto a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on\r\nthe field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the\r\nstraw you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough\r\nand to spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had\r\npicked my men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave\r\ndeath so much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward and\r\nspear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not\r\ncare about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would\r\nbring up children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and\r\narrows- things that most men shudder to think of; but one man likes\r\none thing and another another, and this was what I was most\r\nnaturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine times\r\nwas I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I amassed\r\nmuch wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance, and\r\nmuch more was allotted to me later on.\r\n"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but\r\nwhen Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many\r\nperished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships\r\nto Troy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our\r\ndoing so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we\r\nsacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us.\r\nThen it was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month\r\nhappily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the\r\nidea of making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and\r\nmanned it. I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them.\r\nFor six days I and my men made feast, and I found them many victims\r\nboth for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on the\r\nseventh day we went on board and set sail from Crete with a fair North\r\nwind behind us though we were going down a river. Nothing went ill\r\nwith any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat\r\nwhere we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took\r\nthem. On the fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus; there I\r\nstationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them and\r\nkeep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every\r\npoint of vantage.\r\n"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and\r\nravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their\r\nwives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city,\r\nand when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak\r\ntill the plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the\r\ngleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would\r\nno longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The\r\nEgyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced\r\nlabour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus- and I\r\nwish I had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much\r\nsorrow in store for me- I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my\r\nspear from my hand; then I went straight up to the king\'s chariot,\r\nclasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade\r\nme get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home. Many\r\nmade at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in their\r\nfury, but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the\r\nprotector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.\r\n"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among\r\nthe Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now\r\ngoing on for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning\r\nrascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this\r\nman talked me over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his house\r\nand his possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but\r\nat the end of that time when months and days had gone by till the same\r\nseason had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for\r\nLibya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that\r\nplace, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take the\r\nmoney I fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with\r\nhim, for I could not help it.\r\n"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the\r\nsea that lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled\r\ntheir destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and\r\ncould see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our\r\nship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his\r\nthunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled with\r\nfire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into\r\nthe sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking\r\nlike so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all\r\nchance of getting home again. I was all dismayed; Jove, however,\r\nsent the ship\'s mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung\r\nto it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I\r\ndrift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on\r\nto the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians\r\nentertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all for\r\nhis son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon\r\nhe raised me by the hand, took me to his father\'s house and gave me\r\nclothes to wear.\r\n"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me\r\nhe had entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on\r\nhis homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and\r\nwrought iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep\r\nhis family for ten generations, so much had he left in the house of\r\nking Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he\r\nmight learn Jove\'s mind from the god\'s high oak tree, and know whether\r\nafter so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in\r\nsecret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings\r\nin his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side,\r\nand the crew found, that should take him to his own country. He sent\r\nme off however before Ulysses returned, for there happened to be a\r\nThesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,\r\nand he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely to\r\nKing Acastus.\r\n"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to\r\nthe very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out\r\nfrom land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me\r\nof the shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the\r\ntattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards\r\nnightfall, they reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they\r\nbound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore\r\nto get supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for\r\nme, and having drawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder\r\ninto the sea, where I struck out and swam till I was well clear of\r\nthem, and came ashore near a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They\r\nwere very angry at my having escaped and went searching about for\r\nme, till at last they thought it was no further use and went back to\r\ntheir ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me to\r\na good man\'s door- for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile."\r\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "Poor unhappy stranger, I\r\nhave found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but\r\nthat part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to\r\nbelieve it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this\r\nway? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all of\r\nthem detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let\r\nhim die with friends around him when the days of his fighting were\r\ndone; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes\r\nand his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the storm\r\nwinds have spirited him away we know not whither.\r\n"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to\r\nthe town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news\r\nabout Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those\r\nwho grieve over the king\'s absence, and those who rejoice at it\r\nbecause they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own\r\npart I have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I\r\nwas taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long\r\nway till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He\r\nsaid he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting\r\nhis ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would\r\nreturn in the following summer or autumn with his men, and that he\r\nwould bring back much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man,\r\nsince fate has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter me in\r\nthis way with vain hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall\r\ntreat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the god of\r\nhospitality, as fearing him and pitying you."\r\nUlysses answered, "I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have\r\ngiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make\r\na bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your\r\nmaster comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me\r\nto Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he\r\nwill, set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder\r\nprecepice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the country\r\ntelling lies."\r\n"And a pretty figure I should cut then," replied Eumaeus, both now\r\nand hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut\r\nand showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good\r\nearnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will\r\ncome in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper."\r\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with\r\nthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, and\r\na tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into\r\nthem. But Eumaeus called to his men and said, "Bring in the best pig\r\nyou have, that I may sacrifice for this stranger, and we will take\r\ntoll of him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time\r\nfeeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour."\r\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a\r\nfine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus\r\ndid not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the\r\nfirst thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig\'s face and throw\r\nthem into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that\r\nUlysses might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet\r\nof oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and\r\nstunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they\r\ncut it up, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint\r\non to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid\r\nupon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the\r\npieces upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when\r\nthey had taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in\r\na heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up\r\nto give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he\r\nset apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to\r\nthem as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He\r\ngave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of\r\nespecial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased. "I hope, Eumaeus," said\r\nhe, "that Jove will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the\r\nrespect you are showing to an outcast like myself."\r\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "Eat, my good fellow, and\r\nenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\r\njust as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses."\r\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt\r\nsacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,\r\nput the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own\r\nportion. Mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had\r\nbought this man on his own account from among the Taphians during\r\nhis master\'s absence, and had paid for him with his own money\r\nwithout saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes. They then\r\nlaid their hands upon the good things that were before them, and\r\nwhen they had had enough to eat and drink, Mesaulius took away what\r\nwas left of the bread, and they all went to bed after having made a\r\nhearty supper.\r\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon.\r\nIt poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West,\r\nwhich is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether\r\nEumaeus, in the excellent care he took of him, would take off his\r\nown cloak and give it him, or make one of his men give him one.\r\n"Listen to me," said he, "Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have\r\nsaid a prayer I will tell you something. It is the wine that makes\r\nme talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing;\r\nit will make him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had\r\nbetter leave unspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would\r\nthat I were still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade\r\nbefore Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders, but I was in\r\ncommand also, for the other two would have it so. When we had come\r\nup to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armour and lay\r\nthere under cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about\r\nthe swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow\r\nfell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick\r\nwith rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept\r\ncomfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I had\r\ncarelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be\r\ntoo cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When\r\nthe night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their their\r\nplaces, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and he\r\nat once gave me his ear.\r\n"\'Ulysses,\' said I, \'this cold will be the death of me, for I have\r\nno cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my\r\nshirt, and I do not know what to do.\'\r\n"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the\r\nfollowing plan:\r\n"\'Keep still,\' said he in a low voice, \'or the others will hear\r\nyou.\' Then he raised his head on his elbow.\r\n"\'My friends,\' said he, \'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.\r\nWe are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and\r\ntell Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.\'\r\n"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out\r\nrunning to the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it\r\ncomfortably enough till morning. Would that I were still young and\r\nstrong as I was in those days, for then some one of you swineherds\r\nwould give me a cloak both out of good will and for the respect due to\r\na brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my clothes\r\nare shabby."\r\nAnd Eumaeus answered, "Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\r\nand have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\r\npresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything\r\nelse that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but\r\nto-morrow morning you have to shake your own old rags about your\r\nbody again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here,\r\nbut every man has only one. When Ulysses\' son comes home again he will\r\ngive you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to\r\ngo."\r\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some\r\ngoatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here\r\nUlysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy\r\ncloak that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad\r\nweather.\r\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But\r\nthe swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got\r\nready to go and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his\r\nproperty during his master\'s absence. First he slung his sword over\r\nhis brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He\r\nalso took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case\r\nof attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where\r\nthe pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter\r\nfrom the North wind.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XV.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'BUT Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses\' son\r\nthat he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus\r\nsleeping in the forecourt of Menelaus\'s house; Pisistratus was fast\r\nasleep, but Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his\r\nunhappy father, so Minerva went close up to him and said:\r\n"Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,\r\nnor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they\r\nwill eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been\r\non a fool\'s errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you\r\nwish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back.\r\nHer father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus,\r\nwho has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatly\r\nincreasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been\r\ntaken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are-\r\nthey always want to do the best they can for the man who marries them,\r\nand never give another thought to the children of their first husband,\r\nnor to their father either when he is dead and done with. Go home,\r\ntherefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable\r\nwoman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send\r\nyou a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of another matter which\r\nyou had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying in\r\nwait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean\r\nto kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\r\nsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up\r\nyour property will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and\r\nkeep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches over\r\nyou and protects you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you get\r\nto Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself go\r\nstraight to the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well\r\ndisposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night, and\r\nthen send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from\r\nPylos."\r\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus\r\nwith his heel to rouse him, and said, "Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke\r\nthe horses to the chariot, for we must set off home."\r\nBut Pisistratus said, "No matter what hurry we are in we cannot\r\ndrive in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has\r\nbrought his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him\r\nsay good-bye to us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest\r\nshould never forget a host who has shown him kindness."\r\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,\r\nleaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he\r\nput on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his\r\nshoulders, and went out to meet him. "Menelaus," said he, "let me go\r\nback now to my own country, for I want to get home."\r\nAnd Menelaus answered, "Telemachus, if you insist on going I will\r\nnot detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or\r\ntoo rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a\r\nman go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he\r\nwould like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is\r\nin the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till\r\nI can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have\r\nyourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient\r\ndinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once\r\nmore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting\r\nout on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for\r\nmaking a tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my\r\nhorses, and will conduct you myself through all our principal\r\ncities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will give\r\nus something- a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup."\r\n"Menelaus," replied Telemachus, "I want to go home at once, for when\r\nI came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while\r\nlooking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that\r\nsomething valuable has been stolen during my absence."\r\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants\r\nto prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the\r\nhouse. At this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and\r\nhad just got up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook\r\nsome meat, which he at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his\r\nfragrant store room, not alone, but Helen went too, with\r\nMegapenthes. When he reached the place where the treasures of his\r\nhouse were kept, he selected a double cup, and told his son\r\nMegapenthes to bring also a silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile Helen went\r\nto the chest where she kept the lovely dresses which she had made with\r\nher own hands, and took out one that was largest and most\r\nbeautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star, and\r\nlay at the very bottom of the chest. Then they all came back through\r\nthe house again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said,\r\n"Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely\r\nhome according to your desire. I will now present you with the\r\nfinest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a\r\nmixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,\r\nand it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made\r\nme a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I\r\nwas on my return home. I should like to give it to you."\r\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of\r\nTelemachus, while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and\r\nset it before him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in\r\nher hand.\r\n"I too, my son," said she, "have something for you as a keepsake\r\nfrom the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her\r\nwedding day. Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you;\r\nthus may you go back rejoicing to your own country and to your home."\r\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.\r\nThen Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them\r\nall as he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus\r\ninto the house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid\r\nservant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it\r\ninto a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean\r\ntable beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered\r\nthem many good things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus\r\ncarved the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes\r\npoured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things\r\nthat were before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eat\r\nand drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took\r\ntheir places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner\r\ngateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and\r\nMenelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right\r\nhand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He\r\nstood in front of the horses and pledged them, saying, "Farewell to\r\nboth of you; see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he\r\nwas as kind to me as any father could be while we Achaeans were\r\nfighting before Troy."\r\n"We will be sure, sir," answered Telemachus, "to tell him everything\r\nas soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses\r\nreturned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the\r\nvery great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful\r\npresents I am taking with me."\r\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle with\r\na great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the\r\nfarm yard- and all the men and women were running after it and\r\nshouting. It came quite close up to them and flew away on their\r\nright hands in front of the horses. When they saw it they were glad,\r\nand their hearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said,\r\n"Tell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?"\r\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him\r\nto make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, "I will read this\r\nmatter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it\r\nwill come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was\r\nbred and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having\r\ntravelled far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge- if\r\nindeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors."\r\n"May Jove so grant it," replied Telemachus; "if it should prove to\r\nbe so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I\r\nam at home."\r\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full\r\nspeed through the town towards the open country. They swayed the\r\nyoke upon their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun\r\nset and darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae,\r\nwhere Diocles lived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus.\r\nThere they passed the night and were treated hospitably. When the\r\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their\r\nhorses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through the\r\ninner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then\r\nPisistratus lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing\r\nloath; ere long they came to Pylos, and then Telemachus said:\r\n"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask\r\nyou. You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are\r\nboth of an age, and this journey has brought us together still more\r\nclosely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me\r\nthere, for if I go to your father\'s house he will try to keep me in\r\nthe warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once."\r\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end\r\nhe deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put\r\nMenelaus\'s beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of\r\nthe vessel. Then he said, "Go on board at once and tell your men to do\r\nso also before I can reach home to tell my father. I know how\r\nobstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come down\r\nhere to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he will be\r\nvery angry."\r\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians\r\nand soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together\r\nand gave his orders. "Now, my men," said he, "get everything in\r\norder on board the ship, and let us set out home."\r\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But\r\nas Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva\r\nin the ship\'s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a\r\nseer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was\r\ndescended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep;\r\nhe was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by\r\nthe great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held\r\nthem for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the\r\nhouse of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account\r\nof the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow\r\nthat dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In the end, however, he\r\nescaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged\r\nthe wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to\r\nhis brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos, where it\r\nwas ordained that he should reign over much people. There he\r\nmarried, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates and\r\nMantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of\r\nAmphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he\r\ndid not live to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a\r\nwoman\'s gifts. His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the\r\nother son of Melampus, was father to Polypheides and Cleitus.\r\nAurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus for his beauty\'s sake,\r\nthat he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides\r\nthe greatest seer in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.\r\nHe quarrelled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia, where\r\nhe remained and prophesied for all men.\r\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he\r\nwas making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. "Friend\'" said he,\r\n"now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by\r\nyour sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I\r\npray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell me\r\nthe truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me\r\nalso of your town and parents."\r\nTelemachus said, "I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca,\r\nand my father is \'Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has\r\ncome to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got\r\nmy crew together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been\r\naway a long time."\r\n"I too," answered Theoclymenus, am an exile, for I have killed a man\r\nof my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they\r\nhave great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at\r\ntheir hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the\r\nearth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship\r\nthat they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit."\r\n"I will not refuse you," replied Telemachus, "if you wish to join\r\nus. Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably\r\naccording to what we have."\r\nOn this he received Theoclymenus\' spear and laid it down on the deck\r\nof the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding\r\nTheoclymenus sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers.\r\nTelemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes, and they made all\r\nhaste to do so. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,\r\nraised it and made it fast with the forestays, and they hoisted\r\ntheir white sails with sheets of twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them\r\na fair wind that blew fresh and strong to take the ship on her\r\ncourse as fast as possible. Thus then they passed by Crouni and\r\nChalcis.\r\nPresently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel\r\nmade a quick pass sage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the\r\nEpeans rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,\r\nwondering within himself whether he should escape death or should be\r\ntaken prisoner.\r\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in\r\nthe hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to\r\neat and drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see\r\nwhether he would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay\r\non at the station or pack him off to the city; so he said:\r\n"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin\r\nbegging about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to\r\nyour men. Give me your advice therefore, and let me have a good\r\nguide to go with me and show me the way. I will go the round of the\r\ncity begging as I needs must, to see if any one will give me a drink\r\nand a piece of bread. I should like also to go to the house of Ulysses\r\nand bring news of her husband to queen Penelope. I could then go about\r\namong the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give\r\nme a dinner. I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts\r\nof ways. Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of\r\nMercury who gives grace and good name to the works of all men, there\r\nis no one living who would make a more handy servant than I should- to\r\nput fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and\r\ndo all those services that poor men have to do for their betters."\r\nThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. "Heaven\r\nhelp me," he exclaimed, "what ever can have put such a notion as\r\nthat into your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone\r\nto a certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very\r\nheavens. They would never think of taking a man like you for a\r\nservant. Their servants are all young men, well dressed, wearing\r\ngood cloaks and shirts, with well looking faces and their hair\r\nalways tidy, the tables are kept quite clean and are loaded with\r\nbread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are, then; you are not in\r\nanybody\'s way; I do not mind your being here, no more do any of the\r\nothers, and when Telemachus comes home he will give you a shirt and\r\ncloak and will send you wherever you want to go."\r\nUlysses answered, "I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you\r\nare to me, for having saved me from going about and getting into\r\ntrouble; there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp;\r\nstill, when men have once got low down in the world they will go\r\nthrough a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since\r\nhowever you press me to stay here and await the return of\r\nTelemachus, tell about Ulysses\' mother, and his father whom he left on\r\nthe threshold of old age when he set out for Troy. Are they still\r\nliving or are they already dead and in the house of Hades?"\r\n"I will tell you all about them," replied Eumaeus, "Laertes is still\r\nliving and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house,\r\nfor he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also\r\nabout the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him\r\nmore than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through sorrow\r\nfor her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me\r\ncome to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,\r\nthough she was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking\r\nher how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter\r\nCtimene, the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl\r\ntogether, and she made little difference between us. When, however, we\r\nboth grew up, they sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid\r\ndowry for her. As for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak\r\nwith a pair of sandals for my feet, and sent me off into the\r\ncountry, but she was just as fond of me as ever. This is all over now.\r\nStill it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in the situation\r\nwhich I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can find\r\nsomething for any respectable stranger who comes here; but there is no\r\ngetting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for the house has\r\nfallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want sometimes to see\r\ntheir mistress and have a talk with her; they like to have something\r\nto eat and drink at the house, and something too to take back with\r\nthem into the country. This is what will keep servants in a good\r\nhumour."\r\nUlysses answered, "Then you must have been a very little fellow,\r\nEumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.\r\nTell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and\r\nmother lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off\r\nwhen you were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and\r\nsell you for whatever your master gave them?"\r\n"Stranger," replied Eumaeus, "as regards your question: sit still,\r\nmake yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The\r\nnights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for\r\nsleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed\r\ntill bed time, too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of\r\nthe others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then\r\ntake my master\'s pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.\r\nWe two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one\r\nanother stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered\r\nmuch, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in\r\nrecalling the memory of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards\r\nyour question, then, my tale is as follows:\r\n"You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above\r\nOrtygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in another\r\ndirection. It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,\r\nwith much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine\r\nand wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any\r\nsickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills\r\nthem with his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the\r\nwhole country is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of\r\nOrmenus, a man comparable to the gods, reigned over both.\r\n"Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia\r\n(for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had\r\nfreighted with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician\r\nwoman in my father\'s house, very tall and comely, and an excellent\r\nservant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing\r\nnear their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman\r\ncan resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had\r\nseduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on\r\nthis she told him her father\'s name. \'I come from Sidon,\' said she,\r\n\'and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I\r\nwas coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates\r\nseized me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man\r\nwho owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.\'\r\n"The man who had seduced her then said, \'Would you like to come\r\nalong with us to see the house of your parents and your parents\r\nthemselves? They are both alive and are said to be well off.\'\r\n"\'I will do so gladly,\' answered she, \'if you men will first swear\r\nme a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.\'\r\n"They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed\r\ntheir oath the woman said, \'Hush; and if any of your men meets me in\r\nthe street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some\r\none should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect\r\nsomething. He would put me in prison, and would have all of you\r\nmurdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as\r\nfast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. I will\r\nbring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something\r\nelse also that I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the\r\nson of the good man of the house, a funny little fellow just able to\r\nrun about. I will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great\r\ndeal of money for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.\'\r\n"On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a\r\nwhole year till they had loaded their ship with much precious\r\nmerchandise, and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent\r\nto tell the woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to\r\nmy father\'s house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads\r\nstrung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it in\r\ntheir hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a sign\r\nquietly to the woman and then went back to the ship, whereon she\r\ntook me by the hand and led me out of the house. In the fore part of\r\nthe house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who had\r\nbeen feasting with my father, as being in attendance on him; these\r\nwere now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she snatched\r\nup three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while\r\nI followed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and\r\ndarkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could\r\ntill we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship was lying. When\r\nthey had got on board they sailed their ways over the sea, taking us\r\nwith them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did we sail both\r\nnight and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the woman and she\r\nfell heavily down into the ship\'s hold as though she were a sea gull\r\nalighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and\r\nfishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds\r\nand waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his\r\nchattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon\r\nthis country."\r\nUlysses answered, "Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your\r\nmisfortunes with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given\r\nyou good as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good\r\nmaster, who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you\r\nlead a good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from\r\ncity to city."\r\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left\r\nfor sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemachus and\r\nhis crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the\r\nmast, and rowed the ship into the harbour. They cast out their mooring\r\nstones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea\r\nshore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had\r\nenough to eat and drink Telemachus said, "Take the ship on to the\r\ntown, but leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on\r\none of my farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will\r\ncome down to the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your\r\ntrouble I will give you all a good dinner with meat and wine."\r\nThen Theoclymenus said, \'And what, my dear young friend, is to\r\nbecome of me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to\r\nrepair? or shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?"\r\n"At any other time," replied Telemachus, "I should have bidden you\r\ngo to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at\r\nthe present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I\r\nshall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show\r\nherself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an\r\nupper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose\r\nhouse you can go to- I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held\r\nin the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the\r\nbest man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying\r\ncourt to my mother and trying to take Ulysses\' place. Jove, however,\r\nin heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before\r\nthe marriage takes place."\r\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk,\r\nApollo\'s messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as\r\nit tore them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the\r\nship. On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the\r\nhand. "Telemachus," said he, "that bird did not fly on your right hand\r\nwithout having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew\r\nit was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that\r\nthere will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own."\r\n"I wish it may prove so," answered Telemachus. "If it does, I will\r\nshow you so much good will and give you so many presents that all\r\nwho meet you will congratulate you."\r\nThen he said to his friend Piraeus, "Piraeus, son of Clytius, you\r\nhave throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all\r\nthose who have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this\r\nstranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can\r\ncome for him."\r\nAnd Piraeus answered, "Telemachus, you may stay away as long as\r\nyou please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no\r\nlack of hospitality."\r\nAs he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and\r\nloose the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But\r\nTelemachus bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear\r\nwith a head of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they\r\nloosed the hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards\r\nthe city as they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as\r\nfast as he could, till he reached the homestead where his countless\r\nherds of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent\r\nswineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his master.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XVI.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'MEANWHILE Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and\r\nwere were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent the\r\nmen out with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark,\r\nbut fawned upon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and\r\nnoticing that the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:\r\n"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of\r\nyour acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning urn him and\r\nnot barking."\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the\r\ndoor. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing\r\nwine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his\r\nhead and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not\r\nbe more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old\r\nage, after ten years\' absence in a foreign country and after having\r\ngone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as\r\nthough he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:\r\n"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When\r\nI heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you\r\nany more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good\r\nlook at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into\r\nthe country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town\r\ngenerally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the\r\nsuitors are doing."\r\n"So be it, old friend," answered Telemachus, "but I am come now\r\nbecause I want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still\r\nat her old home or whether some one else has married her, so that\r\nthe bed of Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs."\r\n"She is still at the house," replied Eumaeus, "grieving and breaking\r\nher heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day\r\ncontinually."\r\nAs spoke he took Telemachus\' spear, whereon he crossed the stone\r\nthreshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him\r\nplace as he entered, but Telemachus checked him; "Sit down, stranger."\r\nsaid he, "I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who\r\nwill lay it for me."\r\nUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green\r\nbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for\r\nTelemachus to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of\r\ncold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he\r\nfilled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine\r\nalso in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they\r\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon\r\nas they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,\r\n"Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew\r\nbring him to Ithaca, and who were they?-for assuredly he did not\r\ncome here by land"\'\r\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "My son, I will tell\r\nyou the real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a\r\ngreat traveller. At this moment he is running away from a\r\nThesprotian ship, and has refuge at my station, so I will put him into\r\nyour hands. Do whatever you like with him, only remember that he is\r\nyour suppliant."\r\n"I am very much distressed," said Telemachus, "by what you have just\r\ntold me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet\r\nyoung, and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks\r\nme. My mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and\r\nlook after the house out of respect for public opinion and the\r\nmemory of her husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take\r\nthe best man of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make\r\nher the most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to\r\nyour station I will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a\r\nsword and sandals, and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if\r\nyou like you can keep him here at the station, and I will send him\r\nclothes and food that he may be no burden on you and on your men;\r\nbut I will not have him go near the suitors, for they are very\r\ninsolent, and are sure to ill-treat him in a way that would greatly\r\ngrieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothing\r\nagainst numbers, for they will be too strong for him."\r\nThen Ulysses said, "Sir, it is right that I should say something\r\nmyself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the\r\ninsolent way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a\r\nman as you are. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or\r\nhas some god set your people against you? May you not complain of your\r\nbrothers- for it is to these that a man may look for support,\r\nhowever great his quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are\r\nand in my present mind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed,\r\nUlysses himself, I would rather some one came and cut my head off, but\r\nI would go to the house and be the bane of every one of these men.\r\nIf they were too many for me- I being single-handed- I would rather\r\ndie fighting in my own house than see such disgraceful sights day\r\nafter day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the women\r\nservants about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly,\r\nand bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that shall never be\r\naccomplished."\r\nAnd Telemachus answered, "I will tell you truly everything. There is\r\nno emnity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to\r\nwhom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove\r\nhas made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of\r\nArceisius, and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son\r\nof Ulysses who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have\r\nnever been of any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the\r\nhands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the\r\nneighbouring islands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the\r\nprincipal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the\r\npretext of paying court to my mother, who will neither say point blank\r\nthat she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so they\r\nare making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so with\r\nmyself into the bargain. The issue, however, rests with heaven. But do\r\nyou, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell Penelope that I am safe\r\nand have returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself alone, and then\r\ncome back here without letting any one else know, for there are many\r\nwho are plotting mischief against me."\r\n"I understand and heed you," replied Eumaeus; "you need instruct\r\nme no further, only I am going that way say whether I had not better\r\nlet poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend\r\nthe work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses,\r\nand he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they\r\ntell me that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has\r\nneither eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after\r\nhis farm, but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones."\r\n"More\'s the pity," answered Telemachus, "I am sorry for him, but\r\nwe must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything\r\ntheir own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return\r\nof my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back\r\nagain, and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother\r\nto send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him\r\nhear it from her."\r\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his\r\nsandals, bound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva\r\nwatched him well off the station, and then came up to it in the form\r\nof a woman- fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the\r\nentry, and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see\r\nher, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let\r\nthemselves be seen by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs,\r\nfor they did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other\r\nside of the yards. She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with\r\nher eyebrows; whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the\r\nmain wall of the yards. Then she said to him:\r\n"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell\r\nyour son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans\r\nfor the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will\r\nnot be long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray."\r\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a\r\nfair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him\r\nyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,\r\nfilled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she\r\nwent away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was\r\nastounded when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he\r\nmight be looking upon a god.\r\n"Stranger," said he, "how suddenly you have changed from what you\r\nwere a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your\r\ncolour is not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that\r\nlive in heaven? If so, be propitious to me till I can make you due\r\nsacrifice and offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me."\r\nAnd Ulysses said, "I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am\r\nyour father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the\r\nhands of lawless men."\r\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on\r\nto the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. but\r\nTelemachus could not yet believe that it was his father, and said:\r\n"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain\r\nhopes that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of\r\nhimself contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old\r\nand young at a moment\'s notice, unless a god were with him. A second\r\nago you were old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come\r\ndown from heaven."\r\nUlysses answered, "Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably\r\nastonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will\r\ncome hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and\r\nmuch hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.\r\nWhat you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who\r\ndoes with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At\r\none moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man\r\nwith good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who\r\nlive in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor."\r\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his\r\nfather and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud\r\nlike eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of\r\ntheir half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep,\r\nand the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had\r\nnot suddenly said, "In what ship, my dear father, did your crew\r\nbring you to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be-\r\nfor you cannot have come by land?"\r\n"I will tell you the truth, my son," replied Ulysses. "It was the\r\nPhaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the\r\nhabit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took\r\nme over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca,\r\nafter giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These\r\nthings by heaven\'s mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now\r\ncome here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about\r\nkilling our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the\r\nsuitors, with their number, that I may learn who, and how many, they\r\nare. I can then turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we\r\ntwo can fight the whole body of them ourselves, or whether we must\r\nfind others to help us."\r\nTo this Telemachus answered, "Father, I have always heard of your\r\nrenown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a\r\nvery great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot\r\nstand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor\r\ntwice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at\r\nonce. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they\r\nhave six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young\r\nAchaeans from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them\r\nwell born. They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men\r\nwho can carve at table. If we face such numbers as this, you may\r\nhave bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether\r\nyou cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help\r\nus."\r\n"Listen to me," replied Ulysses, "and think whether Minerva and\r\nher father Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find\r\nsome one else as well."\r\n"Those whom you have named," answered Telemachus, "are a couple of\r\ngood allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they\r\nhave power over both gods and men."\r\n"These two," continued Ulysses, "will not keep long out of the fray,\r\nwhen the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return\r\nhome early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as\r\nbefore. Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised\r\nas a miserable old beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel your\r\nheart against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost\r\nout of the house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond\r\ngently trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not\r\nlisten to you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand.\r\nFurthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, when Minerva shall\r\nput it in my mind, I will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this\r\nyou must collect all the armour that is in the house and hide it in\r\nthe strong store room. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why\r\nyou are removing it; say that you have taken it to be out of the way\r\nof the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses\r\nwent away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this\r\nmore particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to\r\nquarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm\r\nwhich may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms\r\nsometimes tempts people to use them. But leave a sword and a spear\r\napiece for yourself and me, and a couple oxhide shields so that we can\r\nsnatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva will then soon quiet\r\nthese people. There is also another matter; if you are indeed my son\r\nand my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is\r\nwithin the house- neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of\r\nthe servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit the\r\nwomen alone, and let us also make trial of some other of the men\r\nservants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us."\r\n"Father," replied Telemachus, "you will come to know me by and by,\r\nand when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not\r\nthink, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either\r\nof us. Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round of\r\nthe farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be\r\nwasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the\r\nwomen by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I\r\nam not in favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend to\r\nthat later on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will\r\nsupport you."\r\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought\r\nTelemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca.\r\nWhen they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the\r\nland; their servants came and took their armour from them, and they\r\nleft all the presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a\r\nservant to tell Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the country,\r\nbut had sent the ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed\r\nand made unhappy. This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when\r\nthey were both on the same errand of going to tell Penelope. When they\r\nreached the House, the servant stood up and said to the queen in the\r\npresence of the waiting women, "Your son, Madam, is now returned\r\nfrom Pylos"; but Eumaeus went close up to Penelope, and said privately\r\nthat her son had given bidden him tell her. When he had given his\r\nmessage he left the house with its outbuildings and went back to his\r\npigs again.\r\nThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they\r\nwent outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held a\r\ncouncil near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the\r\nfirst to speak.\r\n"My friends," said he, "this voyage of Telemachus\'s is a very\r\nserious matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now,\r\nhowever, let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to\r\nsend after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can."\r\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place\r\nand saw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails,\r\nand putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others,\r\n"We need not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must\r\nhave told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not\r\novertake her.\r\nOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the\r\nship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they\r\nwent up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any\r\none old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of\r\nEupeithes, spoke first.\r\n"Good heavens," said he, "see how the gods have saved this man\r\nfrom destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands\r\nall day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to\r\nsleep, but waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of\r\ncapturing and killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite\r\nof us. Let us consider how we can make an end of him. He must not\r\nescape us; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive,\r\nfor he is very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our\r\nside. We must make haste before he can call the Achaeans in\r\nassembly; he will lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious\r\nwith us, and will tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, but\r\nfailed to take him. The people will not like this when they come to\r\nknow of it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our\r\nown country into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either on his\r\nfarm away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divide\r\nup his property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries\r\nher have the house. If this does not please you, and you wish\r\nTelemachus to live on and hold his father\'s property, then we must not\r\ngather here and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offers\r\nto Penelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man who\r\nwill give the most for her, and whose lot it is to win her."\r\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the\r\nson of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among\r\nall the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of\r\nDulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to\r\nPenelope than that of any of the other for he was a man of good\r\nnatural disposition. "My friends," said he, speaking to them plainly\r\nand in all honestly, "I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It\r\nis a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first\r\ntake counsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will\r\nboth help to kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so;\r\nbut if they dissuade us, I would have you hold your hands."\r\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose\r\nforthwith and went to the house of Ulysses where they took their\r\naccustomed seats.\r\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.\r\nShe knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had\r\noverheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore\r\nto the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors\r\nshe stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the\r\ncloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\r\n"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\r\nspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you\r\nare nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the\r\ndeath of Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness\r\nis Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one\r\nanother. Do you not remember how your father fled to this house in\r\nfear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone\r\nwith some Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at\r\npeace with us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything\r\nhe had, but Ulysses stayed their hands although they were\r\ninfuriated, and now you devour his property without paying for it, and\r\nbreak my heart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his son.\r\nLeave off doing so, and stop the others also."\r\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, "Take heart, Queen\r\nPenelope daughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about\r\nthese matters. The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall\r\nlay hands upon your son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon\r\nthe face of the earth. I say- and it shall surely be- that my spear\r\nshall be reddened with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me\r\non his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat\r\ninto my hands. Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have,\r\nand has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if\r\ndeath comes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it." He said this\r\nto quiet her, but in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.\r\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till\r\nMinerva shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to\r\nUlysses and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old\r\nand were ready; helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva\r\ntherefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke\r\nof her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that\r\nthe swineherd might recognize him and not keep the secret, but go\r\nand tell Penelope.\r\nTelemachus was the first to speak. "So you have got back,\r\nEumaeus," said he. "What is the news of the town? Have the suitors\r\nreturned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my\r\nway home?"\r\n"I did not think of asking about that," replied Eumaeus, "when I was\r\nin the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon\r\nas I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to\r\nPylos, and he was the first to tell the new your mother, but I can say\r\nwhat I saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the\r\nhill of Mercury above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour\r\nwith a number of men in her. They had many shields and spears, and I\r\nthought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure."\r\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus\r\ncould not see him.\r\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they\r\nate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied.\r\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to\r\nrest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XVII.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'WHEN the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\r\nTelemachus bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited\r\nhis hands, for he wanted to go into the city. "Old friend," said he to\r\nthe swineherd, "I will now go to the town and show myself to my\r\nmother, for she will never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As\r\nfor this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let him beg\r\nthere of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I\r\nhave trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other\r\npeople. If this makes him angry so much the worse for him, but I\r\nlike to say what I mean."\r\nThen Ulysses said, "Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can\r\nalways do better in town than country, for any one who likes can\r\ngive him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the\r\nbeck and call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have\r\njust told him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by\r\nthe fire, and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are\r\nwretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with\r\ncold, for you say the city is some way off."\r\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his\r\nrevenge upon the When he reached home he stood his spear against a\r\nbearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the\r\ncloister itself, and went inside.\r\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting\r\nthe fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to\r\nhim; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and\r\nshoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking\r\nlike Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. She\r\nkissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, "Light of my eyes,"\r\nshe cried as she spoke fondly to him, "so you are come home again; I\r\nmade sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of your\r\nhaving gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining\r\nmy consent. But come, tell me what you saw."\r\n"Do not scold me, mother,\' answered Telemachus, "nor vex me,\r\nseeing what a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change\r\nyour dress, go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and\r\nsufficient hecatombs to all the gods if Jove will only grant us our\r\nrevenge upon the suitors. I must now go to the place of assembly to\r\ninvite a stranger who has come back with me from Pylos. I sent him\r\non with my crew, and told Piraeus to take him home and look after\r\nhim till I could come for him myself."\r\nShe heeded her son\'s words, washed her face, changed her dress,\r\nand vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they\r\nwould only vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.\r\nTelemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand-\r\nnot alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him\r\nwith a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as\r\nhe went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in\r\ntheir mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went\r\nto sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his\r\nfather\'s house, and they made him tell them all that had happened to\r\nhim. Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted\r\nthrough the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at\r\nonce joined them. Piraeus was first to speak: "Telemachus," said he,\r\n"I wish you would send some of your women to my house to take awa\r\nthe presents Menelaus gave you."\r\n"We do not know, Piraeus," answered Telemachus, "what may happen. If\r\nthe suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,\r\nI would rather you had the presents than that any of those people\r\nshould get hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them, I\r\nshall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents."\r\nWith these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they\r\ngot there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into\r\nthe baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and\r\nanointed them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their\r\nseats at table. A maid servant then brought them water in a\r\nbeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to\r\nwash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper\r\nservant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what\r\nthere was in the house. Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a\r\ncouch by one of the bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning.\r\nThen they laid their hands on the good things that were before them,\r\nand as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Penelope said:\r\n"Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch,\r\nwhich I have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses\r\nset out for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make\r\nit clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether or\r\nno you had been able to hear anything about the return of your\r\nfather."\r\n"I will tell you then truth," replied her son. "We went to Pylos and\r\nsaw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as\r\nthough I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long\r\nabsence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word\r\nfrom any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. He\r\nsent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw\r\nHelen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in\r\nheaven\'s wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that\r\nhad brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth,\r\nwhereon he said, \'So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man\'s\r\nbed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a\r\nlion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.\r\nThe lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with\r\nthe pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father\r\nJove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was\r\nwhen he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so\r\nheavily that all the Greeks cheered him- if he is still such, and were\r\nto come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry\r\nwedding. As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate nor\r\ndeceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much will I\r\ntell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on an island\r\nsorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was\r\nkeeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no\r\nships nor sailors to take him over the sea.\' This was what Menelaus\r\ntold me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then\r\ngave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again."\r\nWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus\r\nsaid to her:\r\n"Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these\r\nthings; listen therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will\r\nhide nothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness,\r\nand the rites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I\r\nnow come, that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either\r\ngoing about the country or staying in one place, is enquiring into all\r\nthese evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I\r\nsaw an omen when I was on the ship which meant this, and I told\r\nTelemachus about it."\r\n"May it be even so," answered Penelope; "if your words come true,\r\nyou shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who\r\nsee you shall congratulate you."\r\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,\r\nor aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the\r\nhouse, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was\r\nnow time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into\r\nthe town from all the country round, with their shepherds as usual,\r\nthen Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited upon\r\nthem at table, said, "Now then, my young masters, you have had\r\nenough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is\r\nnot a bad thing, at dinner time."\r\nThey left their sports as he told them, and when they were within\r\nthe house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and\r\nthen sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat\r\nand well grown. Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime\r\nUlysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the\r\nswineherd said, "Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town\r\nto-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should\r\nhave liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my\r\nmaster tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from\r\none\'s master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is\r\nnow broad day; it will be night again directly and then you will\r\nfind it colder."\r\n"I know, and understand you," replied Ulysses; "you need say no\r\nmore. Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me\r\nhave it to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one."\r\nAs he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his\r\nshoulders, by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a\r\nstick to his liking. The two then started, leaving the station in\r\ncharge of the dogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led\r\nthe way and his master followed after, looking like some broken-down\r\nold tramp as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in\r\nrags. When they had got over the rough steep ground and were nearing\r\nthe city, they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their\r\nwater. This had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was\r\na grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it,\r\nand the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, while\r\nabove the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all\r\nwayfarers used to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook\r\nthem as he was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the\r\nsuitors\' dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw\r\nEumaeus and Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly\r\nlanguage, which made Ulysses very angry.\r\n"There you go," cried he, "and a precious pair you are. See how\r\nheaven brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray,\r\nmaster swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It\r\nwould make any one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like\r\nthis never won a prize for anything in his life, but will go about\r\nrubbing his shoulders against every man\'s door post, and begging,\r\nnot for swords and cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps not\r\nworth begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my\r\nstation, he might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet\r\nfeed to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased\r\non whey; but he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind\r\nof work; he will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, to\r\nfeed his insatiable belly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be- if\r\nhe goes near Ulysses\' house he will get his head broken by the\r\nstools they will fling at him, till they turn him out."\r\nOn this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure\r\nwantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path.\r\nFor a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill\r\nhim with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains\r\nout; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but\r\nthe swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting\r\nup his hands and praying to heaven as he did so.\r\n"Fountain nymphs," he cried, "children of Jove, if ever Ulysses\r\nburned you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids,\r\ngrant my prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an\r\nend to the swaggering threats with which such men as you go about\r\ninsulting people-gadding all over the town while your flocks are going\r\nto ruin through bad shepherding."\r\nThen Melanthius the goatherd answered, "You ill-conditioned cur,\r\nwhat are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on\r\nboard ship and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and\r\npocket the money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo\r\nwould strike Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors\r\nwould kill him, as I am that Ulysses will never come home again."\r\nWith this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went\r\nquickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he\r\ngot there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite\r\nEurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The\r\nservants brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set\r\nbread before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the\r\nswineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music,\r\nfor Phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses\r\ntook hold of the swineherd\'s hand, and said:\r\n"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter\r\nhow far you go you will find few like it. One building keeps following\r\non after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all\r\nround it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it\r\nwould be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too,\r\nthat there are many people banqueting within it, for there is a\r\nsmell of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods\r\nhave made to go along with feasting."\r\nThen Eumaeus said, "You have perceived aright, as indeed you\r\ngenerally do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will\r\nyou go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind\r\nyou, or will you wait here and let me go in first? But do not wait\r\nlong, or some one may you loitering about outside, and throw something\r\nat you. Consider this matter I pray you."\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, "I understand and heed. Go in first and\r\nleave me here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having\r\nthings thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and\r\nby sea that I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But\r\na man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an\r\nenemy which gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this\r\nthat ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other\r\npeople."\r\nAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised\r\nhis head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had\r\nbred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of\r\nhim. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when\r\nthey went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his\r\nmaster was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow\r\ndung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come\r\nand draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of\r\nfleas. As soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears\r\nand wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When\r\nUlysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear\r\nfrom his eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said:\r\n"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:\r\nhis build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he\r\nonly one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept\r\nmerely for show?"\r\n"This hound," answered Eumaeus, "belonged to him who has died in a\r\nfar country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he\r\nwould soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in\r\nthe forest that could get away from him when he was once on its\r\ntracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead\r\nand gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never do their\r\nwork when their master\'s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes\r\nhalf the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him."\r\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the\r\nsuitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.\r\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned\r\nhim to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat\r\nlying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the\r\nsuitors; he picked it up, brought it to Telemachus\'s table, and sat\r\ndown opposite him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and\r\ngave him bread from the bread-basket.\r\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor\r\nmiserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in\r\nrags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors\r\nleading from the outer to the inner court, and against a\r\nbearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skillfully\r\nplaned, and had made to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took\r\na whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold\r\nin his two hands, and said to Eumaeus, "Take this to the stranger, and\r\ntell him to go the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar\r\nmust not be shamefaced."\r\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, "Stranger, Telemachus sends\r\nyou this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for\r\nbeggars must not be shamefaced."\r\nUlysses answered, "May King Jove grant all happiness to\r\nTelemachus, and fulfil the desire of his heart."\r\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and\r\nlaid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it\r\nwhile the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he\r\nleft off. The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to\r\nUlysses and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the\r\nsuitors, that he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the\r\ngood from the bad; but come what might she was not going to save a\r\nsingle one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going\r\nfrom left to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he\r\nwere a real beggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about\r\nhim, asking one another who he was and where he came from; whereon the\r\ngoatherd Melanthius said, "Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell\r\nyou something about him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd\r\nbrought him here, but I know nothing about the man himself, nor\r\nwhere he comes from."\r\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. "You precious idiot,"\r\nhe cried, "what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not\r\ntramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do\r\nyou think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste\r\nyour master\'s property and must you needs bring this man as well?"\r\nAnd Eumaeus answered, "Antinous, your birth is good but your words\r\nevil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to\r\ninvite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those\r\nwho can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter,\r\nor a bard who can charm us with his Such men are welcome all the world\r\nover, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.\r\nYou are always harder on Ulysses\' servants than any of the other\r\nsuitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as\r\nTelemachus and Penelope are alive and here."\r\nBut Telemachus said, "Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the\r\nbitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse."\r\nThen turning to Antinous he said, "Antinous, you take as much care\r\nof my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to\r\nsee this stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take\'\r\nsomething and give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take\r\nit. Never mind my mother, nor any of the other servants in the\r\nhouse; but I know you will not do what I say, for you are more fond of\r\neating things yourself than of giving them to other people."\r\n"What do you mean, Telemachus," replied Antinous, "by this\r\nswaggering talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I\r\nwill, he would not come here again for another three months."\r\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet\r\nfrom under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses,\r\nbut the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet\r\nwith bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the\r\nthreshold and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up\r\nto Antinous and said:\r\n"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man\r\nhere; you seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you\r\nshould be the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your\r\nbounty. I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own;\r\nin those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who\r\nhe might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and\r\nall the other things which people have who live well and are accounted\r\nwealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with\r\na band of roving robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was\r\nundone by it. I stationed my bade ships in the river Aegyptus, and\r\nbade my men stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent out\r\nscouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\r\n"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and\r\nravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their\r\nwives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city,\r\nand when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak\r\ntill the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the\r\ngleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would\r\nno longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The\r\nEgyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced\r\nlabour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them,\r\nto take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man\r\nin Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery."\r\nThen Antinous said, "What god can have sent such a pestilence to\r\nplague us during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,\r\nor I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence\r\nand importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have\r\ngiven you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy\r\nto be free with other people\'s property when there is plenty of it."\r\nOn this Ulysses began to move off, and said, "Your looks, my fine\r\nsir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house\r\nyou would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for\r\nthough you are in another man\'s, and surrounded with abundance, you\r\ncannot find it in you to give him even a piece of bread."\r\nThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, "You\r\nshall pay for this before you get clear of the court." With these\r\nwords he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right\r\nshoulder-blade near the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a\r\nrock and the blow did not even stagger him, but he shook his head in\r\nsilence as he brooded on his revenge. Then he went back to the\r\nthreshold and sat down there, laying his well-filled wallet at his\r\nfeet.\r\n"Listen to me," he cried, "you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may\r\nspeak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he\r\ngets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle;\r\nand even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable\r\nbelly, which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor\r\nhave gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may\r\ncome to a bad end before his marriage."\r\n"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off\r\nelsewhere," shouted Antinous. "If you say more I will have you dragged\r\nhand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you\r\nalive."\r\nThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young\r\nmen said, "Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a\r\ntramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some\r\ngod- and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as\r\npeople from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who\r\ndo amiss and who righteously."\r\nThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile\r\nTelemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his\r\nfather, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence\r\nand brooded on his revenge.\r\nNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the\r\nbanqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, "Would that Apollo\r\nwould so strike you, Antinous," and her waiting woman Eurynome\r\nanswered, "If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would\r\never again see the sun rise." Then Penelope said, "Nurse, I hate every\r\nsingle one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate\r\nAntinous like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp\r\nhas come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else has\r\ngiven him something to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him\r\non the right shoulder-blade with a footstool."\r\nThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and\r\nin the meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for\r\nthe swineherd and said, "Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come\r\nhere, I want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have\r\ntravelled much, and he may have seen or heard something of my\r\nunhappy husband."\r\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "If these Achaeans,\r\nMadam, would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of\r\nhis adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my\r\nhut, which was the first place he reached after running away from\r\nhis ship, and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes.\r\nIf he had been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world,\r\non whose lips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more\r\ncharmed as I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an\r\nold friendship between his house and that of Ulysses, and that he\r\ncomes from Crete where the descendants of Minos live, after having\r\nbeen driven hither and thither by every kind of misfortune; he also\r\ndeclares that he has heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at\r\nhand among the Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth home\r\nwith him."\r\n"Call him here, then," said Penelope, "that I too may hear his\r\nstory. As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out\r\nas they will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine\r\nremain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume\r\nthem, while they keep hanging about our house day after day\r\nsacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and\r\nnever giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they\r\ndrink. No estate can stand such recklessness, for we have now no\r\nUlysses to protect us. If he were to come again, he and his son\r\nwould soon have their revenge."\r\nAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house\r\nresounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to\r\nEumaeus, "Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son\r\nsneezed just as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the\r\nsuitors are going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape.\r\nFurthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am\r\nsatisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth I shall give him a\r\nshirt and cloak of good wear."\r\nWhen Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said,\r\n"Father stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent\r\nfor you; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you\r\ncan tell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are\r\nspeaking the truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the\r\nvery things that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get\r\nenough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the town, and\r\nletting those give that will."\r\n"I will tell Penelope," answered Ulysses, "nothing but what is\r\nstrictly true. I know all about her husband, and have been partner\r\nwith him in affliction, but I am afraid of passing. through this crowd\r\nof cruel suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just\r\nnow, moreover, as I was going about the house without doing any\r\nharm, a man gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither\r\nTelemachus nor any one else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore,\r\nto be patient and wait till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up\r\nto the fire, for my clothes are worn very thin- you know they are, for\r\nyou have seen them ever since I first asked you to help me- she can\r\nthen ask me about the return of her husband."\r\nThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she\r\nsaw him cross the threshold, "Why do you not bring him here,\r\nEumaeus? Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy\r\nof coming inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced."\r\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, "The stranger is quite\r\nreasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one\r\nelse would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much\r\nbetter, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you\r\ncan hear him and talk to him as you will."\r\n"The man is no fool," answered Penelope, "it would very likely be as\r\nhe says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as\r\nthese men are."\r\nWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for\r\nhe had explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in\r\nhis ear so that none could overhear him, "My dear sir, I will now go\r\nback to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business.\r\nYou will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful to\r\nkeep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove\r\nbring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief."\r\n"Very well," replied Telemachus, "go home when you have had your\r\ndinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are to\r\nsacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me."\r\nOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his\r\ndinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table,\r\nand went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to\r\namuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting on\r\ntowards evening.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                  BOOK XVIII.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'NOW there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all\r\nover the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible\r\nglutton and drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he\r\nwas a great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his\r\nmother gave him, was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called\r\nhim Irus, because he used to run errands for any one who would send\r\nhim. As soon as he came he began to insult Ulysses, and to try and\r\ndrive him out of his own house.\r\n"Be off, old man," he cried, "from the doorway, or you shall be\r\ndragged out neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me\r\nthe wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not\r\nlike to do so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to\r\nblows."\r\nUlysses frowned on him and said, "My friend, I do you no manner of\r\nharm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is\r\nroom enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not\r\ngrudge me things that are not yours to give. You seem to be just\r\nsuch another tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better\r\nluck by and by. Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you\r\nwill incense me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and\r\nchest with blood. I shall have more peace to-morrow if I do, for you\r\nwill not come to the house of Ulysses any more."\r\nIrus was very angry and answered, "You filthy glutton, you run on\r\ntrippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both\r\nhands about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many\r\nboar\'s tusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by\r\nand look on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much\r\nyounger than yourself."\r\nThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in\r\nfront of the doorway, and when Antinous saw what was going on he\r\nlaughed heartily and said to the others, "This is the finest sport\r\nthat you ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this\r\nhouse. The stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight,\r\nlet us set them on to do so at once."\r\nThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two\r\nragged tramps. "Listen to me," said Antinous, "there are some goats\'\r\npaunches down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat,\r\nand set aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to\r\nbe the better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free\r\nof our table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at\r\nall."\r\nThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent,\r\nsaid, "Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot\r\nhold his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges\r\nme on, though I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You\r\nmust swear, however that none of you will give me a foul blow to\r\nfavour Irus and secure him the victory."\r\nThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath\r\nTelemachus put in a word and said, "Stranger, if you have a mind to\r\nsettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here.\r\nWhoever strikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and\r\nthe other chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of\r\nunderstanding, are of the same mind as I am."\r\nEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,\r\nthus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and\r\nhis mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even\r\nstronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one\r\nwould turn towards his neighbour saying, "The stranger has brought\r\nsuch a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing\r\nleft of Irus."\r\nIrus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants\r\ngirded him by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court]\r\nin such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous\r\nscolded him and said, "You swaggering bully, you ought never to have\r\nbeen born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature\r\nas this tramp is. I say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if he\r\nbeats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack you off on\r\nboard ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills\r\nevery one that comes near him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and\r\ndraw out your entrails for the dogs to eat."\r\nThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the\r\nmiddle of the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then\r\nUlysses considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to\r\nmake an end of him then and there, or whether he should give him a\r\nlighter blow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed\r\nit best to give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to\r\nsuspect who he was. Then they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses\r\non the right shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck\r\nunder the ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came\r\ngushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his\r\nteeth and kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up their\r\nhands and nearly died of laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by\r\nthe foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as the\r\ngate-house. There he propped him up against the wall and put his staff\r\nin his hands. "Sit here," said he, "and keep the dogs and pigs off;\r\nyou are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king of\r\nthe beggars any more you shall fare still worse."\r\nThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over\r\nhis shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down\r\nupon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters,\r\nlaughing and saluting him, "May Jove, and all the other gods," said\r\nthey, \'grant you whatever you want for having put an end to the\r\nimportunity of this insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the\r\nmainland presently, to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes\r\nnear him."\r\nUlysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat\'s\r\npaunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two\r\nloaves out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him\r\nas he did so in a golden goblet of wine. "Good luck to you," he\r\nsaid, "father stranger, you are very badly off at present, but I\r\nhope you will have better times by and by."\r\nTo this Ulysses answered, "Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of\r\ngood understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you\r\nare. I have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of\r\nDulichium, a man both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son,\r\nand you appear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and\r\ntake heed to what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures\r\nthat have their being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him\r\nhealth and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm\r\nhereafter, and even when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he\r\nbears it as he needs must, and makes the best of it; for God\r\nAlmighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know all about\r\nit, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the\r\nstubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and\r\nmy brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all\r\nthings always, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him\r\nwithout vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are\r\ndoing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to the\r\nwife, of one who is certain to return some day, and that, too, not\r\nlong hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send you home\r\nquietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of his coming,\r\nfor once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly."\r\nWith these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk\r\nhe put the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked\r\naway serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so\r\nhe did not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him fall by\r\nthe hand of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from\r\nwhich he had come.\r\nThen Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the\r\nsuitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and win\r\nstill further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned a\r\nmocking laugh and said, "Eurynome, I have changed my and have a\r\nfancy to show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should\r\nlike also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything\r\nmore to do with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean\r\nmischief."\r\n"My dear child," answered Eurynome, "all that you have said is true,\r\ngo and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your\r\nface. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is\r\nnot right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus,\r\nwhom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is\r\nalready grown up."\r\n"I know, Eurynome," replied Penelope, "that you mean well, but do\r\nnot try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven\r\nrobbed me of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless,\r\ntell Autonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me\r\nwhen I am in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it\r\nwould not be proper for me to do so."\r\nOn this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to\r\ntheir mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another\r\nmatter, and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on\r\nher couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed\r\ngrace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her.\r\nShe washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears\r\nwhen she goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of a\r\nmore commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter than\r\nsawn ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereon\r\nthe maids came in from the women\'s room and woke Penelope with the\r\nsound of their talking.\r\n"What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having," said\r\nshe, as she passed her hands over her face, "in spite of all my\r\nmisery. I wish Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very\r\nmoment, that I might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my\r\ndear husband, who possessed every kind of good quality and was the\r\nmost distinguished man among the Achaeans."\r\nWith these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but\r\nattended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she\r\nstood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,\r\nholding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on\r\neither side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered\r\nand became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he\r\nmight win her for his own bed fellow.\r\n"Telemachus," said she, addressing her son, "I fear you are no\r\nlonger so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were\r\nyounger you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you\r\nare grown up, though a stranger to look at you would take you for\r\nthe son of a well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go,\r\nyour conduct is by no means what it should be. What is all this\r\ndisturbance that has been going on, and how came you to allow a\r\nstranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What would have\r\nhappened if he had suffered serious injury while a suppliant in our\r\nhouse? Surely this would have been very discreditable to you."\r\n"I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure," replied\r\nTelemachus, "I understand all about it and know when things are not as\r\nthey should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,\r\nhowever, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and\r\nthen another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my\r\nmind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight\r\nbetween Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it\r\nto do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,\r\nMinerva, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these\r\nwooers of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they\r\nmight all be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer\r\ncourt. See how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such\r\na thrashing that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home,\r\nwherever that may be, for has no strength left in him."\r\nThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, "Queen\r\nPenelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos\r\ncould see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in\r\nyour house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman\r\nin the whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of\r\nunderstanding."\r\nTo this Penelope replied, "Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my\r\nbeauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy\r\nand my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after\r\nmy affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence\r\nto the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the\r\nafflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband\r\nforesaw it all, and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in\r\nhis hand- \'Wife, \'he said, \'we shall not all of us come safe home\r\nfrom Troy, for the Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They\r\nare excellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing decides\r\nthe issue of a fight sooner than this. I know not, therefore,\r\nwhether heaven will send me back to you, or whether I may not fall\r\nover there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after things here.\r\nTake care of my father and mother as at present, and even more so\r\nduring my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, then\r\nmarry whom you will, and leave this your present home. This is what he\r\nsaid and now it is all coming true. A night will come when I shall\r\nhave to yield myself to a marriage which I detest, for Jove has\r\ntaken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief, moreover,\r\ncuts me to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me after the\r\ncustom of my country. When men are courting a woman who they think\r\nwill be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when they\r\nare each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and\r\nsheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make her\r\nmagnificent presents, instead of eating up other people\'s property\r\nwithout paying for it."\r\nThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her\r\ntrying to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with\r\nfair words which he knew she did not mean.\r\nThen Antinous said, "Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as\r\nmany presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it\r\nis not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business\r\nnor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among\r\nus whoever he may be."\r\nThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his\r\nservant to bring his present. Antinous\'s man returned with a large and\r\nlovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully\r\nmade brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus\r\nimmediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads\r\nthat gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas\'s two men returned with some\r\nearrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened\r\nmost beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a\r\nnecklace of the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a\r\nbeautiful present of some kind.\r\nThen the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought\r\nthe presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and\r\ndancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it\r\ngrew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give light, and\r\npiled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches\r\nfrom them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses\r\nsaid:\r\n"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the\r\nqueen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and\r\npick wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay\r\ntill morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal."\r\nThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho\r\nbegan to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but\r\nhad been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play\r\nwith, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all\r\nthis she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,\r\nand used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in\r\nlove.\r\n"Poor wretch," said she, "are you gone clean out of your mind? Go\r\nand sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of\r\nchattering here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your\r\nbetters- so many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your\r\nhead, or do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost\r\nyour wits because you beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man\r\nthan he does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack you\r\nbleeding out of the house."\r\n"Vixen," replied Ulysses, scowling at her, "I will go and tell\r\nTelemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb\r\nfrom limb."\r\nWith these words he scared the women, and they went off into the\r\nbody of the house. They trembled all aver, for they thought he would\r\ndo as he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers,\r\nholding up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while on\r\nthings that should surely come to pass.\r\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their\r\ninsolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against\r\nthem; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him,\r\nwhich made the others laugh. "Listen to me," said he, "you suitors\r\nof Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for\r\nnothing that this man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe\r\nthe light has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head-\r\nfor his hair is all gone, every bit of it."\r\nThen turning to Ulysses he said, "Stranger, will you work as a\r\nservant, if I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid?\r\nCan you build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all\r\nthe year round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you\r\ngo, then? Not you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want\r\nto work; you had rather fill your belly by going round the country\r\nbegging."\r\n"Eurymachus," answered Ulysses, "if you and I were to work one\r\nagainst the other in early summer when the days are at their\r\nlongest- give me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let\r\nus see which will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn\r\ntill dark when the mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough\r\nagainst me, let us each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of\r\ngreat strength and endurance: turn me into a four acre field, and\r\nsee whether you or I can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war\r\nwere to break out this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a\r\nhelmet fitting well upon my temples- you would find me foremost in the\r\nfray, and would cease your gibes about my belly. You are insolent\r\nand cruel, and think yourself a great man because you live in a little\r\nworld, ind that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his own again, the\r\ndoors of his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you\r\ntry to fly through them."\r\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried,\r\n"You wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things\r\nto me, and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head\r\nor do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits\r\nbecause you beat the tramp Irus. With this he caught hold of a\r\nfootstool, but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of\r\nDulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right\r\nhand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back,\r\nand his wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the\r\ncovered cloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his\r\nneighbour, saying, "I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad\r\nluck to hide, for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such\r\ndisturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we\r\nshall have no more pleasure at our banquet."\r\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, "Sirs, are you mad? Can\r\nyou not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has\r\npossessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have\r\nhad your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better."\r\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his\r\nspeech; but Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said,\r\n"Do not let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no\r\nanswer. Neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of\r\nUlysses\' servants. Let the cupbearer go round with the\r\ndrink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As for\r\nthe stranger, let us leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to\r\nhis house that he has come."\r\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of\r\nDulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and\r\nwater and handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they\r\nmade their drink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had\r\nmade their drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded,\r\nthey took their several ways each of them to his own abode.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XIX.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'ULYSSES was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby\r\nwith Minerva\'s help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he\r\nsaid to Telemachus, "Telemachus, we must get the armour together and\r\ntake it down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you\r\nhave removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of\r\nthe smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went\r\naway, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more\r\nparticularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\r\nover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may\r\ndisgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes\r\ntempts people to use them."\r\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called\r\nnurse Euryclea and said, "Nurse, shut the women up in their room,\r\nwhile I take the armour that my father left behind him down into the\r\nstore room. No one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has\r\ngot all smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it\r\ndown where the smoke cannot reach it."\r\n"I wish, child," answered Euryclea, "that you would take the\r\nmanagement of the house into your own hands altogether, and look after\r\nall the property yourself. But who is to go with you and light you\r\nto the store room? The maids would have so, but you would not let\r\nthem.\r\n"The stranger," said Telemachus, "shall show me a light; when people\r\neat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from."\r\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their\r\nroom. Then Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets,\r\nshields, and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold\r\nlamp in her hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon\r\nTelemachus said, "Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls,\r\nwith the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest\r\nare all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god here\r\nwho has come down from heaven."\r\n"Hush," answered Ulysses, "hold your peace and ask no questions, for\r\nthis is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here\r\nto talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief\r\nwill ask me all sorts of questions."\r\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the\r\ninner court, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his\r\nbed till morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering\r\non the means whereby with Minerva\'s help he might be able to kill\r\nthe suitors.\r\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana,\r\nand they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near\r\nthe fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had\r\na footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was\r\ncovered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came\r\nfrom the women\'s room to join her. They set about removing the\r\ntables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away\r\nthe bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They\r\nemptied the embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them\r\nto give both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a\r\nsecond time and said, "Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging\r\nabout the house all night and spying upon the women? Be off, you\r\nwretch, outside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven out\r\nwith a firebrand."\r\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, "My good woman, why should\r\nyou be so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my\r\nclothes are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging\r\nabout after the manner of tramps and beggars generall? I too was a\r\nrich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to\r\nmany a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he\r\nwanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which\r\npeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased\r\nJove to take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too\r\ncome to lose that pride and place in which you now wanton above your\r\nfellows; have a care lest you get out of favour with your mistress,\r\nand lest Ulysses should come home, for there is still a chance that he\r\nmay do so. Moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, yet by\r\nApollo\'s will he has left a son behind him, Telemachus, who will\r\nnote anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no\r\nlonger in his boyhood."\r\nPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, "Impudent\r\nbaggage, said she, "I see how abominably you are behaving, and you\r\nshall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself,\r\nthat I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for\r\nwhose sake I am in such continual sorrow."\r\nThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, "Bring a seat with\r\na fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his\r\nstory, and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some\r\nquestions."\r\nEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as\r\nsoon as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, "Stranger, I\r\nshall first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and\r\nparents."\r\n"Madam;" answered Ulysses, "who on the face of the whole earth can\r\ndare to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven\r\nitself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness,\r\nas the monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its\r\nwheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring\r\nforth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues,\r\nand his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in\r\nyour house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know my race\r\nand family, or you will recall memories that will yet more increase my\r\nsorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping and\r\nwailing in another person\'s house, nor is it well to be thus\r\ngrieving continually. I shall have one of the servants or even\r\nyourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tears\r\nbecause I am heavy with wine."\r\nThen Penelope answered, "Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,\r\nwhether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my\r\ndear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs\r\nI should be both more respected and should show a better presence to\r\nthe world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the\r\nafflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from\r\nall our islands- Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca\r\nitself, are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can\r\ntherefore show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to\r\npeople who say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time\r\nbrokenhearted about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once,\r\nand I have to invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first\r\nplace heaven put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my\r\nroom, and to begin working upon an enormous piece of fine\r\nneedlework. Then I said to them, \'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead,\r\nstill, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would\r\nnot have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have\r\nfinished making a pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against the\r\ntime when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of\r\nthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.\' This was what I\r\nsaid, and they assented; whereon I used to keep working at my great\r\nweb all day long, but at night I would unpick the stitches again by\r\ntorch light. I fooled them in this way for three years without their\r\nfinding it out, but as time wore on and I was now in my fourth year,\r\nin the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, those\r\ngood-for-nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who\r\nbroke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was\r\nforced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see\r\nhow I can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage.\r\nMy parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at\r\nthe ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now\r\nold enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to look\r\nafter his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent\r\ndisposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are\r\nand where you come from- for you must have had father and mother of\r\nsome sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock."\r\nThen Ulysses answered, "madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in\r\nasking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs\r\nme: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long\r\nas I have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless,\r\nas regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a\r\nfair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly\r\npeopled and there are nine cities in it: the people speak many\r\ndifferent languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans,\r\nbrave Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi.\r\nThere is a great town there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every\r\nnine years had a conference with Jove himself. Minos was father to\r\nDeucalion, whose son I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and\r\nmyself. Idomeneus sailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am\r\ncalled Aethon; my brother, however, was at once the older and the more\r\nvaliant of the two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and\r\nshowed him hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on\r\nhis way to Troy, carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and\r\nleaving him in Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours\r\nare difficult to enter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds\r\nthat were then xaging. As soon as he got there he went into the town\r\nand asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, but\r\nIdomeneus had already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days\r\nearlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him every kind of\r\nhospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the\r\nmen who were with him with barley meal from the public store, and\r\ngot subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their\r\nheart\'s content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale\r\nblowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one\'s feet\r\non land. I suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, but\r\non the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away."\r\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope\r\nwept as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes\r\nupon the mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have\r\nbreathed upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with\r\nwater, even so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband\r\nwho was all the time sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was\r\nfor her, but he kept his eyes as hard as or iron without letting\r\nthem so much as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears.\r\nThen, when she had relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him\r\nagain and said: "Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and see\r\nwhether or no you really did entertain my husband and his men, as\r\nyou say you did. Tell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man\r\nhe was to look at, and so also with his companions."\r\n"Madam," answered Ulysses, "it is such a long time ago that I can\r\nhardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home,\r\nand went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can\r\nrecollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and\r\nit was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On\r\nthe face of this there was a device that showed a dog holding a\r\nspotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay\r\npanting upon the ground. Every one marvelled at the way in which these\r\nthings had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and\r\nstrangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape.\r\nAs for the shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it\r\nfitted him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to\r\nthe admiration of all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say,\r\nand lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether Ulysses\r\nwore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companions\r\nhad given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one\r\nat whose house he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a\r\nman of many friends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself\r\ngave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double\r\nlined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on\r\nboard his ship with every mark of honour. He had a servant with him, a\r\nlittle older than himself, and I can tell you what he was like; his\r\nshoulders were hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair.\r\nHis name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater\r\nfamiliarity than he did any of the others, as being the most\r\nlike-minded with himself."\r\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable\r\nproofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found\r\nrelief in tears she said to him, "Stranger, I was already disposed\r\nto pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome\r\nin my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I\r\ntook them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I\r\ngave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall\r\nnever welcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set\r\nout for that detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself\r\neven to mention."\r\nThen Ulysses answered, "Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure\r\nyourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can\r\nhardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and\r\nborne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even\r\nthough he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a\r\ngod. Still, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell I will hide\r\nnothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately\r\nheard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the\r\nThesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he\r\nhas begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew\r\nwere lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the\r\nsun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the\r\nsun-god\'s cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses\r\nstuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the\r\nPhaecians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him\r\nas though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing\r\nto escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been\r\nhere long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land\r\ngathering wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he\r\nis; there is no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the\r\nThesprotians told me all this, and he swore to me- making\r\ndrink-offerings in his house as he did so- that the ship was by the\r\nwater side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own\r\ncountry. He sent me off first, for there happened to be a\r\nThesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,\r\nbut he showed me all treasure Ulysses had got together, and he had\r\nenough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family for ten\r\ngenerations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he\r\nmight learn Jove\'s mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after\r\nso long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret.\r\nSo you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at\r\nhand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I will\r\nconfirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first and\r\nmightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses to\r\nwhich I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to\r\npass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this\r\nmoon and the beginning of the next he will be here."\r\n"May it be even so," answered Penelope; "if your words come true you\r\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see\r\nyou shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be.\r\nUlysses will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for\r\nso surely as that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such\r\nmasters in the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or\r\nto further them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet\r\nfor him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he\r\nmay be warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and\r\nanoint him again, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals\r\nwith Telemachus. It shall be the worse for any one of these hateful\r\npeople who is uncivil to him; like it or not, he shall have no more to\r\ndo in this house. For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether\r\nor no I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heart\r\nand understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill\r\nclad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal\r\nhardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak\r\ncontemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous\r\nand deals righteously, the people tell of his praise among all\r\nlands, and many shall call him blessed."\r\nUlysses answered, "Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from\r\nthe day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I\r\nwill lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night\r\nafter night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited\r\nfor morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall\r\nnot let any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet;\r\nbut, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as\r\nmuch trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them."\r\nTo this Penelope said, "My dear sir, of all the guests who ever\r\nyet came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things\r\nwith such admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the\r\nhouse a most respectable old woman- the same who received my poor dear\r\nhusband in her arms the night he was born, and nursed him in\r\ninfancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet."\r\n"Come here," said she, "Euryclea, and wash your master\'s age-mate; I\r\nsuppose Ulysses\' hands and feet are very much the same now as his are,\r\nfor trouble ages all of us dreadfully fast."\r\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she\r\nbegan to weep and made lamentation saying, "My dear child, I cannot\r\nthink whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever\r\nmore god-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in\r\nthe whole world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer\r\nhecatombs when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself\r\nand see your son grow up to take after you; yet see how he has\r\nprevented you alone from ever getting back to your own home. I have no\r\ndoubt the women in some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are\r\ngibing at him as all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do not\r\nwonder at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in\r\nwhich they have insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly\r\nenough, as Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both\r\nfor Penelope\'s sake and for your own, for you have raised the most\r\nlively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this\r\nmoreover, which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers\r\nin distress come here before now, but I make bold to say that no one\r\never yet came who was so like Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as\r\nyou are."\r\n"Those who have seen us both," answered Ulysses, "have always said\r\nwe were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.\r\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to\r\nwash his feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot\r\ntill the bath was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long\r\nhe turned away from the light, for it occurred to him that when the\r\nold woman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar which\r\nit bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as\r\nshe began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one that\r\nhad been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on Mount\r\nParnassus with his excellent grandfather Autolycus- who was the most\r\naccomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world- and with the\r\nsons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, for\r\nhe used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he took\r\npleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolycus had\r\ngone to Ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born. As\r\nsoon as he had done supper Euryclea set the infant upon his knees\r\nand said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished\r\nthat you might have one."\r\n\'Son-in-law and daughter," replied Autolycus, "call the child\r\nthus: I am highly displeased with a large number of people in one\r\nplace and another, both men and women; so name the child \'Ulysses,\' or\r\nthe child of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother\'s\r\nfamily on Mount Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a\r\npresent and will send him on his way rejoicing."\r\nUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from\r\nAutolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him\r\nwelcome. His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and\r\nkissed his head, and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus\r\ndesired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as he told them.\r\nThey brought in a five year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and\r\ndivided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up into\r\nsmaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently and\r\nserved the portions round. Thus through the livelong day to the\r\ngoing down of the sun they feasted, and every man had his full share\r\nso that all were satisfied; but when the sun set and it came on\r\ndark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\r\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of\r\nAutolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too.\r\nThey climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its\r\nbreezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the\r\nfields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came\r\nto a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of\r\nthe beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of\r\nAutolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a\r\nlong spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some\r\nthick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through\r\nit, nor could the sun\'s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath\r\nlay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men\'s\r\nfeet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to\r\nhim, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and\r\nstood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first\r\nto raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boar\r\nwas too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the\r\nknee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As\r\nfor the boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point\r\nof the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in the\r\ndust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied\r\nthemselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses\' wound;\r\nthen, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as\r\nfast as they could. But when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly\r\nhealed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent him\r\nback to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his\r\nfather and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about\r\nit, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how\r\nthe boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolycus and his\r\nsons on Mount Parnassus.\r\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had\r\nwell hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. The\r\nleg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all\r\nthe water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea\'s eyes between her joy and\r\nher grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught\r\nUlysses by the beard and said, "My dear child, I am sure you must be\r\nUlysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched\r\nand handled you."\r\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to\r\ntell her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was\r\nunable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for\r\nMinerva had diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by\r\nthe throat with his right hand and with his left drew her close to\r\nhim, and said, "Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who\r\nnursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering\r\nI am at last come to my own home again? Since it has been borne in\r\nupon you by heaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a\r\nword about it any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you- and\r\nit shall surely be- that if heaven grants me to take the lives of\r\nthese suitors, I will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when\r\nI am killing the other women."\r\n"My child," answered Euryclea, "what are you talking about? You know\r\nvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my\r\ntongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and\r\nlay my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors\r\ninto your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who\r\nhave been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless."\r\nAnd Ulysses answered, "Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way;\r\nI am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them;\r\nhold your tongue and leave everything to heaven."\r\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,\r\nfor the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and\r\nanointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to\r\nwarm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began\r\ntalking to him and said:\r\n"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another\r\nmatter. It is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who can\r\nsleep in spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of\r\nsuch unmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my\r\nduties and looking after the servants, I am still weeping and\r\nlamenting during the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of\r\nus go to bed, I lie awake thinking, and my heart comes a prey to the\r\nmost incessant and cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of\r\nPandareus, sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest\r\ncovert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how\r\nby mishap she killed her own child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so\r\ndoes my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether I ought to\r\nstay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and\r\nthe greatness of my house, out of regard to public opinion and the\r\nmemory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me to\r\ngo with the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me such\r\nmagnificent presents. As long as my son was still young, and unable to\r\nunderstand, he would not hear of my leaving my husband\'s house, but\r\nnow that he is full grown he begs and prays me to do so, being\r\nincensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his property.\r\nListen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for me if\r\nyou can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of a\r\ntrough, and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great\r\neagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into\r\nthe neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he\r\nsoared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;\r\nwhereon I wept in my room till all my maids gathered round me, so\r\npiteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then\r\nhe came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me\r\nwith human voice, and told me to leave off crying. \'Be of good\r\ncourage,\' he said, \'daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a\r\nvision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. The geese are\r\nthe suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am\r\ncome back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a disgraceful\r\nend.\' On this I woke, and when I looked out I saw my geese at the\r\ntrough eating their mash as usual."\r\n"This dream, Madam," replied Ulysses, "can admit but of one\r\ninterpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be\r\nfulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single\r\none of them will escape."\r\nAnd Penelope answered, "Stranger, dreams are very curious and\r\nunaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come\r\ntrue. There are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies\r\nproceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come\r\nthrough the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn\r\nmean something to those that see them. I do not think, however, that\r\nmy own dream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should\r\nbe most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say-\r\nand lay my saying to your heart- the coming dawn will usher in the\r\nill-omened day that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am\r\nabout to hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve\r\naxes in the court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon\r\nwhich a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an\r\narrow through the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the\r\nsame thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily,\r\nand send his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and\r\nquit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in\r\nwealth. But even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my\r\ndreams."\r\nThen Ulysses answered, "Madam wife of Ulysses, you need not defer\r\nyour tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string\r\nthe bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the\r\niron."\r\nTo this Penelope said, "As long, sir, as you will sit here and\r\ntalk to me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do\r\npermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on\r\nearth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and\r\nrecline upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my\r\ntears from the day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name."\r\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by\r\nher maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till\r\nMinerva shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XX.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'ULYSSES slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock\'s hide, on\r\nthe top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had\r\neaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself\r\ndown. There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in\r\nwhich he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had\r\nbeen in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the\r\nhouse giggling and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very\r\nangry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of\r\nthem then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last time\r\nwith the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with\r\npuppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did\r\nhis heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but\r\nhe beat his breast and said, "Heart, be still, you had worse than this\r\nto bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave\r\ncompanions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you\r\nsafe out of the cave, though you made sure of being killed."\r\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he\r\ntossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in\r\nfront of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other,\r\nthat he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn\r\nhimself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single\r\nhanded as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as\r\nthe wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the\r\nlikeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, "My poor\r\nunhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house:\r\nyour wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a\r\nyoung man as any father may be proud of."\r\n"Goddess," answered Ulysses, "all that you have said is true, but\r\nI am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked\r\nsuitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always\r\nare. And there is this further difficulty, which is still more\r\nconsiderable. Supposing that with Jove\'s and your assistance I succeed\r\nin killing them, I must ask you to consider where I am to escape to\r\nfrom their avengers when it is all over."\r\n"For shame," replied Minerva, "why, any one else would trust a worse\r\nally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less\r\nwise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you\r\nthroughout in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though\r\nthere were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you\r\nshould take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with\r\nyou. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night,\r\nand you shall be out of your troubles before long."\r\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to\r\nOlympus.\r\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber\r\nthat eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and\r\nsitting up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by\r\nweeping she prayed to Diana saying, "Great Goddess Diana, daughter\r\nof Jove, drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some\r\nwhirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it\r\ndrop me into the mouths of overflowing Oceanus, as it did the\r\ndaughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their father\r\nand mother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. But\r\nVenus took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet\r\nwine. Juno taught them to excel all women in beauty of form and\r\nunderstanding; Diana gave them an imposing presence, and Minerva\r\nendowed them with every kind of accomplishment; but one day when Venus\r\nhad gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them married (for\r\nwell does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to\r\nevery one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become\r\nhandmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who\r\nlive in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Diana\r\nmight strike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if I\r\nmight do so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having\r\nto yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter how\r\nmuch people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as they\r\ncan sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people\r\nforget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my\r\ndreams. This very night methought there was one lying by my side who\r\nwas like Ulysses as he was when he went away with his host, and I\r\nrejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, but the very truth\r\nitself."\r\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping,\r\nand it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and\r\nwas by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on\r\nwhich he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took\r\nthe bullock\'s hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to\r\nheaven, and prayed, saying "Father Jove, since you have seen fit to\r\nbring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictions\r\nyou have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one\r\nor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me have\r\nanother sign of some kind from outside."\r\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high\r\nup among the from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad\r\nwhen he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman\r\nfrom hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another\r\nsign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind\r\nwheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground\r\ntheir task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet\r\nfinished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard\r\nthe thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.\r\n"Father Jove," said she, "you who rule over heaven and earth, you have\r\nthundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and\r\nthis means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me\r\nyour poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last\r\nday that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn me\r\nout with the labour of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may\r\nnever have another dinner anywhere at all."\r\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the\r\nwoman\'s speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he\r\nshould avenge himself on the suitors.\r\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the\r\nhearth; Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his\r\nsword about his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and\r\ntook a doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to\r\nthe threshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea, "Nurse, did you\r\nmake the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did\r\nyou let him shift for himself?- for my mother, good woman though she\r\nis, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate people, and\r\nof neglecting others who are in reality much better men."\r\n"Do not find fault child," said Euryclea, "when there is no one to\r\nfind fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he\r\nliked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and\r\nhe said he would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the\r\nservants to make one for him, but he said he was re such wretched\r\noutcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he\r\ninsisted on having an undressed bullock\'s hide and some sheepskins put\r\nfor him in the cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself."\r\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the\r\nAchaeans were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and\r\nhe was not alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea\r\ncalled the maids and said, "Come, wake up; set about sweeping the\r\ncloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the\r\ncovers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet\r\nsponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from the\r\nfountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here\r\nearly, for it is a feast day."\r\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of\r\nthem went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves\r\nbusily to work about the house. The men who were in attendance on\r\nthe suitors also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the\r\nwomen returned from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them\r\nwith the three best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about\r\nthe premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,\r\n"Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as\r\ninsolent as ever?"\r\n"May heaven," answered Ulysses, "requite to them the wickedness with\r\nwhich they deal high-handedly in another man\'s house without any sense\r\nof shame."\r\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up,\r\nfor he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors\' dinner; and\r\nhe had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the\r\ngatehouse, and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. "Are you still\r\nhere, stranger," said he, "to pester people by begging about the\r\nhouse? Why can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an\r\nunderstanding before we have given each other a taste of our fists.\r\nYou beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere\r\namong the Achaeans, as well as here?"\r\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third\r\nman, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer\r\nand some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there\r\nto take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his\r\nheifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to\r\nthe swineherd. "Who, Swineherd," said he, "is this stranger that is\r\nlately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where\r\ndoes he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\r\ngreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will- even to kings\r\nif it so pleases them\r\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right\r\nhand; "Good day to you, father stranger," said he, "you seem to be\r\nvery poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and\r\nby. Father Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your\r\nown children, yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and\r\nafflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes\r\nfilled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going\r\nabout in just such rags as this man\'s are, if indeed he is still among\r\nthe living. If he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then,\r\nalas! for my good master, who made me his stockman when I was quite\r\nyoung among the Cephallenians, and now his cattle are countless; no\r\none could have done better with them than I have, for they have bred\r\nlike ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in for\r\nothers to eat, who take no heed of his son though he is in the\r\nhouse, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to\r\ndivide Ulysses\' property among them because he has been away so\r\nlong. I have often thought- only it would not be right while his son\r\nis living- of going off with the cattle to some foreign country; bad\r\nas this would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treated\r\nabout other people\'s herds. My position is intolerable, and I should\r\nlong since have run away and put myself under the protection of some\r\nother chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, and\r\nsend all these suitors flying out of the house."\r\n"Stockman," answered Ulysses, "you seem to be a very well-disposed\r\nperson, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will\r\ntell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Jove, the chief\r\nof all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come,\r\nUlysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so\r\nminded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters\r\nhere."\r\n"If Jove were to bring this to pass," replied the stockman, "you\r\nshould see how I would do my very utmost to help him."\r\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\r\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot\r\nto murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand- an\r\neagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, "My friends,\r\nthis plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go\r\nto dinner instead."\r\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on\r\nthe benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the\r\nheifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them\r\nround. They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave\r\nevery man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the\r\nbreadbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they\r\nlaid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\r\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister\r\nthat was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a\r\nlittle table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats\r\nbrought to him, with his wine in a gold cup. "Sit there," said he,\r\n"and drink your wine among the great people. I will put a stop to\r\nthe gibes and blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but\r\nbelongs to Ulysses, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors,\r\nkeep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be\r\nmischief."\r\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his\r\nspeech; then Antinous said, "We do not like such language but we\r\nwill put up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest.\r\nIf Jove had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere\r\nnow."\r\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the\r\nheralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the\r\nAchaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.\r\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave\r\nevery man his portion, and feasted to their hearts\' content; those who\r\nwaited at table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others\r\nhad, for Telemachus had told them to do so.\r\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their\r\ninsolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter\r\nagainst them. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow,\r\nwhose name was Ctesippus, and who came from Same. This man,\r\nconfident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of\r\nUlysses, and said to the suitors, "Hear what I have to say. The\r\nstranger has already had as large a portion as any one else; this is\r\nwell, for it is not right nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest of\r\nTelemachus who comes here. I will, however, make him a present on my\r\nown account, that he may have something to give to the bath-woman,\r\nor to some other of Ulysses\' servants."\r\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer\'s foot from the meat-basket in\r\nwhich it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a\r\nlittle aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion as he\r\ndid so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke\r\nfiercely to Ctesippus, "It is a good thing for you," said he, "that\r\nthe stranger turned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit\r\nhim I should have run you through with my spear, and your father would\r\nhave had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this\r\nhouse. So let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you,\r\nfor I am grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand\r\nwhat is going on, instead of being the child that I have been\r\nheretofore. I have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with\r\nmy corn and wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no match for\r\nmany, but do me no further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me,\r\nkill me; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day\r\nafter day- guests insulted, and men dragging the women servants\r\nabout the house in an unseemly way."\r\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,\r\n"No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay\r\nit, for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the\r\nstranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; I\r\nwould say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother,\r\nwhich I trust may commend itself to both. \'As long,\' I would say,\r\n\'as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no\r\none could complain of your waiting and suffering the suitors to be\r\nin your house. It would have been better that he should have returned,\r\nbut it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore\r\ntalk all this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the\r\nbest man, and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.\r\nThus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and\r\nto eat and drink in peace, while your mother will look after some\r\nother man\'s house, not yours."\'\r\nTo this Telemachus answered, "By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows\r\nof my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is\r\nwandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of\r\nmy mother\'s marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose\r\nwhomsoever she will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the\r\nbargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she shall leave the\r\nhouse against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this."\r\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and\r\nset their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced\r\nlaughter. Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with\r\ntears, and their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus\r\nsaw this and said, "Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is\r\na shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are\r\nwet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and\r\nroof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court\r\nbeyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell;\r\nthe sun is blotted out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all\r\nthe land."\r\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus\r\nthen said, "This stranger who has lately come here has lost his\r\nsenses. Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it\r\nso dark here."\r\nBut Theoclymenus said, "Eurymachus, you need not send any one with\r\nme. I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of\r\nan understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for\r\nI see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who\r\nare insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses\r\nwill be able to escape."\r\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him\r\nwelcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking\r\nTelemachus fly laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said\r\nto him, "Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you\r\nhave this importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and\r\nhas no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly\r\nuseless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a\r\nprophet. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better, to put\r\nthem on board ship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what\r\nthey will bring."\r\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father,\r\nexpecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the\r\nsuitors.\r\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had had a rich\r\nseat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she\r\ncould hear what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been\r\nprepared amid merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for\r\nthey had sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come,\r\nand nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a\r\ngoddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them- for they had\r\nbrought their doom upon themselves.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XXI.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'MINERVA now put it in Penelope\'s mind to make the suitors try\r\ntheir skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among\r\nthemselves, as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went\r\nupstairs and got the store room key, which was made of bronze and\r\nhad a handle of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store\r\nroom at the end of the house, where her husband\'s treasures of gold,\r\nbronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and\r\nthe quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend\r\nwhom he had met in Lacedaemon- Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two\r\nfell in with one another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus,\r\nwhere Ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was owing\r\nfrom the whole people; for the Messenians had carried off three\r\nhundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away with them and with\r\ntheir shepherds. In quest of these Ulysses took a long journey while\r\nstill quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him on\r\na mission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and\r\nget back twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals\r\nthat were running with them. These mares were the death of him in\r\nthe end, for when he went to the house of Jove\'s son, mighty Hercules,\r\nwho performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his shame killed\r\nhim, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven\'s vengeance,\r\nnor yet respected his own table which he had set before Iphitus, but\r\nkilled him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. It\r\nwas when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the bow\r\nwhich mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death\r\nhad been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword\r\nand a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although\r\nthey never visited at one another\'s houses, for Jove\'s son Hercules\r\nkilled Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him by\r\nIphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for\r\nTroy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it\r\nbehind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\r\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room;\r\nthe carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as\r\nto get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and\r\nhung the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door,\r\nput in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts\r\nthat held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bull\r\nbellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised\r\nplatform, where the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes\r\nwere laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down\r\nthe bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She sat\r\ndown with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of\r\nits case, and when her tears had relieved her, she went to the\r\ncloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with\r\nthe many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came her\r\nmaidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her\r\nhusband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood\r\nby one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,\r\nholding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either side of her.\r\nThen she said:\r\n"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of\r\nthis house because its owner has been long absent, and without other\r\npretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize\r\nthat you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of\r\nUlysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send\r\nhis arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and\r\nquit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in\r\nwealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my\r\ndreams."\r\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron\r\nbefore the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she\r\nhad bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his\r\nmaster\'s bow, but Antinous scolded them. "You country louts," said he,\r\n"silly simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your\r\nmistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the\r\nloss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in\r\nsilence, or go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind\r\nyou. We suitors shall have to contend for it with might and main,\r\nfor we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as this\r\nis. There is not a man of us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I\r\nhave seen him and remember him, though I was then only a child."\r\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be\r\nable to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact\r\nhe was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the\r\nhands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- egging\r\nthe others on to do so also.\r\nThen Telemachus spoke. "Great heavens!" he exclaimed, "Jove must\r\nhave robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother\r\nsaying she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and\r\nenjoying myself as though there were nothing happening. But,\r\nsuitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is\r\nfor a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or\r\nMycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well\r\nas I do; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on,\r\nthen, make no excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string\r\nthe bow or no. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and\r\nshoot through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this\r\nhouse with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won\r\nbefore me."\r\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from\r\nhim, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in\r\na row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wade\r\nstraight by line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and\r\neveryone was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though\r\nhe had never seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on\r\nto the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it,\r\ntrying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to\r\nleave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the\r\niron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it\r\nhad not Ulysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his\r\neagerness. So he said:\r\n"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am\r\ntoo young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be\r\nable to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore,\r\nwho are stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest\r\nsettled."\r\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door\r\n[that led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of\r\nthe bow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and\r\nAntinous said:\r\n"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the\r\nplace at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round the\r\nwine."\r\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise. He\r\nwas sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near\r\nthe mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and\r\nwas indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow\r\nand arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he\r\ncould not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard\r\nwork, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors,\r\n"My friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall\r\ntake the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is\r\nbetter to die than to live after having missed the prize that we\r\nhave so long striven for, and which has brought us so long together.\r\nSome one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry\r\nPenelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo\r\nand make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope\r\nmarry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win\r\nher."\r\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,\r\nwith the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his\r\nseat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked\r\nhim saying:\r\n"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and\r\nintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow\r\ntake the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend\r\nit yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are\r\nothers who will soon string it."\r\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, "Look sharp, light a fire\r\nin the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us\r\nalso a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us\r\nwarm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again, and\r\nbring the contest to an end."\r\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins\r\nbeside it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had\r\nin the house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of\r\nit, but they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it.\r\nNevertheless there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were\r\nthe ringleaders among the suitors and much the foremost among them\r\nall.\r\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and\r\nUlysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the\r\nouter yard, Ulysses said to them quietly:\r\n"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am\r\nin doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What\r\nmanner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should\r\nbring him back here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do-\r\nto side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?"\r\n"Father Jove," answered the stockman, "would indeed that you might\r\nso ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should\r\nsee with what might and main I would fight for him."\r\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might\r\nreturn; when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of,\r\nUlysses said, "It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much,\r\nbut at last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own\r\ncountry. I find that you two alone of all my servants are glad that\r\nI should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying for\r\nmy return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it\r\nshall be. If heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will\r\nfind wives for both of you, will give you house and holding close to\r\nmy own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friends\r\nof Telemachus. I will now give you convincing proofs that you may know\r\nme and be assured. See, here is the scar from the boar\'s tooth that\r\nripped me when I was out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of\r\nAutolycus."\r\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when\r\nthey had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses,\r\nthrew their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while\r\nUlysses kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have\r\ngone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and\r\nsaid:\r\n"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us,\r\nand tell those who a are within. When you go in, do so separately, not\r\nboth together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; Let this\r\nmoreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try\r\nto prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you,\r\ntherefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it\r\nabout, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment. If\r\nthey hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,\r\nthey must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they\r\nare at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the\r\ndoors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once."\r\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat\r\nthat he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\r\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was\r\nwarming it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was\r\ngreatly grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, "I grieve for\r\nmyself and for us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the\r\nmarriage, but I do not care nearly so much about this, for there are\r\nplenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the\r\nfact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot\r\nstring his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet\r\nunborn."\r\n"It shall not be so, Eurymachus," said Antinous, "and you know it\r\nyourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who\r\ncan string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side- as for the\r\naxes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the\r\nhouse and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups,\r\nthat we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the\r\nbow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow-\r\nthe best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty\r\narcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to\r\nan end."\r\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water\r\nover the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with\r\nwine and water and handed it round after giving every man his\r\ndrink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk\r\neach as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said:\r\n"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I\r\nam minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who\r\nhas just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present\r\nand leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give\r\nvictory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that\r\nI may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I\r\nstill have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and\r\nneglect have made an end of it."\r\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the\r\nbow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, "Wretched\r\ncreature, you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body;\r\nyou ought to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed\r\namong your betters, without having any smaller portion served you than\r\nwe others have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation.\r\nNo other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among\r\nourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does\r\nwith all those drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the\r\nCentaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the\r\nLapithae. When the wine had got into his head he went mad and did\r\nill deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes who\r\nwere there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and\r\nnostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the\r\nhouse, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime,\r\nbereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war\r\nbetween mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself\r\nthrough his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it\r\nwill go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no\r\nmercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king\r\nEchetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never get\r\naway alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel\r\nwith men younger than yourself."\r\nPenelope then spoke to him. "Antinous," said she, "it is not right\r\nthat you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this\r\nhouse. If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty\r\nbow of Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him\r\nand make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in\r\nhis mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would\r\nbe out of all reason."\r\n"Queen Penelope," answered Eurymachus, "we do not suppose that\r\nthis man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are\r\nafraid lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans,\r\nshould go gossiping about and say, \'These suitors are a feeble folk;\r\nthey are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one\r\nof them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the\r\nhouse strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.\' This is\r\nwhat will be said, and it will be a scandal against us."\r\n"Eurymachus," Penelope answered, "people who persist in eating up\r\nthe estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not\r\nexpect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men\r\ntalk as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built,\r\nhe says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and\r\nlet us see whether he can string it or no. I say- and it shall\r\nsurely be- that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it,\r\nI will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep\r\noff dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals,\r\nand will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go."\r\nThen Telemachus said, "Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or\r\nin the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any\r\none have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the\r\nother, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of\r\nthe bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then,\r\nwithin the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your\r\nloom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is a\r\nman\'s matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master\r\nhere."\r\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\'s saying in\r\nher heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she\r\nmourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her\r\neyelids.\r\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to\r\nUlysses, but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the\r\ncloisters, and one of them said, "You idiot, where are you taking\r\nthe bow to? Are you out of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods\r\nwill grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into some\r\nquiet little place, and worry you to death."\r\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put\r\nthe bow down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from\r\nthe other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, "Father\r\nEumaeus, bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will\r\npelt you with stones back to the country, for I am the better man of\r\nthe two. I wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in\r\nthe house as I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick\r\nand sorry, for they mean mischief."\r\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which\r\nput them in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the\r\nbow on and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this,\r\nhe called Euryclea apart and said to her, "Euryclea, Telemachus says\r\nyou are to close the doors of the women\'s apartments. If they hear any\r\ngroaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to\r\ncome out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their\r\nwork."\r\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women\'s\r\napartments.\r\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates\r\nof the outer court. There was a ship\'s cable of byblus fibre lying\r\nin the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in\r\nagain, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on\r\nUlysses, who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it\r\nevery way about, and proving it all over to see whether the worms\r\nhad been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then would\r\none turn towards his neighbour saying, "This is some tricky old\r\nbow-fancier; either he has got one like it at home, or he wants to\r\nmake one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it."\r\nAnother said, "I hope he may be no more successful in other things\r\nthan he is likely to be in stringing this bow."\r\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over,\r\nstrung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre\r\nand makes the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his\r\nright hand to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch\r\nlike the twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and\r\nturned colour as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove\r\nthundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he\r\nheard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.\r\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those which\r\nthe Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the\r\nquiver- he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the\r\nnotch of the arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his\r\nseat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every\r\none of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had\r\ngone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to\r\nTelemachus:\r\n"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I\r\naimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,\r\nand not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time\r\nfor the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,\r\nand then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are\r\nthe crowning ornaments of a banquet."\r\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus\r\ngirded on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his\r\nfather\'s seat.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                    BOOK XXII.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THEN Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad\r\npavement with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the\r\narrows on to the ground at his feet and said, "The mighty contest is\r\nat an end. I will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to\r\nhit another mark which no man has yet hit."\r\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take\r\nup a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in\r\nhis hands. He had no thought of death- who amongst all the revellers\r\nwould think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so\r\nmany and kill him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the\r\npoint went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup\r\ndropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his\r\nnostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it,\r\nso that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell\r\nover on to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they saw\r\nthat a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them\r\nfrom their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but there\r\nwas neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily.\r\n"Stranger," said they, "you shall pay for shooting people in this way:\r\nom yi you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom\r\nyou have slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures\r\nshall devour you for having killed him."\r\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by\r\nmistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head\r\nof every one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:\r\n"Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have\r\nwasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you,\r\nand have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared\r\nneither Cod nor man, and now you shall die."\r\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round\r\nabout to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone\r\nspoke.\r\n"If you are Ulysses," said he, "then what you have said is just.\r\nWe have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But\r\nAntinous who was the head and front of the offending lies low already.\r\nIt was all his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope;\r\nhe did not so much care about that; what he wanted was something quite\r\ndifferent, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill\r\nyour son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has\r\nmet the death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We\r\nwill make everything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all\r\nthat we have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine\r\nworth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till\r\nyour heart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain of\r\nyour being enraged against us."\r\nUlysses again glared at him and said, "Though you should give me all\r\nthat you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall\r\nhave, I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You\r\nmust fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall."\r\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke\r\nsaying:\r\n"My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where\r\nhe is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let\r\nus then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield\r\nyou from his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from\r\nthe pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, and\r\nraise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting."\r\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both\r\nsides, and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses\r\ninstantly shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the\r\nnipple and fixed itself in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell\r\ndoubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went over on to\r\nthe ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of\r\ndeath, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were\r\nclosed in darkness.\r\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try\r\nand get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for\r\nhim, and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the\r\nshoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to\r\nthe ground and struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus\r\nsprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he\r\nfeared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans\r\nmight come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he\r\nset off at a run, and immediately was at his father\'s side. Then he\r\nsaid:\r\n"Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet\r\nfor your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other\r\narmour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be\r\narmed."\r\n"Run and fetch them," answered Ulysses, "while my arrows hold out,\r\nor when I am alone they may get me away from the door."\r\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room\r\nwhere the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and\r\nfour brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all\r\nspeed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and\r\nthe swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places near\r\nUlysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been\r\nshooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another:\r\nwhen his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall\r\nof the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick\r\nabout his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well\r\nwrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,\r\nand he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears.\r\nNow there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the\r\npavement there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this\r\nexit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to\r\nstand by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it\r\nat a time. But Agelaus shouted out, "Cannot some one go up to the trap\r\ndoor and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once,\r\nand we should soon make an end of this man and his shooting."\r\n"This may not be, Agelaus," answered Melanthius, "the mouth of the\r\nnarrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.\r\nOne brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know\r\nwhat I will do, I will bring you arms from the store room, for I am\r\nsure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them."\r\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store\r\nroom of Ulysses, house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many\r\nhelmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to\r\ngive them to the suitors. Ulysses\' heart began to fail him when he saw\r\nthe suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He\r\nsaw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, "Some one\r\nof the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be\r\nMelanthius."\r\nTelemachus answered, "The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I\r\nleft the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out\r\nthan I have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one\r\nof the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is\r\nMelanthius the son of Dolius."\r\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to\r\nthe store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and\r\nsaid to Ulysses who was beside him, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it\r\nis that scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to\r\nthe store room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him,\r\nor shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all\r\nthe many wrongs that he has done in your house?"\r\nUlysses answered, "Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in\r\ncheck, no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind\r\nMelanthius\' hands and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room\r\nand make the door fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body,\r\nand string him close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post,\r\nthat he may linger on in an agony."\r\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to\r\nthe store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for\r\nhe was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so\r\nthe two took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and\r\nby Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old\r\ndry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when\r\nhe was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the\r\nstraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back\r\nby the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his\r\nhands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with a\r\npainful bond as Ulysses had told them; then they fastened a noose\r\nabout his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he was\r\nclose up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O\r\nswineherd Eumaeus, saying, "Melanthius, you will pass the night on a\r\nsoft bed as you deserve. You will know very well when morning comes\r\nfrom the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in\r\nyour goats for the suitors to feast on."\r\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put\r\non their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take\r\ntheir places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the\r\ncloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the\r\nbody of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove\'s daughter\r\nMinerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of\r\nMentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, "Mentor, lend me\r\nyour help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he\r\nhas done you. Besides, you are my age-mate."\r\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from\r\nthe other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the\r\nfirst to reproach her. "Mentor," he cried, "do not let Ulysses beguile\r\nyou into siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we\r\nwill do: when we have killed these people, father and son, we will\r\nkill you too. You shall pay for it with your head, and when we have\r\nkilled you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and bring it\r\ninto hotch-pot with Ulysses\' property; we will not let your sons\r\nlive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow\r\ncontinue to live in the city of Ithaca."\r\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very\r\nangrily. "Ulysses," said she, "your strength and prowess are no longer\r\nwhat they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans\r\nabout the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and\r\nit was through your stratagem that Priam\'s city was taken. How comes\r\nit that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your\r\nown ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? Come\r\non, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of\r\nAlcinous shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred\r\nupon him."\r\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still\r\nfurther to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she\r\nflew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon\r\nit in the form of a swallow.\r\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon,\r\nDemoptolemus, Pisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt\r\nof the fight upon the suitors\' side; of all those who were still\r\nfighting for their lives they were by far the most valiant, for the\r\nothers had already fallen under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted\r\nto them and said, "My friends, he will soon have to leave off, for\r\nMentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.\r\nThey are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at\r\nonce, but six of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannot\r\ncover yourselves with glory by killing him. When he has fallen we need\r\nnot be uneasy about the others."\r\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all\r\nof no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door;\r\nthe pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they\r\nhad avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men,\r\n"My friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the\r\nmiddle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by\r\nus outright."\r\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their\r\nspears. Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus\r\nElatus, while the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust,\r\nand as the others drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed\r\nforward and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies of\r\nthe dead.\r\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their\r\nweapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of\r\nthe cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft\r\nof another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the\r\ntop skin from off Telemachus\'s wrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze\r\nEumaeus\'s shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to\r\nthe ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of\r\nsuitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus\r\nPolybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\r\ntaunted him saying, "Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so\r\nfoolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your\r\nspeech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present\r\nof this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when\r\nhe was begging about in his own house."\r\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with\r\na spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor\r\nin the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell\r\nforward full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat\r\non the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the\r\nsuitors quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like a herd\r\nof cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are\r\nat their longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the\r\nmountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon\r\nthe ground, and kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, and\r\nlookers on enjoy the sport- even so did Ulysses and his men fall\r\nupon the suitors and smite them on every side. They made a horrible\r\ngroaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground\r\nseethed with their blood.\r\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, "Ulysses I\r\nbeseech you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of\r\nthe women in your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop\r\nthe others. I saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are\r\npaying for their folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill\r\nme, I shall die without having done anything to deserve it, and\r\nshall have got no thanks for all the good that I did."\r\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, "If you were their\r\nsacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might\r\nbe long before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife\r\nand have children by her. Therefore you shall die."\r\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped\r\nwhen he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he\r\nstruck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell\r\nrolling in the dust while he was yet speaking.\r\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes- he who had been forced by the\r\nsuitors to sing to them- now tried to save his life. He was standing\r\nnear towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He did\r\nnot know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the\r\naltar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes\r\nand Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether\r\nto go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end\r\nhe deemed it best to embrace Ulysses\' knees. So he laid his lyre on\r\nthe ground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded\r\nseat; then going up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said,\r\n"Ulysses, I beseech you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be\r\nsorry for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both for\r\ngods and men as I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits me\r\nwith every kind of inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were\r\na god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your\r\nown son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent\r\nyour house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were\r\ntoo many and too strong for me, so they made me."\r\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. "Hold!"\r\nhe cried, "the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will Medon\r\ntoo, who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius\r\nor Eumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when\r\nyou were raging about the court."\r\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a\r\nseat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly\r\nflayed heifer\'s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,\r\nand laid hold of his knees.\r\n"Here I am, my dear sir," said he, "stay your hand therefore, and\r\ntell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors\r\nfor having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to\r\nyourself."\r\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, "Fear not; Telemachus has\r\nsaved your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people,\r\nhow greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore,\r\noutside the cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of\r\nthe slaughter- you and the bard- while I finish my work here inside."\r\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat\r\ndown by Jove\'s great altar, looking fearfully round, and still\r\nexpecting that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole\r\ncourt carefully over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and\r\nwas still living, but he found them all lying in the dust and\r\nweltering in their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have\r\nnetted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for\r\nwater till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were\r\nthe suitors lying all huddled up one against the other.\r\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, "Call nurse Euryclea; I have\r\nsomething to say to her."\r\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women\'s room. "Make\r\nhaste," said he, "you old woman who have been set over all the other\r\nwomen in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you."\r\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women\'s room\r\nand came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the\r\ncorpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just\r\nbeen devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all\r\nbloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses\r\nbesmirched from head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses\r\nand such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy,\r\nfor she saw that a great deed had been done; but Ulysses checked\r\nher, "Old woman," said he, "rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and\r\ndo not make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over\r\ndead men. Heaven\'s doom and their own evil deeds have brought these\r\nmen to destruction, for they respected no man in the whole world,\r\nneither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad\r\nend as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell\r\nme which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and\r\nwho are innocent."\r\n"I will tell you the truth, my son," answered Euryclea. "There are\r\nfifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding\r\nwool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have\r\nmisbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to\r\nPenelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only\r\nlately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to\r\nthe female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all\r\nthat has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep."\r\n"Do not wake her yet," answered Ulysses, "but tell the women who\r\nhave misconducted themselves to come to me."\r\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come\r\nto Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and\r\nthe swineherd. "Begin," said he, "to remove the dead, and make the\r\nwomen help you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the\r\ntables and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole\r\ncloisters, take the women into the space between the domed room and\r\nthe wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swords\r\ntill they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the\r\nway in which they used to lie in secret with the suitors."\r\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.\r\nFirst they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against\r\none another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them\r\ndo their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When\r\nthey had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges\r\nand water, while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the\r\nblood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away\r\nand put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite\r\nclean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the\r\nnarrow space between the wall of the domed room and that of the\r\nyard, so that they could not get away: and Telemachus said to the\r\nother two, "I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they\r\nwere insolent to me and my mother, and used to sleep with the\r\nsuitors."\r\nSo saying he made a ship\'s cable fast to one of the bearing-posts\r\nthat supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around\r\nthe building, at a good height, lest any of the women\'s feet should\r\ntouch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has\r\nbeen set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their\r\nnest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have to\r\nput their heads in nooses one after the other and die most\r\nmiserably. Their feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very\r\nlong.\r\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner\r\ncourt. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his\r\nvitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they\r\ncut off his hands and his feet.\r\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went\r\nback into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the\r\ndear old nurse Euryclea, "Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all\r\npollution, and fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the\r\ncloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her\r\nattendants, and also all the maid servants that are in the house."\r\n"All that you have said is true," answered Euryclea, "but let me\r\nbring you some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these\r\nrags on your back any longer. It is not right."\r\n"First light me a fire," replied Ulysses.\r\nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and\r\nUlysses thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer\r\ncourts. Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what\r\nhad happened; whereon they came from their apartment with torches in\r\ntheir hands, and pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his\r\nhead and shoulders and taking hold of his hands.

Her aged knees became young again and\r\nher feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent\r\nover her head to speak to her. "Wake up Penelope, my dear child,"\r\nshe exclaimed, "and see with your own eyes something that you have\r\nbeen wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home\r\nagain, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble in\r\nhis house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son."\r\n"My good nurse," answered Penelope, "you must be mad. The gods\r\nsometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, and\r\nmake foolish people become sensible. This is what they must have\r\nbeen doing to you; for you always used to be a reasonable person.\r\nWhy should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough already-\r\ntalking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that\r\nhad taken possession of my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so\r\nsoundly from the day my poor husband went to that city with the\r\nill-omened name. Go back again into the women\'s room; if it had been\r\nany one else, who had woke me up to bring me such absurd news I should\r\nhave sent her away with a severe scolding. As it is, your age shall\r\nprotect you."\r\n"My dear child," answered Euryclea, "I am not mocking you. It is\r\nquite true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the\r\nstranger whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister.\r\nTelemachus knew all the time that he was come back, but kept his\r\nfather\'s secret that he might have his revenge on all these wicked\r\npeople.\r\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round\r\nEuryclea, and wept for joy. "But my dear nurse," said she, "explain\r\nthis to me; if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage\r\nto overcome the wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number\r\nof them there always were?"\r\n"I was not there," answered Euryclea, "and do not know; I only heard\r\nthem groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and\r\nhuddled up in a corner of the women\'s room with the doors closed, till\r\nyour son came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found\r\nUlysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all\r\nround him, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you\r\ncould have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and\r\nfilth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled\r\nup in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit\r\na great fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to\r\ncall you, so come with me that you may both be happy together after\r\nall; for now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your\r\nhusband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and\r\nto take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so\r\nbadly to him."\r\n"\'My dear nurse," said Penelope, "do not exult too confidently\r\nover all this. You know how delighted every one would be to see\r\nUlysses come home- more particularly myself, and the son who has\r\nbeen born to both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true.\r\nIt is some god who is angry with the suitors for their great\r\nwickedness, and has made an end of them; for they respected no man\r\nin the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, who\r\ncame near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence of\r\ntheir iniquity. Ulysses is dead far away from the Achaean land; he\r\nwill never return home again."\r\nThen nurse Euryclea said, "My child, what are you talking about? but\r\nyou were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your\r\nhusband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own\r\nfire side at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof;\r\nwhen I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave\r\nhim, and I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not\r\nlet me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I\r\nwill make this bargain with you- if I am deceiving you, you may have\r\nme killed by the most cruel death you can think of."\r\n"My dear nurse," said Penelope, "however wise you may be you can\r\nhardly fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in\r\nsearch of my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the\r\nman who has killed them."\r\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she\r\nconsidered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband\r\nand question him, or whether she should at once go up to him and\r\nembrace him. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the\r\ncloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the\r\nwall at right angles [to that by which she had entered], while Ulysses\r\nsat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and\r\nwaiting to see what his wife would say to him when she saw him. For\r\na long time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment\r\nshe looked him full in the face, but then again directly, she was\r\nmisled by his shabby clothes and failed to recognize him, till\r\nTelemachus began to reproach her and said:\r\n"Mother- but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a\r\nname- why do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you\r\nnot sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?\r\nNo other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had\r\ncome back to her after twenty years of absence, and after having\r\ngone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a stone."\r\nPenelope answered, "My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I\r\ncan find no words in which either to ask questions or to answer\r\nthem. I cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really\r\nis Ulysses come back to his own home again, we shall get to understand\r\none another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we two\r\nare alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others."\r\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, "Let your mother put\r\nme to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it\r\npresently. She rejects me for the moment and believes me to be\r\nsomebody else, because I am covered with dirt and have such bad\r\nclothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better do next. When\r\none man has killed another, even though he was not one who would leave\r\nmany friends to take up his quarrel, the man who has killed him must\r\nstill say good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have\r\nbeen killing the stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth of\r\nIthaca. I would have you consider this matter."\r\n"Look to it yourself, father," answered Telemachus, "for they say\r\nyou are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other\r\nmortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right\r\ngood will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength\r\nholds out."\r\n"I will say what I think will be best," answered Ulysses. "First\r\nwash and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own\r\nroom and dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre,\r\nso that if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some\r\none going along the street happens to notice it, they may think\r\nthere is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of the\r\nsuitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the\r\nwoods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of the\r\ncourses heaven vouchsafes us shall seem wisest."\r\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they\r\nwashed and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then\r\nPhemius took his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and\r\nstately dance. The house re-echoed with the sound of men and women\r\ndancing, and the people outside said, "I suppose the queen has been\r\ngetting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for not\r\ncontinuing to protect her husband\'s property until he comes home."\r\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was that\r\nhad been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed\r\nUlysses in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva\r\nmade him look taller and stronger than before; she also made the\r\nhair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like\r\nhyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders just\r\nas a skilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan\r\nor Minerva- and his work is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silver\r\nplate by gilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of the\r\nimmortals, and sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. "My\r\ndear," said he, "heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding\r\nthan woman ever yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from\r\nher husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of\r\nabsence, and after having gone through so much. But come, nurse, get a\r\nbed ready for me; I will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as\r\nhard as iron."\r\n"My dear," answered Penelope, "I have no wish to set myself up,\r\nnor to depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I\r\nvery well remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail\r\nfrom Ithaca. Nevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed\r\nchamber that he himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and\r\nput bedding upon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets."\r\nShe said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said,\r\n"Wife, I am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has\r\nbeen taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have\r\nfound it a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless\r\nsome god came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living,\r\nhowever strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for\r\nit is a marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands.\r\nThere was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house,\r\nin full vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my\r\nroom round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them,\r\nand I made the doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top\r\nboughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed\r\nroughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter\'s tools\r\nwell and skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the\r\nwood, and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the\r\nmiddle, and made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I worked\r\ntill I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I\r\nstretched a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the\r\nother. So you see I know all about it, and I desire to learn whether\r\nit is still there, or whether any one has been removing it by\r\ncutting down the olive tree at its roots."\r\nWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly\r\nbroke down. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his\r\nneck, and kissed him. "Do not be angry with me Ulysses," she cried,\r\n"you, who are the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us.\r\nHeaven has denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and of\r\ngrowing old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss\r\nthat I did not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have been\r\nshuddering all the time through fear that someone might come here\r\nand deceive me with a lying story; for there are many very wicked\r\npeople going about. Jove\'s daughter Helen would never have yielded\r\nherself to a man from a foreign country, if she had known that the\r\nsons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her back. Heaven put\r\nit in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin,\r\nwhich has been the source of all our sorrows. Now, however, that you\r\nhave convinced me by showing that you know all about our bed (which no\r\nhuman being has ever seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the\r\ndaughter of Actor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and\r\nwho keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I have been I\r\ncan mistrust no longer."\r\nThen Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and\r\nfaithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who\r\nare swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship\r\nwith the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the land,\r\nand these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find\r\nthemselves on firm ground and out of danger- even so was her husband\r\nwelcome to her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her\r\ntwo fair arms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on\r\nindulging their sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not\r\nMinerva determined otherwise, and held night back in the far west,\r\nwhile she would not suffer Dawn to leave Oceanus, nor to yoke the\r\ntwo steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear her onward to break the day\r\nupon mankind.\r\nAt last, however, Ulysses said, "Wife, we have not yet reached the\r\nend of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to\r\nundergo. It is long and difficult, but I must go through with it,\r\nfor thus the shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day\r\nwhen I went down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my\r\ncompanions. But now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy\r\nthe blessed boon of sleep."\r\n"You shall go to bed as soon as you please," replied Penelope,\r\n"now that the gods have sent you home to your own good house and to\r\nyour country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it,\r\ntell me about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hear\r\nabout it later, so it is better that I should be told at once."\r\n"My dear," answered Ulysses, "why should you press me to tell you?\r\nStill, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like BOOK\r\nit. I do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and\r\nwide, carrying an oar, till I came to a country where the people\r\nhave never heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food.\r\nThey know nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a\r\nship. He gave me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He\r\nsaid that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a\r\nwinnowing shovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my\r\noar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to\r\nNeptune; after which I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all the\r\ngods in heaven, one after the other. As for myself, he said that death\r\nshould come to me from the sea, and that my life should ebb away\r\nvery gently when I was full of years and peace of mind, and my\r\npeople should bless me. All this, he said, should surely come to\r\npass."\r\nAnd Penelope said, "If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier\r\ntime in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from\r\nmisfortune."\r\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took\r\ntorches and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they\r\nhad laid them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest,\r\nleaving the bed chamber woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope to\r\nbed by torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went\r\nback, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.\r\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\r\nmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep\r\nin the cloisters.\r\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell\r\ntalking with one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in\r\nseeing the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had\r\nkilled so many sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many\r\ncasks of wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered,\r\nand how much trouble he had himself given to other people. He told her\r\neverything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never went\r\nto sleep till he had ended his whole story.\r\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached\r\nthe fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the\r\nCyclops and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his\r\nbrave comrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him\r\nhospitably and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to\r\nreach home, for to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to\r\nsea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where\r\nthe people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save himself\r\nand his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft,\r\nand how he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of\r\nthe Theban prophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms,\r\nand his mother who bore him and brought him up when he was a child;\r\nhow he then heard the wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to\r\nthe wandering rocks and terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no\r\nman had ever yet passed in safety; how his men then ate the cattle\r\nof the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with his\r\nthunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone\r\nbeing left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the\r\nnymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted\r\nhim to marry her, in which case she intended making him immortal so\r\nthat he should never grow old, but she could not persuade him to let\r\nher do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way to the\r\nPhaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, and\r\nsent him back in a ship to his own country after having given him\r\ngold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last\r\nthing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon\r\nhim and eased the burden of his sorrows.\r\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that\r\nUlysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade\r\ngold-enthroned Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon\r\nmankind. On this, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to\r\nPenelope, "Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles,\r\nyou, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from\r\ngetting home though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however,\r\nthat we have at last come together, take care of the property that\r\nis in the house. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors\r\nhave eaten, I will take many myself by force from other people, and\r\nwill compel the Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall have\r\nfilled all my yards. I am now going to the wooded lands out in the\r\ncountry to see my father who has so long been grieved on my account,\r\nand to yourself I will give these instructions, though you have little\r\nneed of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have been\r\nkilling the suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with\r\nyour women. See nobody and ask no questions."\r\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,\r\nPhiloetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour\r\nalso. This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they\r\nopened the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was\r\nnow daylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness\r\nand led them quickly out of the town.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                   BOOK XXIV.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'THEN Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in\r\nhis hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men\'s eyes\r\nin sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the\r\nghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering\r\nbehind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave,\r\nwhen one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang,\r\neven so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of\r\nsorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had\r\npassed the waters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the\r\ngates of the sun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached the\r\nmeadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and shadows of them that\r\ncan labour no more.\r\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of\r\nPatroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man\r\nof all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.\r\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of\r\nAgamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered\r\nalso the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of\r\nAeisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.\r\n"Son of Atreus," it said, "we used to say that Jove had loved you\r\nbetter from first to last than any other hero, for you were captain\r\nover many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before\r\nTroy; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon\r\nyou all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the\r\nhey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over\r\nyour ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good name,\r\nwhereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end."\r\n"Happy son of Peleus," answered the ghost of Agamemnon, "for\r\nhaving died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans\r\nand the Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you\r\nlay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless\r\nnow of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor\r\nshould we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to\r\nstay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray,\r\nwe laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water\r\nand with ointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly\r\nround about you. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal\r\nnymphs from out of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing went\r\nforth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They would\r\nhave fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestor\r\nwhose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, \'Hold, Argives, fly\r\nnot sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea\r\nwith her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son.\'\r\n"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of\r\nthe old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed\r\nyou in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up\r\ntheir sweet voices in lament- calling and answering one another; there\r\nwas not an Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days\r\nand nights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on\r\nthe eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep\r\nwith many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in\r\nraiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\r\nhorse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were\r\nburning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames\r\nof heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones at\r\ndaybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother\r\nbrought us a golden vase to hold them- gift of Bacchus, and work of\r\nVulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of\r\nPatroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those\r\nof Antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of your\r\ncomrades now that Patroclus was no more.\r\n"Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point\r\njutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far\r\nout upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born\r\nhereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them\r\nto be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been\r\npresent at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird\r\nthemselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some\r\ngreat chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\r\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in\r\ndeath your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives\r\nevermore among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when\r\nthe days of my fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on\r\nmy return, by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife."\r\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with\r\nthe ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts\r\nof Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went\r\nup to them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son\r\nof Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began to\r\ntalk to him.\r\n"Amphimedon," it said, "what has happened to all you fine young men-\r\nall of an age too- that you are come down here under the ground? One\r\ncould pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his\r\nwinds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your\r\nenemies make an end of you on the mainland when you were\r\ncattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of\r\ntheir wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been your\r\nguest. Do you not remember how I came to your house with Menelaus,\r\nto persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships against Troy? It was a\r\nwhole month ere we could resume our voyage, for we had hard work to\r\npersuade Ulysses to come with us."\r\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, "Agamemnon, son of Atreus,\r\nking of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell\r\nyou fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought\r\nabout. Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife,\r\nwho did not say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring\r\nmatters to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this,\r\nthen, was the trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in\r\nher room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework.\r\n\'Sweethearts,\' said she, \'Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not\r\npress me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would not have my\r\nskill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have completed a pall\r\nfor the hero Laertes, against the time when death shall take him. He\r\nis very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out\r\nwithout a pall.\' This is what she said, and we assented; whereupon\r\nwe could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at night\r\nshe would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in\r\nthis way for three years without our finding it out, but as time\r\nwore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and\r\nmany days had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she\r\nwas doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work,\r\nso she had to finish it whether she would or no; and when she showed\r\nus the robe she had made, after she had had it washed, its splendour\r\nwas as that of the sun or moon.\r\n"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where\r\nhis swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning\r\nfrom a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had\r\nhatched their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and\r\nthen after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in\r\nrags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old\r\nbeggar. He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the\r\nolder ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He\r\nendured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was\r\nin his own house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired\r\nhim, he and Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber,\r\nbolting the doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer\r\nhis bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated\r\nsuitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us\r\ncould string the bow- nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the\r\nhands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given\r\nhim, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his\r\nhaving it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease\r\nand sent his arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the\r\ncloister and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about\r\nhim. First he killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him,\r\nhe let fly his deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. It was\r\nplain that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon\r\nus with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a\r\nhideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and\r\nthe ground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came\r\nby our end, and our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the house\r\nof Ulysses, for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened,\r\nso that they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our\r\nwounds, making moan over us according to the offices due to the\r\ndeparted."\r\n"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes," replied the ghost of Agamemnon,\r\n"you are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with\r\nsuch rare excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded\r\nlord as Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of\r\nher virtue shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song\r\nthat shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of\r\nPenelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of\r\nTyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful\r\namong men, for she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the\r\ngood ones."\r\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the\r\nbowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of\r\nthe town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes,\r\nwhich he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house,\r\nwith a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for\r\nhim slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old\r\nSicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When\r\nUlysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:\r\n"Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for\r\ndinner. Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or\r\nfail to recognize me after so long an absence."\r\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius,\r\nwho went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the\r\nvineyard to make trial of his father. As he went down into the great\r\norchard, he did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other\r\nbondsmen, for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the\r\nvineyard, at the place where the old man had told them; he therefore\r\nfound his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt,\r\npatched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of\r\noxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of\r\nleather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very\r\nwoe-begone. When Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow,\r\nhe stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He doubted\r\nwhether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having\r\ncome home, or whether he should first question him and see what he\r\nwould say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in\r\nthis mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging\r\nabout a plant.\r\n"I see, sir," said Ulysses, "that you are an excellent gardener-\r\nwhat pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single\r\nplant, not a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears\r\nthe trace of your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be\r\noffended if I say that you take better care of your garden than of\r\nyourself. You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be\r\nbecause you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you,\r\nindeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them,\r\nand proclaim you of noble birth. I should have said that you were\r\none of those who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night\r\nas old men have a right to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose\r\nbondman are you, and in whose garden are you working? Tell me also\r\nabout another matter. Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca?\r\nI met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had\r\nnot the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an\r\nold friend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead\r\nand in the house of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man\r\ncame to my house once when I was in my own country and never yet did\r\nany stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said that his family\r\ncame from Ithaca and that his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius.\r\nI received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance\r\nof my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary\r\npresents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid\r\nsilver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks,\r\nand as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of\r\nsingle fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number\r\nof shirts. To all this I added four good looking women skilled in\r\nall useful arts, and I let him take his choice."\r\nHis father shed tears and answered, "Sir, you have indeed come to\r\nthe country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of\r\nwicked people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no\r\npurpose. If you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca,\r\nhe would have entertained you hospitably and would have required\r\nyour presents amply when you left him- as would have been only right\r\nconsidering what you have already given him. But tell me, and tell\r\nme true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest- my\r\nunhappy son, as ever was? Alas! He has perished far from his own\r\ncountry; the fishes of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey\r\nto the birds and wild beasts of some continent. Neither his mother,\r\nnor I his father, who were his parents, could throw our arms about him\r\nand wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered\r\nwife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed,\r\nand close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But\r\nnow, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you- tell me\r\nof your town and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you\r\nand your men to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man\'s\r\nship, and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left\r\nyou?"\r\n"I will tell you everything," answered Ulysses, "quite truly. I come\r\nfrom Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who\r\nis the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me\r\noff my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here\r\nagainst my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the\r\nopen country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since\r\nUlysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for\r\nhim when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both\r\nhe and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that\r\nwe should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents."\r\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled\r\nboth hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his\r\ngrey head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was\r\ntouched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father;\r\nthen he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him,\r\nsaying, "I am he, father, about whom you are asking- I have returned\r\nafter having been away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and\r\nlamentation- we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I\r\nhave been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their\r\ninsolence and crimes."\r\n"If you really are my son Ulysses," replied Laertes, "and have\r\ncome back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity\r\nas shall convince me."\r\n"First observe this scar," answered Ulysses, "which I got from a\r\nboar\'s tusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my mother\r\nhad sent me to Autolycus, my mother\'s father, to receive the\r\npresents which when he was over here he had promised to give me.\r\nFurthermore I will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which\r\nyou gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed you round\r\nthe garden. We went over them all, and you told me their names and\r\nwhat they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple\r\ntrees, and forty fig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows\r\nof vines; there was corn planted between each row, and they yield\r\ngrapes of every kind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy\r\nupon them."\r\nLaertes\' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs\r\nwhich his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and\r\nUlysses had to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon;\r\nbut as soon as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he\r\nsaid, "O father Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if\r\nthe suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly.\r\nNevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople\r\nof Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers\r\neverywhere throughout the cities of the Cephallenians."\r\nUlysses answered, "Take heart and do not trouble yourself about\r\nthat, but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already\r\ntold Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner\r\nready as soon as possible."\r\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When\r\nthey got there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the\r\nswineherd cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old\r\nSicel woman took Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with\r\noil. She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and\r\ngave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter\r\nthan before. When he came back his son was surprised to see him\r\nlooking so like an immortal, and said to him, "My dear father, some\r\none of the gods has been making you much taller and better-looking."\r\nLaertes answered, "Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,\r\nthat I were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and\r\ntook Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still\r\nwhat I then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,\r\nI should have been able to stand by you and help you against the\r\nsuitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have\r\nrejoiced to see it."\r\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their\r\nwork and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his\r\nproper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by\r\nand by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for\r\ntheir mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was\r\ngrowing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were\r\ncertain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but\r\nUlysses scolded them good-naturedly and said, "Sit down to your\r\ndinner, old man, and never mind about your surprise; we have been\r\nwanting to begin for some time and have been waiting for you."\r\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. "Sir,"\r\nsaid he, seizing his master\'s hand and kissing it at the wrist, "we\r\nhave long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us\r\nafter we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods\r\nprosper you. But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return,\r\nor shall we send some one to tell her?"\r\n"Old man," answered Ulysses, "she knows already, so you need not\r\ntrouble about that." On this he took his seat, and the sons of\r\nDolius gathered round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one\r\nafter the other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolius\r\ntheir father.\r\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went\r\nround the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had\r\nbefallen the suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it\r\nthey gathered from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the\r\nhouse of Ulysses. They took the dead away, buried every man his own,\r\nand put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere on board the\r\nfishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his own\r\nplace. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they\r\nwere got together Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with\r\ngrief for the death of his son Antinous, who had been the first man\r\nkilled by Ulysses, so he said, weeping bitterly, "My friend, this\r\nman has done the Achaeans great wrong. He took many of our best men\r\naway with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men; now,\r\nmoreover, on his return he has been killing all the foremost men among\r\nthe Cephallenians. Let us be up and doing before he can get away to\r\nPylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of\r\nourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace to\r\nus if we do not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own\r\npart I should have no mote pleasure in life, but had rather die at\r\nonce. Let us be up, then, and after them, before they can cross over\r\nto the mainland."\r\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard\r\nPhemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses.\r\nEvery one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the\r\nmiddle of the assembly, and Medon said, "Hear me, men of Ithaca.\r\nUlysses did not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself\r\nsaw an immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This\r\ngod appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going\r\nfuriously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they\r\nfell thick on one another."\r\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of\r\nMastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew\r\nboth past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all\r\nhonesty, saying,\r\n"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out\r\nas they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we\r\nbade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the\r\nwantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring the\r\nwife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however,\r\nlet it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against\r\nUlysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on\r\nyour own heads."\r\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and\r\nat once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for\r\nthe speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with\r\nEupeithes; they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when\r\nthey had armed themselves, they met together in front of the city, and\r\nEupeithes led them on in their folly. He thought he was going to\r\navenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return,\r\nbut was himself to perish in his attempt.\r\nThen Minerva said to Jove, "Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,\r\nanswer me this question- What do you propose to do? Will you set\r\nthem fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?"\r\nAnd Jove answered, "My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by\r\nyour own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge\r\nupon the suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I\r\nthink will be most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is\r\nrevenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he\r\nshall continue to rule, while we cause the others to forgive and\r\nforget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then all\r\nbecome friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign."\r\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down\r\nshe darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.\r\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by\r\nsaying, "Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up\r\nto us." So one of Dolius\'s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the\r\nthreshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, "Here\r\nthey are, let us put on our armour at once."\r\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to say\r\nUlysses, his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and\r\nDolius did the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their grey\r\nhair. When they had all put on their armour, they opened the gate\r\nand sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way.\r\nThen Jove\'s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the\r\nform and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said\r\nto his son Telemachus, "Telemachus, now that are about to fight in\r\nan engagement, which will show every man\'s mettle, be sure not to\r\ndisgrace your ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and\r\ncourage all the world over."\r\n"You say truly, my dear father," answered Telemachus, "and you shall\r\nsee, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family."\r\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. "Good heavens, he\r\nexclaimed, "what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My\r\nson and grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour."\r\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, "Son of Arceisius-\r\nbest friend I have in the world- pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and\r\nto Jove her father; then poise your spear and hurl it."\r\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had\r\nprayed to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes\'\r\nhelmet, and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed\r\nit not, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to\r\nthe ground. Meantime Ulysses and his son fell the front line of the\r\nfoe and smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would\r\nhave killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting\r\nhome again, only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one\r\npause. "Men of Ithaca," she cried, cease this dreadful war, and settle\r\nthe matter at once without further bloodshed."\r\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that\r\ntheir arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the\r\nsound of the goddess\'s voice, and they fled back to the city for their\r\nlives. But Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together\r\nswooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a\r\nthunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to\r\nUlysses, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or\r\nJove will be angry with you."\r\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva\r\nassumed the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of\r\npeace between the two contending parties.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                  -THE END-\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"XFIR\ufffd\x17MZ\ufffd"})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>h,x:()=>s});var o=t(96540);const a={},r=o.createContext(a);function h(e){const n=o.useContext(r);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:h(e.components),o.createElement(r.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
