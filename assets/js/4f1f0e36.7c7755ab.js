Before, then, anyone comes forth from the house,\r\ntake counsel; seeing that the time allows not of delay, but is full\r\nripe for deeds.\r\nORESTES\r\nTrue friend and follower, how well dost thou prove thy loyalty\r\nto our house! As a steed of generous race, though old, loses not\r\ncourage in danger, but pricks his ear, even so thou urgest us forward,\r\nand art foremost in our support. I will tell thee, then, what I have\r\ndetermined; listen closely to my words, and correct me, if I miss\r\nthe mark in aught.\r\nWhen I went to the Pythian oracle, to learn how I might avenge\r\nmy father on his murderers, Phoebus gave me the response which thou\r\nart now to hear:- that alone, and by stealth, without aid of arms or\r\nnumbers, I should snatch the righteous vengeance of my hand.

Tell them, and confirm it with\r\nthine oath, that Orestes hath perished by a fatal chance,- hurled at\r\nthe Pythian games from his rapid chariot; be that the substance of thy\r\nstory.\r\nWe, meanwhile, will first crown my father's tomb, as the god\r\nenjoined, with drink-offerings and the luxuriant tribute of severed\r\nhair; then come back, bearing in our hands an urn of shapely\r\nbronze,-now hidden in the brushwood, as I think thou knowest,- so to\r\ngladden them with the false tidings that this my body is no more,\r\nbut has been consumed with fire and turned to ashes.

For if thou repel me now, thou wilt come back to seek me\r\nin thy trouble.\r\nELECTRA\r\nNay, dear sister, let none of these things in thy hands touch\r\nthe tomb; for neither custom nor piety allows thee to dedicate gifts\r\nor bring libations to our sire from a hateful wife. No- to the winds\r\nwith them or bury them deep in the earth, where none of them shall\r\never come near his place of rest; but, when she dies, let her find\r\nthese treasures laid up for her below.\r\nAnd were she not the most hardened of all women, she would never\r\nhave sought to pour these offerings of enmity on the grave of him whom\r\nshe slew. Think now if it is likely that the dead in the tomb should\r\ntake these honours kindly at her hand, who ruthlessly slew him, like a\r\nfoeman, and mangled him, and, for ablution, wiped off the blood-stains\r\non his head? Canst thou believe that these things which thou\r\nbringest will absolve her of the murder?\r\nIt is not possible. No, cast these things aside; give him rather a\r\nlock cut from thine own tresses, and on my part, hapless that I\r\nam,-scant gifts these, but my best,- this hair, not glossy with\r\nunguents, and this girdle, decked with no rich ornament. Then fall\r\ndown and pray that he himself may come in kindness from the world\r\nbelow, to aid us against our foes; and that the young Orestes may live\r\nto set his foot upon his foes in victorious might, that henceforth\r\nwe may crown our father's tomb with wealthier hands than those which\r\ngrace it now.\r\nI think, indeed, I think that he also had some part in sending her\r\nthese appalling dreams; still, sister, do this service, to help\r\nthyself, and me, and him, that most beloved of all men, who rests in\r\nthe realm of Hades, thy sire and mine.\r\nLEADER\r\nThe maiden counsels piously; and thou, friend, wilt do her\r\nbidding, if- thou art wise.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nI will.

But now, since he is absent, thou takest no heed of\r\nme, though thou hast said of me oft-times, and to many, that I am a\r\nbold and lawless tyrant, who insults thee and thine. I am guilty of no\r\ninsolence; I do but return the taunts that I often hear from thee.\r\nThy father- this is thy constant pretext- was slain by me. Yes, by\r\nme- I know it well; it admits of no denial; for justice slew him,\r\nand not I alone,- justice, whom it became thee to support, hadst\r\nthou been right-minded; seeing that this father of thine, whom thou\r\nart ever lamenting, was the one man of the Greeks who had the heart to\r\nsacrifice thy sister to the gods- he, the father, who had not shared\r\nthe mother's pangs.\r\nCome, tell me now, wherefore, or to please whom, did he\r\nsacrifice her? To please the Argives, thou wilt say? Nay, they had\r\nno right to slay my daughter. Or if, forsooth, it was to screen his\r\nbrother Menelaus that he slew my child, was he not to pay me the\r\npenalty for that? Had not Menelaus two children, who should in\r\nfairness have been taken before my daughter, as sprung from the sire\r\nand mother who had caused that voyage? Or had Hades some strange\r\ndesire to feast on my offspring, rather than on hers? Or had that\r\naccursed father lost all tenderness for the children of my womb, while\r\nhe was tender to the children of Menelaus? Was not that the part of\r\na callous and perverse parent? I think so, though differ from thy\r\njudgment; and so would say the dead, if she could speak. For myself,\r\nthen, I view the past without dismay; but if thou deemest me perverse,\r\nsee that thine own judgment is just, before thou blame thy neighbour.\r\nELECTRA\r\nThis time thou canst not say that I have done anything to\r\nprovoke such words from thee. But, if thou wilt give me leave, I\r\nfain would declare the truth, in the cause alike of my dead sire and\r\nof my sister.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nIndeed, thou hast my leave; and didst thou always address me in\r\nsuch a tone, thou wouldst be heard without pain.\r\nELECTRA\r\nThen I will speak. Thou sayest that thou hast slain my father.\r\nWhat word could bring thee deeper shame than that, whether the deed\r\nwas just or not? But I must tell thee that thy deed was not just;\r\nno, thou wert drawn on to it by the wooing of the base man who is\r\nnow thy spouse.\r\nAsk the huntress Artemis what sin she punished when she stayed the\r\nfrequent winds at Aulis; or I will tell thee; for we may not learn\r\nfrom her. My father- so I have heard- was once disporting himself in\r\nthe grove of the goddess, when his footfall startled a dappled and\r\nantlered stag; he shot it, and chanced to utter a certain boast\r\nconcerning its slaughter. Wroth thereat, the daughter of Leto detained\r\nthe Greeks, that, in quittance for the wild creature's life, my father\r\nshould yield up the life of his own child. Thus it befell that she was\r\nsacrificed; since the fleet had no other release, homeward or to Troy;\r\nand for that cause, under sore constraint and with sore reluctance, at\r\nlast he slew her- not for the sake of Menelaus.\r\nBut grant- for I will take thine own plea- grant that the motive\r\nof his deed was to benefit his brother;- was that a reason for his\r\ndying by thy hand? Under what law? See that, in making such a law\r\nfor men, thou make not trouble and remorse for thyself; for, if we are\r\nto take blood for blood, thou wouldst be the first to die, didst\r\nthou meet with thy desert.\r\nBut look if thy pretext is not false. For tell me, if thou wilt,\r\nwherefore thou art now doing the most shameless deeds of all,-\r\ndwelling as wife with that blood-guilty one, who first helped thee\r\nto slay my sire, and bearing children to him, while thou hast cast out\r\nthe earlier-born, the stainless offspring of a stainless marriage. How\r\ncan I praise these things? Or wilt thou say that this, too, is thy\r\nvengeance for thy daughter? Nay, shameful plea, if so thou plead; 'tis\r\nnot well to wed an enemy for a daughter's sake.\r\nBut indeed I may not even counsel thee,- who shriekest that I\r\nrevile my mother; and truly I think that to me thou art less a\r\nmother than mistress; so wretched is the life that I live, ever\r\nbeset with miseries by thee and by thy partner. And that other, who\r\nscarce escaped thy hand, the hapless Orestes, is wearing out his\r\nill-starred days in exile. Often hast thou charged me with rearing him\r\nto punish thy crime; and I would have done so, if I could, thou\r\nmayst be sure:-for that matter, denounce me to all, as disloyal, if\r\nthou wilt, or petulant, or impudent; for if I am accomplished in\r\nsuch ways, methinks I am no unworthy child of thee.\r\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\r\nI see that she breathes forth anger; but whether justice be with\r\nher, for this she seems to care no longer.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA  (to the CHORUS)\r\nAnd what manner of care do I need to use against her, who hath\r\nthus insulted a mother, and this at her ripe age? Thinkest thou not\r\nthat she would go forward to any deed, without shame?\r\nELECTRA\r\nNow be assured that I do feel shame for this, though thou\r\nbelieve it not; I know that my behaviour is unseemly, and becomes me\r\nill. But then the enmity on thy part, and thy treatment, compel me\r\nin mine own despite to do thus; for base deeds are taught by base.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nThou brazen one! Truly I and my sayings and my deeds give thee too\r\nmuch matter for words.\r\nELECTRA\r\nThe words are thine, not mine; for thine is the action; and the\r\nacts find the utterance.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nNow by our lady Artemis, thou shalt not fail to pay for this\r\nboldness, so soon as Aegisthus returns.\r\nELECTRA\r\nLo, thou art transported by anger, after granting me free\r\nspeech, aid hast no patience to listen.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nNow wilt thou not hush thy clamour, or even suffer me to\r\nsacrifice, when I have permitted thee to speak unchecked?\r\nELECTRA\r\nI hinder not,- begin thy rites, I pray thee; and blame not my\r\nvoice, for I shall say no more.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nRaise then, my handmaid, the offerings of many fruits, that I\r\nmay uplift my prayers to this our king, for deliverance from my\r\npresent fears.

And if any are\r\nplotting to hurl me by treachery from the high estate which now is\r\nmine, permit them not; rather vouch. safe that, still living thus\r\nunscathed, I may bear sway over the house of the Atreidae and this\r\nrealm, sharing prosperous days with the friends who share them now,\r\nand with those of my children from whom no enmity or bitterness\r\npursues me.\r\nO Lycean Apollo, graciously hear these prayers, and grant them\r\nto us all, even as we ask! For the rest, though I be silent, I deem\r\nthat thou, a god, must know it; all things, surely, are seen by the\r\nsons of Zeus.\r\n(The PAEDAGOGUS enters.)\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nLadies, might a stranger crave to know if this be the palace of\r\nthe king Aegisthus?\r\nLEADER\r\nIt is, sir; thou thyself hast guessed aright.\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nAnd am I right in surmising that this lady is his consort?

Tell me: coming from a friend, thou wilt bring, I\r\nknow; a kindly message.\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nOrestes is dead; that is the sum.\r\nELECTRA\r\nOh, miserable that I am! I am lost this day!\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nWhat sayest thou, friend, what sayest thou?- listen not to her!\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nI said, and say again- Orestes is dead.\r\nELECTRA\r\nI am lost, hapless one, I am undone!\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA  (to ELECTRA)\r\nSee thou to thine own concerns.- But do thou, sir, tell me\r\nexactly,-how did he perish?\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nI was sent for that purpose, and will tell thee all. Having gone\r\nto the renowned festival, the pride of Greece, for the Delphian games,\r\nwhen he heard the loud summons to the foot-race which was first to\r\nbe decided, he entered the lists, a brilliant form, a wonder in the\r\neyes of all there; and, having finished his course at the point\r\nwhere it began, he went out with the glorious meed of victory. To\r\nspeak briefly, where there is much to tell, I know not the man whose\r\ndeeds and triumphs have matched his; but one thing thou must know;\r\nin all the contests that the judges announced, he bore away the prize;\r\nand men deemed him happy, as oft as the herald proclaimed him an\r\nArgive, by name Orestes, son of Agamemnon, who once gathered the\r\nfamous armament of Greece.\r\nThus far, 'twas well; but, when a god sends harm, not even the\r\nstrong man can escape. For, on another day, when chariots were to\r\ntry their speed at sunrise, he entered, with many charioteers. One was\r\nan Achaean, one from Sparta, two masters of yoked cars were Libyans;\r\nOrestes, driving Thessalian mares, came fifth among them; the sixth\r\nfrom Aetolia, with chestnut colts; a Magnesian was the seventh; the\r\neighth, with white horses, was of Aenian stock; the ninth, from\r\nAthens, built of gods; there was a Boeotian too, making the tenth\r\nchariot.\r\nThey took their stations where the appointed umpires placed them\r\nby lot and ranged the cars; then, at the sound of the brazen trump,\r\nthey started. All shouted to their horses, and shook the reins in\r\ntheir hands; the whole course was filled with the noise of rattling\r\nchariots; the dust flew upward; and all, in a confused throng, plied\r\ntheir goads unsparingly, each of them striving to pass the wheels\r\nand the snorting steeds of his rivals; for alike at their backs and at\r\ntheir rolling wheels the breath of the horses foamed and smote.\r\nOrestes, driving close to the pillar at either end of the\r\ncourse, almost grazed it with his wheel each time, and, giving rein to\r\nthe trace-horse on the right, checked the horse on the inner side.\r\nHitherto, all the chariots had escaped overthrow; but presently the\r\nAenian's hard-mouthed colts ran away, and, swerving, as they passed\r\nfrom the sixth into the seventh round, dashed their foreheads\r\nagainst the team of the Barcaean. Other mishaps followed the first,\r\nshock on shock and crash on crash, till the whole race-ground of Crisa\r\nwas strewn with the wreck of the chariots.\r\nSeeing this, the wary charioteer from Athens drew aside and\r\npaused, allowing the billow of chariots, surging in mid course, to\r\ngo by. Orestes was driving last, keeping his horses behind,- for his\r\ntrust was in the end; but when he saw that the Athenian was alone left\r\nin, he sent a shrill cry ringing through the ears of his swift\r\ncolts, and gave chase. Team was brought level with team, and so they\r\nraced,-first one man, then the other. showing his head in front of the\r\nchariots.\r\nHitherto the ill-fated Orestes had passed safely through every\r\nround, steadfast in his steadfast car; at last, slackening his left\r\nrein while the horse was turning, unawares he struck the edge of the\r\npillar; he broke the axle-box in twain; he was thrown over the\r\nchariot-rail; he was caught in the shapely reins; and, as he fell on\r\nthe ground, his colts were scattered into the middle of the course.\r\nBut when the people saw him fallen from the car, a cry of pity\r\nwent up for the youth, who had done such deeds and was meeting such\r\na doom,- now dashed to earth, now tossed feet uppermost to the sky,-\r\ntill the charioteers, with difficulty checking the career of his\r\nhorses, loosed him, so covered with blood that no friend who saw it\r\nwould have known the hapless corpse. Straightway they burned it on a\r\npyre; and chosen men of Phocis are bringing in a small urn of bronze\r\nthe sad dust of that mighty form, to find due burial in his\r\nfatherland.\r\nSuch is my story,- grievous to hear, if words can grieve; but\r\nfor us, who beheld, the greatest of sorrows that these eyes have seen.\r\nLEADER\r\nAlas, alas Now, methinks, the stock of our ancient masters hath\r\nutterly perished, root and branch.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nO Zeus, what shall I call these tidings,- glad tidings? Or dire,\r\nbut gainful? 'Tis a bitter lot, when mine own calamities make the\r\nsafety of my life.\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nWhy art thou so downcast, lady, at this news?\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nThere is a strange power in motherhood; a mother may be wronged,\r\nbut she never learns to hate her child.\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nThen it seems that we have come in vain.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nNay, not in vain; how canst thou say 'in vain,' when thou hast\r\nbrought an sure proofs of his death?- His, who sprang from mine own\r\nlife, yet, forsaking me who had suckled and reared him, became an\r\nexile and an alien; and, after he went out of this land, he saw me\r\nno more; but, charging me with the murder of his sire, he uttered\r\ndread threats against me; so that neither by night nor by day could\r\nsweet sleep cover mine eyes, but from moment to moment I lived in fear\r\nof death. Now, however-since this day I am rid of terror from him, and\r\nfrom this girl,- that worse plague who shared my home, while still she\r\ndrained my very life-blood,-now, methinks, for aught that she can\r\nthreaten, I shall pass my days in peace.\r\nELECTRA\r\nAh, woe is me! Now, indeed, Orestes, thy fortune may be\r\nlamented, when it is thus with thee, and thou art mocked by this thy\r\nmother! Is it not well?\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nNot with thee; but his state is well.\r\nELECTRA\r\nHear, Nemesis of him who hath lately died!\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nShe hath heard who should be heard, and hath ordained well.\r\nELECTRA\r\nInsult us, for this is the time of thy triumph.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nThen will not Orestes and thou silence me?\r\nELECTRA\r\nWe are silenced; much less should we silence thee.\r\nCLYTEMNESTRA\r\nThy coming, sir, would deserve large recompense, if thou hast\r\nhushed her clamorous tongue.\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nThen I may take my leave, if all is well."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CLYTEMNESTRA\r\nNot so; thy welcome would then be unworthy of me, and of the\r\nally who sent thee.

Whose part else was that, save mine and thine? And I did\r\nit not, I know,- nor thou; how shouldst thou?- when thou canst not\r\nleave this house, even to worship the gods, but at thy peril. Nor,\r\nagain, does our mother's heart incline to do such deeds, nor could she\r\nhave so done without our knowledge.\r\nNo, these offerings are from Orestes! Come, dear sister,\r\ncourage! No mortal life is attended by a changeless fortune. Ours\r\nwas once gloomy; but this day, perchance, will seal the promise of\r\nmuch good.\r\nELECTRA\r\nAlas for thy folly! How I have been pitying thee!\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nWhat, are not my tidings welcome?\r\nELECTRA\r\nThou knowest not whither or into what dreams thou wanderest.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nShould I not know what mine own eyes have seen?\r\nELECTRA\r\nHe is dead, poor girl; and thy hopes in that deliverer are gone:\r\nlook not to him.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nWoe, woe is me! From whom hast thou heard this?\r\nELECTRA\r\nFrom the man who was present when he perished.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nAnd where is he? Wonder steals over my mind.\r\nELECTRA\r\nHe is within, a guest not unpleasing to our mother.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nAh, woe is me! Whose, then, can have been those ample offerings to\r\nour father's tomb?\r\nELECTRA\r\nMost likely, I think, some one brought those gifts in memory of\r\nthe dead Orestes.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nOh, hapless that I am! And I was bringing such news in joyous\r\nhaste, ignorant, it seems, how dire was our plight; but now that I\r\nhave come, I find fresh sorrows added to the old!\r\nELECTRA\r\nSo stands thy case; yet, if thou wilt hearken to me, thou wilt\r\nlighten the load of our present trouble.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nCan I ever raise the dead to life?\r\nELECTRA\r\nI meant not that; I am not so foolish.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nWhat biddest thou, then, for which my strength avails?\r\nELECTRA\r\nThat thou be brave in doing what I enjoin.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nNay, if any good can be done, I will not refuse,\r\nELECTRA\r\nRemember, nothing succeeds without toil.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nI know it, and will share thy burden with all my power.\r\nELECTRA\r\nHear, then, how I am resolved to act. As for the support of\r\nfriends, thou thyself must know that we have none; Hades hath taken\r\nour friends away. and we two are left alone. I, so long as I heard\r\nthat my brother still lived and prospered, had hopes that he would yet\r\ncome to avenge the murder of our sire. But now that he is no more, I\r\nlook next to thee, not to flinch from aiding me thy sister to slay our\r\nfather's murderer, Aegisthus:- I must have no secret from thee more.\r\nHow long art thou to wait inactive? What hope is left standing, to\r\nwhich thine eyes can turn? Thou hast to complain that thou art\r\nrobbed of thy father's heritage; thou hast to mourn that thus far\r\nthy life is fading without nuptial song or wedded love. Nay, and do\r\nnot hope that such joys will ever be thine; Aegisthus is not so\r\nill-advised as ever to permit that children should spring from thee or\r\nme for his own sure destruction. But if thou wilt follow my\r\ncounsels, first thou wilt win praise of piety from our dead sire\r\nbelow, and from our brother too; next, thou shalt be called free\r\nhenceforth, as thou wert born, and shalt find worthy bridals; for\r\nnoble natures draw the gaze of all.\r\nThen seest thou not what fair fame thou wilt win for thyself and\r\nfor me, by hearkening to my word? What citizen or stranger, when he\r\nsees us, will not greet us with praises such as these?- 'Behold\r\nthese two sisters, my friends, who saved their father's house; who,\r\nwhen their foes were firmly planted of yore, took their lives in their\r\nhands and stood forth as avengers of blood! Worthy of love are these\r\ntwain, worthy of reverence from all; at festivals, and wherever the\r\nfolk are assembled, let these be honoured of all men for their\r\nprowess.' Thus will every one speak of us, so that in life and in\r\ndeath our glory shall not fail.\r\nCome, dear sister, hearken! Work with thy sire, share the burden\r\nof thy brother, win rest from woes for me and for thyself,- mindful of\r\nthis, that an ignoble life brings shame upon the noble.\r\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\r\nIn such case as this, forethought is helpful for those who speak\r\nand those who hear.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nYea, and before she spake, my friends, were she blest with a sound\r\nmind, she would have remembered caution, as she doth not remember it.\r\nNow whither canst thou have turned thine eyes, that thou art\r\narming thyself with such rashness, and calling me to aid thee? Seest\r\nthou not, thou art a woman, not a man, and no match for thine\r\nadversaries in strength? And their fortune prospers day by day,\r\nwhile ours is ebbing and coming to nought. Who, then, plotting to\r\nvanquish a foe so strong, shall escape without suffering deadly\r\nscathe? See that we change not our evil plight to worse, if any one\r\nhears these words. It brings us no relief or benefit, if, after\r\nwinning fair fame, we die an ignominious death; for mere death is\r\nnot the bitterest, but rather when one who wants to die cannot\r\nobtain even that boon.\r\nNay, I beseech thee, before we are utterly destroyed, and leave\r\nour house desolate, restrain thy rage! I will take care that thy words\r\nremain secret and harmless; and learn thou the prudence, at last\r\nthough late, of yielding, when so helpless, to thy rulers.\r\nLEADER\r\nHearken; there is no better gain for mortals to win than foresight\r\nand a prudent mind.\r\nELECTRA\r\nThou hast said nothing unlooked-for; I well knew that thou wouldst\r\nreject what I proffered. Well! I must do this deed with mine own hand,\r\nand alone; for assuredly I will not leave it void.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nAlas! Would thou hadst been so purposed on the day of our father's\r\ndeath! What mightst thou not have wrought?\r\nELECTRA\r\nMy nature was the same then, but my mind less ripe.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nStrive to keep such a mind through all thy life.\r\nELECTRA\r\nThese counsels mean that thou wilt not share my deed.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nNo; for the venture is likely to bring disaster.\r\nELECTRA\r\nI admire thy prudence; thy cowardice I hate.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nI will listen not less calmly when thou praise me.\r\nELECTRA\r\nNever fear to suffer that from me.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nTime enough in the future to decide that.\r\nELECTRA\r\nBegone; there is no power to help in thee.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nNot so; but in thee, no mind to learn.\r\nELECTRA\r\nGo, declare all this to thy mother!\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nBut, again, I do not hate thee with such a hate.\r\nELECTRA\r\nYet know at least to what dishonour thou bringest me.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nDishonour, no! I am only thinking of thy good.\r\nELECTRA\r\nAm I bound, then, to follow thy rule of right?\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nWhen thou art wise, then thou shalt be our guide.\r\nELECTRA\r\nSad, that one who speaks so well should speak amiss!\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nThou hast well described the fault to which thou cleavest.\r\nELECTRA\r\nHow? Dost thou not think that I speak with justice?\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nBut sometimes justice itself is fraught with harm.\r\nELECTRA\r\nI care not to live by such a law.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nWell, if thou must do this, thou wilt praise me yet.\r\nELECTRA\r\nAnd do it I will, no whit dismayed by thee.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nIs this so indeed? Wilt thou not change thy counsels?\r\nELECTRA\r\nNo, for nothing is more hateful than bad counsel.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nThou seemest to agree with nothing that I urge.\r\nELECTRA\r\nMy resolve is not new, but long since fixed.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nThen I will go; thou canst not be brought to approve my words, nor\r\nto commend thy conduct.\r\nELECTRA\r\nNay, go within; never will I follow thee, however much thou\r\nmayst desire it; it were great folly even to attempt an idle quest.\r\nCHRYSOTHEMIS\r\nNay, if thou art wise in thine own eyes, be such wisdom thine;\r\nby and by, when thou standest in evil plight, thou wilt praise my\r\nwords.\r\n(CHRYSOTHEMIS goes into the palace.)\r\nCHORUS  (singing)"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                                                         strophe 1\r\n\r\nWhen we see the birds of the air, with sure instinct, careful to\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"nourish those who give them life and nurture, why do not we pay\r\nthese debts in like measure?

Now have done with this long discourse, these insatiate\r\ncries of joy, and pass within; for in such deeds delay is evil, and\r\n'tis well to make an end.\r\nORESTES\r\nWhat, then, will be my prospects when I enter?\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nGood; for thou art secured from recognition.\r\nORESTES\r\nThou hast reported me, I presume, as dead?\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nKnow that here thou art numbered with the shades.\r\nORESTES\r\nDo they rejoice, then, at these tidings? Or what say they?\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nI will tell thee at the end; meanwhile, all is well for us on\r\ntheir party-even that which is not well.\r\nELECTRA\r\nWho is this, brother? I pray thee, tell me.\r\nORESTES\r\nDost thou not perceive?\r\nELECTRA\r\nI cannot guess.\r\nORESTES\r\nKnowest thou not the man to whose hands thou gavest me once?\r\nELECTRA\r\nWhat man?

O sole preserver of Agamemnon's house, how hast thou\r\ncome? Art thou he indeed, who didst save my brother and myself from\r\nmany sorrows? O dearest hands; O messenger whose feet were kindly\r\nservants! How couldst thou be with me so long, and remain unknown, nor\r\ngive a ray of light, but afflict me by fables, while possessed of\r\ntruths most sweet? Hail, father,- for 'tis a father that I seem to\r\nbehold! All hail,- and know that I have hated thee, and loved thee, in\r\none day, as never man before!\r\nPAEDAGOGUS\r\nEnough, methinks; as for the story of the past, many are the\r\ncircling nights, and days as many, which shall show it thee,\r\nElectra, in its fulness.
