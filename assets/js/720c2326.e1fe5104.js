For a moment, Harry considered\r\nsuggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione\r\nmurmured, "Let\'s go this way," and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the\r\nvillage in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the\r\npoint where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked\r\nas quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the\r\noutlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains.\r\n"How are we going to find Bathilda\'s house?" asked Hermione, who was shivering a little\r\nand kept glancing back over her shoulder. "Harry? What do you think? Harry?"\r\nShe tugged at this arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the\r\ndark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he sped up,\r\ndragging Hermione along with him, she slipped a little on the ice.\r\n"Harry --"\r\n"Look ... Look at it, Hermione ..."\r\n"I don\'t ... oh!"\r\nHe could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had\r\ngrown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay\r\nscattered amongst the waist-high grass.

Harry replied. "Maybe it\'s like the injuries from Dark\r\nMagic and you can\'t repair the damage?"\r\nHe slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate,\r\nnot wishing to open it, but simply so he\'d some part of the house.\r\n"You\'re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might -- oh, Harry, look!"\r\nHis touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front\r\nof them, up thorough the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing\r\nflower, and in golden letters upon the wood it said:\r\nOn this spot, on this night of 31 October 1981,\r\nLily and James Potter lost their lives.\r\nTheir son, Harry, remains the only wizard\r\never to have survived the Killing Curse.\r\nThis house, invisible to Muggles, has been left\r\nin its ruined state as a monument to the Potters\r\nand as a reminder of the violence\r\nthat tore apart their family.\r\nAnd all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches\r\nand wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped.\r\nSome had merely signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials\r\ninto the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly\r\nover sixteen years\' worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things.\r\nGood luck, Harry, wherever you are.\r\nIf you read this, Harry, we\'re all behind you!\r\nLong live Harry Potter.\r\n"They shouldn\'t have written on the sign!" said Hermione, indignant.\r\nBut Harry beamed at her.\r\n"It\'s brilliant. I\'m glad they did. I ..."\r\nHe broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted\r\nby the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that\r\nthe figure was a woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the\r\nsnowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'extreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see\r\nwhether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew\r\ninstinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and\r\nsimply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them.\r\nHe did not need Hermione\'s pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this\r\nwoman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been\r\ncompletely invisible to her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch,\r\nhowever, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old\r\nruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see\r\nHermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that\r\nthey were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion,\r\nshe raised a gloved hand and beckoned.\r\nHermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his.\r\n"How does she know?"\r\nHe shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of\r\nmany reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were\r\ngrowing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street.\r\nWas it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months? That\r\nDumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely\r\nthat it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to\r\nthis spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he\r\nhad never encountered before.\r\nFinally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump.\r\n"Are you Bathilda?"\r\nThe muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.\r\nBeneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows;\r\nHermione gave a tiny, nervous nod.\r\nThey stepped toward the woman and , at once, she turned and hobbled off back the way\r\nthey had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed\r\nher up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left.\r\nShe fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back\r\nto let them pass.\r\nShe smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house; Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past\r\nher and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was;\r\nbowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into\r\nHarry\'s face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin,\r\nand her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether\r\nshe could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose\r\nidentity he had stolen that she would see.\r\nThe odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as the\r\nunwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which\r\nthe scalp showed clearly.\r\n"Bathilda?" Harry repeated.\r\nShe nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it\r\nthat sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold.\r\nDid it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?\r\nBathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and\r\nvanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.\r\n"Harry, I\'m not sure about this," breathed Hermione.\r\n"Look at the size of her, I think we could overpower her if we had to," said Harry. "Listen,\r\nI should have told you, I knew she wasn\'t all there. Muriel called her \'gaga.\'"\r\n"Come!" called Bathilda from the next room.\r\nHermione jumped and clutched Harry\'s arm.\r\n"It\'s okay," said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room.\r\nBathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to\r\nmention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry\'s nose\r\ndetected, underneath the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone bad.\r\nHe wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda\'s house to check\r\nwhether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for\r\nshe lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching\r\nfire.\r\n"Let me do that," offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching\r\nhim as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room,\r\nperched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and\r\nmoldy cups.\r\nThe last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest of drawers on\r\nwhich there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced into life, its\r\nreflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from the'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered "Tergeo": The dust\r\nvanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from\r\nthe largest and most ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had\r\nremoved them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his\r\neye, and he snatched it up.\r\nIt was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on\r\nGregorovitch\'s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came\r\nto Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus\r\nDumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the\r\nmissing photographs were: in Rita\'s book.\r\n"Mrs. -- Miss -- Bagshot?" he said, and his voice shook slightly. "Who is this?"\r\nBathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her.\r\n"Miss Bagshot?" Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the\r\nflames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux\r\nbeat faster upon his chest.\r\n"Who is this person?" Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward.\r\nShe peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry.\r\n"Do you know who this is?" he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual.\r\n"This man? Do you know him? What\'s he called?"\r\nBathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter\r\nunlocked Bathilda\'s memories?\r\n"Who is this man?" he repeated loudly.\r\n"Harry, what area you doing?" asked Hermione.\r\n"This picture. Hermione, it\'s the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!" he\r\nsaid to Bathilda. "Who is this?"\r\nBut she only stared at him.\r\n"Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. - Miss -- Bagshot?" asked Hermione,\r\nraising her own voice. "Was there something you wanted to tell us?"\r\nGiving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to\r\nHarry. With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall.\r\n"You want us to leave?" he asked.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself, then at the\r\nceiling.\r\n"Oh, right... Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her."\r\n"All right," said Hermione, "let\'s go."\r\nBut when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more\r\npointing first at Harry, then to herself.\r\n"She wants me to go with her, alone."\r\n"Why?" asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room, the\r\nold lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.\r\n"Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?"\r\n"Do you really think she knows who you are?"\r\n"Yes," said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own. "I think she\r\ndoes."\r\n"Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry."\r\n"Lead the way," Harry told Bathilda.\r\nShe seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the door. Harry\r\nglanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it;\r\nshe stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the\r\nbookcase. As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he\r\nslipped the silver-framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket.\r\nThe stairs were steep and narrow; Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout\r\nBathilda\'s backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which\r\nseemed only too likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing,\r\nturned immediately right, and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom.\r\nIt was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot\r\nprotruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was\r\nswallowed by the darkness.\r\n"Lumos," said Harry, and his wand ignited.

Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-\r\ntip.\r\n"Have you got anything for me?" he repeated.\r\nThen she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry\'s scar prickled\r\npainfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark,\r\nfetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice:\r\nHold him!\r\nHarry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him\r\nagain; he did not know what had just happened.\r\n"Have you got anything for me?" he asked for a third time, much louder.\r\n"Over here," she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the\r\noutline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window.\r\nThis time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand\r\nraised. He did not want to look away from her.\r\n"What is it?" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what\r\nlooked and smelled like dirty laundry.\r\n"There," she said, pointing at the shapeless mass.\r\nAnd in the instant that he looked away, his eyes taking the tangled mess for a sword hilt,\r\na ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn\r\nand horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring\r\nfrom the place where her neck had been.\r\nThe snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand\r\nspinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was\r\nextinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of\r\nhim: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing --\r\nHe rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake\'s tail, which thrashed down upon the\r\ntable where he had been a second earlier.

"Yesss... hold you ... hold you ..."\r\n"Accio ...

Harry\r\nraised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it\r\nhad done in years.\r\n"He\'s coming! Hermione, he\'s coming!"\r\nAs he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves\r\nfrom the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and\r\nseized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione --\r\nShe shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but\r\nHarry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his\r\nhead was going to split open with the pain from his scar --\r\nThe snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck,\r\nHermione screamed, "Confringo!" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the\r\nwardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt\r\nthe heat of it sear the back of his hand.

Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every\r\nminor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful\r\nthan those he had produced with his phoenix wand.

"Its all a matter of confidence Harry."\r\nHe knew why she wanted it to be all right; She still felt guilty about\r\nbreaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she\r\ncould take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he\r\nwould have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he\r\nagreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and\r\nvanished behind her book once more.\r\nAll three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took\r\nfirst watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand\r\nlevitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and\r\nless powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk\r\nreading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small\r\nwooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it.\r\n"There\'s this one program," he told Harry in a low voice, "that tells the\r\nnews like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who\'s side and are\r\nfollowing the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it\'s\r\ngreat.

Come in, quickly, Quickly!"\r\nThey were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door\r\nshut behind them, They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had\r\never seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that he felt like being\r\ninside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls - the\r\nstove, the sink, and the cupboards - and all of it had been painted with\r\nflowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he\r\nrecognized Luna\'s styles. The effect in such and enclosed space, was\r\nslightly overwhelming.\r\nIn the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase ld to the\r\nupper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from\r\noverhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.\r\n"You\'d better come up." said Xenophilius, still looking extremely\r\nuncomfortable, and he led the way.\r\nThe room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace,'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller\r\nand entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on\r\nthe unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic\r\nlabyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon\r\npiles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of\r\ncreatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung\r\nfrom the ceiling.\r\nLuna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden\r\nobject covered in magically turning cogs and wheels, It looked like the\r\nbizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves, but after a moment\r\nHarry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the fact\r\nthat it was churning out Quibblers.\r\n"Excuse me," said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized\r\ngrubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers,\r\nwhich all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat\r\nmuffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.\r\n"Why have you come here?"\r\nBefore Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock.\r\n"Mr. Lovegood - what\'s that?"\r\nSee was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a\r\nunicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into\r\nthe room.\r\n"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius.\r\n"No it isn\'t!" said Hermione.\r\n"Hermione," muttered Harry, embarrassed, "now\'s not the moment -"\r\n"But Harry, it\'s an Erumpent horn! It\'s a Class B Tradeable Material and\r\nit\'s an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house!"\r\n"How\'d you know it\'s an Erumpent horn?" asked Ron, edging away from the\r\nhorn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.\r\n"There\'s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr.\r\nLovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don\'t you know it can\r\nexplode at the slightest touch?"\r\n"The Crumple Horned Snorkack" said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish\r\nlook upon his face, is a shy and highly magical creature, and it\'s horn -"\r\n"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that\'s\r\nan Erumpent horn and it\'s incredibly dangerous - I don\'t know where you got\r\nit-"\r\n"I bought it," said Xenophilius dogmatically. "Two weeks ago, from a\r\ndelightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A\r\nChristmas surprise for my Luna. Now," he said, turning to Harry, "why\r\nexactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?"\r\n"We need some help," said Harry, before Hermione could start again.\r\n"Ah," said Xenophilius, "Help, Hmm."\r\nHis good eye moved again to Harry\'s scar. He seemed simultaneously\r\nterrified and mesmerized.\r\n"Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous..."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Aren\'t you the one who keeps telling everyone it\'s their first duty to\r\nhelp Harry?" said Ron. "In that magazine of yours?"\r\nXenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still\r\nbanging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.\r\n"Er - yes, I have expressed that view. however -"\r\n"That\'s for everyone else to do, not you personally?" said Ron.\r\nXenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between\r\nthe three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some\r\npainful internal struggle.\r\n"Where\'s Luna?" asked Hermione. "Let\'s see what she thinks."\r\nXenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in\r\na shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, "Luna\r\nis down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She...she will like\r\nto see you. I\'ll go and call her and then - yes, very well. I shall try to\r\nhelp you."\r\nHe disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open\r\nand close. They looked at each other.\r\n"Cowardly old wart," said Ron. "Luna\'s got ten times his guts."\r\n"He\'s probably worried about what\'ll happen to them if the Death Eaters\r\nfind out I was here" said Harry.\r\n"Well, I agree with Ron, " said Hermione, "Awful old hypocrite, telling\r\neveryone else to help you and trying to worm our of it himself. And for\r\nheaven\'s sake keep away from that horn."\r\nHarry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a\r\nstream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the\r\nhill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared\r\nin the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills.\r\nGinny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than\r\nthey had been since Bill and Fleur\'s wedding, but she could have no idea he\r\nwas gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He suppose he ought to be glad\r\nof it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius\'s attitude\r\nproved that.\r\nhe turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar\r\nobject standing upon the cluttered, curved slide board; a stone but of a\r\nbeautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking\r\nheaddress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from\r\nthe sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wing was stuck to a leather strap\r\nthat ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been\r\nstuck to a second strap around her forehead.\r\n"Look at this," said Harry.\r\n"Fetching," said Ron. "Surprised he didn\'t hear that to the wedding."\r\nThey heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius climbed\r\nback up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encase in\r\nWellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming\r\nteapot.\r\n"Ah, you have spotted my pet invention," he said, shoving the tray into'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Hermione\'s arms and joining Harry at the statue\'s side.\r\n"Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowens Ravenclaw,\r\n\'Wit beyond measure is a man\'s greatest treasure!\'"\r\nHe indicated the objects like ear trumpets.\r\n"These are the Wrackpurt siphons - to remove all sources of distraction\r\nfrom the thinker\'s immediate area.

"We\r\nmake it ourselves." As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply\r\npurple as beetroot juice, he added, "Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she\r\nis most excited that you are here She ought not to be too long, she has\r\ncaught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and\r\nhelp yourselves to sugar.\r\n"Now," he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat\r\ndown, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, "how may I help you, Mr. Potter?"\r\n"Well," said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly,\r\n"it\'s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and\r\nFleur\'s wedding, Mr. Lovegood.

"You know\r\nthe only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful\r\nwands for hundreds of years."\r\n"There have?" asked Harry.\r\nHermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and\r\nRon grinned at each other.\r\n"The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the\r\ncenturies, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard whos boasting about them.\r\nProfessor Binns mentioned some of them, but -- oh it\'s all nonsense.

His\r\nwand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by\r\nOllivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies\r\nand if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken?\r\n"So why would you take the stone?" Ron asked him.\r\n"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius...Mad-\r\nEye...Dumbledore...my parents..."\r\nNeither Ron nor Hermione smiled.\r\n"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn\'t want to come back, would they?" said\r\nHarry, thinking about the tail they had just heard. "I don\'t suppose there have been loads\r\nof other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?: he asked Hermione.\r\n"No," she replied sadly. "I don\'t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves\r\nthat\'s possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer\'s Stone; you know,\r\ninstead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death."\r\nThe smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning\r\nunderpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever\r\nXenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings.\r\n"What about the Cloak, though?" said Ron slowly. "Don\'t you realize, he\'s right? I\'ve got\r\nso used to Harry\'s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I\'ve never heard of\r\none like Harry\'s. It\'s infallible. We\'ve never been spotted under it --"\r\n"Of course not -- we\'re invisible when we\'re under it, Ron!"\r\n"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they\'re not exactly ten a Knut, you know,\r\nis true! It\'s never occurred to me before but I\'ve heard stuff about charms wearing off\r\ncloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they\'ve got holes,\r\nHarry\'s was owned by his dad, so it\'s not exactly new, is it, but it\'s just ... perfect!"\r\n"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone..."\r\nAs they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching\r\nthe spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once.\r\nHis own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a\r\nmoment\'s bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he\r\nbegan to clime the stairs.\r\n"Harry, what are you doing? I don\'t think you should look around when he\'s not here!"\r\nBut Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling\r\nwith five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They\r\nwere not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about\r\nthem all the same. Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be a fine golden chains\r\nwove around the pictures linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or\r\nso, Harry realized that the chains were actually one work repeated a thousand times in\r\ngolden ink: friends... friends... friends...\r\nHarry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a\r\nlarge photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her.\r\nThey were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had\r\never seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were\r\nno clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look,\r\nas though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest\r\nwindow across the blood red sky.\r\n"What\'s wrong?" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could\r\nrespond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray\r\nladen with bowls.\r\n"Mr. Lovegood," said Harry. "Where\'s Luna?"\r\n"Excuse me?"\r\n"Where\'s Luna?"\r\nXenophilius halted on the top step.\r\n"I -- I\'ve already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge fishing for Plimpies."\r\n"So why have you only laid that tray for four?"\r\nXenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued\r\nchugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius\'s hands\r\nshook.\r\n"I don\'t think Luna\'s been here for weeks." said Harry. "Her clothes are gone, her bed\r\nhasn\'t been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?"\r\nXenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed Harry, Ron, and\r\nHermione drew their wands. Xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket. At that\r\nmoment the printing press have a huge bank and numerous Quibblers came streaming\r\nacross the floor from underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. Hermione\r\nstooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr.\r\nLovegood.\r\n"Harry, look at this" He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter.\r\nThe front of the Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words\r\n"Undesirable Number One" and captioned with the reward money.\r\n"The Quibbler\'s going for a new angle, then?: Harry asked coldly, his mind working very\r\nfast. "Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood?\r\nSending an owl to the Ministry?\r\nXenophilius licked his lips\r\n"They took my Luna," he whispered, "Because of what I\'ve been writing. They took my\r\nLuna and I don\'t know where she is, what they\'ve done to her. But they might give her\r\nback to me if I -- If I--"\r\n"Hand over Harry?" Hermione finished for him.\r\n"No deal." said Ron flatly. "Get out of the way, we\'re leaving."\r\nXenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer.\r\n"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not\r\nleave."\r\nHe spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother\r\ndoing the same thing in front of his crib.\r\n"Don\'t make us hurt you," Harry said. "Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood."\r\n"HARRY!" Hermione screamed.\r\nFigures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away\r\nfrom him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He\r\nlaunched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm\'s way as'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Xenophilius\'s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.\r\nThere was a colossal explosion.

Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the\r\nfloor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard\r\nHermione\'s scream, Ron\'s yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him\r\nthat Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.\r\nHalf buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust.\r\nHalf of the ceiling had fall in and the end of Luna\'s bead was hanging through the hole.\r\nThe bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of\r\ntorn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side,\r\nblocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen.

"Didn\'t I tell\r\nyou this nutter was just raving as usual?" There was a bang and a scream of pain from\r\nXenophilius.\r\n"No...no...upstairs...Potter!"\r\n"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren\'t coming back for anything less than some\r\nsolid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for\r\nthat stupid bleeding headdress?

"It really is Potter, Really!"\r\n"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!" roared the Death\r\nEater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from\r\nXenophilius.\r\n"The place looks like it\'s about to fall in, Selwyn," said a cool second voice, echoing up\r\nthe mangled staircase. "The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might\r\nbring the place down."\r\n"You lying piece of filth." shouted the wizard named Selwyn.\r\n"You have never seen Potter in your life, have you?

And you think you\'ll get your girl back like this?"\r\n"I swear...I swear...Potter\'s upstairs!"\r\n"Homenum revelio." said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp,\r\nand he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body\r\nin its shadow.\r\n"There\'s someone up there all right, Selwyn," said the second man sharply.\r\n"It\'s Potter, I tell you, it\'s Potter!" sobbed Xenophilius. "Please...please...give me Luna,\r\njust let me have Luna..."\r\n"You can have your little girl, Lovegood," said Selwyn, "if you get up those stairs and\r\nbring me down Harry Potter.

As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths\r\nof the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last\r\non a distant bank.\r\nHarry, Ron and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did\r\nnot seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of fighting their way\r\nthrough reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden,\r\npanting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.\r\nHermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have\r\nhappily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand,\r\nand started casting the usual protective spells around them.\r\nWhen he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that\r\nhe had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red\r\nburns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in\r\nplaces. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many\r\ninjuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of\r\npumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for\r\nall of them. They changes and then gulped down the juice.\r\n"Well, on the upside," said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the\r\nskin on his hands regrow, "we got the Horcrux. On the downside-"\r\n"-- no sword," said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany\r\nthrough the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath.\r\n"No sword," repeated Ron. "That double-crossing little scab..."\r\nHarry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just\r\ntaken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the\r\nsun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice.\r\n"At least we can\'t wear it this time, that\'d look a bit weird hanging\r\naround our necks," said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.\r\nHermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was\r\nstill drinking.\r\n"What\'ll happen to it, do you think?" she asked, "Will it be alright?"\r\n"You sound like Hagrid," said Ron, "It\'s a dragon, Hermione, it can look\r\nafter itself. It\'s us we need to worry about."\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n"Well I don\'t know how to break this to you," said Ron, "but I think\r\nthey might have noticed we broke into Gringotts."\r\nAll three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'to stop. Harry\'s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay\r\nback on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was\r\nraw.\r\n"What are we going to do, though?" said Hermione finally, hiccuping\r\nherself back to seriousness. "He\'ll know, won\'t he? You-Know-Who will know\r\nwe know about his Horcruxes!"\r\n"Maybe they\'ll be too scared to tell him!" said Ron hopefully, "Maybe\r\nthey\'ll cover up --"\r\nThe sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron\'s voice were\r\nextinguished. Pain cleaved Harry\'s head like a sword stroke. He was standing\r\nin a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor\r\nat his feet knelt a small, quaking figure.\r\n"What did you say to me?" His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear\r\nburned inside him. The one thing that he had dreaded - but it could not be\r\ntrue, he could not see how...\r\nThe goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his.\r\n"Say it again!" murmured Voldemort. "Say it again!"\r\n"M-my Lord," stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror,\r\n"m-my Lord... we t-tried to st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke -\r\nbroke into the - into the Lestranges\' vault..."\r\n"Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing\r\nimpostors? Who were they?\r\n"It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices..."\r\n"And they took?" he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping\r\nhim, "Tell me! What did they take?"\r\n"A... a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord..."\r\nThe scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger\'s. He\r\nwas crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had\r\nknown. How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret?\r\nThe Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through\r\nthe room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards\r\nscattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others\r\nbehind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell,\r\nand those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news,\r\nfor hearing about the golden cup -\r\nAlone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him\r\nin vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality - the\r\ndiary was destroyed and the cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew\r\nabout the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of\r\nthem? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always\r\nsuspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was\r\nhis now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the\r\nboy -\r\nBut surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord\r\nVoldemort, would have known, would have felt it?

How could Lord Voldemort not have known,\r\nif he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated?\r\nTrue, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had\r\nthought that was because he had no body to fell, being less than ghost...\r\nNo, surely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes must be intact...\r\nBut he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside\r\nthe goblin's corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his\r\nboiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts -\r\nA modicum of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he\r\nhad hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be\r\nrelated to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never\r\nbeen traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe.\r\nAnd how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate\r\nits protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd...\r\nAs for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the\r\nHorcrux, because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place...\r\nAnd there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to\r\ndo his bidding, under his protection...\r\nBut to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding\r\nplaces, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job,\r\nlike the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone...\r\nWhich should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease\r\nflickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name... Dumbledore\r\nmight have made the connection with the Gaunts... Their abandoned home was,\r\nperhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would\r\ngo first...\r\nThe lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility\r\nthat Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the\r\norphanage.\r\nAnd Hogwarts... but he knew the his Horcrux there was safe; it would be\r\nimpossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the\r\nschool. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that\r\nthe boy might try to reenter the castle. ... To tell Snape why the boy might\r\nreturn would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust\r\nBellatrix and Malfoy. Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how\r\nunwise it was ever to trust?\r\nHe would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He\r\nwould not be parted from the snake anymore ... and he strode from the room,\r\nthrough the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he\r\ncalled the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a\r\nlong shadow. ...\r\nHarry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He\r\nwas lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione\r\nwere looking down at him.

"We can\'t just go, we haven\'t got a\r\nplan, we need to -"\r\n"We need to get going," said Harry firmly.

Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a\r\ncrystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground\r\nand did not move.\r\n"I have more!" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the\r\nbanisters.

Here--"\r\nAnd with a move likea tennis serve, she heaved another enormous\r\ncrystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and\r\ncaused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a\r\nwindow. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst\r\nopen, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the\r\nfront hall.\r\nScreams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death\r\nEaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and\r\nreared, more terrifying than ever.\r\n"How do we get out?" yelled ron over all the screaming, but before\r\neither Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside;\r\nHagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery\r\npink umbrella.\r\n"Don\'t hurt \'em, don\'t hurt \'em!" he yelled.\r\n"HAGRID, NO!"\r\nHarry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak,\r\nrunning bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall.\r\n"HAGRID, COME BACK!"\r\nBut he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid\r\nvanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul\r\nswarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells,\r\nHagrid buried in their midst.\r\n"HAGRID!" Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend\r\nor foe he did not care: He was springint down the front steps into\r\nthe dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their\r\nprey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all.\r\n"HAGRID!"\r\nHe thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist\r\nof the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way\r\nwas impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the\r\ndarkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked\r\nup: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head ihidden in\r\nshadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light\r\nfrom the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed\r\na massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon\r\nHarryk, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway.\r\n"Oh my--!" shrieked Hermione, as she and ron caught up with Harry\r\nand gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through\r\nthe window above.\r\n"DON\'T!" ron yelled, grabbing Hermione\'s hand as she raised her\r\nwand. "Stun him and he\'ll crush half the castle--"\r\n"HAGGER?"\r\nGrawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only dnow did\r\nHarry realzie that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The\r\ngargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors\r\nturned around and let out a rorar. The stone steps tremebled as he\r\nstomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp\'s lopsided mouth fell\r\nopen, showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they\r\nlaunched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.\r\n"RUN!" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows\r\nas the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione\'s hand and tore down\r\nthe steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not\r\nlost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short\r\nagain.\r\nThe air around them had frozen: Harry\'s breath caught and\r\nsolidified in his chest.

He felt as though his soul had already half left his body....\r\n"HARRY, COME ON!" screamed Hermione.\r\nA hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking\r\ntheir way closer to Harry\'s despair, which was like a promise of a\r\nfeast...\r\nHe saw Ron\'s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and\r\nexpire; he saw Hermione\'s otter twist in midair and fade, and his\r\nown wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming\r\noblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling...\r\nAnd then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and\r\nHermione\'s heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures\'\r\napproach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to\r\nstand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast\r\nPatronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus.\r\n"That\'s right," said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in\r\nthe Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the\r\nD.A., "That\'s right, Harry...come on think of something happy..."\r\n\'something happy?" he said, his voice cracked.\r\n"We\'re all still here," she whispered, "we;re still fighting. Come\r\non, now...."\r\nThere was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the\r\ngreatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of\r\nHarry\'s wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered\r\nin earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the\r\nsounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears.\r\n"Can\'t thank you enough," said ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie,\r\nand Seamus "you just saved--"\r\nWith a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came\r\nlurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest,\r\nbrandishing a club taller than any of them.\r\n"RUN!"

Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out\r\nof breath that she could not speak.\r\n"How--how\'re we going to get in?" panted ron. "I can--see the palce-\r\n-if we jsut had--Crookshanks again--"\r\n"Crookshanks?" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest.\r\n"Are you a wizard, or what?"\r\n"Oh--right--yeah--"\r\nRon looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground\r\nand said "Winguardium Leviosa!" The twig flew up from the gruond,\r\nspun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed\r\ndirectly at the trunk through the Willow\'s ominously swaying\r\nbranches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the\r\nwrithing tree became still.\r\n"Perfect!" panted Hermione.\r\n"Wait."\r\nFor one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle\r\nfilled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this,\r\nwanted him to come...Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap?\r\nBut the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only\r\nway forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where\r\nVoldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel...'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Harry, we\'re coming, just get in there!" said Ron, pushing him\r\nforward.\r\nHarry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree\'s roots.\r\nIt was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they\r\nhad entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to\r\ndouble up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now\r\nthere was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand\r\nilluminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none\r\ncame. They moved in silence, Harry\'s gaze fixed upon the swinging\r\nbeam of the wand held in his fist. At last, the tunnel began to\r\nslope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged\r\nat his ankle.\r\n"The Cloak!" she whispered. "Put the Cloak on!"\r\nHe groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth\r\ninto his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself,\r\nmurmered, "Nox," extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his\r\nhands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining,\r\nexpecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear\r\nvoice, see a flash of green light.\r\nand then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of\r\nthem, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the\r\nendo fht etuunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old\r\ncrate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he\r\nopening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall.\r\nThe room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign\r\nand coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted,\r\nstarry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see\r\nthe edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a\r\nwand.\r\nThen Snape spoke, and Harry\'s heart lurched: Snape was inches away\r\nfrom where he crouched, hidden.\r\n"...my Lord, their resistance is crumbling--"\r\n"--and it is doing so without your help," said Voldemort in his\r\nhigh, clear voice. "Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do\r\nnot think you will make much difference now. We are almost\r\nthere...almost."\r\n"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find\r\nhim, my Lord. Please."\r\nSnape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping\r\nhis eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell\r\nthat might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could\r\nnot think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away\r\nhis position...\r\nVoldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the\r\nflattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in\r\nthe semidarkness.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"I have a problem, Severus," said Voldemort softly.\r\n"My Lord?" said Snape.\r\nVoldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and\r\nprecisely as a conductor\'s baton.\r\n"Why doesn\'t it work for me, Severus?"\r\nIn the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing\r\nslightly as it coiled and uncoiled--or was it Voldemort\'s sibilant\r\nsigh lingering on the air?\r\n"My--my lord?" said Snape blankly. "I do not understand. You--you\r\nhave performed extraordinary magic with that wand."\r\n"No," said Voldemort. "I have performed my usual magic. I am\r\nextraordinary, but this wand...no. It has not revealed the wonders\r\nit has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one\r\nI procured from Ollivander all those years ago."\r\nVoldemort\'s tone was musing, calm, but Harry\'s scar had begun to\r\nthrob and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could\r\nfeel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort.\r\n"No difference," said Voldemort again.\r\nSnape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered\r\nwhether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to\r\nreassure his master.\r\nVoldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him\r\nfor seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice,\r\nwhile the pain and fury mounted in Harry.\r\n"I have thought long and hard, Severus...do you know why I have\r\ncalled you back from battle?"\r\nAnd for a moment Harry saw Snape\'s profile. His eyes were fixed\r\nupon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage.\r\n"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter."\r\n"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do.\r\nHe does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I knew his\r\nweakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the\r\nothers struck down around him, knwoing that it is for him that it\r\nhappens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come."\r\n"But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than\r\nyourself--"\\\r\n"My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear.\r\nCapture Potter.

Very valuable."\r\n"My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But--let me go and find\r\nthe boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can--"\r\n"I have told you, no!" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the lgint\r\nof red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his\r\ncloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort\'s'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'impatience in his burning scar. "My concern at the moment, Severus,\r\nis what will happen when I finally meet the boy!"\r\n"My Lord, there can be no question, surely--?"\r\n"--but there is a question, Severus. There is."\r\nVoldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid\r\nthe Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape.\r\n"Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry\r\nPotter?"\r\n"I--I cannot answer that, my Lord."\r\n"Can\'t you?"\r\nThe stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry\'s head: he\r\nforced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out\r\nin pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking\r\ninto Snape\'s pale face.\r\n"My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except\r\nto kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under\r\ntorture of the twin cores, told me to take another\'s wand. I did\r\nso, but Lucius\'s wand shattered upon meeting Potter\'s."\r\n"I--I have no explanation, my Lord."\r\nSnape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still\r\nfixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.\r\n"I sought a third wand, Severus. the Elder Wand, the Wand of\r\nDestiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took\r\nit from the grfave of Albus Dumbledore."\r\nAnd now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape\'s face was like a\r\ndeath mask. it was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it\r\nwas a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.\r\n"My Lord--let me go to the boy--"\r\n"all this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat\r\nhere," said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper,\r\n"wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it\r\nought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for\r\nits rightful owner...and I think I have the answer."\r\nSnape did not speak.\r\n"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all,\r\nSeverus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret\r\nwhat must happen."\r\n"My Lord--"\r\n"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not\r\nits true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed\r\nits last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live,\r\nSeverus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine."\r\n"My Lord!" Snape protested, raising his wand.\r\n"It cannot be any other way," said Voldemort. "I must master the\r\nwand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last."\r\nAnd Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Sanpe, who for a split second seemed to think he had been\r\nreprieved: but then Voldemort\'s intention became clear. The snake\'s\r\ncage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do\r\nanything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders,\r\nand Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.\r\n"Kill."\r\nThere was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape\'s face losing the\r\nlittle color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as\r\nthe snake\'s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the\r\nenchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to\r\nthe floor.\r\n"I regret it," said Voldemort coldly.\r\nHe turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was\r\ntime to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would\r\nnow do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding\r\nthe snake, which drifted upward, off snape, who fell sideways onto\r\nthe floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort\r\nswept from the room without a backward glance, and the great\r\nserpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere.\r\nBack in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes; He had\r\ndrawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout\r\nout. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and\r\nwall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor.\r\n"Harry!" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed\r\nhis wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the\r\nair and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he\r\npulled himself up into the room.\r\nHe did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the\r\ndying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape\'s white\r\nface, adn the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his\r\nneck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon\r\nthe man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he cried\r\nto speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his\r\nrobes and pulled him close.\r\nA terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape\'s throat.\r\n"Take...it...Take...it..."\r\nSomething more than blood was leaking from Snape.
