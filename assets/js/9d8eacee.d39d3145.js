And later on they spoke of sweethearts and of wives.  Mate Damon's experiences had apparently been wide and varied.  They talked--or, rather, the mate talked, and Mr. Korner listened--of the olive-tinted beauties of the Spanish Main, of the dark-eyed passionate creoles, of the blond Junos of the Californian valleys.  The mate had theories concerning the care and management of women:  theories that, if the mate's word could be relied upon, had stood the test of studied application.  A new world opened out to Mr. Korner; a world where lovely women worshipped with doglike devotion men who, though loving them in return, knew how to be their masters.  Mr. Korner, warmed gradually from cold disapproval to bubbling appreciation, sat entranced.  Time alone set a limit to the recital of the mate's adventures.  At eleven o'clock the cook reminded them that the captain and the pilot might be aboard at any moment. Mr. Korner, surprised at the lateness of the hour, took a long and tender farewell of his cousin, and found St. Katherine's Docks one of the most bewildering places out of which he had ever tried to escape. Under a lamp-post in the Minories, it suddenly occurred to Mr. Korner that he was an unappreciated man.  Mrs. Korner never said and did the sort of things by means of which the beauties of the Southern Main endeavoured feebly to express their consuming passion for gentlemen superior in no way--as far as he could see--to Mr. Korner himself. Thinking over the sort of things Mrs. Korner did say and did do, tears sprung into Mr. Korner's eyes.  Noticing that a policeman was eyeing him with curiosity, he dashed them aside and hurried on.  Pacing the platform of the Mansion House Station, where it is always draughty, the thought of his wrongs returned to him with renewed force.  Why was there no trace of doglike devotion about Mrs. Korner?  The fault--so he bitterly told himself--the fault was his.  \"A woman loves her master; it is her instinct,\" mused Mr. Korner to himself.  \"Damme,\" thought Mr. Korner, \"I don't believe that half her time she knows I am her master.\""}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Go away," said Mr. Korner to a youth of pasty appearance who, with open mouth, had stopped immediately in front of him.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"\"I'm fond o' listening,\" explained the pasty youth."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Who\'s talking?" demanded Mr. Korner.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"You are," replied the pasty youth.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"It is a long journey from the city to Ravenscourt Park, but the task of planning out the future life of Mrs. Korner and himself kept Mr. Korner wide awake and interested.
