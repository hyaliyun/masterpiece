They were a noisy company, and certainly the quietest among them was not the general, who nursed on a sofa the leg which still held him captive after the recent attack, that to his old coachman and his two piebald horses had proved fatal. The story of the always-amiable Ivan Petrovitch (a lively, little, elderly man with his head bald as an egg) was about the evening before.

I knew the officer in command and invited him to come along with us and drink the Emperor's health at Cubat's place. That officer, Feodor Feodorovitch, is a man who knows vintages and boasts that he has never swallowed a glass of anything so common as Crimean wine.  When I named champagne he cried, 'Vive l'Empereur!' A true patriot.  So we started, merry as school-children.  The entire company followed, then all the diners playing little whistles, and all the servants besides, single file.  At Cubat's I hated to leave the companion-officers of my friend at the door, so I invited them in, too.  They accepted, naturally.  But the subalterns were thirsty as well.  I understand discipline.  You know, Feodor Feodorovitch, that I am a stickler for discipline.  Just because one is gay of a spring morning, discipline should not be forgotten. I invited the officers to drink in a private room, and sent the subalterns into the main hall of the restaurant.  Then the soldiers were thirsty, too, and I had drinks served to them out in the courtyard.  Then, my word, there was a perplexing business, for now the horses whinnied.  The brave horses, Feodor Feodorovitch, who also wished to drink the health of the Emperor.  I was bothered about the discipline.  Hall, court, all were full.  And I could not put the horses in private rooms.  Well, I made them carry out champagne in pails and then came the perplexing business I had tried so hard to avoid, a grand mixture of boots and horse-shoes that was certainly the liveliest thing I have ever seen in my life.  But the horses were the most joyous, and danced as if a torch was held under their nostrils, and all of them, my word! were ready to throw their riders because the men were not of the same mind with them as to the route to follow!  From our window we laughed fit to kill at such a mixture of sprawling boots and dancing hoofs.  But the troopers finally got all their horses to barracks, with patience, for the Emperor's cavalry are the best riders in the world, Feodor Feodorovitch.  And we certainly had a great laugh! - Your health, Matrena Petrovna.\" These last graceful words were addressed to Madame Trebassof, who shrugged her shoulders at the undesired gallantry of the gay Councilor.

This policeman was on his knees in the drawing-room watching what passed in the next room through the narrow space of light in the hinge-way of the door.

This had commenced at Moscow after the terrible repression, the massacre of revolutionaries under the walls of Presnia, when the surviving Nihilists left behind them a placard condemning the victorious General Trebassof to death.

General Trebassof's father was governor of Courlande at that time, by the grace of God and the Little Father.  Thaddeus, who was just thirteen years old, killed the bear with a single stroke of his boar-spear, and just in time. Close ties were knit between the two families by this occurrence, and though Thaddeus was neither noble-born nor a soldier, Feodor considered him his brother and felt toward him as such.  Now Thaddeus had become the greatest timber-merchant of the western provinces, with his own forests and also with his massive body, his fat, oily face, his bull-neck and his ample paunch.  He quitted everything at once - all his affairs, his family - as soon as he learned of the first attack, to come and remain by the side of his dear comrade Feodor.  He had done this after each attack, without forgetting one.  He was a faithful friend.  But he fretted because they might not go bear-hunting as in their youth.  'Where, he would ask, are there any bears remaining in Courlande, or trees for that matter, what you could call trees, growing since the days of the grand-dukes of Lithuania, giant trees that threw their shade right up to the very edge of the towns? Where were such things nowadays? Thaddeus was very amusing, for it was he, certainly, who had cut them away tranquilly enough and watched them vanish in locomotive smoke.  It was what was called Progress.  Ah, hunting lost its national character assuredly with tiny new-growth trees which had not had time to grow.  And, besides, one nowadays had not time for hunting.  All the big game was so far away.  Lucky enough if one seized the time to bring down a brace of woodcock early in the morning.  At this point in Thaddeus's conversation there was a babble of talk among the convivial gentlemen, for they had all the time in the world at their disposal and could not see why he should be so concerned about snatching a little while at morning or evening, or at midday for that matter.

Then they drank more, amid a perfect fracas of talk and laughter.  Ivan Petrovitch and Athanase Georgevitch walked across and kissed the general. Rouletabille saw all around him great children who amused themselves with unbelievable naivete and who drank in a fashion more unbelievable still.  Matrena Petrovna smoked cigarettes of yellow tobacco incessantly, rising almost continually to make a hurried round of the rooms, and after having prompted the servants to greater watchfulness, sat and looked long at Rouletabille, who did not stir, but caught every word, every gesture of each one there.  Finally, sighing, she sat down by Feodor and asked how his leg felt.  Michael and Natacha, in a corner, were deep in conversation, and Boris watched them with obvious impatience, still strumming the guzla.  But the thing that struck Rouletabille\'s youthful imagination beyond all else was the mild face of the general.  He had not imagined the terrible Trebassof with so paternal and sympathetic an expression.  The Paris papers had printed redoubtable pictures of him, more or less authentic, but the arts of photography and engraving had cut vigorous, rough features of an official - who knew no pity.  Such pictures were in perfect accord with the idea one naturally had of the dominating figure of the government at Moscow, the man who, during eight days - the Red Week - had made so many corpses of students and workmen that the halls of the University and the factories had opened their doors since in vain.  The dead would have had to arise for those places to be peopled!  Days of terrible battle where in one quarter or another of the city there was naught but massacre or burnings, until Matrena Petrovna and her step-daughter, Natacha (all the papers told of it), had fallen on their knees before the general and begged terms for the last of the revolutionaries, at bay in the Presnia quarter, and had been refused by him.  "War is war," had been his answer, with irrefutable logic.  "How can you ask mercy for these men who never give it?" Be it said for the young men of the barricades that they never surrendered, and equally be it said for Trebassof that he necessarily shot them.  "If I had only myself to consider," the general had said to a Paris journalist, "I could have been gentle as a lamb with these unfortunates, and so I should not now myself be condemned to death. After all, I fail to see what they reproach me with.  I have served my master as a brave and loyal subject, no more, and, after the fighting, I have let others ferret out the children that had hidden under their mothers\' skirts.  Everybody talks of the repression of Moscow, hut let us speak, my friend, of the Commune.  There was a piece of work I would not have done, to massacre within a court an unresisting crowd of men, women and children.  I am a rough and faithful soldier of His Majesty, but I am not a monster, and I have the feelings of a husband and father, my dear monsieur.  Tell your readers that, if you care to, and do not surmise further about whether I appear to regret being condemned to death."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Certainly what stupefied Rouletabille now was this staunch figure of the condemned man who appeared so tranquilly to enjoy his life.

As Trebassof had prayed his companions to let his young friend satisfy his ravening hunger in peace, they did not concern themelves to entertain him.  Then, too, the music served to distract attention from him, and at a moment somewhat later, when Matrena Petrovna turned to speak to the young man, she was frightened at not seeing him.

The first happened very simply.  The general knew he had been condemned to death.  They had delivered to him at the palace in the afternoon the revoluntionary poster which proclaimed his intended fate to the whole city and country.  So Feodor, who was just about to ride into the city, dismissed his escort.  He ordered horses put to a sleigh. I trembled and asked what he was going to do.  He said he was going  to drive quietly through all parts of the city, in order to show the Muscovites that a governor appointed according to law by the Little Father and who had in his conscience only the sense that he had done his full duty was not to be intimidated.  It was nearly four o'clock, toward the end of a winter day that had been clear and bright, but very cold.  I wrapped myself in my furs and took my seat beside him, and he said, 'This is fine, Matrena; this will have a great effect on these imbeciles.'  So we started.  At first we drove along the Naberjnaia.  The sleigh glided like the wind.  The general hit the driver a heavy blow in the back, crying, 'Slower, fool; they will think we are afraid,' and so the horses were almost walking when, passing behind the Church of Protection and intercession, we reached the Place Rouge.  Until then the few passers-by had looked at us, and as they recognized him, hurried along to keep him in view.  At the Place Rouge there was only a little knot of women kneeling before the Virgin.  As soon as these women saw us and recognized the equipage of the Governor, they dispersed like a flock of crows, with frightened cries.  Feodor laughed so hard that as we passed under the vault of the Virgin his laugh seemed to shake the stones.  I felt reassured, monsieur.  Our promenade continued without any remarkable incident.  The city was almost deserted.  Everything lay prostrated under the awful blow of that battle in the street.

We glided over the snow like a boat along the river in foggy calm.  Then, suddenly, we heard piercing cries and saw shadows of soldiers rushing around, with movements that looked larger than human through the mist; their short whips looked enormous as they knocked some other shadows that we saw down like logs.  The general stopped the sleigh and got out to see what was going on.  I got out with him.  They were soldiers of the famous Semenowsky regiment, who had two prisoners, a young man and a child.  The child was being beaten on the nape of the neck.  It writhed on the ground and cried in torment.  It couldn't have been more than nine years old.  The other, the young man, held himself up and marched along without a single cry as the thongs fell brutally upon him.  I was appalled. I did not give my husband time to open his mouth before I called to the subaltern who commanded the detachment, 'You should be ashamed to strike a child and a Christian like that, which cannot defend itself.'  The general told him the same thing.  Then the subaltern told us that the little child had just killed a lieutenant in the street by firing a revolver, which he showed us, and it was the biggest one I ever have seen, and must have been as heavy for that infant to lift as a small cannon.

You have not been furnished with these whips in order to beat isolated prisoners, but to charge the crowd when it does not obey the governor's orders.  In such a case you are ordered \"Charge,\" and you know what to do.  You understand?'  Feodor said roughly.

But the general was not hit, happily, nor I either, who was by him and had thrown myself onto the student to disarm him and then was tossed about at the feet of the soldiers in the battle they waged around the student while the revolver was going off.  Three soldiers were killed.  You can understand that the others were furious.  They raised me with many excuses and, all together, set to kicking the student in the loins and striking at him as he lay on the ground.  The subaltern struck his face a blow that might have blinded him.  Feodor hit the officer in the head with his fist and called, 'Didn't you hear what I said?'  The officer fell under the blow and Feodor himself carried him to the sleigh and laid him with the dead men.  Then he took charge of the soldiers and led them to the barracks.  I followed, as a sort of after-guard.  We returned to the palace an hour later. It was quite dark by then, and almost at the entrance to the palace we were shot at by a group of revolutionaries who passed swiftly in two sleighs and disappeared in the darkness so fast that they could not be overtaken.  I had a ball in my toque.  The general had not been touched this time either, but our furs were ruined by the blood of the dead soldiers which they had forgotten to clean out of the sleigh.

We had had a jolly dinner because we thought that at last the good old days were back and good citizens could live in peace; and Boris had tried out the guzia singing songs of the Orel country to please me; he is so fine and sympathetic.  Natacha had gone somewhere or other.  The sleigh was waiting at the door and we went out and got in.  Almost instantly there was a fearful noise, and we were thrown out into the snow, both the general and me.  There remained no trace of sleigh or coachman; the two horses were disemboweled, two magnificent piebald horses, my dear young monsieur, that the general was so attached to. As to Feodor, he had that serious wound in his right leg; the calf was shattered.  I simply had my shoulder a little wrenched, practically nothing.  The bomb had been placed under the seat of the unhappy coachman, whose hat alone we found, in a pool of blood. >From that attack the general lay two months in bed.  In the second month they arrested two servants who were caught one night on the  landing leading to the upper floor, where they had no business, and after that I sent at once for our old domestics in Orel to come and serve us.  It was discovered that these detected servants were in touch with the revolutionaries, so they were hanged.  The Emperor appointed a provisional governor, and now that the general was better we decided on a convalescence for him in the midi of France. We took train for St. Petersburg, but the journey started high fever in my husband and reopened the wound in his calf.  The doctors ordered absolute rest and so we settled here in the datcha des Iles. Since then, not a day has passed without the general receiving an anonymous letter telling him that nothing can save him from the revenge of the revolutionaries.  He is brave and only smiles over them, but for me, I know well that so long as we are in Russia we have not a moment\'s security.  So I watch him every minute and let no one approach him except his intimate friends and us of the family. I have brought an old gniagnia who watched me grow up, Ermolai, and the Orel servants.

Of an evening, when his work was over, he always left the bureau of the prefecture and went to join his wife and children in their apartment in the ruelle des Loups.  Not a soldier!  No guard!  The others had every chance. One evening a score of revolutionaries, after having driven away the terrorized servants, mounted to his apartments.  He was dining with his family.  They knocked and he opened the door.  He saw who they were, and tried to speak.  They gave him no time.

Under the veranda the schwitzar was spreading a mattress for Ermolai.  She asked him if he had seen the young Frenchman anywhere, and after the answer, could only say to herself, "Where is he, then?"  Where had Rouletabille gone?   The general, whom she had carried up to his room on her back, without any help, and had helped into bed without assistance, was disturbed by this singular disappearance.   Had someone already carried off "their" Rouletabille?   Their friends were gone and the orderlies had taken leave without being able to say where this boy of a journalist had gone.  But it would be foolish to worry about the disappearance of a Journalist, they had said.  That kind of man - these journalists - came, went, arrived when one least expected them, and quitted their company - even the highest society - without formality.  It was what they called in France "leaving English fashion."  However, it appeared it was not meant to be impolite.  Perhaps he had gone to telegraph.  A journalist had to keep in touch with the telegraph at all hours.  Poor Matrena Petrovna roamed the solitary garden in tumult of heart.  There was the light in the general\'s window on the first floor.  There were lights in the basement from the kitchens.  There was a light on the ground-floor near the sitting-room, from Natacha\'s chamber window.  Ah, the night was hard to bear.  And this night the shadows weighed heavier than ever on the valiant breast of Matrena.  As she breathed she felt as though she lifted all the weight of the threatening night.  She examined everything - everything.  All was shut tight, was perfectly secure, and there was no one within excepting people she was absolutely sure of - but whom, all the same, she did not allow to go anywhere in the house excepting where their work called them. Each in his place.  That made things surer.  She wished each one could remain fixed like the porcelain statues of men out on the lawn.  Even as she thought it, here at her feet, right at her very feet, a shadow of one of the porcelain men moved, stretched itself out, rose to its knees, grasped her skirt and spoke in the voice of Rouletabille.

Down there each night the devoted gniagnia and the faithful Ermolai watched in turn."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Within the villa, now closed, there were on the ground-floor only Matrena herself and her step-daughter Natacha, who slept in the chamber off the sitting-room, and, above on the first floor, the general asleep, or who ought to be asleep if he had taken his potion.  Matrena remained in the darkness of the drawing-room, her dark-lantern in her hand.  All her nights passed thus, gliding from door to door, from chamber to chamber, watching over the watch of the police, not daring to stop her stealthy promenade even to throw herself on the mattress that she had placed across the doorway of her husband's chamber.  Did she ever sleep?  She herself could hardly say.  Who else could, then?  A tag of sleep here and there, over the arm of a chair, or leaning against the wall, waked always by some noise that she heard or dreamed, some warning, perhaps, that she alone had heard.  And to-night, to-night there is Rouletabille's alert guard to help her, and she feels a little less the aching terror of watchfulness, until there surges back into her mind the recollection that the police are no longer there.  Was he right, this young man?  Certainly she could not deny that some way she feels more confidence now that the police are gone.  She does not have to spend her time watching their shadows in the shadows, searching the darkness, the arm-chairs, the sofas, to rouse them, to appeal in low tones to all they held binding, by their own name and the name of their father, to promise them a bonus that would amount to something if they watched well, to count them in order to know where they all were, and, suddenly, to throw full in their face the ray of light from her little dark-lantern in order to be sure, absolutely sure, that she was face to face with them, one of the police, and not with some other, some other with an infernal machine under his arm.  Yes, she surely had less work now that she had no longer to watch the police.  And she had less fear!"}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'She thanked the young reporter for that.  Where was he?  Did he remain in the pose of a porcelain statue all this time out there on the lawn?  She peered through the lattice of the veranda shutters and looked anxiously out into the darkened garden.  Where could he be?  Was that he, down yonder, that crouching black heap with an unlighted pipe in his mouth?  No, no.  That, she knew well, was the dwarf she genuinely loved, her little domovoi-doukh, the familiar spirit of the house, who watched with her over the general\'s life and thanks to whom serious injury had not yet befallen Feodor Feodorovitch - one could not regard a mangled leg that seriously. Ordinarily in her own country (she was from the Orel district) one did not care to see the domovoi-doukh appear in flesh and blood. When she was little she was always afraid that she would come upon him around a turn of the path in her father\'s garden.  She always thought of him as no higher than that, seated back on his haunches and smoking his pipe.  Then, after she was married, she had suddenly run across him at a turning in the bazaar at Moscow.  He was just as she had imagined him, and she had immediately bought him, carried him home herself and placed him, with many precautions, for he was of very delicate porcelain, in the vestibule of the palace.  And in leaving Moscow she had been careful not to leave him there.  She had carried him herself in a case and had placed him herself on the lawn of the datcha des Iles, that he might continue to watch over her happiness and over the life of her Feodor.  And in order that he should not be bored, eternally smoking his pipe all alone, she had surrounded him with a group of little porcelain genii, after the fashion of the Jardins des Iles.  Lord! how that young Frenchman had frightened her, rising suddenly like that, without warning, on the lawn.  She had believed for a moment that it was the domovoi-doukh himself rising to stretch his legs.  Happily he had spoken at once and she had recognized his voice.  And besides, her domovoi surely would not speak French.  Ah! Matrena Petrovna breathed freely now.  It seemed to her, this night, that there were two little familiar genii watching over the house.  And that was worth more than all the police in the world, surely.  How wily that little fellow was to order all those men away.  There was something it was necessary to know; it was necessary therefore that nothing should be in the way of learning it.  As things were now, the mystery could operate without suspicion or interference.  Only one man watched it, and he had not the air of watching.  Certainly Rouletabille had not the air of constantly watching anything.  He had the manner, out in the night, of an easy little man in porcelain, neither more nor less, yet he could see everything - if anything were there to see - and he could hear everything - if there were anything to hear.  One passed beside him without suspecting him, and men might talk to each other without an idea that he heard them, and even talk to themselves according to the habit people have sometimes when they think themselves quite alone.  All the guests had departed thus, passing close by him, almost brushing him, had exchanged their "Adieus," their "Au revoirs," and all their final, drawn-out farewells.  That dear little living domovoi certainly was a rogue!  Oh, that dear little domovoi who had been so affected by the tears of Matrena Petrovna!

It was not his role.  A soldier is a soldier.  My husband raised him roughly and ordered him, for his pains, to march at the head of the troops.  It was right.  What else could he do?

All the clocks had been stopped, as Koupriane advised, and I had made an excuse to send Feodor's great watch to the repairer.  You can understand how I felt when I heard that tick-tack.  I was frenzied. I turned my head in all directions, and decided that the sound came from my husband's chamber.  I ran there.  He still slept, man that he is!  The tick-tack was there.  But where?  I turned here and there like a fool.  The chamber was in darkness and it seemed absolutely impossible for me to light a lamp because I thought I could not take the time for fear the infernal machine would go off in those few seconds.  I threw myself on the floor and listened under the bed.  The noise came from above.  But where?  I sprang to the fireplace, hoping that, against my orders, someone had started the mantel-clock.  No, it was not that!  It seemed to me now that the tick-tack came from the hed itself, that the machine was in the bed.  The general awaked just then and cried to me, 'What is it, Matrena?  What are you doing?'  And he raised himself in bed, while I cried, 'Listen!  Hear the tick-tack.  Don't you hear the tick-tack?'  I threw myself upon him and gathered him up in my arms to carry him, but I trembled too much, was too weak from fear, and fell back with him onto the bed, crying, 'Help!'  He thrust me away and said roughly, 'Listen.'  The frightful tick-tack was behind us now, on the table.  But there was nothing on the table, only the night-light, the glass with the potion in it, and a gold vase where I had placed with my own hands that morning a cluster of grasses and wild flowers that Ermolai had brought that morning on his return from the Orel country.  With one bound I was on the table and at the flowers.  I struck my fingers among the grasses and the flowers, and felt a resistance.  The tick-tack was in the bouquet!  I took the bouquet in both hands, opened the window and threw it as far as I could into the garden.

She had been invited to the soiree du 'Michel' by the parents of Boris Nikolaievitch, and she slept at their house, after supper at the Ours, as had been planned.  The next day, when she learned the danger the general had escaped, she trembled in every limb.  She threw herself in her father's arms, weeping, which was natural enough, and declared that she never would go away from him again. The general told her how I had managed.  Then she pressed me to her heart, saying that she never would forget such an action, and that she loved me more than if I were truly her mother.  It was all in vain that during the days following we sought to understand how the infernal machine had been placed in the bouquet of wild flowers. Only the general's friends that you saw this evening, Natacha and I had entered the general's chamber during the day or in the evening. No servant, no chamber-maid, had been on that floor.  In the day-time as well as all night long that entire floor is closed and I have the keys.  The door of the servants' staircase which opens onto that floor, directly into the general's chamber, is always locked and barred on the inside with iron.  Natacha and I do the chamber work.  There is no way of taking greater precautions.  Three police agents watched over us night and day.  The night of the bouquet two had spent their time watching around the house, and the third lay on the sofa in the veranda.  Then, too, we found all the doors and windows of the villa shut tight.  In such circumstances you can judge whether my anguish was not deeper than any I had known hitherto.  Because to whom, henceforth, could we trust ourselves? what and whom could we believe?  what and whom could we watch? >From that day, no other person but Natacha and me have the right to go to the first floor.  The general's chamber was forbidden to his friends.  Anyway, the general improved, and soon had the pleasure of receiving them himself at his table.  I carry the general down and take him to his room again on my back.  I do not wish anyone to help.  I am strong enough for that.  I feel that I could carry him to the end of the world if that would save him.  Instead of three police, we had ten; five outside, five inside.  The days went well enough, but the nights were frightful, because the shadows of the police that I encountered always made me fear that I was face to face with the Nihilists.  One night I almost strangled one with my hand.  It was after that incident that we arranged with Koupriane that the agents who watched at night, inside, should stay placed in the veranda, after having, at the end of the evening, made complete examination of everything.

If you do not have breakfast promptly mornings, I will think you are annoyed.  I am so annoyed that you have heard the secret of the night.  I have been afraid that you would want to leave at once and for good, and that you would have mistaken ideas about the general.  There is not a better man in the world that Feodor, and he must have a good, a very good conscience to dare, without fail, to perform such terrible duties as those at Moscow, when he is so good at heart.  These things are easy enough for wicked people, but for good men, for good men who can reason it out, who know what they do and that they are condemned to death into the bargain, it is terrible, it is terrible!  Why, I told him the moment things began to go wrong in Moscow, 'You know what to expect, Feodor.  Here is a dreadful time to get through - make out you are sick.'  I believed he was going to strike me, to kill me on the spot.  'I!  Betray the Emperor in such a moment!  His Majesty, to whom I owe everything!  What are you thinking of, Matrena Petrovna!'

It was only when he saw I was growing very ill that he pardoned me, but he had to be plagued with my jeremiads and the appealing looks of Natacha without end in his own home each time we heard any shooting in the street.  Natacha attended the lectures of the Faculty, you know.  And she knew many of them, and even some of those who were being killed on the barricades.  Ah, life was not easy for him in his own home, the poor general!

Truly, it seems his heart can only be touched by the sight of Natacha.  And that again has caused a good deal of anxiety to Feodor and me.  It has caught us in a useless complication that we would have liked to end by the prompt marriage of Natacha and Boris. But Natacha, to our great surprise, has not wished it to be so.  No, she has not wished it, saying that there is always time to think of her wedding and that she is in no hurry to leave us.  Meantime she entertains herself with this Michael as if she did not fear his passion, and neither has Michael the desperate air of a man who knows the definite engagement of Natacha and Boris.  And my step-daughter is not a coquette.  No, no.  No one can say she is a coquette.  At least, no one had been able to say it up to the time that Michael arrived.  Can it be that she is a coquette?  They are mysterious, these young girls, very mysterious, above all when they have that calm and tranquil look that Natacha always has; a face, monsieur, as you have noticed perhaps, whose beauty is rather passive whatever one says and does, excepting when the volleys in the streets kill her young comrades of the schools.  Then I have seen her almost faint, which proves she has a great heart under her tranquil beauty.  Poor Natacha!  I have seen her excited as I over the life of her father.  My little friend, I have seen her searching in the middle of the night, with me, for infernal machines under the furniture, and then she has expressed the opinion that it is nervous, childish, unworthy of us to act like that, like timid beasts under the sofas, and she has left me to search by myself.  True, she never quits the general.  She is more reassured, and is reassuring to him, at his side.  It has an excellent moral effect on him, while I walk about and search like a beast.  And she has become as fatalistic as he, and now she sings verses to the guzla, like Boris, or talks in corners with Michael, which makes the two enraged each with the other.

My opinion, since I saw Matrena lift the carpet the first time without any real precaution, is that they have definitely abandoned the preparation of that attack and are trying to account for the secret becoming known.  What Matrena feels so sure of is that the trap I laid by the promenade to the Point was against Natacha particularly.  I knew beforehand that Natacha would absent herself during the promenade.  I'm not looking for anything new from Natacha, but what I did need was to be sure that Matrena didn't detest Natacha, and that she had not faked the preparations for an attack under the floor in such a way as to throw almost certain suspicion on her step-daughter.  I am sure about that now.  Matrena is innocent of such a thing, the poor dear soul.  If Matrena had been a monster the occasion was too good.  Natacha's absence, her solitary presence for a quarter of an hour in the empty villa, all would have urged Matrena, whom I sent alone to search under the carpet in the dining-room, to draw the last nails from the board if she was really guilty of having drawn the others.  Natacha would have been lost then!  Matrena returned sincerely, tragically happy at not having found anything new, and now I have the material proof that I needed.

For himself, the reporter during that conversation hid a real horror which had seized him at the cynical and inappropriate tranquillity with which the young lady received all suggestions that accused the police or that assumed the general no longer ran any immediate danger.  In short, he worked, or at least believed he worked, to clear Natacha as he had cleared Matrena, so that there would develop the absolute necessity of assuming a third person's intervention in the facts disclosed so clearly by Koupriane where Matrena or Natacha seemed alone to be possible agents.

His face stood out pallid and tragic on the pillow; his mouth was open and, at times, the lips moved.  There was fear at any moment of nightmare or his awakening.  Unconsciously he threw an arm over toward the table where the glass of narcotic stood.  Then he lay still again and snored lightly.  The night-lamp on the mantelpiece caught queer yellow reflections from the corners of the furniture, from the gilded frame of a picture on the wall and from the phials and glasses on the table.  But in all the chamber Matrena Petrovna saw nothing, thought of nothing but the brass bolt which shone there on the door.  Tired of being on her knees, she shifted, her chin in her hands, her gaze steadily fixed.  As time passed and nothing happened she heaved a sigh.

It seemed to him there was nothing alive in that house except his heart.  He was stifled with the horror that he glimpsed, that he almost touched, although  that door remained closed.  He felt along the wall in order to reach the window, and pulled aside the curtain.  Window and blinds of the little room giving on the Neva were closed.  The bar of iron inside was in its place.  Then he went to the passage, mounted and descended the narrow servants' stairway, looked all about, in all the rooms, feeling everywhere with silent hands, assuring himself that no lock had been tampered with.

The dyernick on guard out in the roadway also watched the young man through the bars of the gate in consternation, as though he thought him a fool.  Along the paths of beaten earth or cement which offered no chance for footprints Rouletabille hurried silently.  Around him he noted that the grass of the lawn had not been trodden.

He continually worked back toward the house, and thus he traversed all the paths that led from the villa, but in all these excursions he took pains not to place himself in the field of vision from Natacha's window, a restricted field because of its location just around an abutment of the building.  To ascertain about this window he crept on all-fours up to the garden-edge that ran along the foot of the wall and had sufficient proof that no one had jumped out that way.

Ermolai came out and opened the gate for him. Matrena moved to the threshold of the little sitting-room and watched Natacha's door with horror.  She felt her legs give under her, she could not stand up under the diabolic thought of such a crime.  Ah, that arm, that arm! reaching out, making its way, with a little shining phial in its hand.  Pains of Christ!  What could there be in the damnable books over which Natacha and her companions pored that could make such abominable crimes possible?  Ah, Natacha, Natacha! it was from her that she would have desired the answer, straining her almost to stifling on her rough bosom and strangling her with her own strong hand that she might not hear the response. Ah, Natacha, Natacha, whom she had loved so much!  She sank to the floor, crept across the carpet to the door, and lay there, stretched like a beast, and buried her bead in her arms while she wept over her daughter.  Natacha, Natacha, whom she had cherished as her own child, and who did not hear her.  Ah, what use that the little fellow had gone to search outside when the whole truth lay behind this door?  Thinking of him, she was embarrassed lest he should find her in that animalistic posture, and she rose to her knees and worked her way over to the window that looked out upon the Neva. The angle of the slanting blinds let her see well enough what passed.  outside, and what she saw made her spring to her feet. Below her the reporter was going through the same incomprehensible maneuvers that she had seen him do in the garden.  Three pathways led to the little road that ran along the wall of the villa by the bank of the Neva.  The young man, still with his hands behind his back and with his face up, took them one after the other.  In the first he stopped at the first step.  He didn't take more than two steps in the second.  In the third, which cut obliquely toward the right and seemed to run to the bank nearest Krestowsky Ostrow, she saw him advance slowly at first, then more quickly among the small trees and hedges.  Once only he stopped and looked closely at the trunk of a tree against which he seemed to pick out something invisible, and then he continued to the bank.  There he sat down on a stone and appeared to reflect, and then suddenly he cast off his jacket and trousers, picked out a certain place on the bank across from him, finished undressing and plunged into the stream. She saw at once that he swam like a porpoise, keeping beneath and showing his head from time to time, breathing, then diving below the surface again.  He reached Krestowsky Ostrow in a clump of reeds. Then he disappeared.  Below him, surrounded by trees, could be seen the red tiles of the villa which sheltered Boris and Michael.  From that villa a person could see the window of the sitting-room in General Trebassof's residence, but not what might occur along the bank of the river just below its walls.  An isvotchick drove along the distant route of Krestowsky, conveying in his carriage a company of young officers and young women who had been feasting and who sang as they rode; then deep silence ensued.  Matrena's eyes searched for Rouletabille, but could not find him.  How long was he going to stay hidden like that?  She pressed her face against the chill window. What was she waiting for?  She waited perhaps for someone to make a move on this side, for the door near her to open and the traitorous figure of The Other to appear."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A hand touched her carefully.

You can't do me as much harm as I have done you, whether you think so or not.  All the harm that can be done me by you and yours is already accomplished.  My name is not Touman, but Matiev.  Listen.  I had a son that was the light of my eyes. Neither my son nor I had ever been concerned with politics.  I was employed in Moscow.  My son was a student.  During the Red Week we went out, my son and I, to see a little of what was happening over in the Presnia quarter.  They said everybody had been killed over there!  We passed before the Presnia gate.  Soldiers called to us to stop because they wished to search us.  We opened our coats. The soldiers saw my son's student waistcoat and set up a cry.  They unbuttoned the vest, drew a note-book out of his pocket and they found a workman's song in it that had been published in the Signal. The soldiers didn't know how to read.  They believed the paper was a proclamation, and they arrested my son.  I demanded to be arrested with him.  They pushed me away.  I ran to the governor's house. Trebassof had me thrust away from his door with blows from the butt-ends of his Cossacks' guns.  And, as I persisted, they kept me locked up all that night and the morning of the next day.  At noon I was set free.  I demanded my son and they replied they didn't know what I was talking about.  But a soldier that I recognized as having arrested my son the evening before pointed out a van that was passing, covered with a tarpaulin and surrounded by Cossacks.  'Your son is there,' he said; 'they are taking him to the graves.' Mad with despair, I ran after the van.  It went to the outskirts of Golountrine cemetery.  There I saw in the white snow a huge grave, wide, deep.  I shall see it to my last minute.  Two vans had already stopped near the hole.  Each van held thirteen corpses.  The vans were dumped into the trench and the soldiers commenced to sort the bodies into rows of six.  I watched for my son.  At last I recognized him in a body that half hung over the edge of the trench.  Horrors of suffering were stamped in the expression of his face.  I threw myself beside him.  I said that I was his father.  They let me embrace him a last time and count his wounds.  He had fourteen. Someone had stolen the gold chain that had hung about his neck and held the picture of his mother, who died the year before.  I whispered into his ear, I swore to avenge him.  Forty-eight hours later I had placed myself at the disposition of the Revolutionary Committee.  A week had not passed before Touman, whom, it seems, I resemble and who was one of the Secret Service agents in Kiew, was assassinated in the train that was taking him to St. Petersburg. The assassination was kept a secret.  I received all his papers and I took his place with you.  I was doomed beforehand and I asked nothing better, so long as I might last until after the execution of Trebassof.  Ah, how I longed to kill him with my own hands!  But another had already been assigned the duty and my role was to help him.  And do you suppose I am going to tell you the name of that other?  Never!  And if you discover that other, as you have discovered me, another will come, and another, and another, until Trebassof has paid for his crimes.  That is all I have to say to you, Koupriane.

The most celebrated companies of the old and the new world play there amid an enthusiasm that is steadily maintained by the foresight of the managers: Russian and foreign dancers, and above all the French chanteuses, the little dolls of the cafes-concerts, so long as they are young, bright, and elegantly dressed, may meet their fortune there.  If there is no such luck, they are sure at least to find every evening some old beau, and often some officer, who willingly pays twenty-five roubles for the sole pleasure of having a demoiselle born on the banks of the Seine for his companion at the supper-table. After their turn at the singing, these women display their graces and their eager smiles in the promenades of the garden or among the tables where the champagne-drinkers sit.  The head-liners, naturally, are not driven to this wearying perambulation, but can go away to their rest if they are so inclined.  However, the management is appreciative if they accept the invitation of some dignitary of the army, of administration, or of finance, who seeks the \x07honor of hearing from the chanteuse, in a private room and with a company of friends not disposed to melancholy, the Bohemian songs of the Vieux Derevnia.  They sing, they loll, they talk of Paris, and above all they drink.  If sometimes the little fete ends rather roughly, it is the friendly and affectionate champagne that is to blame, but usually the orgies remain quite innocent, of a character that certainly might trouble the temperance societies but need not make M. le Senateur Berenger feel involved."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'A war whose powder fumes reeked still, a revolution whose last defeated growls had not died away at the period of these events, had not at all diminished the nightly gayeties of Kretowsky.  Many of the young men who displayed their uniforms that evening and called their "Nichevo" along the brilliantly lighted paths of the public gardens, or filled the open-air tables, or drank vodka at the buffets, or admired the figures of the wandering soubrettes, had come here on the eve of their departure for the war and had returned with the same child-like, enchanted smile, the same ideal of futile joy, and kissed their passing comrades as gayly as ever. Some of them had a sleeve lying limp now, or walked with a crutch, or even on a wooden leg, but it was, all the same, "Nichevo!"'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The crowd this evening was denser than ordinarily, because there was the chance to hear Annouchka again for the first time since the somber days of Moscow.  The students were ready to give her an ovation, and no one opposed it, because, after all, if she sang now it was because the police were willing at last.  If the Tsar's government had granted her her life, it was not in order to compel her to die of hunger.  Each earned a livelihood as was possible. Annouchka only knew how to sing and dance, and so she must sing and dance!"}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'When Rouletabille entered the Krestowsky Gardens, Annouchka had commenced her number, which ended with a tremendous "Roussalka." Surrounded by a chorus of male and female dancers in the national dress and with red boots, striking tambourines with their fingers, then suddenly taking a rigid pose to let the young woman\'s voice, which was of rather ordinary register, come out, Annouchka had centered the attention of the immense audience upon herself.  All the other parts of the establishment were deserted, the tables had been removed, and a panting crowd pressed about the open-air theater. Rouletabille stood up on his chair at the moment tumultuous "Bravos" sounded from a group of students.  Annouchka bowed toward them, seeming to ignore the rest of the audience, which had not dared declare itself yet.  She sang the old peasant songs arranged to present-day taste, and interspersed them with dances.  They had an enormous success, because she gave her whole soul to them and sang with her voice sometimes caressing, sometimes menacing, and sometimes magnificently desperate, giving much significance to words which on paper had not aroused the suspicions of the censor. The taste of the day was obviously still a taste for the revolution, which retained its influence on the banks of the Neva.  What she was doing was certainly very bold, and apparently she realized how audacious she was, because, with great adroitness, she would bring out immediately after some dangerous phrase a patriotic couplet which everybody was anxious to applaud.  She succeeded by such means in appealing to all the divergent groups of her audience and secured a complete triumph for herself.  The students, the revolutionaries, the radicals and the cadets acclaimed the singer, glorifying not only her art but also and beyond everything else the sister of the engineer Volkousky, who had been doomed to perish with her brother by the bullets of the Semenovsky regiment.  The friends of the Court on their side could not forget that it was she who, in front of the Kremlin, had struck aside the arm of Constantin Kochkarof, ordered by the Central Revolutionary Committee to assassinate the Grand Duke Peter Alexandrovitch as he drove up to the governor\'s house in his sleigh.  The bomb burst ten feet away, killing Constantin Kochkarof himself.  It may be that before death came he had time to hear Annouchka cry to him, "Wretch!  You were told to kill the prince, not to assassinate his children."  As it happened, Peter Alexandrovitch held on his knees the two little princesses, seven and eight years old.  The Court had wished to recompense her for that heroic act.  Annouchka had spit at the envoy of the Chief of Police who called to speak to her of money.  At the Hermitage in Moscow, where she sang then, some of her admirers had warned her of possible reprisals on the part of the revolutionaries.  But the revolutionaries gave her assurance at once that she had nothing to fear.  They approved her act and let her know that they now counted on her to kill the Grand Duke some time when he was alone; which had made Annouchka laugh.  She was an enfant terrible, whose friends no one knew, who passed for very wise, and whose lines of intrigue were inscrutable.  She enjoyed making her hosts in the private supper-rooms quake over their meal.  One day she had said bluntly to one of the most powerful tchinovnicks of Moscow:  "You, my old friend, you are president of the Black Hundred.  Your fate is sealed. Yesterday you were condemned to death by the delegates of the Central Committee at Presnia.  Say your prayers."  The man reached for champagne.  He never finished his glass.  The dvornicks carried him out stricken with apoplexy.  Since the time she saved the little grand-duchesses the police had orders to allow her to act and talk as she pleased.  She had been mixed up in the deepest plots against the government.  Those who lent the slightest countenance to such plottings and were not of the police simply disappeared.  Their friends dared not even ask for news of them.  The only thing not in doubt about them was that they were at hard labor somewhere in the mines of the Ural Mountains.  At the moment of the revolution Annouchka had a brother who was an engineer on the Kasan-Moscow line. This Volkousky was one of the leaders on the Strike Committee.  The authorities had an eye on him.  The revolution started.  He, with the help of his sister, accomplished one of those formidable acts which will carry their memory as heroes to the farthest posterity. Their work accomplished, they were taken by Trebassof\'s soldiers. Both were condemned to death.  Volkousky was executed first, and the sister was taking her turn when an officer of the government arrived on horseback to stop the firing.  The Tsar, informed of her intended fate, had sent a pardon by telegraph.  After that she disappeared.  She was supposed to have gone on some tour across Europe, as was her habit, for she spoke all the languages, like a true Bohemian.  Now she had reappeared in all her joyous glory at Krestowsky.  It was certain, however, that she had not forgotten her brother.  Gossips said that if the government and the police showed themselves so long-enduring they found it to their interest to do so.  The open, apparent life Annouclika led was less troublesome to them than her hidden activities would be.  The lesser police who surrounded the Chief of the St.  retersburg Secret Service, the famous Gounsovski, had meaning smiles when the matter was discussed. Among them Annouchka had the ignoble nickname, "Stool-pigeon."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Rouletabille must have been well aware of all these particulars concerning Annoucbka, for he betrayed no astonishment at the great interest and the strong emotion she aroused.

I was struck by there being no guard with a big revolver in the antechamber.  He had a little, timid schwitzar there, who took my umbrella, murmuring 'barine' and bowing over and over again.  He conducted me through very ordinary rooms quite unguarded to an average sitting-room of a common kind.

For that matter, I understood him, and, you know, since that day I have cut out certain side passages unnecessary in my general law pleadings that had been giving me a reputation for rather too free opinions in the papers.  None of that at my age!  Ah, the great Gounsovski!  Over our coffee I asked him if he didn't find the country in pretty strenuous times.  He replied that he looked forward with impatience to the month of May, when he could go for a rest to a little property with a small garden that he had bought at Asnieres, near Paris.  When he spoke of their house in the country Madame Gounsovski heaved a sigh of longing for those simple country joys.  The month of May brought tears to her eyes.  Husband and wife looked at one another with real tenderness.  They had not the air of thinking for one second: to-morrow or the day after, before our country happiness comes, we may find ourselves stripped of everything.  No!

Besides, have you noticed, my dear old friends, that no one ever tries to work harm to chiefs of Secret Police?  One goes after heads of police, prefects of police, ministers, grand-dukes, and even higher, but the chiefs of Secret Police are never, never attacked.  They can promenade tranquilly in the streets or in the gardens of Krestowsky or breathe the pure air of the Finland country or even the country around Paris.  They have done so many little favors for this one and that, here and there, that no one wishes to do them the least injury.

'Give him a good present, a hundred roubles, and he will leave your house.  I went back to the officer and took him aside; he said he wanted to do anything that he could for me, but that the order was positive to bombard the house.

He made his way through the crowd toward Natacha, whom he had sought futilely since morning.  The audience, after clamoring in vain for a repetition of the prayer by Annouchka, commenced to disperse, and the reporter was swept along with them for a few moments.  When he reached the range of boxes he saw that Natacha and the family she had been with were gone.  He looked on all sides without seeing the object of his search and like a madman commenced to run through the passages, when a sudden idea struck his blood cold.  He inquired where the exit for the artists was and as soon as it was pointed out, he hurried there.  He was not mistaken. In the front line of the crowd that waited to see Annouchka come out he recognized Natacha, with her head enveloped in the black mantle so that none should see her face.  Besides, this corner of the garden was in a half-gloom.  The police barred the way; he could not approach as near Natacha as he wished.  He set himself to slip like a serpent through the crowd.  He was not separated from Natacha by more than four or five persons when a great jostling commenced. Annouchka was coming out.  Cries rose: "Annouchka!  Annouchka!" Rouletabille threw himself on his knees and on all-fours succeeded in sticking his head through into the way kept by the police for Annouchka\'s passage.  There, wrapped in a great red mantle, his hat on his arm, was a man Rouletabille immediately recognized.  It was Prince Galitch.  They were hurrying to escape the impending pressure of the crowd.  But Annouchka as she passed near Natacha stopped just a second - a movement that did not escape Rouletabille - and, turning toward her said just the one word, "Caracho."  Then she passed on.  Rouletabille got up and forced his way back, having once more lost Natacha.  He searched for her.  He ran to the carriage-way and arrived just in time to see her seated in a carriage with the Mourazoff family.  The carriage started at once in the direction of the datcha des Iles.  The young man remained standing there, thinking.  He made a gesture as though he were ready now to let luck take its course.  "In the end," said he, "it will be better so, perhaps," and then, to himself, "Now to supper, my boy."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"He turned in his tracks and soon was established in the glaring light of the restaurant.

Inside the villa Rouletabille advanced on tiptoe.  He found the door of the drawing-room open.  The door of the sitting-room had not been closed, or else had been reopened.  He turned in his tracks, felt in the dark for a chair and sat down, with his hand on his revolver in his pocket, waiting for the events that would not delay long now.  Above he heard distinctly from time to time the movements of Matrena Petrovna.  And this would evidently give a sense of security to those who needed to have the ground-floor free this night.

On tiptoe she went quickly to the window and opened it.  The man entered.  The little light that by now was commencing to dawn was enough to show Rouletabille that Natacha still wore the toilette in which he had seen her that same evening at Krestowsky.  As for the man, he tried in vain to identify him; he was only a dark mass wrapped in a mantle.  He leaned over and kissed Natacha's hand.

He regained the balcony and jumped from it as the others turned toward him.  At least, it was so that Rouletabille believed he saw the mysterious struggle go in the half-light, amid most impressive silence, after that frightened cry of Natacha's.  The whole affair had lasted only a few seconds, and the man was still hanging over the balcony, when from the bottom of the hall a new person sprang.

Shoot!"  In just that moment the man was hesitating whether to risk the jump and perhaps break his neck, or descend less rapidly by the gutter-pipe.  A policeman fired and missed him, and the man, after firing back and wounding the policeman, disappeared. It was still too far from dawn for them to see clearly what happened below, where the barking of Brownings alone was heard.  And there could be nothing more sinister than the revolver-shots unaccompanied by cries in the mists of the morning.  The man, before he disappeared, had had only time by a quick kick to throw down one of the two ladders which had been used by the police in climbing; down the other one all the police in a bunch, even to the wounded one, went sliding, falling, rising, running after the shadow which fled still, discharging the Browning steadily; other shadows rose from the river-bank, hovering in the mist.  Suddenly Koupniane\'s voice was heard shouting orders, calling upon his agents to take the quarry alive or dead.  From the balcony Matrena Petrovna cried out also, like a savage, and Rouletabille tried in vain to keep her quiet.  She was delirious at the thought "The Other" might escape yet.  She fired a revolver, she also, into the group, not knowing whom she might wound.   Rouletabille grabbed her arm and as she turned on him angrily she observed Natacha, who, leaning until she almost fell over the balcony, her lips trembling with delirious utterance, followed as well as she could the progress of the struggle, trying to understand what happened below, under the trees, near the Neva, where the tumult by now extended.  Matrena Petrovna pulled her back by the arms.  Then she took her by the neck and threw her into the drawing-room in a heap.  When she had almost strangled her step-daughter, Matrena Petrovna saw that the general was there.  He appeared in the pale glimmerings of dawn like a specter.  By what miracle had Feodor Feodorovitch been able to descend the stairs and reach there?  How had it been brought about?

The unfortunate officer had received a bullet at the back of the head just after he had plunged into the Neva from the rear of the Trebassof datcha and started to swim across.  It was a miracle that he had managed to keep going.  Doubtless he hoped to die in peace if only he could reach his own house.

For fifty years he lived miserably as a pharmacist\'s assistant in the back of a disreputable shop in the Notre Dame quarter.  The proprietor of the place was implicated in the famous affair of the gold ingots, which started Rouletabille\'s reputation, and was arrested along with his assistant, Alexis.  It was Rouletabille who proved, clear as day, that poor Alexis was innocent, and that he had never been cognizant of his master\'s evil ways, being absorbed in the depths of his laboratory in trying to work out a naive alchemy which fascinated him, though the world of chemistry had passed it by centuries ago.   At the trial Alexis was acquitted, but found himself in the street.  He shed what tears remained in his body upon the neck of the reporter, assuring him of paradise if he got him back to his own country, because he desired only the one thing more of life, that he might see his birth-land before he died.  Rouletabille advanced the necessary means and sent him to St. Petersburg.  There he was picked up at the end of two days by the police, in a petty gambling-game, and thrown into prison, where he promptly had a chance to show his talents.  He cured some of his companions in misery, and even some of the guards.  A guard who had an injured leg, whose healing he had despaired of, was cured by Alexis.  Then there was found to be no actual charge against him.  They set him free and, moreover, they interested themselves in him.  They found meager employment for him in the Stchoukine-dvor, an immense popular bazaar.  He accumulated a few roubles and installed himself on his own account at the back of a court in the Aptiekarski-Pereoulok, where he gradually piled up a heap of old odds and ends that no one wanted even in the Stchoukine-dvor.  But he was happy, because behind his shop he had installed a little laboratory where he continued for his pleasure his experiments in alchemy and his study of plants. He still proposed to write a book that he had already spoken of in France to Rouletabille, to prove the truth of "Empiric Treatment of Medicinal Herbs, the Science of Alchemy, and the Ancient Experiments in Sorcery."  Between times he continued to cure anyone who applied to him, and the police in particular.  The police guards protected him and used him.  He had splendid plasters for them after "the scandal," as they called the October riots.  So when the doctors of the quarter tried to prosecute him for illegal practice, a deputation of police-guards went to Koupriane, who took the responsibility and discontinued proceedings against him.  They regarded him as under protection of the saints, and Alexis soon came to be regarded himself as something of a holy man.

The little doctor of Vassili-Ostrow had already gone, saying there was nothing more for him to do when two such celebrated specialists had arrived.  However, in spite of their celebrity, no one had ever heard the names they gave.  Koupriane believed the little doctor was an accomplice.  The most necessary thing was to warn those in the room above.  There was immediate danger that someone would come downstairs to find the doctors and take them to the general, or that the general would come down himself to meet them.  Evidently that was what they were waiting for.  They wished to die in his arms, to make sure that this time he did not escape them!  Koupriane directed Ermolai to go into the veranda and speak in a commonplace way to them at the threshold of the drawing-room door, saying that he would go upstairs and see if he might now escort them to Madame Trebassof's room.

And that sudden silence made the two "doctors" raise their faces toward the ceiling.  Then they exchanged an aroused glance.  This change in the manner of things above was dangerous.

That the "doctors" still remained below, that they had not been received instantly, in brief, that the catastrophe had been delayed up to now was due to Matrena Petrovna, whose watchful love, like a watch-dog, was always ready to scent danger.  These two "doctors" whose names she did not know, who arrived so late, and the precipitate departure of the little doctor of Vassili-Ostrow aroused her watchfulness.  Before allowing them to come upstairs to the general she resolved to have a look at them herself downstairs.  She arose from her bed for that; and now her presentiment was justified.  When she saw Ermolai, sober and mysterious, enter with Koupriane\'s message, she knew instinctively, before he spoke, that there were bombs in the house.  When Ermolai did speak it was a blow for everybody.  At first she, Matrena Perovna, had been a frightened, foolish figure in the big flowered dressing-gown belonging to Feodor that she had wrapped about her in her haste.  When Ermolai left, the general, who knew she only trembled for him, tried to reassure her, and, in the midst of the frightened silence of all of them, said a few words recalling the failure of all the previous attempts.  But she shook her head and trembled, shaking with fear for him, in agony at the thought that she could do nothing there above those living bombs but wait for them to burst.  As to the friends, already their limbs were ruined, absolutely ruined, in very truth.  For a moment they were quite incapable of moving.  The jolly Councilor of Empire, Ivan Petrovitch, had no longer a lively tale to tell, and the abominable prospect of " this horrible mix-up" right at hand rendered him much less gay than in his best hours at Cubat\'s place.  And poor Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff was whiter than the snow that covers old Lithuania\'s fields when the winter\'s chase is on.  Athanase Georgevitch himself was not brilliant, and his sanguine face had quite changed, as though he had difficulty in digesting his last masterpiece with knife and fork.  But, in justice to them, that was the first instantaneous effect.  No one could learn like tnat, all af a sudden, that they were about to die in an indiscriminate slaughter without the heart being stopped for a little.  Ermolai\'s words had turned these amiable loafers into waxen statues, but, little by little, their hearts commenced to beat again and each suggested some way of preventing the disaster - all of them sufficiently incoherent - while Matrena Petrovna invoked the Virgin and at the same time helped Feodor Feodorovitch adjust his sword and buckle his belt; for the general wished to die in uniform.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Athanase Georgevitch, his eyes sticking out of his head and his body bent as though he feared the Nihlists just below him might perceive his tall form - through the floor, no doubt - proposed that they should throw themselves out of the window, even at the cost of broken legs.  The saddened Councilor of Empire declared that project simply idiotic, for as they fell they would be absolutely at the disposal of the Nihilists, who would be attracted by the noise and would make a handful of dust of them with a single gesture through the window.  Thaddeus Tchitchnikoff, who couldn\'t think of anything at all, blamed Koupriane and the rest of the police for not having devised something.  Why hadn\'t they already got rid of these Nihilists?  After the frightened silence they had kept at first, now they all spoke at once, in low voices, hoarse and rapid, with shortened breath, making wild movements of the arms and head, and walked here and there in the chamber quite without motive, but very softly on tiptoe, going to the windows, returning, listening at the doors, peering through the key-holes, exchanging absurd suggestions, full of the wildest imaginings.  "If we should ... if ... if," - everybody speaking and everybody making signs for the others to be quiet.  "Lower!  If they hear us, we are lost."  And Koupriane, who did not come, and his police, who themselves had brought two assassins into the house, and were not able now to make them leave without having everybody jump!  They were certainly lost.  There was nothing left but to say their prayers.  They turned to the general and Matrena Petrovna, who were wrapped in a close embrace. Feodor had taken the poor disheveled head of the good Matrena between his hands and pressed it upon his shoulders as he embraced her.  He said, "Rest quietly against my heart, Matrena Petrovna.

Nitchevo!*  We will all die with you, Feodor Feodorovitch."

Koupriane marched ahead.   And they insisted also upon descending the terrible steps slowly, and sang the Bodje tsara Krani, the national anthem!

They strove to quiet him, because, after all, around him some poor wretches had been badly hurt, as well as poor Ermolai, who lay there dead.

A boat plying between these shores in the twilight would certainly attract attention.  Rouletabille showed the guard the paper Koupriane had given him in the beginning, and with the officer (who turned out to be a police officer) as interpreter, he asked his questions.  As a matter of fact the guard had been sufficiently puzzled by the doings and comings of a light boat which, after disappearing for an instant, around the bend of the river, had suddenly rowed swiftly out again and accosted a sailing-yacht which appeared at the opening of the gulf.

Stagnant water stretching to the horizon, coarse grass and reeds, an extraordinary tangle of water-plants, small ponds whose greenish scum did not stir under the stiff breeze, water that was heavy and dirty.  Along this narrow strip of land thrust thus between the marsh, the sky and the sea, he hurried, with many stumblings, his eyes fixed on the deserted gulf.  Suddenly he turned his head at a singular noise.  At first he didn't see anything, but heard in the distance a vague clamoring while a sort of vapor commenced to rise from the marsh.  And then he noticed, nearer him, the high marsh grasses undulating.  Finally he saw a countless flock rising from the bed of the marshes.  Beasts, groups of beasts, whose horns one saw like bayonets, jostled each other trying to keep to the firm land.  Many of them swam and on the backs of some were naked men, stark naked, with hair falling to their shoulders and streaming behind them like manes.  They shouted war-cries and waved their clubs.  Rouletabille stopped short before this prehistoric invasion. He would never have imagined that a few miles from the Newsky Prospect he could have found himself in the midst of such a spectacle.  These savages had not even a loin-cloth.  Where did they come from with their herd?  From what remote place in the world or in old and gone history had they emerged?  What was this new invasion?  What prodigious slaughter-house awaited these unruly herds?  They made a noise like thunder in the marsh.  Here were a thousand unkempt haunches undulating in the marsh like the ocean as a storm approaches.  The stark-naked men jumped along the route, waving their clubs, crying gutturally in a way the beasts seemed to understand.  They worked their way out from the marsh and turned toward the city, leaving behind, to swathe the view of them a while and then fade away, a pestilential haze that hung like an aura about the naked, long-haired men.  It was terrible and magnificent.  In order not to be shoved into the water, Rouletabille had climbed a small rock that stood beside the route, and had waited there as though petrified himself.  When the barbarians had finally passed by he climbed down again, but the route had become a bog of trampled filth."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Happily, he heard the noise of a primitive conveyance behind him.

Such crude conveyances are necessary on such crude roads, but it requires a strong constitution to make a journey on them.  Still, the reporter felt none of the jolting, he was so intent on the sea and the coast of Lachtka Bay.  The vehicle finally reached a wooden bridge, across a murky creek.  As the day commenced to fade colorlessly, Rouletabille jumped off onto the shore and his rustic equipage crossed to the Sestroriesk side.  It was a corner of land black and somber as his thoughts that he surveyed now.  "Watch the Bay of Lachtka!"  The reporter knew that this desolate plain, this impenetrable marsh, this sea which offered the fugitive refuge in innumerable fords, had always been a useful retreat for Nihilistic adventurers.  A hundred legends circulated in St. Petersburg about the mysteries of Lachtka marshes.  And that gave him his last hope.

An old man, with glasses and a long gray beard, evidently the proprietor of the establishment, stood behind the counter, presiding over the zakouskis.  Rouletabille chose some little sandwiches which he placed on a plate.  He took a bottle of pivo and made the man understand that later, if it were possible, he would like a good hot supper.

Suddenly, just when they supposed she was coming straight to shore, the sails fell and a canoe was dropped over the side.

They saw Natacha, who was held up by Priemkof himself, reject the aid of the Nihilist, who did not wish to abandon her, in order that he might save himself. She made him go and seeing that she was going to be taken, stopped short and waited for the enemy stoically, with folded arms. Meanwhile, her three companions succeeded in throwing themselves into the canoe and plied the oars hard while Koupriane's men, in the water up to their chests, discharged their revolvers at the fugitives.  The men in the canoe, fearing to wound Natacha, made no reply to the firing.

He had planned for the whole bag, and his men's stupidity took away all his self-control.  If he had had a whip at hand he would have found prompt solace for his mined hopes.  Natacha, standing in a corner, with her face singularly calm, watched this extraordinary scene that was like a menagerie in which the tamer himself had become a wild beast.  From another corner, Rouletabille kept his eyes fixed on Natacha who ignored him. Ah, that girl, sphinx to them all!  Even to him who thought a while ago that he could read things invisible to other vulgar men in her features, in her eyes!  The impassive face of that girl whose father they had tried to assassinate only a few hours before and who had just pressed the hand of Priemkof, the assassin!  Once she turned her head slightly toward Rouletabille.

Peter and Paul.  A final gesture from the Prefect of Police and the rough bands of the two guards seized the prisoner's frail wrists. They hustled her along, thrust her outside, jamming her against the doorway, venting thus their anger at the reproaches of their chief.

Monsieur, in the evening, at a fete, we are Asiatic.  Let me tell you something on the quiet.  You notice that this enormous dining  ail is surrounded by those windowed balconies.  Each of those windows belongs to a separate private room.  Well, you see that window there?  - yes, there - that is the room of a grand duke - yes, he's the one I mean - a very gay grand duke.  Do you know, one evening when there was a great crowd here - families, monsieur, family parties, high-born families - the window of that particular balcony was thrown open, and a woman stark naked, as naked as my hand, monsieur, was dropped into the dining-hall and ran across it full-speed.  It was a wager, monsieur, a wager of the jolly grand duke's, and the demoiselle won it.  But what a scandal!  Ah, don't speak of it; that would be very bad form.  But - sufficiently Asiatic, eh?  Truly Asiatic.  And - something much more unfortunate - you see that table?  It happened the Russian New Year Eve, at supper.  All the beauty, the whole capital, was here.  Just at midnight the orchestra struck up the Bodje tsara krani* to inaugurate the joyful Russian New Year, and everybody stood up, according to custom, and listened in silence, as loyal subjects should.  Well, at that table, accompanying his family, there was a young student, a fine fellow, very correct, and in uniform.  This unhappy young student, who had risen like everybody else, to listen to the Bodje tsara krani, inadvertently placed his knee on a chair. Truly that is not a correct attitude, monsieur, but really it was no reason for killing him, was it now?  Certainly not. Well, a brute in uniform, an officer quite immaculately gotten-up, drew a revolver from his pocket and discharged it at the student point-blank.  You can imagine the scandal, for the student was dead!  There were Paris journalists there, besides, who had never been there before, you see! Monsieur Gaston Leroux was at that very table.  What a scandal! They had a regular battle.  They broke carafes over the head of the assassin - for he was neither more nor less than an assassin, a drinker of blood - an Asiatic.  They picked up the assassin, who was bleeding all over, and carried him off to look after him.  As to the dead man, he lay stretched out there under a table-cloth, waiting for the police - and those at the tables went on with their drinking. Isn't that Asiatic enough for you?

Ah, that is it, Sire!  Consider always the alternative motive.  What I finally could see myself, the others, who had a fixed opinion about Natacha, could not see.  And why had they their fixed opinion?  Simply because the idea of compromise with the Nihilists aroused at once the idea of complicity!  For such people it is always the same thing - they never can see but the one side of the situation.  But, nevertheless, the situation had two sides, as all situations have.  The question was simple. The compromise was certain.  But why had Natacha compromised herself with the Nihilists?  Was it necessarily in order to lose her father?  Might it not be, on the contrary, in order to save him?  When one has rendezvous with an enemy it is not necessarily to enter into his game, sometimes it is to disarm him with an offer.

Pursued without by the incessant spying of Koupriane, who sought to surprise her in company with the Nihilists, watched closely, too, by the jealous supervision of Boris, who was jealous of Michael Nikolaievitch, she had to seize the only opportunities possible for such negotiations, at night, in her own home, the sole place where, by the very audacity of it, she was able to play her part in any security.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"Michael Nikolaievitch knew Annouchka.  There was certainly the point of departure for the negotiations which that felon-officer, traitor to all sides, worked at will toward the realization of his own infamous project.  I do not think that Michael ever confided to Natacha that he was, from the very first, the instrument of the revolutionaries.  Natacha, who sought to get in touch with the revolutionary party, had to entrust him with a correspondence for Annouchka, following which he assumed direction of the affair, deceiving the Nihilists, who, in their absolute penury, following the revolt, had been seduced by the proposition of General Trebassof's daughter, and deceiving Natacha, whom he pretended to love and by whom he believed himself loved.  At this point in the affair Natacha came to understand that it was necessary to propitiate Michael Nikolaievitch, her indispensable intermediary, and she managed to do it so well that Boris Mourazoff felt the blackest jealousy.  On his side, Michael came to believe that Natacha would have no other husband than himself, but he did not propose to marry a penniIess girl!  And, fatally, it followed that Natacha, in that infernal intrigue, negotiated for the life of her father through the agency of a man who, underhandedly, sought to strike at the general himself, because the immediate death of her father before the negotiation was completed would enrich Natacha, who had given Michael so much to hope.  That frightful tragedy, Sire, in which we have lived our most painful hours, appeared to me, confident of Natacha's innocence, as absolutely simple as for the others it seemed complicated.  Natacha believed she had in Michael Nikolaievitch a man who worked for her, but he worked only for himself.  The day that I was convinced of it, Sire, by my examination of the approach to the balcony, I had a mind to warn Natacha, to go to her and say, 'Get rid of that man.  He will betray you.  If you need an agent, I am at your service.'  But that day, at Krestowsky, destiny prevented my rejoining Natacha; and I must attribute it to destiny, which would not permit the loss of that man.  Michael Nikolaievitch, who was a traitor, was too much in the 'combination,' and if he had been rejected he would have ruined everything.  I caused him to disappear!  The great misfortune then was that Natacha, holding me responsible for the death of a man she believed innocent, never wished to see me again, and, when she did see me, refused to have any conversation with me because I proposed that I take Michael's place for her with the revolutionaries.
