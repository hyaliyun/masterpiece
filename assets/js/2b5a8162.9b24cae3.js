The\r\nlady who, that evening, was scented with the perfume of the lady in\r\nblack, was dressed in white.  She was wonderfully beautiful.  I\r\ncould not help rising and following her.

I\r\nfollowed.  The weather was very mild that evening; the garden doors\r\nwere open.  Mademoiselle Stangerson threw a fichu shawl over her\r\nshoulders and I plainly saw that it was she who was begging Monsieur\r\nDarzac to go with her into the garden.  I continued to follow,\r\ninterested by the agitation plainly exhibited by the bearing of\r\nMonsieur Darzac.  They slowly passed along the wall abutting on the\r\nAvenue Marigny.

His face\r\nwas the red face of a drunkard.  When Monsieur and Mademoiselle\r\nStangerson left, he went to the bar and remained there.  I joined\r\nhim, and rendered him some little service in the midst of the\r\npressing crowd.  He thanked me and told me he was returning to\r\nAmerica three days later, that is to say, on the 26th (the day after\r\nthe crime).  I talked with him about Philadelphia; he told me he\r\nhad lived there for five-and-twenty years, and that it was there he\r\nhad met the illustrious Professor Stangerson and his daughter.

It was not this phrase, however, that I repeated to\r\nhim, when we met here at Glandier.  The sentence of the presbytery\r\nand the bright garden sufficed to open the gate of the chateau.

What threw him into a state of real\r\nconsternation was to learn from me that the day on which he had\r\ngone to meet Mademoiselle Stangerson at the Elysee, was the very\r\nday on which she had gone to the Post Office for the letter.  It\r\nwas that letter, perhaps, which ended with the words: 'The presbytery\r\nhas lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.'

From that day to the\r\nevening at the Elysee, the Sorbonne professor and Mademoiselle\r\nStangerson did not see one another; but they may have written to\r\neach other.

Now even admitting that the letter was\r\nwritten by him - which I do not believe - he knew that Mademoiselle\r\nStangerson had received it, since he had seen it in her hands in\r\nthe garden at the Elysee.

So that, one afternoon, while Monsieur\r\nand Mademoiselle Stangerson were out for a walk, and while Daddy\r\nJacques was away, he entered the latter by the vestibule window.  He\r\nwas alone, and, being in no hurry, he began examining the furniture.\r\nOne of the pieces, resembling a safe, had a very small keyhole.\r\nThat interested him!  He had with him the little key with the brass\r\nhead, and, associating one with the other, he tried the key in the\r\nlock.  The door opened.  He saw nothing but papers.  They must be\r\nvery valuable to have been put away in a safe, and the key to which\r\nto be of so much importance.  Perhaps a thought of blackmail occurred\r\nto him as a useful possibility in helping him in his designs on\r\nMademoiselle Stangerson.  He quickly made a parcel of the papers and\r\ntook it to the lavatory in the vestibule.  Between the time of his\r\nfirst examination of the pavilion and the night of the murder of the\r\nkeeper, Larsan had had time to find out what those papers contained.\r\nHe could do nothing with them, and they were rather compromising.\r\nThat night he took them back to the chateau.
