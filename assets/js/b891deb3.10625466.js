For my wooer was a river-god,\r\nAchelous, who in three shapes was ever asking me from my sire,- coming\r\nnow as a bull in bodily form, now as serpent with sheeny coils, now\r\nwith trunk of man and front of ox, while from a shaggy beard the\r\nstreams of fountain-water flowed abroad. With the fear of such a\r\nsuitor before mine eyes, I was always praying in my wretchedness\r\nthat I might die, or ever I should come near to such a bed.\r\nBut at last, to my joy, came the glorious son of Zeus and Alcmena;\r\nwho dosed with him in combat, and delivered me. How the fight was\r\nwaged, I cannot clearly tell, I know not; if there be any one who\r\nwatched that sight without terror, such might speak: I, as I sat\r\nthere, was distraught with dread, lest beauty should bring me sorrow\r\nat the last. But finally the Zeus of battles ordained well,- if well\r\nindeed it be: for since I have been joined to Heracles as his chosen\r\nbride, fear after fear hath haunted me on his account; one night\r\nbrings a trouble, and the next night, in turn, drives it out. And then\r\nchildren were born to us; whom he has seen only as the husbandman sees\r\nhis distant field, which he visits at seedtime, and once again at\r\nharvest. Such was the life that kept him journeying to and fro, in the\r\nservice of a certain master.\r\nBut now, when he hath risen above those trials,- now it is that my\r\nanguish is sorest. Ever since he slew the valiant Iphitus, we have\r\nbeen dwelling here in Trachis, exiles from our home, and the guests of\r\nstranger; but where he is, no one knows; I only know that he is\r\ngone, and hath pierced my heart with cruel pangs for him. I am\r\nalmost sure that some evil hath befallen him; it is no short space\r\nthat hath passed, but ten long months, and then five more,- and\r\nstill no message from him. Yes, there has been some dread\r\nmischance;- witness that tablet which he left with me ere he went\r\nforth: oft do I pray to the gods that I may not have received it for\r\nmy sorrow.\r\nNURSE\r\nDeianeira, my mistress, many a time have I marked thy bitter tears\r\nand lamentations, as thou bewailedst the going forth of Heracles;\r\nbut now,- if it be meet to school the free-born with the counsels of a\r\nslave, and if I must say what behoves thee,- why, when thou art so\r\nrich in sons, dost thou send no one of them to seek thy lord;- Hyllus,\r\nbefore all, who might well go on that errand, if he cared that there\r\nshould be tidings of his father's welfare? Lo! there he comes,\r\nspeeding towards the house with timely step; if, then, thou deemest\r\nthat I speak in season, thou canst use at once my counsel, and the\r\nman.\r\n(HYLLUS comes in from the side.)\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nMy child, my son, wise words may fall, it seems, from humble lips;\r\nthis woman is a slave, but hath spoken in the spirit of the free.\r\nHYLLUS\r\nHow, mother? Tell me, if it may be told.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nIt brings thee shame, she saith, that, when thy father hath been\r\nso long a stranger, thou hast not sought to learn where he is.\r\nHYLLUS\r\nNay, I know,- if rumour can be trusted.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nAnd in what region, my child, doth rumour place him?\r\nHYLLUS\r\nLast year, they say, through all the months, he toiled as\r\nbondman to Lydian woman.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nIf he bore that, then no tidings can surprise.\r\nHYLLUS\r\nWell, he has been delivered from that, as I hear.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nWhere, then, is he reported to be now,- alive or dead?\r\nHYLLUS\r\nHe is waging or planning a war, they say, upon Euboea, the realm\r\nof Eurytus.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nKnowest thou, my son, that he hath left with me sure oracles\r\ntouching that land?\r\nHYLLUS\r\nWhat are they, mother?

For we are saved, if he find safety, or we\r\nperish with him.\r\nHYLLUS\r\nAy, I will go, my mother; and, had I known the import of these\r\nprophecies, I had been there long since; but, as it was, my father's\r\nwonted fortune suffered me not to feel fear for him, or to be\r\nanxious overmuch. Now that I have the knowledge, I will spare no pains\r\nto learn the whole truth in this matter.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nGo, then, my son; be the seeker ne'er so late, he is rewarded if\r\nhe learn tidings of joy."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"(HYLLUS departs as the CHORUS OF TRACHINIAN MAIDENS enters.

Yes, the tender plant\r\ngrows in those sheltered regions of its own! and the Sun-god's heat\r\nvexes it not, nor rain, nor any wind; but it rejoices in its sweet,\r\nuntroubled being, til such time as the maiden is called a wife, and\r\nfinds her portion of anxious thoughts in the night, brooding on danger\r\nto husband or to children. Such an one could understand the burden\r\nof my cares; she could judge them by her own.\r\nWell, I have had many a sorrow to weep for ere now; but I am going\r\nto speak of one more grievous than them all.\r\nWhen Heracles my lord was going from home on his last journey,\r\nhe left in the house an ancient tablet, inscribed with tokens which he\r\nhad never brought himself to explain to me before, many as were the\r\nordeals to which he had gone forth. He had always departed as if to\r\nconquer, not to die. But now, as if he were a doomed man, he told me\r\nwhat portion of his substance I was to take for my dower, and how he\r\nwould have his sons share their father's land amongst them. And he\r\nfixed the time; saying that, when a year and three months should\r\nhave passed since he had left the country, then he was fated to die;\r\nor, if he should have survived that term, to live thenceforth an\r\nuntroubled life.\r\nSuch, he said, was the doom ordained by the gods to be\r\naccomplished in the toils of Heracles; as the ancient oak at Dodona\r\nhad spoken of yore, by the mouth of the two Peleiades. And this is the\r\nprecise moment when the fulfilment of that word becomes due; so that I\r\nstart up from sweet slumber, my friends, stricken with terror at the\r\nthought that I must remain widowed of the noblest among men.\r\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\r\nHush- no more ill-omened words; I see a man approaching, who wears\r\na wreath, as if for joyous tidings.\r\n(A MESSENGER enters.)\r\nMESSENGER\r\nQueen Deianeira, I shall be the first of messengers to free thee\r\nfrom fear.

Thus their eagerness detains him against\r\nhis will; but thou shalt presently see him face to face.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nO Zeus, who rulest the meads of Oeta, sacred from the scythe, at\r\nlast, though late, thou hast given us joy! Uplift your voices, ye\r\nwomen within the house and ye beyond our gates, since now we are\r\ngladdened by the light of this message, that hath risen on us beyond\r\nmy hope!\r\nLEADER OF ONE SEMI-CHORUS  (singing)\r\nLet the maidens raise a joyous strain for the house, with songs of\r\ntriumph at the hearth; and, amidst them, let the shout of the men go\r\nup with one accord for Apollo of the bright quiver, our Defender!\r\nAnd at the same time, ye maidens, lift up a paean, cry aloud to his\r\nsister, the Ortygian Artemis, smiter of deer, goddess of the twofold\r\ntorch, and to the Nymphs her neighbours!\r\nLEADER OF OTHER SEMI-CHORUS\r\nMy spirit soars; I will not reject the wooing of the flute.- O\r\nthou sovereign of my soul! Lo, the ivy's spell begins to work upon me!\r\nEuoe!- even now it moves me to whirl in the swift dance of Bachanals!\r\nCHORUS\r\nPraise, praise unto the Healer!\r\nLEADER OF WHOLE CHORUS\r\nSee, dear lady, see! Behold, these tidings are taking shape before\r\nthy gaze.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nI see it, dear maidens; my watching eyes had not failed to note\r\nyon company.  (Enter LICHAS, followed by Captive Maidens.\r\nConspicuous among them is IOLE.)  -All hail to the herald, whose\r\ncoming hath been so long delayed!- if indeed thou bringest aught\r\nthat can give joy.\r\nLICHAS\r\nWe are happy in our return, and happy in thy greeting, lady, which\r\nbefits the deed achieved; for when a man hath fair fortune, he needs\r\nmust win good welcome.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nO best of friends, tell me first what first I would know,- shall I\r\nreceive Heracles alive?\r\nLICHAS\r\nI, certainly, left him alive and well,- in vigorous health,\r\nunburdened by disease.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nWhere, tell me- at home, or on foreign soil?\r\nLICHAS\r\nThere is a headland of Euboea, where to Cenaean Zeus he\r\nconsecrates altars, and the tribute of fruitful ground.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nIn payment of a vow, or at the bidding of an oracle?\r\nLICHAS\r\nFor a vow, made when he was seeking to conquer and despoil the\r\ncountry of these women who are before thee.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nAnd these- who are they, I pray thee, and whose daughters? They\r\ndeserve pity, unless their plight deceives me.\r\nLICHAS\r\nThese are captives whom he chose out for himself and for the gods,\r\nwhen he sacked the city of Eurytus.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nWas it the war against that city which kept him away so long,\r\nbeyond all forecast, past all count of days?\r\nLICHAS\r\nNot so: the greater part of the time he was detained in Lydia,- no\r\nfree man, as he declares, but sold into bondage. No offence should\r\nattend on the word, lady, when the deed is found to be of Zeus. So\r\nhe passed a whole year, as he himself avows, in thraldom to Omphale\r\nthe barbarian. And so stung was he by that reproach, he bound\r\nhimself by a solemn oath that he would one day enslave, with wife\r\nand child, the man who had brought that calamity upon him. Nor did\r\nhe speak the word in vain; but, when he bad been purged, gathered an\r\nalien host, and went against the city of Eurytus. That man, he said,\r\nalone of mortals, had a share in causing his misfortune. For when\r\nHeracles, an old friend, came to his house and hearth, Eurytus\r\nheaped on him the taunts of a bitter tongue and spiteful soul,-\r\nsaying, 'Thou hast unerring arrows in thy hands, and yet my sons\r\nsurpass thee in the trial of archery'; 'Thou art a slave,' he cried,\r\n'a free man's broken thrall': and at a banquet, when his guest was\r\nfull of wine, he thrust him from his doors.\r\nWroth thereat, when afterward Iphitus came to the hill of\r\nTiryns, in search for horses that had strayed, Heracles seized a\r\nmoment when the man's wandering thoughts went not with his wandering\r\ngaze, and hurled him from a tower-like summit. But in anger at that\r\ndeed, Zeus our lord, Olympian sire of all, sent him forth into\r\nbondage, and spared not, because, this once, he had taken a life by\r\nguile. Had he wreaked his vengeance openly, Zeus would surely have\r\npardoned him the righteous triumph; for the gods, too, love not\r\ninsolence.\r\nSo those men, who waxed so proud with bitter speech, are\r\nthemselves in the mansions of the dead, all of them, and their city is\r\nenslaved; while the women whom thou beholdest, fallen from happiness\r\nto misery, come here to thee; for such was thy lord's command, which\r\nI, his faithful servant, perform. He himself, thou mayest be sure,- so\r\nsoon as he shall have offered holy sacrifice for his victory to Zeus\r\nfrom whom he sprang,- will be with thee. After all the fair tidings\r\nthat have been told, this, indeed, is the sweetest word to hear.\r\nLEADER OF THE CHORUS\r\nNow, O Queen, thy joy is assured; part is with thee, and thou hast\r\npromise of the rest.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nYea, have I not the fullest reason to rejoice at these tidings\r\nof my lord's happy fortune? To such fortune, such joy must needs\r\nrespond. And yet a prudent mind can see room for misgiving lest he who\r\nprospers should one day suffer reverse. A strange pity hath come\r\nover me, friends, at the sight of these ill-fated exiles, homeless and\r\nfatherless in a foreign land; once the daughters, perchance, of\r\nfree-born sires, but now doomed to the life of slaves. O Zeus, who\r\nturnest the tide of battle, never may I see child of mine thus visited\r\nby thy hand; nay, if such visitation is to be, may it not fall while\r\nDeianeira lives! Such dread do I feel, beholding these.\r\n(To IOLE)  Ah, hapless girl, say, who art thou? A maiden, or a\r\nmother? To judge by thine aspect, an innocent maiden, and of a noble\r\nrace. Lichas, whose daughter is this stranger? Who is her mother,\r\nwho her sire? Speak, I pity her more than all the rest, when I\r\nbehold her; as she alone shows due feeling for her plight.\r\nLICHAS\r\nHow should I know? Why should'st thou ask me? Perchance the off,\r\nspring of not the meanest in yonder land.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nCan she be of royal race? Had Eurytus a daughter?\r\nLICHAS\r\nI know not; indeed, I asked not many questions.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nAnd thou hast not heard her name from any of her companions?\r\nLICHAS\r\nNo, indeed, I went through my task in silence.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nUnhappy girl, let me, at least, hear it from thine own mouth. It\r\nis indeed distressing not to know thy name.\r\n(IOLE maintains her silence.)\r\nLICHAS\r\nIt will be unlike her former behaviour, then, I can tell thee,\r\nif she opens her lips: for she hath not uttered one word, but hath\r\never been travailing with the burden of her sorrow, and weeping\r\nbitterly, poor girl, since she left her wind-swept home. Such a\r\nstate is grievous for herself, but claims our forbearance.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nThen let her be left in peace, and pass under our roof as she\r\nwishes; her present woes must not be crowned with fresh pains at my\r\nhands; she hath enough already.-Now let us all go in, that thou mayest\r\nstart speedily on thy journey, while I make all things ready in the\r\nhouse."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,h.jsx)(n.code,{children:"(LICHAS leads the captives into the house.

But now the herald has thrust Love out of\r\nsight, and tells different tale.\r\nWell, when he could not persuade her sire to give him the maiden\r\nfor his paramour, he devised some petty complaint as a pretext, and\r\nmade war upon her land,- that in which, as he said, this Eurytus\r\nbore sway,- and slew the prince her father, and sacked her city. And\r\nnow, as thou seest, he comes sending her to this house not in careless\r\nfashion, lady, nor like slave:-no, dream not of that,- it is not\r\nlikely, if his heart is kindled with desire.\r\nI resolved, therefore, O Queen, to tell thee all that I had\r\nheard from yonder man.

Who and where is the man that will be thy witness\r\nto hearing this from me?\r\nMESSENGER\r\nTo many of our own folk thou saidst it: in the public gathering of\r\nTrachinians, a great crowd heard thus much from thee.\r\nLICHAS\r\nAy- said they heard-but 'tis one thing to report a fancy, and\r\nanother to make the story good.\r\nMESSENGER\r\nA fancy! Didst thou not say on thine oath that thou wast\r\nbringing her us a bride for Heracles?\r\nLICHAS\r\nI? bringing a bride?- In the name of the gods, dear mistress, tell\r\nme who this stranger may be?\r\nMESSENGER\r\nOne who heard from thine own lips that the conquest of the whole\r\ncity was due to love for this girl: the Lydian woman was not its\r\ndestroyer, but the passion which this maid has kindled.\r\nLICHAS\r\nLady, let this fellow withdraw: to prate with the brainsick befits\r\nnot sane man.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nNay, I implore thee by Zeus whose lightnings go forth over the\r\nhigh glens of Oeta, do not cheat me of the truth! For she to whom thou\r\nwilt speak is not ungenerous, nor hath she yet to learn that the human\r\nheart is inconstant to its joys. They are not wise, then, who stand\r\nforth to buffet against Love; for Love rules the gods as he will,\r\nand me; and why not another woman, such as I am? So I am mad indeed,\r\nif I blame my husband, because that distemper hath seized him; or this\r\nwoman, his partner in a thing which is no shame to them, and no\r\nwrong to me. Impossible! No; if he taught thee to speak falsely,\r\n'tis not a noble lesson that thou art learning; or if thou art thine\r\nown teacher in this, thou wilt be found cruel when it is thy wish to\r\nprove kind. Nay, tell me the whole truth. To a free-born man, the name\r\nof liar cleaves as a deadly brand. If thy hope is to escape detection,\r\nthat, too, is vain; there are many to whom thou hast spoken, who\r\nwill tell me.\r\nAnd if thou art afraid, thy fear is mistaken. Not to learn the\r\ntruth,-that, indeed, would pain me; but to know it- what is there\r\nterrible in that? Hath not Heracles wedded others ere now,- ay, more\r\nthan living man,- and no one of them hath bad harsh word or taunt from\r\nme; nor shall this girl, though her whole being should be absorbed\r\nin her passion; for indeed I felt a profound pity when I beheld her,\r\nbecause her beauty hath wrecked her life, and she, hapless one, all\r\ninnocent, hath brought her fatherland to ruin and to bondage.\r\nWell, those things must go with wind and stream.- To thee I\r\nsay,-deceive whom thou wilt, but ever speak the truth to me.\r\nLEADER\r\nHearken to her good counsel, and hereafter thou shalt have no\r\ncause to complain of this lady; our thanks, too, will be thine.\r\nLICHAS\r\nNay, then, dear mistress,- since I see that thou thinkest as\r\nmortals should think, and canst allow for weakness,- I will tell\r\nthee the whole truth, and hide it not. Yes, it is even as yon man\r\nsaith. This girl inspired that overmastering love which long ago smote\r\nthrough the soul of Heracles; for this girl's sake the desolate\r\nOechalia, her home, was made the prey of his spear. And he,- it is\r\njust to him to say so,- never denied this,- never told me to conceal\r\nit. But I, lady, fearing to wound thy heart by such tidings, have\r\nsinned, if thou count this in any sort a sin.\r\nNow, however, that thou knowest the whole story, for both your\r\nsakes,- for his, and not less for thine own,- bear with the woman, and\r\nbe content that the words which thou hast spoken regarding her\r\nshould bind thee still. For he, whose strength is victorious in all\r\nelse, hath been utterly vanquished by his passion for this girl.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nIndeed, mine own thoughts move me to act thus. Trust me, I will\r\nnot add a new affliction to my burdens by waging a fruitless fight\r\nagainst the gods.\r\nBut let us go into the house, that thou mayest receive my\r\nmessages; and, since gifts should be meetly recompensed with gifts,-\r\nthat thou mayest take these also.

And now we twain are to\r\nshare the same marriage-bed, the same embrace. Such is the reward that\r\nHeracles hath sent me,- he whom I called true and loyal,- for guarding\r\nhis home through all that weary time. I have no thought of anger\r\nagainst him, often as he is vexed with this distemper. But then to\r\nlive with her, sharing the same union- what woman could endure it? For\r\nI see that the flower of her age is blossoming, while mine is\r\nfading; and the eyes of men love to cull the bloom of youth, but\r\nthey turn aside from the old. This, then, is my fear,- lest\r\nHeracles, in name my spouse, should be the younger's mate.\r\nBut, as I said, anger ill beseems a woman of understanding. I will\r\ntell you, friends, the way by which I hope to find deliverance and\r\nrelief. I had a gift, given to me long ago by a monster of olden time,\r\naid stored in an urn of bronze; a gift which, while yet a girl, I took\r\nup from the shaggy-breasted Nessus,- from his life-blood, as he lay\r\ndying; Nessus, who used to carry men in his arms across the deep\r\nwaters of the Evenus, using no oar to waft them, nor sail of ship.\r\nI, too, was carried on his shoulders,- when, by my father's\r\nsending, first went forth with Heracles as his wife; and when I was in\r\nmid-stream, he touched me with wanton hands. I shrieked; the son of\r\nZeus turned quickly round, and shot a feathered arrow; it whizzed\r\nthrough his breast to the lungs; and, in his mortal faintness, thus\r\nmuch the Centaur spake:-\r\n'Child of aged Oeneus, thou shalt have at least this profit of\r\nmy ferrying,- if thou wilt hearken,-because thou wast the last whom\r\nI conveyed. If thou gatherest with thy hands the blood clotted round\r\nmy wound, at the place where the Hydra, Lerna's monstrous growth, hath\r\ntinged the arrow with black gall,- this shall be to thee a charm for\r\nthe soul of Heracles, so that he shall never look upon any woman to\r\nlove her more than thee.'\r\nI bethought me of this, my friends- for, after his death, I had\r\nkept it carefully locked up in a secret place; and I have anointed\r\nthis robe, doing everything to it as he enjoined while he lived. The\r\nwork is finished. May deeds of wicked daring be ever far from my\r\nthoughts, and from my knowledge,- as I abhor the women who attempt\r\nthem! But if in any wise I may prevail against this girl by\r\nlove-spells and charms used on Heracles, the means to that end are\r\nready;-unless, indeed, I seem to be acting rashly: if so, I will\r\ndesist forthwith.\r\nLEADER\r\nNay, if these measures give any ground of confidence, we think\r\nthat thy design is not amiss.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nWell, the ground stands thus,- there is a fair promise; but I have\r\nnot yet essayed the proof.\r\nLEADER\r\nNay, knowledge must come through action; thou canst have no test\r\nwhich is not fanciful, save by trial.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nWell, we shall know presently:- for there I see the man already at\r\nthe doors; and he will soon be going.- Only may my secret be well kept\r\nby you! While thy deeds are hidden, even though they be not seemly,\r\nthou wilt never be brought to shame.\r\n(LICHAS enters from the house.)\r\nLICHAS\r\nWhat are thy commands? Give me my charge, daughter of Oeneus;\r\nfor already I have tarried over long.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nIndeed, I have just been seeing to this for thee, Lichas, while\r\nthou wast speaking to the stranger maidens in the house;- that thou\r\nshouldest take for me this long robe, woven by mine own hand, a gift\r\nto mine absent lord.\r\nAnd when thou givest it, charge him that he, and no other, shall\r\nbe the first to wear it; that it shall not be seen by the light of the\r\nsun, nor by the sacred precinct, nor by the fire at the hearth,\r\nuntil he stand forth, conspicuous before all eyes, and show it to\r\nthe gods on a day when bulls are slain.\r\nFor thus had I vowed,- that if I should ever see or hear that he\r\nhad come safely home, I would duly clothe him in this robe, and so\r\npresent him to the gods, newly radiant at their altar in new garb.\r\nAs proof, thou shalt carry a token, which he will quickly\r\nrecognise within the circle of this seal.\r\nNow go thy way; and, first, remember the rule that messengers\r\nshould not be meddlers; next, so bear thee that my thanks may be\r\njoined to his doubling the grace which thou shalt win.\r\nLICHAS\r\nNay, if I ply this herald-craft of Hermes with any sureness, I\r\nwill never trip in doing thine errand: I will not fail to deliver this\r\ncasket as it is, and to add thy words in attestation of thy gift.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nThou mayest be going now; for thou knowest well how things are\r\nwith us in the house.\r\nLICHAS\r\nI know, and will report, that all hath prospered.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nAnd then thou hast seen the greeting given to the stranger\r\nmaiden-thou knowest how I welcomed her?\r\nLICHAS\r\nSo that my heart was filled with wondering joy.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nWhat more, then, is there for thee to tell?

But I must tell the story\r\nMore at length, that thou mayest know exactly how this thing befell.\r\nI neglected no part of the precepts which the savage Centaur\r\ngave me, when the bitter barb was rankling in his side: they were in\r\nmy memory, like the graven words which no hand may wash from a\r\ntablet of bronze. Now these were his orders, and I obeyed them:-to\r\nkeep this unguent in secret place, always remote from fire and from\r\nthe sun's warm ray, until I should apply it, newly spread, where I\r\nwished. So had I done. And now, when the moment for action had come, I\r\nperformed the anointing privily in the house, with a tuft of soft wool\r\nwhich I had plucked from a sheep of our home-flock; then I folded up\r\nmy gift, and laid it, unvisited by sunlight, within its casket, as\r\nye saw.\r\nBut as I was going back into the house, I beheld a thing too\r\nwondrous for words, and passing the wit of man to understand. I\r\nhappened to have thrown the shred of wool, with which I bad been\r\npreparing the robe, into the full blaze of the sunshine. As it grew\r\nwarm, it shrivelled all away, and quickly crumbled to powder on the\r\nground, like nothing so much as the dust shed from a saw's teeth where\r\nmen work timber. In such a state it lies as it fell. And from the\r\nearth, where it was strewn, clots of foam seethed up, as when the rich\r\njuice of the blue fruit from the vine of Bacchus is poured upon the\r\nground.\r\nSo I know not, hapless one, whither to turn my thoughts; I only\r\nsee that I have done a fearful deed. Why or wherefore should the\r\nmonster, in his death-throes, have shown good will to me, on whose\r\naccount he was dying? Impossible! No, he was cajoling me, in order\r\nto slay the man who had smitten him: and I gain the knowledge of\r\nthis too late, when it avails no more. Yes, I alone- unless my\r\nforeboding prove false- I, wretched one, must destroy him! For I\r\nknow that the arrow which made the wound did scathe even to the god\r\nCheiron; and it kills all beasts that it touches. And since 'tis\r\nthis same black venom in the blood that hath passed out through the\r\nwound of Nessus, must it not kill my lord also? I ween it must.\r\nHowbeit, I am resolved that, if he is to fall, at the same time\r\nI also shall be swept from life; for no woman could bear to live\r\nwith an evil name, if she rejoices that her nature is not evil.\r\nLEADER\r\nMischief must needs be feared; but it is not well to doom our hope\r\nbefore the event.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nUnwise counsels leave no room even for a hope which can lend\r\ncourage.\r\nLEADER\r\nYet towards those who have erred unwittingly, men's anger is\r\nsoftened; and so it should be towards thee.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nNay, such words are not for one who has borne a part in the ill\r\ndeed, but only for him who has no trouble at his own door.\r\nLEADER\r\n'Twere well to refrain from further speech, unless thou would'st\r\ntell aught to thine own son; for he is at hand, who went erewhile to\r\nseek his sire.\r\n(Enter HYLLUS)\r\nHYLLUS\r\nO mother, would that one of three things had befallen thee!\r\nWould that thou wert dead,- or, if living, no mother of mine,- or that\r\nsome new and better spirit had passed into thy bosom.\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nAh, my son, what cause have I given thee to abhor me?\r\nHYLLUS\r\nI tell thee that thy husband- yea, my sire-bath been done to death\r\nby thee this day\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nOh, what word hath passed thy lips, my child!\r\nHYLLUS\r\nA word that shall not fail of fulfilment; for who may undo that\r\nwhich bath come to pass?\r\nDEIANEIRA\r\nWhat saidst thou, my son?

There is a sea-washed headland\r\nof Euboea, Cape Cenaeum, where he dedicated altars and a sacred\r\ngrove to the Zeus of his fathers; and there I first beheld him, with\r\nthe joy of yearning love.\r\nHe was about to celebrate a great sacrifice, when his own\r\nherald, Lichas, came to him from home, bearing thy gift, the deadly\r\nrobe; which he put on, according to thy precept; and then began his\r\noffering with twelve bulls, free from blemish, the firstlings of the\r\nspoil; but altogether he brought a hundred victims, great or small, to\r\nthe altar.\r\nAt first, hapless one, he prayed with serene soul, rejoicing in\r\nhis comely garb. But when the blood-fed flame began to blaze from\r\nthe holy offerings and from the resinous pine, a sweat broke forth\r\nupon his flesh, and the tunic clung to his sides, at every joint,\r\nclose-glued, as if by a craftsman's hand; there came a biting pain\r\nthat racked his bones; and then the venom, as of some deadly, cruel\r\nviper, began to devour him.\r\nThereupon he shouted for the unhappy Lichas,- in no wise to\r\nblame for thy crime,- asking what treason had moved him to bring\r\nthat robe; but he, all-unknowing, hapless one, said that he had\r\nbrought the gift from thee alone, as it had been sent. When his master\r\nheard it, as a piercing spasm clutched his lungs, he caught him by the\r\nfoot, where the ankle turns in the socket, and hurled him at a\r\nsurf-beaten rock in the sea; and he made the white brain to ooze\r\nfrom the hair, as the skull was dashed to splinters, and blood\r\nscattered therewith.\r\nBut all the people lifted up a cry of awe-struck grief, seeing\r\nthat one was frenzied, and the other slain; and no one dared to come\r\nbefore the man. For the pain dragged him to earth, or made him leap\r\ninto the air, with yells and shrieks, till the cliffs rang around,\r\nsteep headlands of Locris, and Euboean capes.\r\nBut when he was spent with oft throwing himself on the ground in\r\nhis anguish, and oft making loud lament,- cursing his fatal marriage\r\nwith thee, the vile one, and his alliance with Oeneus,- saying how\r\nhe had found in it the ruin of his life,- then from out of the\r\nshrouding altar-smoke, he lifted up his wildly-rolling eyes, and saw\r\nme in the great crowd, weeping. He turned his gaze on me, and called\r\nme: 'O son, draw near; do not fly from my trouble, even though thou\r\nmust share my death. Come, bear me forth, and set me, if thou canst,\r\nin a place where no man shall see me; or, if thy pity forbids that, at\r\nleast convey me with all speed out of this land, and let me not die\r\nwhere I am.'\r\nThat command sufficed; we laid him in mid-ship, and brought\r\nhim-but hardly brought him- to this shore, moaning in his torments.\r\nAnd ye shall presently behold him, alive, or lately dead.\r\nSuch, mother, are the designs and deeds against my sire whereof\r\nthou hast been found guilty. May avenging justice and the Erinys visit\r\nthee for them!

But if thou\r\ndo it not, even from the world below my curse and my wrath shall\r\nwait on thee for ever.\r\nHYLLUS\r\nAlas, my father, what hast thou spoken?

What perplexities surround me!\r\nHERACLES\r\nYea, since thou deignest not to hear thy sire.\r\nHYLLUS\r\nBut must I learn, then, to be impious, my father?\r\nHERACLES\r\n'Tis not impiety, if thou shalt gladden my heart.\r\nHYLLUS\r\nDost thou command me, then, to do this deed, as a clear duty?\r\nHERACLES\r\nI command thee,- the gods bear me witness!\r\nHYLLUS\r\nThen will I do it, and refuse not,- calling upon the gods to\r\nwitness thy deed. I can never be condemned for loyalty to thee, my\r\nfather.\r\nHERACLES\r\nThou endest well; and to these words, my son, quickly add the\r\ngracious deed, that thou mayest lay me on the pyre before any pain\r\nreturns to rend or sting me.\r\nCome, make haste and lift me! This, in truth, is rest from\r\ntroubles; this is the end, the last end, of Heracles!\r\nHYLLUS\r\nNothing, indeed, hinders the fulfilment of thy wish, since thy\r\ncommand constrains us, my father.\r\nHERACLES  (chanting)\r\nCome, then, ere thou arouse this plague, O my stubborn soul,\r\ngive me a curb as of steel on lips set like stone to stone, and let no\r\ncry escape them; seeing that the deed which thou art to do, though\r\ndone perforce, is yet worthy of thy joy!\r\nHYLLUS  (chanting)\r\nLift him, followers!
