When I got into the top of the gap\r\nthe first thing I saw was something white amongst the dark bushes\r\nover the spot where the Chinaman\'s grave was, and I stood staring at it\r\nwith both eyes.  It moved out of the shadow presently, and I saw that it\r\nwas a white bullock, and I felt relieved.  I\'d hardly felt relieved when,\r\nall at once, there came a "pat-pat-pat" of running feet close behind me!\r\nI jumped round quick, but there was nothing there, and while I stood\r\nstaring all ways for Sunday, there came a "pat-pat", then a pause,\r\nand then "pat-pat-pat-pat" behind me again:  it was like some one\r\ndodging and running off that time.  I started to walk down the track\r\npretty fast, but hadn\'t gone a dozen yards when "pat-pat-pat",\r\nit was close behind me again.  I jerked my eyes over my shoulder\r\nbut kept my legs going.  There was nothing behind, but I fancied I saw\r\nsomething slip into the Bush to the right.  It must have been the moonlight\r\non the moving boughs; there was a good breeze blowing now.  I got down\r\nto a more level track, and was making across a spur to the main road,\r\nwhen "pat-pat!" "pat-pat-pat, pat-pat-pat!" it was after me again.\r\nThen I began to run -- and it began to run too! "pat-pat-pat" after me\r\nall the time.  I hadn\'t time to look round.  Over the spur and down the siding\r\nand across the flat to the road I went as fast as I could split my legs apart.\r\nI had a scared idea that I was getting a touch of the "jim-jams",\r\nand that frightened me more than any outside ghost could have done.\r\nI stumbled a few times, and saved myself, but, just before I reached the road,\r\nI fell slithering on to my hands on the grass and gravel.\r\nI thought I\'d broken both my wrists.  I stayed for a moment\r\non my hands and knees, quaking and listening, squinting round\r\nlike a great gohana; I couldn\'t hear nor see anything.  I picked myself up,\r\nand had hardly got on one end, when "pat-pat!" it was after me again.\r\nI must have run a mile and a half altogether that night.\r\nIt was still about three-quarters of a mile to the camp,\r\nand I ran till my heart beat in my head and my lungs choked up in my throat.\r\nI saw our tent-fire and took off my hat to run faster.  The footsteps stopped,\r\nthen something about the hat touched my fingers, and I stared at it --\r\nand the thing dawned on me.  I hadn\'t noticed at Peter Anderson\'s --\r\nmy head was too swimmy to notice anything.  It was an old hat of the style\r\nthat the first diggers used to wear, with a couple of loose ribbon ends,\r\nthree or four inches long, from the band behind.  As long as I walked quietly\r\nthrough the gully, and there was no wind, the tails didn\'t flap,\r\nbut when I got up into the breeze, they flapped or were still\r\naccording to how the wind lifted them or pressed them down flat on the brim.\r\nAnd when I ran they tapped all the time; and the hat being tight on my head,\r\nthe tapping of the ribbon ends against the straw sounded loud of course.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"`I sat down on a log for a while to get some of my wind back and cool down,\r\nand then I went to the camp as quietly as I could, and had\r\na long drink of water."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'`"You seem to be a bit winded, Dave," said Jim Bently, "and mighty thirsty.\r\nDid the Chinaman\'s ghost chase you?"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"`I told him not to talk rot, and went into the tent, and lay down on my bunk,\r\nand had a good rest.'"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The Loaded Dog."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Dave Regan, Jim Bently, and Andy Page were sinking a shaft at Stony Creek\r\nin search of a rich gold quartz reef which was supposed to exist\r\nin the vicinity.
