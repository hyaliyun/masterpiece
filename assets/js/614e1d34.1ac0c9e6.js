In attempting to\r\ntrace the chief current of ancient traditions about Helen, we cannot\r\nreally get further back than the Homeric poems, the Iliad and\r\nOdyssey.  Philological conjecture may assure us that Helen, like most\r\nof the characters of old romance, is "merely the Dawn," or Light, or\r\nsome other bright being carried away by Paris, who represents Night,\r\nor Winter, or the Cloud, or some other power of darkness.  Without\r\ndiscussing these ideas, it may be said that the Greek poets (at all\r\nevents before allegorical explanations of mythology came in, about\r\nfive hundred years before Christ) regarded Helen simply as a woman of\r\nwonderful beauty.  Homer was not thinking of the Dawn, or the Cloud\r\nwhen he described Helen among the Elders on the Ilian walls, or\r\nrepeated her lament over the dead body of Hector.  The Homeric poems\r\nare our oldest literary documents about Helen, but it is probable\r\nenough that the poet has modified and purified more ancient\r\ntraditions which still survive in various fragments of Greek legend.\r\nIn Homer Helen is always the daughter of Zeus.  Isocrates tells us\r\n("Helena," 211 b) that "while many of the demigods were children of\r\nZeus, he thought the paternity of none of his daughters worth\r\nclaiming, save that of Helen only."  In Homer, then, Helen is the\r\ndaughter of Zeus, but Homer says nothing of the famous legend which\r\nmakes Zeus assume the form of a swan to woo the mother of Helen.\r\nUnhomeric as this myth is, we may regard it as extremely ancient.\r\nVery similar tales of pursuit and metamorphosis, for amatory or other\r\npurposes, among the old legends of Wales, and in the "Arabian\r\nNights," as well as in the myths of Australians and Red Indians.\r\nAgain, the belief that different families of mankind descend from\r\nanimals, as from the Swan, or from gods in the shape of animals, is\r\nfound in every quarter of the world, and among the rudest races.\r\nMany Australian natives of to-day claim descent, like the royal house\r\nof Sparta, from the Swan.  The Greek myths hesitated as to whether\r\nNemesis or Leda was the bride of the Swan.  Homer only mentions Leda\r\namong "the wives and daughters of mighty men," whose ghosts Odysseus\r\nbeheld in Hades:  "And I saw Leda, the famous bedfellow of Tyndareus,\r\nwho bare to Tyndareus two sons, hardy of heart, Castor, tamer of\r\nsteeds, and the boxer Polydeuces."  These heroes Helen, in the Iliad\r\n(iii. 238), describes as her mother\'s sons.  Thus, if Homer has any\r\ndistinct view on the subject, he holds that Leda is the mother of\r\nHelen by Zeus, of the Dioscuri by Tyndareus.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Greek ideas as to the character of Helen varied with the various\r\nmoods of Greek literature.  Homer\'s own ideas about his heroine are\r\nprobably best expressed in the words with which Priam greets her as\r\nshe appears among the assembled elders, who are watching the Argive\r\nheroes from the wall of Troy: --"In nowise, dear child, do I blame\r\nthee; nay, the Gods are to blame, who have roused against me the\r\nwoful war of the Achaeans."  Homer, like Priam, throws the guilt of\r\nHelen on the Gods, but it is not very easy to understand exactly what\r\nhe means by saying "the Gods are to blame."  In the first place,\r\nHomer avoids the psychological problems in which modern poetry\r\nrevels, by attributing almost all changes of the moods of men to\r\ndivine inspiration.  Thus when Achilles, in a famous passage of the\r\nfirst book of the Iliad, puts up his half-drawn sword in the sheath,\r\nand does not slay Agamemnon, Homer assigns his repentance to the\r\ndirect influence of Athene.  Again, he says in the Odyssey, about\r\nClytemnestra, that "she would none of the foul deed;" that is of the\r\nlove of Aegisthus, till "the doom of the Gods bound her to her ruin."\r\nSo far the same excuse is made for the murderous Clytemnestra as for\r\nthe amiable Helen.  Again, Homer is, in the strictest sense, and in\r\nstrong contrast to the Greek tragedians and to Virgil, a chivalrous\r\npoet.  It would probably be impossible to find a passage in which he\r\nspeaks harshly or censoriously of the conduct of any fair and noble\r\nlady.  The sordid treachery of Eriphyle, who sold her lord for gold,\r\nwins for her the epithet "hateful;" and Achilles, in a moment of\r\nstrong grief, applies a term of abhorrence to Helen.  But Homer is\r\ntoo chivalrous to judge the life of any lady, and only shows the\r\nother side of the chivalrous character--its cruelty to persons not of\r\nnoble birth--in describing the "foul death" of the waiting women of\r\nPenelope.  "God forbid that I should take these women\'s lives by a\r\nclean death," says Telemachus (Odyssey, xxii. 462).  So "about all\r\ntheir necks nooses were cast that they might die by the death most\r\npitiful.  And they writhed with their feet for a little space, but\r\nfor no long while."  In trying to understand Homer\'s estimate of\r\nHelen, therefore, we must make allowance for his theory of divine\r\nintervention, and for his chivalrous judgment of ladies.  But there\r\nare two passages in the Iliad which may be taken as indicating\r\nHomer\'s opinion that Helen was literally a victim, an unwilling\r\nvictim, of Aphrodite, and that she was carried away by force a\r\ncaptive from Lacedaemon.  These passages are in the Iliad, ii. 356,\r\n590.  In the former text Nestor says, "let none be eager to return\r\nhome ere he has couched with a Trojan\'s wife, and AVENGED THE\r\nLONGINGS AND SORROWS OF HELEN"--[Greek text which cannot be\r\nreproduced.]  It is thus that Mr. Gladstone, a notable champion of\r\nHelen\'s, would render this passage, and the same interpretation was\r\nfavoured by the ancient "Separatists" (Chorizontes), who wished to\r\nprove that the Iliad and Odyssey were by different authors; but many\r\nauthorities prefer to translate "to avenge our labours and sorrows\r\nfor Helen\'s sake"--"to avenge all that we have endured in the attempt\r\nto win back Helen."  Thus the evidence of this passage is ambiguous.\r\nThe fairer way to seek for Homer\'s real view of Helen is to examine\r\nall the passages in which she occurs.  The result will be something\r\nlike this:- Homer sees in Helen a being of the rarest personal charm\r\nand grace of character; a woman who imputes to herself guilt much\r\ngreater than the real measure of her offence.  She is ever gentle\r\nexcept with the Goddess who betrayed her, and the unworthy lover\r\nwhose lot she is compelled to share.  Against them her helpless anger\r\nbreaks out in flashes of eloquent scorn.  Homer was apparently\r\nacquainted with the myth of Helen\'s capture by Theseus, a myth\r\nillustrated in the decorations of the coffer of Cypselus.  But we\r\nfirst see Helen, the cause of the war, when Menelaus and Paris are\r\nabout to fight their duel for her sake, in the tenth year of the\r\nLeaguer (Iliad, iii. 121).  Iris is sent to summon Helen to the\r\nwalls.  She finds Helen in her chamber, weaving at a mighty loom, and\r\nembroidering on tapestry the adventures of the siege--the battles of\r\nhorse-taming Trojans and bronze-clad Achaeans.  The message of Iris\r\nrenews in Helen\'s heart "a sweet desire for her lord and her own\r\ncity, and them that begat her;" so, draped in silvery white, Helen\r\ngoes with her three maidens to the walls.  There, above the gate,\r\nlike some king in the Old Testament, Paris sits among his\r\ncounsellors, and they are all amazed at Helen\'s beauty; "no marvel is\r\nit that Trojans and Achaeans suffer long and weary toils for such a\r\nwoman, so wondrous like to the immortal goddesses."  Then Priam,\r\nassuring Helen that he holds her blameless, bids her name to him her\r\nkinsfolk and the other Achaean warriors.  In her reply, Helen\r\ndisplays that grace of penitence which is certainly not often found\r\nin ancient literature:- "Would that evil death had been my choice,\r\nwhen I followed thy son, and left my bridal bower and my kin, and my\r\ndaughter dear, and the maidens of like age with me."  Agamemnon she\r\ncalls, "the husband\'s brother of me shameless; alas, that such an one\r\nshould be."  She names many of the warriors, but misses her brothers\r\nCastor and Polydeuces, "own brothers of mine, one mother bare us.\r\nEither they followed not from pleasant Lacedaemon, or hither they\r\nfollowed in swift ships, but now they have no heart to go down into\r\nthe battle for dread of the shame and many reproaches that are mine."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"So spake she, but already the life-giving earth did cover them,\r\nthere in Lacedaemon, in their own dear country."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Menelaus and Paris fought out their duel, the Trojan was discomfited,\r\nbut was rescued from death and carried to Helen\'s bower by Aphrodite.\r\nThen the Goddess came in disguise to seek Helen on the wall, and\r\nforce her back into the arms of her defeated lover.  Helen turned on\r\nthe Goddess with an abruptness and a force of sarcasm and invective\r\nwhich seem quite foreign to her gentle nature.  "Wilt thou take me\r\nfurther yet to some city of Phrygia or pleasant Maeonia, if there any\r\nman is dear to thee . . . Nay, go thyself and sit down by Paris, and\r\nforswear the paths of the Gods, but ever lament for him and cherish\r\nhim, till he make thee his wife, yea, or perchance his slave, but to\r\nhim will I never go."  But this anger of Helen is soon overcome by\r\nfear, when the Goddess, in turn, waxes wrathful, and Helen is\r\nliterally driven by threats--"for the daughter of Zeus was afraid,"--\r\ninto the arms of Paris.  Yet even so she taunts her lover with his\r\ncowardice, a cowardice which she never really condones.  In the sixth\r\nbook of the Iliad she has been urging him to return to the war.  She\r\nthen expresses her penitence to Hector, "would that the fury of the\r\nwind had borne me afar to the mountains, or the wave of the roaring\r\nsea--ere ever these ill deeds were done!"  In this passage too, she\r\nprophesies that her fortunes will be [Greek text] famous in the\r\nsongs, good or evil, of men unborn.  In the last book of the Iliad we\r\nmeet Helen once more, as she laments over the dead body of Hector.\r\n"\'Never, in all the twenty years since I came hither, have I heard\r\nfrom thee one taunt or one evil word:  nay, but if any other rebuked\r\nme in the halls, any one of my husband\'s brothers, or of their\r\nsisters, or their wives, or the mother of my husband (but the king\r\nwas ever gentle to me as a father), then wouldst thou restrain them\r\nwith thy loving kindness and thy gentle speech.\'  So spake she;\r\nweeping."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In the Odyssey, Helen is once more in Lacedaemon, the honoured but\r\nstill penitent wife of Menelaus.

She was lawfully married,\r\nby "capture," to Paris.  Unfortunately for this theory there is\r\nabundant proof that, in the heroic age, wives were nominally BOUGHT\r\nfor so many cattle, or given as a reward for great services.  There\r\nis no sign of marriage by capture, and, again, marriage by capture is\r\na savage institution which applies to unmarried women, not to women\r\nalready wedded, as Helen was to Menelaus.  Perhaps the oldest\r\nevidence we have for opinion about the later relations of Helen and\r\nMenelaus, is derived from Pausanias\'s (174. AD.) description of the\r\nChest of Cypselus.  This ancient coffer, a work of the seventh\r\ncentury, B.C, was still preserved at Olympia, in the time of\r\nPausanias.  On one of the bands of cedar or of ivory, was represented\r\n(Pausanias, v. 18), "Menelaus with a sword in his hand, rushing on to\r\nkill Helen--clearly at the sacking of Ilios."  How Menelaus passed\r\nfrom a desire to kill Helen to his absolute complacency in the\r\nOdyssey, Homer does not tell us.  According to a statement attributed\r\nto Stesichorus (635, 554, B.C.?), the army of the Achaeans purposed\r\nto stone Helen, but was overawed and compelled to relent by her\r\nextraordinary beauty:  "when they beheld her, they cast down their\r\nstones on the ground."  It may be conjectured that the reconciliation\r\nfollowed this futile attempt at punishing a daughter of Zeus.  Homer,\r\nthen, leaves us without information about the adventures of Helen,\r\nbetween the sack of Tiny and the reconciliation with Menelaus.  He\r\nhints that she was married to Deiphobus, after the death of Paris,\r\nand alludes to the tradition that she mimicked the voices of the\r\nwives of the heroes, and so nearly tempted them to leave their ambush\r\nin the wooden horse.  But in the fourth book of the Odyssey, when\r\nTelemachus visits Lacedaemon, he finds Helen the honoured wife of\r\nMenelaus, rich in the marvellous gifts bestowed on her, in her\r\nwanderings from Troy, by the princes of Egypt.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"While yet he pondered these things in his mind and in his heart,\r\nHelen came forth from her fragrant vaulted chamber, like Artemis of\r\nthe golden arrows; and with her came Adraste and set for her the\r\nwell-wrought chair, and Alcippe bare a rug of soft wool, and Phylo\r\nbare a silver basket which Alcandre gave her, the wife of Polybus,\r\nwho dwelt in Thebes of Egypt, where is the chiefest store of wealth\r\nin the houses.  He gave two silver baths to Menelaus, and tripods\r\ntwain, and ten talents of gold.  And besides all this, his wife\r\nbestowed on Helen lovely gifts; a golden distaff did she give, and a\r\nsilver basket with wheels beneath, and the rims thereof were finished\r\nwith gold.  This it was that the handmaid Phylo bare and set beside\r\nher, filled with dressed yarn, and across it was laid a distaff\r\ncharged with wool of violet blue.

This version of the end of Helen\'s history we have\r\nadopted, but many other legends were known in Greece.  Pausanias\r\ntells us that, in a battle between the Crotoniats and the Locrians,\r\none Leonymus charged the empty space in the Locrian line, which was\r\nentrusted to the care of the ghost of Aias.  Leonymus was wounded by\r\nthe invisible spear of the hero, and could not be healed of the hurt.\r\nThe Delphian oracle bade him seek the Isle of Leuke in the Euxine\r\nSea, where Aias would appear to him, and heal him.  When Leonymus\r\nreturned from Leuke he told how Achilles dwelt there with his ancient\r\ncomrades, and how he was now wedded to Helen of Troy.  Yet the local\r\ntradition of Lacedaemon showed the sepulchre of Helen in Therapnae.\r\nAccording to a Rhodian legend (adopted by the author of the "Epic of\r\nHades"), Helen was banished from Sparta by the sons of Menelaus, came\r\nwandering to Rhodes, and was there strangled by the servants of the\r\nqueen Polyxo, who thus avenged the death of her husband at Troy.  It\r\nis certain, as we learn both from Herodotus (vi. 61) and from\r\nIsocrates, that Helen was worshipped in Therapnae.  In the days of\r\nAriston the king, a deformed child was daily brought by her nurse to\r\nthe shrine of Helen.  And it is said that, as the nurse was leaving\r\nthe shrine, a woman appeared unto her, and asked what she bore in her\r\narms, who said, "she bore a child."  Then the woman said, "show it to\r\nme," which the nurse refused, for the parents of the child had\r\nforbidden that she should be seen of any.  But the woman straitly\r\ncommanding that the child should be shown, and the other beholding\r\nher eagerness, at length the nurse showed the child, and the woman\r\ncaressed its face and said, "she shall be the fairest woman in\r\nSparta."

She\r\nremained in Egypt, and Achaeans and Trojans fought for a mere shadow,\r\nformed by the Gods out of clouds and wind.  In the "Cyclops" of\r\nEuripides, a satirical drama, the cynical giant is allowed to speak\r\nof Helen in a strain of coarse banter.  Perhaps the essay of\r\nIsocrates on Helen may be regarded as a kind of answer to the attacks\r\nof several speakers in the works of the tragedians.  Isocrates\r\ndefends Helen simply on the plea of her beauty:  "To Heracles Zeus\r\ngave strength, to Helen beauty, which naturally rules over even\r\nstrength itself."  Beauty, he declares, the Gods themselves consider\r\nthe noblest thing in the world, as the Goddesses showed when they\r\ncontended for the prize of loveliness.  And so marvellous, says\r\nIsocrates, was the beauty of Helen, that for her glory Zeus did not\r\nspare his beloved son, Sarpedon; and Thetis saw Achilles die, and the\r\nDawn bewailed her Memnon.  "Beauty has raised more mortals to\r\nimmortality than all the other virtues together."
