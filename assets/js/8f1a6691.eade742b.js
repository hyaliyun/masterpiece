His son, whether perforce or from choice,\r\nremoved to London when he was a youth, and speedily obtained\r\na clerkship in the Bank of England, where he remained for fifty years,\r\ntill he was pensioned off in 1821 with over 400 Pounds a year.\r\nHe died in 1833.  His wife, to whom he was married in or about 1780,\r\nwas one Margaret Morris Tittle, a Creole, born in the West Indies.\r\nHer portrait, by Wright of Derby, used to hang in the poet's dining-room.\r\nThey resided, Mr. R. Barrett Browning tells me, in Battersea,\r\nwhere his grandfather was their first-born.  The paternal grandfather\r\nof the poet decided that his three sons, Robert, William Shergold, and Reuben,\r\nshould go into business, the two younger in London, the elder abroad.\r\nAll three became efficient financial clerks, and attained to good positions\r\nand fair means.*  The eldest, Robert, was a man of exceptional powers.\r\nHe was a poet, both in sentiment and expression; and he understood,\r\nas well as enjoyed, the excellent in art.  He was a scholar, too,\r\nin a reputable fashion:  not indifferent to what he had learnt in his youth,\r\nnor heedless of the high opinion generally entertained for the greatest\r\nwriters of antiquity, but with a particular care himself for Horace\r\nand Anacreon.  As his son once told a friend, \"The old gentleman's brain\r\nwas a storehouse of literary and philosophical antiquities.\r\nHe was completely versed in mediaeval legend, and seemed to have known\r\nParacelsus, Faustus, and even Talmudic personages, personally\" --\r\na significant detail, by the way.  He was fond of metrical composition,\r\nand his ease and grace in the use of the heroic couplet were the admiration,\r\nnot only of his intellectual associates, but, in later days, of his son,\r\nwho was wont to affirm, certainly in all seriousness,\r\nthat expressionally his father was a finer poetic artist than himself.\r\nSome one has recorded of him that he was an authority\r\non the Letters of Junius:  fortunately he had more tangible claims than this\r\nto the esteem of his fellows.  It was his boast that,\r\nnotwithstanding the exigencies of his vocation, he knew as much\r\nof the history of art as any professional critic.  His extreme modesty\r\nis deducible from this naive remark.  He was an amateur artist, moreover,\r\nas well as poet, critic, and student.  I have seen several of his drawings\r\nwhich are praiseworthy:  his studies in portraiture, particularly,\r\nare ably touched:  and, as is well known, he had an active faculty\r\nof pictorial caricature.  In the intervals of leisure\r\nwhich beset the best regulated clerk he was addicted\r\nto making drawings of the habitual visitors to the Bank of England,\r\nin which he had obtained a post on his return, in 1803, from the West Indies,\r\nand in the enjoyment of which he remained till 1853,\r\nwhen he retired on a small pension.  His son had an independent income,\r\nbut whether from a bequest, or in the form of an allowance from his\r\nthen unmarried Uncle Reuben, is uncertain.  In the first year of his marriage\r\nMr. Browning resided in an old house in Southampton Street, Peckham,\r\nand there the poet was born.  The house was long ago pulled down,\r\nand another built on its site.  Mr. Browning afterwards removed\r\nto another domicile in the same Peckham district.  Many years later,\r\nhe and his family left Camberwell and resided at Hatcham, near New Cross,\r\nwhere his brothers and sisters (by his father's second marriage) lived.\r\nThere was a stable attached to the Hatcham house, and in it\r\nMr. Reuben Browning kept his horse, which he let his poet-nephew ride,\r\nwhile he himself was at his desk in Rothschild's bank.\r\nNo doubt this horse was the `York' alluded to by the poet\r\nin the letter quoted, as a footnote, at page 189 [Chapter 9] of this book.\r\nSome years after his wife's death, which occurred in 1849,\r\nMr. Browning left Hatcham and came to Paddington, but finally went to reside\r\nin Paris, and lived there, in a small street off the Champs Elysees,\r\ntill his death in 1866.  The Creole strain seems to have been\r\ndistinctly noticeable in Mr. Browning, so much so that it is possible\r\nit had something to do with his unwillingness to remain at St. Kitts,\r\nwhere he was certainly on one occasion treated cavalierly enough.\r\nThe poet's complexion in youth, light and ivory-toned as it was in later life,\r\nhas been described as olive, and it is said that one of his nephews,\r\nwho met him in Paris in his early manhood, took him for an Italian.\r\nIt has been affirmed that it was the emotional Creole strain in Browning\r\nwhich found expression in his passion for music.**"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"--"}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.li,{children:'The three brothers were men of liberal education and literary tastes.\r\nMr. W.

As a sympathetic critic has remarked,\r\n"His stage is not the visible phenomenal England (or elsewhere) of history;\r\nit is a point in the spiritual universe, where naked souls meet and wrestle,\r\nas they play the great game of life, for counters, the true value of which\r\ncan only be realised in the bullion of a higher life than this."\r\nNo doubt there is "a certain crudeness in the manner in which\r\nthese naked souls are presented," not only in "Strafford" but elsewhere\r\nin the plays.

Of these plays, "The Return of the Druses" seems to me the most picturesque, "Luria" the most noble and dignified, and "In a Balcony" the most potentially a great dramatic success.

But I do not for a moment believe\r\nthat his greatness is in his status as a thinker:  even less,\r\nthat the poet and the thinker are indissociable.  Many years ago\r\nSainte-Beuve destroyed this shallow artifice of pseudo-criticism:\r\n"Venir nous dire que tout poe"te de talent est, par essence,\r\nun grand PENSEUR, et que tout vrai PENSEUR est ne/cessairement\r\nartiste et poe"te, c\'est une pre/tention insoutenable et que de/ment\r\na\\ chaque instant la re/alite/."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['When Browning\'s enormous influence upon the spiritual and mental life\r\nof our day -- an influence ever shaping itself to wise and beautiful issues --\r\nshall have lost much of its immediate import, there will still surely be\r\ndiscerned in his work a formative energy whose resultant is pure poetic gain.\r\nIt is as the poet he will live:  not merely as the "novel thinker in verse".\r\nLogically, his attitude as ',(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"thinker' is unimpressive.  It is the attitude, as I think some one has pointed out, of acquiescence with codified morality. In one of his "}),'Causeries\', the keen French critic quoted above\r\nhas a remark upon the great Bossuet, which may with singular aptness\r\nbe repeated of Browning: --  "His is the Hebrew genius extended,\r\nfecundated by Christianity, and open to all the acquisitions\r\nof the understanding, but retaining some degree of sovereign interdiction,\r\nand closing its vast horizon precisely where its light ceases."\r\nBrowning cannot, or will not, face the problem of the future\r\nexcept from the basis of assured continuity of individual existence.\r\nHe is so much in love with life, for life\'s sake, that he cannot even credit\r\nthe possibility of incontinuity; his assurance of eternity in another world\r\nis at least in part due to his despair at not being eternal in this.\r\nHe is so sure, that the intellectually scrupulous detect\r\nthe odours of hypotheses amid the sweet savour of indestructible assurance.\r\nSchopenhauer says, in one of those recently-found Annotations of his\r\nwhich are so characteristic and so acute, "that which is called\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"mathematical certainty' is the cane of a blind man without a dog, or equilibrium in darkness.\"  Browning would sometimes have us accept the evidence of his "}),"cane' as all-sufficient.  He does not entrench himself\r\namong conventions:  for he already finds himself within the fortified lines\r\nof convention, and remains there.  Thus is true what Mr. Mortimer says\r\nin a recent admirable critique -- \"His position in regard\r\nto the thought of the age is paradoxical, if not inconsistent.\r\nHe is in advance of it in every respect but one, the most important of all,\r\nthe matter of fundamental principles; in these he is behind it.\r\nHis processes of thought are often scientific in their precision of analysis;\r\nthe sudden conclusion which he imposes upon them is transcendental and inept.\"\r\nBrowning's conclusions, which harmonise so well with\r\nour haphazard previsionings, are sometimes so disastrously facile\r\nthat they exercise an insurrectionary influence.  They occasionally suggest\r\nthat wisdom of Gotham which is ever ready to postulate\r\nthe certainty of a fulfilment because of the existence of a desire.\r\nIt is this that vitiates so much of his poetic reasoning.\r\nTruth may ring regnant in the lines of Abt Vogler --"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:'"And what is our failure here but a triumph\'s evidence\r\nFor the fulness of the days?" --\n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"but, unfortunately, the conclusion is, in itself, illogical."}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["We are all familiar with, and in this book I have dwelt more than once upon,\r\nBrowning's habitual attitude towards Death.

It is of good hap, of welcome significance:  none the less there is an aspect of our mortality of which the poet's evasion is uncompromising and absolute.

It is part of the insistent and perverse ingenuity which we display in masking with illusion the more disturbing elements of life.  Veil after veil is torn down, but seldom before another has been slipped behind it, until we acquiesce without a murmur in the concealment that we ourselves have made.  Two facts thus carefully shrouded from full vision by elaborate illusion conspicuously round in our lives -- the life-giving and life-destroying elements, Sex and Death. We are compelled to occasional physiologic and economic discussion of the one, but we shrink from recognising the full extent to which it bases the whole social fabric, carefully concealing its insurrections, and ignoring or misreading their lessons.  The other, in certain aspects, we are compelled to face, but to do it we tipple on illusions, from our cradle upwards, in dread of the coming grave, purchasing a drug for our poltroonery at the expense of our sanity. We uphold our wayward steps with the promises and the commandments for crutches, but on either side of us trudge the shadow Death and the bacchanal Sex, and we mumble prayers against the one, while we scourge ourselves for leering at the other. On one only of these can Browning be said to have spoken with novel force -- the relations of sex, which he has treated with a subtlety and freedom, and often with a beauty, unapproached since Goethe.  On the problem of Death, except in masquerade of robes and wings, his eupeptic temperament never allowed him to dwell.  He sentimentalised where Shakespeare thought.\" Browning's whole attitude to the Hereafter is different from that of Tennyson only in that the latter "}),'faintly\', while he strenuously,\r\n"trusts the larger hope."

These inexcusable violations are like the larvae within certain vegetable growths:  soon or late they will destroy their environment before they perish themselves. Though possessive above all others of that science of the percipient in the allied arts of painting and music, wherein he found the unconventional Shelley so missuaded by convention, he seemed ever more alert to the substance than to the manner of poetry. In a letter of Mrs. Browning\'s she alludes to a friend\'s "melodious feeling" for poetry.  Possibly the phrase was accidental, but it is significant. To inhale the vital air of poetry we must love it, not merely find it "interesting", "suggestive", "soothing", "stimulative":  in a word, we must have a "melodious feeling" for poetry before we can deeply enjoy it. Browning, who has so often educed from his lyre melodies and harmonies of transcendent, though novel, beauty, was too frequently, during composition, without this melodious feeling of which his wife speaks. The distinction between literary types such as Browning or Balzac on the one hand, and Keats or Gustave Flaubert on the other, is that with the former there exists a reverence for the vocation and a relative indifference to the means, in themselves -- and, with the latter, a scrupulous respect for the mere means as well as for that to which they conduce.  The poet who does not love words for themselves, as an artist loves any chance colour upon his palette, or as the musician any vagrant tone evoked by a sudden touch in idleness or reverie, has not entered into the full inheritance of the sons of Apollo.  The writer cannot aim at beauty, that which makes literature and art, without this heed -- without, rather, this creative anxiety:  for it is certainly not enough, as some one has said, that language should be used merely for the transportation of intelligence, as a wheelbarrow carries brick. Of course, Browning is not persistently neglectful of this fundamental necessity for the literary artist.  He is often as masterly in this as in other respects.  But he is not always, not often enough, alive to the paramount need.  He writes with "the verse being as the mood it paints:"  but, unfortunately, the mood is often poetically unformative.  He had no passion for the quest for seductive forms.  Too much of his poetry has been born prematurely.  Too much of it, indeed, has not died and been born again -- for all immortal verse is a poetic resurrection. Perfect poetry is the deathless part of mortal beauty. The great artists never perpetuate gross actualities, though they are the supreme realists.  It is Schiller, I think, who says in effect, that to live again in the serene beauty of art, it is needful that things should first die in reality. Thus Browning\'s dramatic method, even, is sometimes disastrous in its untruth, as in Caliban\'s analytical reasoning -- an initial absurdity, as Mr. Berdoe has pointed out, adding epigrammatically, '}),"Caliban is a savage, with the introspective powers of a Hamlet,\r\nand the theology of an evangelical Churchman.'
