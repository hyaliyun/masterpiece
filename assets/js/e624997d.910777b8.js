He was young at that time-indeed, he is young still, although he is ten years older than hewas then. On his return, he went to visit one of the little towns inthe island of Zealand. The whole town knew who the stranger was; andone of the richest men in the place gave a party in his honor, and allwho were of any consequence, or who possessed some property, wereinvited. It was quite an event, and all the town knew of it, so thatit was not necessary to announce it by beat of drum.Apprentice-boys, children of the poor, and even the poor peoplethemselves, stood before the house, watching the lighted windows;and the watchman might easily fancy he was giving a party also,there were so many people in the streets. There was quite an air offestivity about it, and the house was full of it; for Mr. Alfred,the sculptor, was there. He talked and told anecdotes, and every onelistened to him with pleasure, not unmingled with awe; but none feltso much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a naval officer.She seemed, so far as Mr. Alfred was concerned, to be like a pieceof fresh blotting-paper that absorbed all he said and asked formore. She was very appreciative, and incredibly ignorant- a kind offemale Gaspar Hauser.    \\"I should like to see Rome,\\" she said; \\"it must be a lovelycity, or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving there.Now, do give me a description of Rome. How does the city look when youenter in at the gate?\\"    \\"I cannot very well describe it,\\" said the sculptor; \\"but youenter on a large open space, in the centre of which stands an obelisk,which is a thousand years old.\\"    \\"An organist!\\" exclaimed the lady, who had never heard the word\'obelisk.\' Several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing,and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping hiscountenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sightof a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady.They belonged to her daughter; and surely no one who had such adaughter could be silly. The mother was like a fountain ofquestions; and the daughter, who listened but never spoke, mighthave passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain. How charming shewas! She was a study for the sculptor to contemplate, but not toconverse with; for she did not speak, or, at least, very seldom.    \\"Has the pope a great family?\\" inquired the lady.    The young man answered considerately, as if the question hadbeen a different one, \\"No; he does not come from a great family.\\"    \\"That is not what I asked,\\" persisted the widow; \\"I mean, has he awife and children?\\"    \\"The pope is not allowed to marry,\\" replied the gentleman.    \\"I don\'t like that,\\" was the lady\'s remark.    She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if shehad not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughterhave been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and lookingstraight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on herface?    Mr. Alfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious colors inItalian scenery; the purple hills, the deep blue of the Mediterranean,the azure of southern skies, whose brightness and glory could onlybe surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of a maiden; and hesaid this with a peculiar intonation; but she who should haveunderstood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it, which alsowas charming.    \\"Beautiful Italy!\\" sighed some of the guests.    \\"Oh, to travel there!\\" exclaimed others.    \\"Charming! Charming!\\" echoed from every voice.    \\"I may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery,\\"said the naval officer\'s widow; \\"and if I do, we will travel- I and mydaughter; and you, Mr. Alfred, must be our guide. We can all threetravel together, with one or two more of our good friends.\\" And shenodded in such a friendly way at the company, that each imaginedhimself to be the favored person who was to accompany them to Italy.\\"Yes, we must go,\\" she continued; \\"but not to those parts wherethere are robbers. We will keep to Rome. In the public roads one isalways safe.\\"    The daughter sighed very gently; and how much there may be in asigh, or attributed to it! The young man attributed a great deal ofmeaning to this sigh. Those deep-blue eyes, which had been lit up thisevening in honor of him, must conceal treasures, treasures of heartand mind, richer than all the glories of Rome; and so when he left theparty that night, he had lost it completely to the young lady. Thehouse of the naval officer\'s widow was the one most constantly visitedby Mr. Alfred, the sculptor. It was soon understood that his visitswere not intended for that lady, though they were the persons who keptup the conversation. He came for the sake of the daughter. They calledher Kaela. Her name was really Karen Malena, and these two names hadbeen contracted into the one name Kaela. She was really beautiful; butsome said she was rather dull, and slept late of a morning.    \\"She has been accustomed to that,\\" her mother said. \\"She is abeauty, and they are always easily tired. She does sleep ratherlate; but that makes her eyes so clear.\\"    What power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes! Theyoung man felt the truth of the proverb, \\"Still waters run deep-    \\"It is difficult to follow you; but I go hobbling along afteryou with my thoughts, though what you say makes my head whirl roundand round. Still I contrive to lay hold on some of it.\\"    Kaela\'s beauty had a firm hold on Alfred; it filled his soul,and held a mastery over him. Beauty beamed from Kaela\'s every feature,glittered in her eyes, lurked in the corners of her mouth, andpervaded every movement of her agile fingers. Alfred, the sculptor,saw this. He spoke only to her, thought only of her, and the twobecame one; and so it may be said she spoke much, for he was alwaystalking to her; and he and she were one. Such was the betrothal, andthen came the wedding, with bride\'s-maids and wedding presents, allduly mentioned in the wedding speech. Mamma-in-law had set upThorwalsden\'s bust at the end of the table, attired in adressing-gown; it was her fancy that he should be a guest. Songswere sung, and cheers given; for it was a gay wedding, and they were ahandsome pair. \\"Pygmalion loved his Galatea,\\" said one of the songs.    \\"Ah, that is some of your mythologies,\\" said mamma-in-law.    Next day the youthful pair started for Copenhagen, where they wereto live; mamma-in-law accompanied them, to attend to the \\"coarsework,\\" as she always called the domestic arrangements. Kaela lookedlike a doll in a doll\'s house, for everything was bright and new,and so fine. There they sat, all three; and as for Alfred, a proverbmay describe his position- he looked like a swan amongst the geese.The magic of form had enchanted him; he had looked at the casketwithout caring to inquire what it contained, and that omission oftenbrings the greatest unhappiness into married life. The casket may beinjured, the gilding may fall off, and then the purchaser regretshis bargain.    In a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button givingway, with no studs at hand to fall back upon; but it is worse still ina large company to be conscious that your wife and mother-in-law aretalking nonsense, and that you cannot depend upon yourself toproduce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the wholeaffair.    The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he wouldtalk, but she could only now and then let fall a word in the samemelodious voice, the same bell-like tones. It was a mental relief whenSophy, one of her friends, came to pay them a visit. Sophy was not,pretty. She was, however, quite free from any physical deformity,although Kaela used to say she was a little crooked; but no eye,save an intimate acquaintance, would have noticed it. She was a verysensible girl, yet it never occurred to her that she might be adangerous person in such a house. Her appearance created a newatmosphere in the doll\'s house, and air was really required, theyall owned that. They felt the want of a change of air, andconsequently the young couple and their mother travelled to Italy.    \\"Thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls,\\"said mamma-in-law and daughter both, on their return after a year\'sabsence.    \\"There is no real pleasure in travelling,\\" said mamma; \\"to tellthe truth, it\'s very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so. I was soonvery tired of it, although I had my children with me; and, besides,it\'s very expensive work travelling, very expensive. And all thosegalleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of things you areobliged to run after! It must be done, for very shame; you are sure tobe asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will mostlikely be told that you\'ve omitted to see what was best worth seeingof all. I got tired at last of those endless Madonnas; I began tothink I was turning into a Madonna myself.\\"    \\"And then the living, mamma,\\" said Kaela.    \\"Yes, indeed,\\" she replied, \\"no such a thing as a respectable meatsoup- their cookery is miserable stuff.\\"    The journey had also tired Kaela; but she was always fatigued,that was the worst of it. So they sent for Sophy, and she was takeninto the house to reside with them, and her presence there was a greatadvantage. Mamma-in-law acknowledged that Sophy was not only aclever housewife, but well-informed and accomplished, though thatcould hardly be expected in a person of her limited means. She wasalso a generous-hearted, faithful girl; she showed that thoroughlywhile Kaela lay sick, fading away. When the casket is everything,the casket should be strong, or else all is over. And all was overwith the casket, for Kaela died.    \\"She was beautiful,\\" said her mother; \\"she was quite differentfrom the beauties they call \'antiques,\' for they are so damaged. Abeauty ought to be perfect, and Kaela was a perfect beauty.\\"    Alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning. Theblack dress suited mamma very well, and she wore mourning the longest.She had also to experience another grief in seeing Alfred marry again,marry Sophy, who was nothing at all to look at. \\"He\'s gone to the veryextreme,\\" said mamma-in-law; \\"he has gone from the most beautiful tothe ugliest, and he has forgotten his first wife. Men have noconstancy. My husband was a very different man,- but then he diedbefore me.\\"    \\"\'Pygmalion loved his Galatea,\' was in the song they sung at myfirst wedding,\\" said Alfred; \\"I once fell in love with a beautifulstatue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred soul, which isa gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and sympathize with andelevate us, I have not found and won till now. You came, Sophy, not inthe glory of outward beauty, though you are even fairer than isnecessary. The chief thing still remains. You came to teach thesculptor that his work is but dust and clay only, an outward form madeof a material that decays, and that what we should seek to obtain isthe ethereal essence of mind and spirit. Poor Kaela! our life wasbut as a meeting by the way-side; in yonder world, where we shall knoweach other from a union of mind, we shall be but mere acquaintances.\\"    \\"That was not a loving speech,\\" said Sophy, \\"nor spoken like aChristian. In a future state, where there is neither marrying norgiving in marriage, but where, as you say, souls are attracted to eachother by sympathy; there everything beautiful develops itself, andis raised to a higher state of existence: her soul will acquire suchcompleteness that it may harmonize with yours, even more than mine,and you will then once more utter your first rapturous exclamationof your love, \'Beautiful, most beautiful!\'\\"                            THE END.","source":"@site/learn/BEAUTY OF FORM AND BEAUTY OF MIND.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/BEAUTY OF FORM AND BEAUTY OF MIND","permalink":"/learn/BEAUTY OF FORM AND BEAUTY OF MIND","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/BEAUTY OF FORM AND BEAUTY OF MIND.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Awakening To Let","permalink":"/learn/Awakening To Let"},"next":{"title":"BENITO CERENO","permalink":"/learn/BENITO CERENO"}}');var n=t(74848),h=t(28453);const s={},i=void 0,r={},l=[];function d(e){const a={code:"code",pre:"pre",...(0,h.R)(),...e.components};return(0,n.jsx)(a.pre,{children:(0,n.jsx)(a.code,{children:'                                  1872                     FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                       BEAUTY OF FORM AND BEAUTY OF MIND                           by Hans Christian Andersen    THERE was once a sculptor, named Alfred, who having won thelarge gold medal and obtained a travelling scholarship, went to Italy,and then came back to his native land.

"She has been accustomed to that," her mother said. "She is abeauty, and they are always easily tired. She does sleep ratherlate; but that makes her eyes so clear."    What power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes! Theyoung man felt the truth of the proverb, "Still waters run deep:"and his heart had sunk into their depths. He often talked of hisadventures, and the mamma was as simple and eager in her questionsas on the first evening they met. It was a pleasure to hear Alfreddescribe anything. He showed them colored plates of Naples, andspoke of excursions to Mount Vesuvius, and the eruptions of firefrom it. The naval officer\'s widow had never heard of them before.    "Good heavens!" she exclaimed. "So that is a burning mountain; butis it not very dangerous to the people who live near it?"    "Whole cities have been destroyed," he replied; "for instance,Herculaneum and Pompeii."    "Oh, the poor people! And you saw all that with your own eyes?"    "No; I did not see any of the eruptions which are represented inthose pictures; but I will show you a sketch of my own, whichrepresents an eruption I once saw."    He placed a pencil sketch on the table; and mamma, who had beenover-powered with the appearance of the colored plates, threw a glanceat the pale drawing and cried in astonishment, "What, did you see itthrow up white fire?"    For a moment, Alfred\'s respect for Kaela\'s mamma underwent asudden shock, and lessened considerably; but, dazzled by the lightwhich surrounded Kaela, he soon found it quite natural that the oldlady should have no eye for color. After all, it was of very littleconsequence; for Kaela\'s mamma had the best of all possessions;namely, Kaela herself.    Alfred and Kaela were betrothed, which was a very naturalresult; and the betrothal was announced in the newspaper of the littletown. Mama purchased thirty copies of the paper, that she might cutout the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances. Thebetrothed pair were very happy, and the mother was happy too. She saidit seemed like connecting herself with Thorwalsden.    "You are a true successor of Thorwalsden," she said to Alfred; andit seemed to him as if, in this instance, mamma had said a cleverthing. Kaela was silent; but her eyes shone, her lips smiled, everymovement was graceful,- in fact, she was beautiful; that cannot berepeated too often. Alfred decided to take a bust of Kaela as wellas of her mother. They sat to him accordingly, and saw how hemoulded and formed the soft clay with his fingers.    "I suppose it is only on our account that you perform thiscommon-place work yourself, instead of leaving it to your servant todo all that sticking together."    "It is really necessary that I should mould the clay myself," hereplied.    "Ah, yes, you are always so polite," said mamma, with a smile; andKaela silently pressed his hand, all soiled as it was with the clay.    Then he unfolded to them both the beauties of Nature, in all herworks; he pointed out to them how, in the scale of creation, inanimatematter was inferior to animate nature; the plant above the mineral,the animal above the plant, and man above them all. He strove toshow them how the beauty of the mind could be displayed in the outwardform, and that it was the sculptor\'s task to seize upon that beauty ofexpression, and produce it in his works. Kaela stood silent, butnodded in approbation of what he said, while mamma-in-law made thefollowing confession:-    "It is difficult to follow you; but I go hobbling along afteryou with my thoughts, though what you say makes my head whirl roundand round. Still I contrive to lay hold on some of it."    Kaela\'s beauty had a firm hold on Alfred; it filled his soul,and held a mastery over him. Beauty beamed from Kaela\'s every feature,glittered in her eyes, lurked in the corners of her mouth, andpervaded every movement of her agile fingers. Alfred, the sculptor,saw this.
