When he was yet a lad,--now some seventeen years ago,--fortune\r\ntook him to South Africa. There he was thrown in with men who, for\r\nthirty or forty years, had been intimately acquainted with the Zulu\r\npeople, with their history, their heroes, and their customs. From\r\nthese he heard many tales and traditions, some of which, perhaps, are\r\nrarely told nowadays, and in time to come may cease to be told\r\naltogether. Then the Zulus were still a nation; now that nation has\r\nbeen destroyed, and the chief aim of its white rulers is to root out\r\nthe warlike spirit for which it was remarkable, and to replace it by a\r\nspirit of peaceful progress. The Zulu military organisation, perhaps\r\nthe most wonderful that the world has seen, is already a thing of the\r\npast; it perished at Ulundi. It was Chaka who invented that\r\norganisation, building it up from the smallest beginnings. When he\r\nappeared at the commencement of this century, it was as the ruler of a\r\nsingle small tribe; when he fell, in the year 1828, beneath the\r\nassegais of his brothers, Umhlangana and Dingaan, and of his servant,\r\nMopo or Umbopo, as he is called also, all south-eastern Africa was at\r\nhis feet, and in his march to power he had slaughtered more than a\r\nmillion human beings. An attempt has been made in these pages to set\r\nout the true character of this colossal genius and most evil man,--a\r\nNapoleon and a Tiberiius in one,--and also that of his brother and\r\nsuccessor, Dingaan, so no more need be said of them here. The author\'s\r\naim, moreover, has been to convey, in a narrative form, some idea of\r\nthe remarkable spirit which animated these kings and their subjects,\r\nand to make accessible, in a popular shape, incidents of history which\r\nare now, for the most part, only to be found in a few scarce works of\r\nreference, rarely consulted, except by students. It will be obvious\r\nthat such a task has presented difficulties, since he who undertakes\r\nit must for a time forget his civilisation, and think with the mind\r\nand speak with the voice of a Zulu of the old regime. All the horrors\r\nperpetrated by the Zulu tyrants cannot be published in this polite age\r\nof melanite and torpedoes; their details have, therefore, been\r\nsuppressed. Still much remains, and those who think it wrong that\r\nmassacre and fighting should be written of,--except by special\r\ncorrespondents,--or that the sufferings of mankind beneath one of the\r\nworld\'s most cruel tyrannies should form the groundwork of romance,\r\nmay be invited to leave this book unread. Most, indeed nearly all, of\r\nthe historical incidents here recorded are substantially true. Thus,\r\nit is said that Chaka did actually kill his mother, Unandi, for the\r\nreason given, and destroy an entire tribe in the Tatiyana cleft, and\r\nthat he prophesied of the coming of the white man after receiving his\r\ndeath wounds. Of the incident of the Missionary and the furnace of\r\nlogs, it is impossible to speak so certainly. It came to the writer\r\nfrom the lips of an old traveller in "the Zulu"; but he cannot\r\ndiscover any confirmation of it. Still, these kings undoubtedly put\r\ntheir soldiers to many tests of equal severity. Umbopo, or Mopo, as he\r\nis named in this tale, actually lived. After he had stabbed Chaka, he\r\nrose to great eminence. Then he disappears from the scene, but it is\r\nnot accurately known whether he also went "the way of the assegai," or\r\nperhaps, as is here suggested, came to live near Stanger under the\r\nname of Zweete. The fate of the two lovers at the mouth of the cave is\r\na true Zulu tale, which has been considerably varied to suit the\r\npurposes of this romance. The late Mr. Leslie, who died in 1874, tells\r\nit in his book "Among the Zulus and Amatongas." "I heard a story the\r\nother day," he says, "which, if the power of writing fiction were\r\npossessed by me, I might have worked up into a first-class sensational\r\nnovel." It is the story that has been woven into the plot of this\r\nbook. To him also the writer is indebted for the artifice by which\r\nUmslopogaas obtained admission to the Swazi stronghold; it was told to\r\nMr. Leslie by the Zulu who performed the feat and thereby won a wife.\r\nAlso the writer\'s thanks are due to his friends, Mr. F. B. Fynney,[1]\r\nlate Zulu border agent, for much information given to him in bygone\r\nyears by word of mouth, and more recently through his pamphlet\r\n"Zululand and the Zulus," and to Mr. John Bird, formerly treasurer to\r\nthe Government of Natal, whose compilation, "The Annals of Natal," is\r\ninvaluable to all who would study the early history of that colony and\r\nof Zululand.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'As for the wilder and more romantic incidents of this story, such as\r\nthe hunting of Umslopogaas and Galazi with the wolves, or rather with\r\nthe hyaenas,--for there are no true wolves in Zululand,--the author\r\ncan only say that they seem to him of a sort that might well have been\r\nmythically connected with the names of those heroes. Similar beliefs\r\nand traditions are common in the records of primitive peoples. The\r\nclub "Watcher of the Fords," or, to give its Zulu name, U-nothlola-\r\nmazibuko, is an historical weapon, chronicled by Bishop Callaway. It\r\nwas once owned by a certain Undhlebekazizwa. He was an arbitrary\r\nperson, for "no matter what was discussed in our village, he would\r\nbring it to a conclusion with a stick." But he made a good end; for\r\nwhen the Zulu soldiers attacked him, he killed no less than twenty of\r\nthem with the Watcher, and the spears stuck in him "as thick as reeds\r\nin a morass." This man\'s strength was so great that he could kill a\r\nleopard "like a fly," with his hands only, much as Umslopogaas slew\r\nthe traitor in this story.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Perhaps it may be allowable to add a few words about the Zulu\r\nmysticism, magic, and superstition, to which there is some allusion in\r\nthis romance. It has been little if at all exaggerated. Thus the\r\nwriter well remembers hearing a legend how the Guardian Spirit of the\r\nAma-Zulu was seen riding down the storm. Here is what Mr. Fynney says\r\nof her in the pamphlet to which reference has been made: "The natives\r\nhave a spirit which they call Nomkubulwana, or the Inkosazana-ye-Zulu\r\n(the Princess of Heaven). She is said to be robed in white, and to\r\ntake the form of a young maiden, in fact an angel. She is said to\r\nappear to some chosen person, to whom she imparts some revelation;\r\nbut, whatever that revelation may be, it is kept a profound secret\r\nfrom outsiders. I remember that, just before the Zulu war,\r\nNomkubulwana appeared, revealing something or other which had a great\r\neffect throughout the land, and I know that the Zulus were quite\r\nimpressed that some calamity was about to befall them. One of the\r\nominous signs was that fire is said to have descended from heaven, and\r\nignited the grass over the graves of the former kings of Zululand.\r\n. . . On another occasion Nomkubulwana appeared to some one in\r\nZululand, the result of that visit being, that the native women buried\r\ntheir young children up to their heads in sand, deserting them for the\r\ntime being, going away weeping, but returning at nightfall to unearth\r\nthe little ones again."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"For this divine personage there is, therefore, authority, and the same\r\nmay be said of most of the supernatural matters spoken of in these\r\npages. The exact spiritual position held in the Zulu mind by the\r\nUmkulunkulu,--the Old--Old,--the Great--Great,--the Lord of Heavens,--\r\nis a more vexed question, and for its proper consideration the reader\r\nmust be referred to Bishop Callaway's work, the \"Religious System of\r\nthe Amazulu.\" Briefly, Umkulunkulu's character seems to vary from the\r\nidea of an ancestral spirit, or the spirit of an ancestor, to that of\r\na god. In the case of an able and highly intelligent person like the\r\nMopo of this story, the ideal would probably not be a low one;\r\ntherefore he is made to speak of Umkulunkulu as the Great Spirit, or\r\nGod."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It only remains to the writer to express his regret that this story is\r\nnot more varied in its hue.

The weather was cold and\r\nthere was little or no grass for the oxen, which made the journey\r\ndifficult; but he had been tempted to it by the high rates of\r\ntransport that prevailed at that season of the year, which would\r\nremunerate him for any probable loss he might suffer in cattle. So he\r\npushed along on his journey, and all went well until he had passed the\r\nlittle town of Stanger, once the site of Duguza, the kraal of Chaka,\r\nthe first Zulu king and the uncle of Cetywayo.

They said that I should bring ill-luck on\r\nthe tribe by having killed so great a witch-doctor as Noma; also that\r\nthe people of the headman would demand payment for the assault on him.\r\nI learned, moreover, that my father had ordered out all the men of the\r\ntribe to hunt for me on the morrow and to kill me wherever they found\r\nme.

Presently she was in, and,\r\nsquatting by the side of the corpse in such a fashion that I could not\r\nget to the door, she began to make lamentations and to cal down curses\r\non me. Ah! she did not know that I was listening. I too squatted by\r\nNoma's head, and grew quick-witted in my fear. Now that the woman was\r\nthere I was not so much afraid of the dead man, and I remembered, too,\r\nthat he had been a great cheat; so I thought I would make him cheat\r\nfor the last time.

The words of that song came to me then, my father; but\r\nafterwards they passed from me, and I remember them no more. Only I\r\nknow this, that the song was of the making of Things, and of the\r\nbeginning and the end of Peoples. It told of how the black folk grew,\r\nand of how the white folk should eat them up, and wherefore they were\r\nand wherefore they should cease to be. It told of Evil and of Good, of\r\nWoman and of Man, and of how these war against each other, and why it\r\nis that they war, and what are the ends of the struggle. It told also\r\nof the people of the Zulu, and it spoke of a place of a Little Hand\r\nwhere they should conquer, and of a place where a White Hand should\r\nprevail against them, and how they shall melt away beneath the shadow\r\nof the White Hand and be forgotten, passing to a land where things do\r\nnot die, but live on forever, the Good with the Good, the Evil with\r\nthe Evil. It told of Life and of Death, of Joy and of Sorrow, of Time\r\nand of that sea in which Time is but a floating leaf, and of why all\r\nthese things are. Many names also came into the song, and I knew but a\r\nfew of them, yet my own was there, and the name of Baleka and the name\r\nof Umslopogaas, and the name of Chaka the Lion. But a little while did\r\nthe voice sing, yet all this was in the song--ay, and much more; but\r\nthe meaning of the song is gone from me, though I knew it once, and\r\nshall know it again when all is done. The voice in the shadow sang on\r\ntill the whole place was full of the sound of its singing, and even\r\nthe dead seemed to listen.

For this reason it is, that I may be\r\nbrief, I have only spoken of a few of those events which befell in the\r\nreign of Chaka; for my tale is not of the reign of Chaka, but of the\r\nlives of a handful of people who lived in those days, and of whom I\r\nand Umslopogaas alone are left alive--if, indeed, Umslopogaas, the son\r\nof Chaka, is still living on the earth. Therefore, in a few words I\r\nwill pass over all that came about after the fall of Chaka and till I\r\nwas sent down by Dingaan, the king, to summon him to surrender to the\r\nking who was called the Slaughterer and who ruled the People of the\r\nAxe.

All things are a great pattern, my\r\nfather, drawn by the hand of the Umkulunkulu upon the cup whence he\r\ndrinks the water of his wisdom; and our lives, and what we do, and\r\nwhat we do not do, are but a little bit of the pattern, which is so\r\nbig that only the eyes of Him who is above, the Umkulunkulu, can see\r\nit all. Even Chaka, the slayer of men, and all those he slew, are but\r\nas a tiny grain of dust in the greatness of that pattern. How, then,\r\ncan we be wise, my father, who are but the tools of wisdom? how can be\r\nbuild who are but pebbles in a wall? how can we give life who are\r\nbabes in the womb of fate? or how can we slay who are but spears in\r\nthe hands of the slayer?"}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This came about, my father.

But he\r\nwas dead, and earth and heaven had not come together, so what did it\r\nmatter? Moreover, the two new kings promised to deal gently with the\r\npeople, and to lighten the heavy yoke of Chaka, and men in a bad case\r\nare always ready to home for a better. So it came about that the only\r\nenemies the princes found were each other and Engwade, the son of\r\nUnandi, Chaka's half-brother. But I, Mopo, who was now the first man\r\nin the land after the kings, ceasing to be a doctor and becoming a\r\ngeneral, went up against Engwade with the regiment of the Bees and the\r\nregiment of the Slayers and smote him in his kraals.
