admit me of thy crew,\r\nTo live with her, and live with thee,\r\nIn unreproved pleasures free:\r\nTo hear the lark begin his flight,\r\nAnd, singing, startle the dull night,\r\nFrom his watch-tower in the skies,\r\nTill the dappled dawn doth rise;\r\nThen to come, in spite of sorrow,\r\nAnd at my window bid good-morrow,\r\nThrough the sweet-briar or the vine,\r\nOr the twisted eglantine;\r\nWhile the cock, with lively din,\r\nScatters the rear of darkness thin,\r\nAnd to the stack, or the barn-door,\r\nStoutly struts his dames before:\r\nOft listening how the hounds and horn\r\nCheerly rouse the slumbering morn,\r\nFrom the side of some hoar hill,\r\nThrough the high wood echoing shrill:\r\nSometime walking, not unseen,\r\nBy hedgerow elms, on hillocks green,\r\nRight against the eastern gate\r\nWhere the great Sun begins his state,\r\nRobed in flames and amber light,\r\nThe clouds in thousand liveries dight;\r\nWhile the ploughman, near at hand,\r\nWhistles o'er the furrowed land,\r\nAnd the milkmaid singeth blithe,\r\nAnd the mower whets his scythe,\r\nAnd every shepherd tells his tale\r\nUnder the hawthorn in the dale.\r\nStraight mine eye hath caught new pleasures,\r\nWhilst the landskip round it measures:\r\nRusset lawns, and fallows grey,\r\nWhere the nibbling flocks do stray;\r\nMountains on whose barren breast\r\nThe labouring clouds do often rest;\r\nMeadows trim, with daisies pied;\r\nShallow brooks, and rivers wide;\r\nTowers and battlements it sees\r\nBosomed high in tufted trees,\r\nWhere perhaps some beauty lies,\r\nThe cynosure of neighbouring eyes.\r\nHard by a cottage chimney smokes\r\nFrom betwixt two aged oaks,\r\nWhere Corydon and Thyrsis met\r\nAre at their savoury dinner set\r\nOf herbs and other country messes,\r\nWhich the neat-handed Phyllis dresses;\r\nAnd then in haste her bower she leaves,\r\nWith Thestylis to bind the sheaves;\r\nOr, if the earlier season lead,\r\nTo the tanned haycock in the mead.\r\nSometimes, with secure delight,\r\nThe upland hamlets will invite,\r\nWhen the merry bells ring round,\r\nAnd the jocund rebecks sound\r\nTo many a youth and many a maid\r\nDancing in the chequered shade,\r\nAnd young and old come forth to play\r\nOn a sunshine holiday,\r\nTill the livelong daylight fail:\r\nThen to the spicy nut-brown ale,\r\nWith stories told of many a feat,\r\nHow Faery Mab the junkets eat.\r\nShe was pinched and pulled, she said;\r\nAnd he, by Friar's lantern led,\r\nTells how the drudging goblin sweat\r\nTo earn his cream-bowl duly set,\r\nWhen in one night, ere glimpse of morn,\r\nHis shadowy flail hath threshed the corn\r\nThat ten day-labourers could not end;\r\nThen lies him down, the lubber fiend,\r\nAnd, stretched out all the chimney's length,\r\nBasks at the fire his hairy strength,\r\nAnd crop-full out of doors he flings,\r\nEre the first cock his matin rings.\r\nThus done the tales, to bed they creep,\r\nBy whispering winds soon lulled asleep.\r\nTowered cities please us then,\r\nAnd the busy hum of men,\r\nWhere throngs of knights and barons bold,\r\nIn weeds of peace, high triumphs hold\r\nWith store of ladies, whose bright eyes\r\nRain influence, and judge the prize\r\nOf wit or arms, while both contend\r\nTo win her grace whom all commend.\r\nThere let Hymen oft appear\r\nIn saffron robe, with taper clear,\r\nAnd pomp, and feast, and revelry,\r\nWith mask and antique pageantry;\r\nSuch sights as youthful poets dream\r\nOn summer eves by haunted stream.\r\nThen to the well-trod stage anon,\r\nIf Jonson's learned sock be on,\r\nOr sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,\r\nWarble his native wood-notes wild.\r\nAnd ever, against eating cares,\r\nLap me in soft Lydian airs,\r\nMarried to immortal verse,\r\nSuch as the meeting soul may pierce,\r\nIn notes with many a winding bout\r\nOf linked sweetness long drawn out\r\nWith wanton heed and giddy cunning,\r\nThe melting voice through mazes running,\r\nUntwisting all the chains that tie\r\nThe hidden soul of harmony;\r\nThat Orpheus' self may heave his head\r\nFrom golden slumber on a bed\r\nOf heaped Elysian flowers, and hear\r\nSuch strains as would have won the

the cricket on the hearth,\r\nOr the bellman's drowsy charm\r\nTo bless the doors from nightly harm.\r\nOr let my lamp, at midnight hour,\r\nBe seen in some high lonely tower,\r\nWhere I may oft outwatch the Bear,\r\nWith thrice great Hermes, or unsphere\r\nThe spirit of Plato, to unfold\r\nWhat worlds or what vast regions hold\r\nThe immortal mind that hath forsook\r\nHer mansion in this fleshly nook;\r\nAnd of those demons that are found\r\nIn fire, air, flood, or underground,\r\nWhose power hath a true consent\r\nWith planet or with element.\r\nSometime let gorgeous Tragedy\r\nIn sceptred pall come sweeping by,\r\nPresenting Thebes, or Pelops' line,\r\nOr the tale of Troy divine,\r\nOr what (though rare) of later age\r\nEnnobled hath the buskined stage.\r\nBut, O sad Virgin! that thy power\r\nMight raise Musaeus from his bower;\r\nOr bid the soul of Orpheus sing\r\nSuch notes as, warbled to the string,\r\nDrew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,\r\nAnd made Hell grant what

the Attic boy to hunt,\r\nBut kerchieft in a comely cloud\r\nWhile rocking winds are piping loud,\r\nOr ushered with a shower still,\r\nWhen the gust hath blown his fill,\r\nEnding on the rustling leaves,\r\nWith minute-drops from off the eaves.\r\nAnd, when the sun begins to fling\r\nHis flaring beams, me, Goddess, bring\r\nTo arched walks of twilight groves,\r\nAnd shadows brown, that Sylvan loves,\r\nOf pine, or monumental oak,\r\nWhere the rude axe with heaved stroke\r\nWas never heard the nymphs to daunt,\r\nOr fright them from their hallowed haunt.\r\nThere, in close covert, by some

the studious cloister's pale,\r\nAnd love the high embowed roof,\r\nWith antique pillars massy proof,\r\nAnd storied windows richly dight,\r\nCasting a dim religious light.\r\nThere let the pealing organ blow,\r\nTo the full-voiced quire below,\r\nIn service high and anthems clear,\r\nAs may with sweetness, through mine ear,\r\nDissolve me into ecstasies,\r\nAnd bring all Heaven before mine
