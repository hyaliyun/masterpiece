He served fifty years, and rose to the position of\r\nPrincipal of the Bank Stock Office, then an important one,\r\nand which brought him into contact with the leading financiers of the day.\r\nHe became also a lieutenant in the Honourable Artillery Company,\r\nand took part in the defence of the Bank in the Gordon Riots of 1789.\r\nHe was an able, energetic, and worldly man:  an Englishman,\r\nvery much of the provincial type; his literary tastes being limited\r\nto the Bible and `Tom Jones', both of which he is said to have read through\r\nonce a year.  He possessed a handsome person and, probably,\r\na vigorous constitution, since he lived to the age of eighty-four,\r\nthough frequently tormented by gout; a circumstance which may help\r\nto account for his not having seen much of his grandchildren,\r\nthe poet and his sister; we are indeed told that he particularly dreaded\r\nthe lively boy's vicinity to his afflicted foot.  He married, in 1778,\r\nMargaret, daughter of a Mr. Tittle by his marriage with Miss Seymour;\r\nand who was born in the West Indies and had inherited property there.\r\nThey had three children:  Robert, the poet's father; a daughter,\r\nwho lived an uneventful life and plays no part in the family history;\r\nand another son who died an infant.  The Creole mother died also\r\nwhen her eldest boy was only seven years old, and passed out of his memory\r\nin all but an indistinct impression of having seen her lying in her coffin.\r\nFive years later the widower married a Miss Smith, who gave him\r\na large family."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This second marriage of Mr. Browning's was a critical event\r\nin the life of his eldest son; it gave him, to all appearance,\r\ntwo step-parents instead of one.  There could have been little sympathy\r\nbetween his father and himself, for no two persons were ever more unlike,\r\nbut there was yet another cause for the systematic unkindness\r\nunder which the lad grew up.  Mr. Browning fell, as a hard man easily does,\r\ngreatly under the influence of his second wife, and this influence\r\nwas made by her to subserve the interests of a more than natural jealousy\r\nof her predecessor.  An early instance of this was her banishing\r\nthe dead lady's portrait to a garret, on the plea that her husband\r\ndid not need two wives.  The son could be no burden upon her\r\nbecause he had a little income, derived from his mother's brother;\r\nbut this, probably, only heightened her ill-will towards him.\r\nWhen he was old enough to go to a University, and very desirous of going --\r\nwhen, moreover, he offered to do so at his own cost --\r\nshe induced his father to forbid it, because, she urged,\r\nthey could not afford to send their other sons to college.\r\nAn earlier ambition of his had been to become an artist;\r\nbut when he showed his first completed picture to his father, the latter\r\nturned away and refused to look at it.  He gave himself the finishing stroke\r\nin the parental eyes, by throwing up a lucrative employment\r\nwhich he had held for a short time on his mother's West Indian property,\r\nin disgust at the system of slave labour which was still in force there;\r\nand he paid for this unpractical conduct as soon as he was of age,\r\nby the compulsory reimbursement of all the expenses which his father,\r\nup to that date, had incurred for him; and by the loss\r\nof his mother's fortune, which, at the time of her marriage, had not been\r\nsettled upon her.  It was probably in despair of doing anything better,\r\nthat, soon after this, in his twenty-second year, he also became a clerk\r\nin the Bank of England.  He married and settled in Camberwell, in 1811;\r\nhis son and daughter were born, respectively, in 1812 and 1814.\r\nHe became a widower in 1849; and when, four years later, he had completed\r\nhis term of service at the Bank, he went with his daughter to Paris,\r\nwhere they resided until his death in 1866."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Dr. Furnivall has originated a theory, and maintains it as a conviction,\r\nthat Mr. Browning's grandmother was more than a Creole\r\nin the strict sense of the term, that of a person born of white parents\r\nin the West Indies, and that an unmistakable dash of dark blood\r\npassed from her to her son and grandson.  Such an occurrence was,\r\non the face of it, not impossible, and would be absolutely unimportant\r\nto my mind, and, I think I may add, to that of Mr. Browning's sister and son.\r\nThe poet and his father were what we know them, and if negro blood\r\nhad any part in their composition, it was no worse for them,\r\nand so much the better for the negro.  But many persons among us\r\nare very averse to the idea of such a cross; I believe its assertion,\r\nin the present case, to be entirely mistaken; I prefer, therefore,\r\ntouching on the facts alleged in favour of it, to passing them over\r\nin a silence which might be taken to mean indifference,\r\nbut might also be interpreted into assent."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"We are told that Mr. Browning was so dark in early life,\r\nthat a nephew who saw him in Paris, in 1837, mistook him for an Italian.\r\nHe neither had nor could have had a nephew; and he was not out of England\r\nat the time specified.  It is said that when Mr. Browning senior\r\nwas residing on his mother's sugar plantation at St. Kitt's,\r\nhis appearance was held to justify his being placed in church\r\namong the coloured members of the congregation.  We are assured\r\nin the strongest terms that the story has no foundation,\r\nand this by a gentleman whose authority in all matters concerning\r\nthe Browning family Dr. Furnivall has otherwise accepted as conclusive.\r\nIf the anecdote were true it would be a singular circumstance\r\nthat Mr. Browning senior was always fond of drawing negro heads,\r\nand thus obviously disclaimed any unpleasant association with them."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I do not know the exact physical indications by which a dark strain\r\nis perceived; but if they are to be sought in the colouring of eyes,\r\nhair, and skin, they have been conspicuously absent in the two persons\r\nwho in the present case are supposed to have borne them.\r\nThe poet's father had light blue eyes and, I am assured by those\r\nwho knew him best, a clear, ruddy complexion.

The acute ailment reproduced itself\r\nin her daughter in spite of an otherwise vigorous constitution.\r\nWith the brother, the inheritance of suffering was not less surely present,\r\nif more difficult to trace.  We have been accustomed to speaking of him\r\nas a brilliantly healthy man; he was healthy, even strong,\r\nin many essential respects.  Until past the age of seventy\r\nhe could take long walks without fatigue, and endure an amount\r\nof social and general physical strain which would have tried many younger men.\r\nHe carried on until the last a large, if not always serious, correspondence,\r\nand only within the latest months, perhaps weeks of his life,\r\ndid his letters even suggest that physical brain-power was failing him.\r\nHe had, within the limits which his death has assigned to it,\r\na considerable recuperative power.

Till towards the age of forty\r\nhe suffered from attacks of sore-throat, not frequent, but of an angry kind.\r\nHe was constantly troubled by imperfect action of the liver,\r\nthough no doctor pronounced the evil serious.  I have spoken of this\r\nin reference to his complexion.  During the last twenty years, if not\r\nfor longer, he rarely spent a winter without a suffocating cold and cough;\r\nwithin the last five, asthmatic symptoms established themselves;\r\nand when he sank under what was perhaps his first real attack of bronchitis\r\nit was not because the attack was very severe, but because the heart\r\nwas exhausted.  The circumstances of his death recalled that of his mother;\r\nand we might carry the sad analogy still farther in his increasing pallor,\r\nand the slow and not strong pulse which always characterized him.\r\nThis would perhaps be a mistake.  It is difficult to reconcile any idea\r\nof bloodlessness with the bounding vitality of his younger body and mind.\r\nAny symptom of organic disease could scarcely, in his case,\r\nhave been overlooked.  But so much is certain:  he was conscious\r\nof what he called a nervousness of nature which neither father nor grandfather\r\ncould have bequeathed to him.  He imputed to this, or, in other words,\r\nto an undue physical sensitiveness to mental causes of irritation,\r\nhis proneness to deranged liver, and the asthmatic conditions\r\nwhich he believed, rightly or wrongly, to be produced by it.\r\nHe was perhaps mistaken in some of his inferences, but he was not mistaken\r\nin the fact.  He had the pleasures as well as the pains\r\nof this nervous temperament; its quick response to every congenial stimulus\r\nof physical atmosphere, and human contact.  It heightened the enjoyment,\r\nperhaps exaggerated the consciousness of his physical powers.\r\nIt also certainly in his later years led him to overdraw them.\r\nMany persons have believed that he could not live without society;\r\na prolonged seclusion from it would, for obvious reasons,\r\nhave been unsuited to him.  But the excited gaiety which to the last\r\nhe carried into every social gathering was often primarily\r\nthe result of a moral and physical effort which his temperament prompted,\r\nbut his strength could not always justify.

He wrote music for songs which he himself sang;\r\namong them Donne's ",(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Go and catch a falling star'; Hood's "}),"I will not have\r\nthe mad Clytie'; Peacock's ",(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The mountain sheep are sweeter'; and his settings, all of which he subsequently destroyed, were, I am told, very spirited. His education seems otherwise to have been purely literary.  For two years, from the age of fourteen to that of sixteen, he studied with a French tutor, who, whether this was intended or not, imparted to him very little but a good knowledge of the French language and literature. In his eighteenth year he attended, for a term or two, a Greek class at the London University.  His classical and other reading was probably continued.  But we hear nothing in the programme of mathematics, or logic -- of any, in short, of those subjects which train, even coerce, the thinking powers, and which were doubly requisite for a nature in which the creative imagination was predominant over all the other mental faculties, great as these other faculties were.  And, even as poet, he suffered from this omission:  since the involutions and overlappings of thought and phrase, which occur in his earlier and again in his latest works, must have been partly due to his never learning to follow the processes of more normally constituted minds.  It would be a great error to suppose that they ever arose from the absence of a meaning clearly felt, if not always clearly thought out, by himself.  He was storing his memory and enriching his mind; but precisely in so doing he was nourishing the consciousness of a very vivid and urgent personality; and, under the restrictions inseparable from the life of a home-bred youth, it was becoming a burden to him.  What outlet he found in verse we do not know, because nothing survives of what he may then have written. It is possible that the fate of his early poems, and, still more, the change of ideals, retarded the definite impulse towards poetic production. It would be a relief to him to sketch out and elaborate the plan of his future work -- his great mental portrait gallery of typical men and women; and he was doing so during at least the later years which preceded the birth of "}),"Pauline'.  But even this must have been\r\nthe result of some protracted travail with himself; because it was only\r\nthe inward sense of very varied possibilities of existence\r\nwhich could have impelled him towards this kind of creation.\r\nNo character he ever produced was merely a figment of the brain."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"It was natural, therefore, that during this time of growth he should\r\nhave been, not only more restless, but less amiable than at any other.\r\nThe always impatient temper assumed a quality of aggressiveness.\r\nHe behaved as a youth will who knows himself to be clever, and believes\r\nthat he is not appreciated, because the crude or paradoxical forms\r\nwhich his cleverness assumes do not recommend it to his elders' minds.\r\nHe set the judgments of those about him at defiance,\r\nand gratuitously proclaimed himself everything that he was,\r\nand some things that he was not.  All this subdued itself as time advanced,\r\nand the coming man in him could throw off the wayward child.\r\nIt was all so natural that it might well be forgotten.  But it distressed\r\nhis mother, the one being in the world whom he entirely loved;\r\nand deserves remembering in the tender sorrow with which he himself\r\nremembered it.  He was always ready to say that he had been worth little\r\nin his young days; indeed, his self-depreciation covered the greater part\r\nof his life.

Nor did he submit to this\r\nas a necessary restraint; for, except on the occasions of his going abroad,\r\nit is scarcely on record that he ever willingly spent a night away from home.\r\nIt may not stand for much, or it may stand to the credit of his restlessness,\r\nthat, when he had been placed with some gentleman in Gower Street,\r\nfor the convenience of attending the University lectures,\r\nor for the sake of preparing for them, he broke through the arrangement\r\nat the end of a week; but even an agreeable visit had no power to detain him\r\nbeyond a few days."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This home-loving quality was in curious contrast to the natural bohemianism\r\nof youthful genius, and the inclination to wildness which asserted itself\r\nin his boyish days.

You will have heard how\r\nour joy turned suddenly into deep sorrow by the death of my husband\'s mother.\r\nAn unsuspected disease (ossification of the heart) terminated in a fatal way\r\n-- and she lay in the insensibility precursive of the grave\'s\r\nwhen the letter written with such gladness by my poor husband\r\nand announcing the birth of his child, reached her address.\r\n"It would have made her heart bound," said her daughter to us.\r\nPoor tender heart -- the last throb was too near.  The medical men\r\nwould not allow the news to be communicated.  The next joy she felt\r\nwas to be in heaven itself.  My husband has been in the deepest anguish,\r\nand indeed, except for the courageous consideration of his sister\r\nwho wrote two letters of preparation, saying "She was not well"\r\nand she "was very ill" when in fact all was over, I am frightened to think\r\nwhat the result would have been to him.  He has loved his mother\r\nas such passionate natures only can love, and I never saw a man so bowed down\r\nin an extremity of sorrow -- never.  Even now, the depression is great --\r\nand sometimes when I leave him alone a little and return to the room,\r\nI find him in tears.  I do earnestly wish to change the scene and air --\r\nbut where to go?  England looks terrible now.  He says\r\nit would break his heart to see his mother\'s roses over the wall\r\nand the place where she used to lay her scissors and gloves --\r\nwhich I understand so thoroughly that I can\'t say "Let us go to England."\r\nWe must wait and see what his father and sister will choose to do,\r\nor choose us to do -- for of course a duty plainly seen\r\nwould draw us anywhere.  My own dearest sisters will be painfully disappointed\r\nby any change of plan -- only they are too good and kind not to understand\r\nthe difficulty -- not to see the motive.  So do you, I am certain.\r\nIt has been very, very painful altogether, this drawing together\r\nof life and death.

. .  We have been wandering in search of cool air and a cool bough\r\namong all the olive trees to build our summer nest on.\r\nMy husband has been suffering beyond what one could shut one's eyes to,\r\nin consequence of the great mental shock of last March --\r\nloss of appetite, loss of sleep -- looks quite worn and altered.\r\nHis spirits never rallied except with an effort, and every letter\r\nfrom New Cross threw him back into deep depression.  I was very anxious,\r\nand feared much that the end of it all would be (the intense heat\r\nof Florence assisting) nervous fever or something similar;\r\nand I had the greatest difficulty in persuading him to leave Florence\r\nfor a month or two.  He who generally delights in travelling,\r\nhad no mind for change or movement.  I had to say and swear\r\nthat Baby and I couldn't bear the heat, and that we must and would go away.\r\n\"Ce que femme veut, HOMME veut,\" if the latter is at all amiable,\r\nor the former persevering.  At last I gained the victory.  It was agreed\r\nthat we two should go on an exploring journey, to find out where we could have\r\nmost shadow at least expense; and we left our child with his nurse and Wilson,\r\nwhile we were absent.  We went along the coast to Spezzia,\r\nsaw Carrara with the white marble mountains, passed through\r\nthe olive-forests and the vineyards, avenues of acacia trees,\r\nchestnut woods, glorious surprises of the most exquisite scenery.\r\nI say olive-forests advisedly -- the olive grows like a forest-tree\r\nin those regions, shading the ground with tints of silvery network.\r\nThe olive near Florence is but a shrub in comparison,\r\nand I have learnt to despise a little too the Florentine vine,\r\nwhich does not swing such portcullises of massive dewy green\r\nfrom one tree to another as along the whole road where we travelled.\r\nBeautiful indeed it was.  Spezzia wheels the blue sea\r\ninto the arms of the wooded mountains; and we had a glance\r\nat Shelley's house at Lerici.  It was melancholy to me, of course.\r\nI was not sorry that the lodgings we inquired about were far above our means.\r\nWe returned on our steps (after two days in the dirtiest of possible inns),\r\nsaw Seravezza, a village in the mountains, where rock river and wood\r\nenticed us to stay, and the inhabitants drove us off\r\nby their unreasonable prices.  It is curious -- but just in proportion\r\nto the want of civilization the prices rise in Italy.\r\nIf you haven't cups and saucers, you are made to pay for plate.\r\nWell -- so finding no rest for the soles of our feet,\r\nI persuaded Robert to go to the Baths of Lucca, only to see them.\r\nWe were to proceed afterwards to San Marcello, or some safer wilderness.\r\nWe had both of us, but he chiefly, the strongest prejudice\r\nagainst the Baths of Lucca; taking them for a sort of wasp's nest\r\nof scandal and gaming, and expecting to find everything trodden flat\r\nby the continental English -- yet, I wanted to see the place,\r\nbecause it is a place to see, after all.  So we came, and were so charmed\r\nby the exquisite beauty of the scenery, by the coolness of the climate,\r\nand the absence of our countrymen -- political troubles serving admirably\r\nour private requirements, that we made an offer for rooms on the spot,\r\nand returned to Florence for Baby and the rest of our establishment\r\nwithout further delay.  Here we are then.  We have been here\r\nmore than a fortnight.  We have taken an apartment for the season --\r\nfour months, paying twelve pounds for the whole term, and hoping to be able\r\nto stay till the end of October.  The living is cheaper than even in Florence,\r\nso that there has been no extravagance in coming here.\r\nIn fact Florence is scarcely tenable during the summer from the excessive heat\r\nby day and night, even if there were no particular motive for leaving it.\r\nWe have taken a sort of eagle's nest in this place -- the highest house\r\nof the highest of the three villages which are called the Bagni di Lucca,\r\nand which lie at the heart of a hundred mountains sung to continually\r\nby a rushing mountain stream.  The sound of the river and of the cicale\r\nis all the noise we hear.  Austrian drums and carriage-wheels cannot vex us,\r\nGod be thanked for it!  The silence is full of joy and consolation.\r\nI think my husband's spirits are better already, and his appetite improved.\r\nCertainly little Babe's great cheeks are growing rosier and rosier.\r\nHe is out all day when the sun is not too strong, and Wilson will have it\r\nthat he is prettier than the whole population of babies here. . . .\r\nThen my whole strength has wonderfully improved -- just as\r\nmy medical friends prophesied, -- and it seems like a dream\r\nwhen I find myself able to climb the hills with Robert,\r\nand help him to lose himself in the forests.  Ever since my confinement\r\nI have been growing stronger and stronger, and where it is to stop\r\nI can't tell really.  I can do as much or more than at any point of my life\r\nsince I arrived at woman's estate.  The air of the place\r\nseems to penetrate the heart, and not the lungs only:  it draws you,\r\nraises you, excites you.  Mountain air without its keenness --\r\nsheathed in Italian sunshine -- think what that must be!\r\nAnd the beauty and the solitude -- for with a few paces\r\nwe get free of the habitations of men -- all is delightful to me.\r\nWhat is peculiarly beautiful and wonderful, is the variety of the shapes\r\nof the mountains.  They are a multitude -- and yet there is no likeness.\r\nNone, except where the golden mist comes and transfigures them into one glory.\r\nFor the rest, the mountain there wrapt in the chestnut forest\r\nis not like that bare peak which tilts against the sky --\r\nnor like the serpent-twine of another which seems to move and coil\r\nin the moving coiling shadow. . . .'"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"She writes again:"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"==\r\nBagni di Lucca:  Oct. 2 ('49)."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.h1,{id:"----i-have-performed-a-great-exploit----ridden-on-a-donkey-five-miles-deepinto-the-mountain-to-an-almost-inaccessible-volcanic-ground-not-farfrom-the-stars--robert-on-horseback-and-wilson-and-the-nurse-with-babyon-other-donkies----guides-of-course--we-set-off-at-eight-in-the-morningand-returned-at-six-pm-after-dining-on-the-mountain-pinnaclei-dreadfully-tired-but-the-child-laughing-as-usual-burnt-brick-colourfor-all-bad-effect--no-horse-or-ass-untrained-for-the-mountainscould-have-kept-foot-a-moment-where-we-penetrated-and-even-as-it-wasone-could-not-help-the-natural-thrill--no-road-except-the-bedof-exhausted-torrents----above-and-through-the-chestnut-forestsprecipitous-beyond-what-you-would-think-possible-for-ascent-or-descentravines-tearing-the-ground-to-pieces-under-your-feet--the-scenerysublime-and-wonderful-satisfied-us-wholly-as-we-looked-roundon-the-world-of-innumerable-mountains-bound-faintly-with-the-grey-sea---and-not-a-human-habitation---",children:"`. . .

He was then alluding to a special offshoot of feeling and association, on the permanence of which it is not now necessary to dwell; but it is certain that he continued growing up to a late age, and that the development was only limited by those general roots, those fixed conditions of his being, which had predetermined its form. This progressive intellectual vitality is amply represented in his works; it also reveals itself in his letters in so far as I have been allowed to publish them.  I only refer to it to give emphasis to a contrasted or corresponding characteristic:  his aversion to every thought of change. I have spoken of his constancy to all degrees of friendship and love. What he loved once he loved always, from the dearest man or woman to whom his allegiance had been given, to the humblest piece of furniture which had served him.  It was equally true that what he had done once he was wont, for that very reason, to continue doing. The devotion to habits of feeling extended to habits of life; and although the lower constancy generally served the purposes of the higher, it also sometimes clashed with them.  It conspired with his ready kindness of heart to make him subject to circumstances which at first appealed to him through that kindness, but lay really beyond its scope.  This statement, it is true, can only fully apply to the latter part of his life. His powers of reaction must originally have been stronger, as well as freer from the paralysis of conflicting motive and interest. The marked shrinking from effort in any untried direction, which was often another name for his stability, could scarcely have coexisted with the fresher and more curious interest in men and things; we know indeed from recorded facts that it was a feeling of later growth; and it visibly increased with the periodical nervous exhaustion of his advancing years.  I am convinced, nevertheless, that, when the restiveness of boyhood had passed away, Mr. Browning's strength was always more passive than active; that he habitually made the best of external conditions rather than tried to change them.

He would read\r\nan old closely printed volume by the waning light of a winter afternoon,\r\npositively refusing to use a lamp.  Indeed his preference\r\nof the faintest natural light to the best that could be artificially produced\r\nwas perhaps the one suggestion of coming change.  He used for all purposes\r\na single eye; for the two did not combine in their action,\r\nthe right serving exclusively for near, the left for distant objects.\r\nThis was why in walking he often closed the right eye;\r\nwhile it was indispensable to his comfort in reading,\r\nnot only that the light should come from the right side,\r\nbut that the left should be shielded from any luminous object, like the fire,\r\nwhich even at the distance of half the length of a room\r\nwould strike on his field of vision and confuse the near sight."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"His literary interest became increasingly centred on records of the lives\r\nof men and women; especially of such men and women as he had known;\r\nhe was generally curious to see the newly published biographies,\r\nthough often disappointed by them.

This author's\r\ndeep and hence often poetic realism was, I believe, bound up\r\nwith his own earliest aspirations towards dramatic art.\r\nHis manner of reading aloud a story which he already knew\r\nwas the counterpart of his own method of construction.\r\nHe would claim his listener's attention for any apparently unimportant fact\r\nwhich had a part to play in it:  he would say:  `Listen to this description:\r\nit will be important.  Observe this character:  you will see a great deal more\r\nof him or her.'  We know that in his own work nothing was thrown away;\r\nno note was struck which did not add its vibration to the general utterance\r\nof the poem; and his habitual generosity towards a fellow-worker\r\nprompted him to seek and recognize the same quality,\r\neven in productions where it was less conspicuous than in his own.\r\nThe patient reading which he required for himself was justified\r\nby that which he always demanded for others; and he claimed it less\r\nin his own case for his possible intricacies of thought or style,\r\nthan for that compactness of living structure in which\r\nevery detail or group of details was essential to the whole,\r\nand in a certain sense contained it.
