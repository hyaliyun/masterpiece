I was pale, and both\r\nmy words and actions were disordered and embarrassed.  The young\r\nMen observed this, and enquired the cause.  I attributed it to\r\nexcess of fatigue, and the violent effect produced on me by the\r\nseverity of the season.  Whether they believed me or not, I will\r\nnot pretend to say:  They at least ceased to embarrass me with\r\ntheir questions.  I strove to divert my attention from the perils\r\nwhich surrounded me, by conversing on different subjects with the\r\nBaroness.

She replied to me with great ease\r\nand politeness, professed that the pleasure of making my\r\nacquaintance amply compensated for the delay in her journey, and\r\ngave me a pressing invitation to make some stay at the Castle of\r\nLindenberg.  As She spoke thus, the Youths exchanged a malicious\r\nsmile, which declared that She would be fortunate if She ever\r\nreached that Castle herself.  This action did not escape me; But\r\nI concealed the emotion which it excited in my breast.  I\r\ncontinued to converse with the Lady; But my discourse was so\r\nfrequently incoherent, that as She has since informed me, She\r\nbegan to doubt whether I was in my right senses.  The fact was,\r\nthat while my conversation turned upon one subject, my thoughts\r\nwere entirely occupied by another.  I meditated upon the means of\r\nquitting the Cottage, finding my way to the Barn, and giving the\r\nDomestics information of our Host's designs.  I was soon\r\nconvinced, how impracticable was the attempt.  Jacques and Robert\r\nwatched my every movement with an attentive eye, and I was\r\nobliged to abandon the idea.

Oh! how\r\nin my heart I cursed the Hypocrite!  How I loathed his presence,\r\nwho was on the point of depriving me of an existence, at that\r\ntime infinitely dear!  I had every reason to be satisfied with\r\nlife; I had youth, wealth, rank, and education; and the fairest\r\nprospects presented themselves before me.

She soon\r\nentered the room, and placed before us a plain but comfortable\r\nPeasant's repast.

I was therefore obliged\r\nto chime in with her plan, which in truth seemed well arranged:\r\nHer disguise would secure her from being stopped in quitting the\r\nCastle, and would enable her to step into the Carriage at the\r\nvery Gate without difficulty or losing time."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Agnes reclined her head mournfully upon my shoulder, and by the\r\nlight of the Moon I saw tears flowing down her cheek.

I told her that\r\nmy first care should be to find you out, Lorenzo, and reconcile\r\nyou to our union; and I was continuing to speak in the same\r\nstrain, when a noise without alarmed me.  Suddenly the door of\r\nthe Pavilion was thrown open, and Cunegonda stood before us.  She\r\nhad heard Agnes steal out of her chamber, followed her into the\r\nGarden, and perceived her entering the Pavilion.

At the same moment Theodore, who had followed her into\r\nthe room, closed the door, and prevented her escape.  I took the\r\nveil of Agnes:  I threw it round the Duenna's head, who uttered\r\nsuch piercing shrieks that in spite of our distance from the\r\nCastle, I dreaded their being heard.  At length I succeeded in\r\ngagging her so compleatly that She could not produce a single\r\nsound.  Theodore and myself with some difficulty next contrived\r\nto bind her hands and feet with our handkerchiefs; And I advised\r\nAgnes to regain her chamber with all diligence.  I promised that\r\nno harm should happen to Cunegonda, bad her remember that on the\r\nfifth of May I should be in waiting at the Great Gate of the\r\nCastle, and took of her an affectionate farewell.

The unlucky Duenna never had made\r\na more disagreeable journey in her life:  She was jolted and\r\nshaken till She was become little more than an animated Mummy;\r\nnot to mention her fright when we waded through a small River\r\nthrough which it was necessary to pass in order to regain the\r\nVillage.  Before we reached the Inn, I had already determined how\r\nto dispose of the troublesome Cunegonda.

He soon quitted the\r\nroom, and left me to exult in the success of my undertaking."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I immediately paid a visit to my Prisoner.  I strove to persuade\r\nher submitting with patience to her temporary confinement.  My\r\nattempt was unsuccessful.  Unable to speak or move, She expressed\r\nher fury by her looks, and except at meals I never dared to\r\nunbind her, or release her from the Gag.  At such times I stood\r\nover her with a drawn sword, and protested, that if She uttered a\r\nsingle cry, I would plunge it in her bosom.  As soon as She had\r\ndone eating, the Gag was replaced.  I was conscious that this\r\nproceeding was cruel, and could only be justified by the urgency\r\nof circumstances:  As to Theodore, He had no scruples upon the\r\nsubject.  Cunegonda's captivity entertained him beyond measure.\r\nDuring his abode in the Castle, a continual warfare had been\r\ncarried on between him and the Duenna; and now that He found his\r\nEnemy so absolutely in his power, He triumphed without mercy.  He\r\nseemed to think of nothing but how to find out new means of\r\nplaguing her:  Sometimes He affected to pity her misfortune, then\r\nlaughed at, abused, and mimicked her; He played her a thousand\r\ntricks, each more provoking than the other, and amused himself by\r\ntelling her that her elopement must have occasioned much\r\nsurprise at the Baron's.  This was in fact the case.  No one\r\nexcept Agnes could imagine what was become of Dame Cunegonda:\r\nEvery hole and corner was searched for her; The Ponds were\r\ndragged, and the Woods underwent a thorough examination.  Still\r\nno Dame Cunegonda made her appearance.  Agnes kept the secret,\r\nand I kept the Duenna:  The Baroness, therefore, remained in\r\ntotal ignorance respecting the old Woman's fate, but suspected\r\nher to have perished by suicide.  Thus past away five days,\r\nduring which I had prepared every thing necessary for my\r\nenterprise.  On quitting Agnes, I had made it my first business\r\nto dispatch a Peasant with a letter to Lucas at Munich, ordering\r\nhim to take care that a Coach and four should arrive about ten\r\no'clock on the fifth of May at the Village of Rosenwald.  He\r\nobeyed my instructions punctually: The Equipage arrived at the\r\ntime appointed.  As the period of her Lady's elopement drew\r\nnearer, Cunegonda's rage increased.  I verily believe that spight\r\nand passion would have killed her, had I not luckily discovered\r\nher prepossession in favour of Cherry Brandy. With this favourite\r\nliquor She was plentifully supplied, and Theodore always\r\nremaining to guard her, the Gag was occasionally removed.  The\r\nliquor seemed to have a wonderful effect in softening the\r\nacrimony of her nature; and her confinement not admitting of any\r\nother amusement, She got drunk regularly once a day just by way\r\nof passing the time."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The fifth of May arrived, a period by me never to be forgotten!\r\nBefore the Clock struck twelve, I betook myself to the scene of\r\naction.  Theodore followed me on horseback.

The\r\nnight was calm and beautiful:  The Moonbeams fell upon the\r\nantient Towers of the Castle, and shed upon their summits a\r\nsilver light.  All was still around me:  Nothing was to be heard\r\nexcept the night breeze sighing among the leaves, the distant\r\nbarking of Village Dogs, or the Owl who had established herself\r\nin a nook of the deserted Eastern Turret.  I heard her melancholy\r\nshriek, and looked upwards.  She sat upon the ride of a window,\r\nwhich I recognized to be that of the haunted Room.  This brought\r\nto my remembrance the story of the Bleeding Nun, and I sighed\r\nwhile I reflected on the influence of superstition and weakness\r\nof human reason.

I could hear the heavy doors grate as they opened\r\nwith difficulty, and as they closed again the rotten Casements\r\nrattled in their frames.  The chamber of Agnes was on the other\r\nside of the Castle.  I trembled lest She should have failed in\r\nobtaining the Key of the haunted Room:  Through this it was\r\nnecessary for her to pass in order to reach the narrow\r\nStaircase by which the Ghost was supposed to descend into the\r\ngreat Hall.  Agitated by this apprehension, I kept my eyes\r\nconstantly fixed upon the window, where I hoped to perceive the\r\nfriendly glare of a Lamp borne by Agnes.  I now heard the massy\r\nGates unbarred.  By the candle in his hand I distinguished old\r\nConrad, the Porter.  He set the Portal doors wide open, and\r\nretired.

I\r\napproached the Castle, and ventured to walk round it.  A few rays\r\nof light still glimmered in the chamber of Agnes.  I observed\r\nthem with joy.  I was still gazing upon them, when I perceived a\r\nfigure draw near the window, and the Curtain was carefully closed\r\nto conceal the Lamp which burned there.

My plan was soon\r\narranged.  When Don Gaston discovered to me his Daughter's\r\nretreat, I entertained no doubt of her readiness to quit the\r\nConvent:  I had, therefore, entrusted the Cardinal-Duke of Lerma\r\nwith the whole affair, who immediately busied himself in\r\nobtaining the necessary Bull.  Fortunately I had afterwards\r\nneglected to stop his proceedings.  Not long since I received a\r\nletter from him, stating that He expected daily to receive the\r\norder from the Court of Rome.  Upon this I would willingly have\r\nrelyed:  But the Cardinal wrote me word, that I must find some\r\nmeans of conveying Agnes out of the Convent, unknown to the\r\nPrioress.  He doubted not but this Latter would be much incensed\r\nby losing a Person of such high rank from her society, and\r\nconsider the renunciation of Agnes as an insult to her House.  He\r\nrepresented her as a Woman of a violent and revengeful character,\r\ncapable of proceeding to the greatest extremities.  It was\r\ntherefore to be feared, lest by confining Agnes in the Convent\r\nShe should frustrate my hopes, and render the Pope's mandate\r\nunavailing.  Influenced by this consideration, I resolved to\r\ncarry off my Mistress, and conceal her till the arrival of the\r\nexpected Bull in the Cardinal-Duke's Estate.  He approved of my\r\ndesign, and profest himself ready to give a shelter to the\r\nFugitive.  I next caused the new Gardener of St. Clare to be\r\nseized privately, and confined in my Hotel.  By this means I\r\nbecame Master of the Key to the Garden door, and I had now\r\nnothing more to do than prepare Agnes for the elopement.  This\r\nwas done by the letter, which you saw me deliver this Evening.

But I wander from my subject.  I was\r\ngoing to say that you cannot employ your time worse than in\r\nmaking verses.  An Author, whether good or bad, or between both,\r\nis an Animal whom everybody is privileged to attack; For though\r\nAll are not able to write books, all conceive themselves able to\r\njudge them.  A bad composition carries with it its own\r\npunishment, contempt and ridicule.  A good one excites envy, and\r\nentails upon its Author a thousand mortifications.  He finds\r\nhimself assailed by partial and ill-humoured Criticism: One Man\r\nfinds fault with the plan, Another with the style, a Third with\r\nthe precept, which it strives to inculcate; and they who cannot\r\nsucceed in finding fault with the Book, employ themselves in\r\nstigmatizing its Author.  They maliciously rake out from\r\nobscurity every little circumstance which may throw ridicule\r\nupon his private character or conduct, and aim at wounding the\r\nMan, since They cannot hurt the Writer.  In short, to enter the\r\nlists of literature is wilfully to expose yourself to the arrows\r\nof neglect, ridicule, envy, and disappointment.  Whether you\r\nwrite well or ill, be assured that you will not escape from\r\nblame; Indeed this circumstance contains a young Author's chief\r\nconsolation:  He remembers that Lope de Vega and Calderona had\r\nunjust and envious Critics, and He modestly conceives himself to\r\nbe exactly in their predicament.  But I am conscious that all\r\nthese sage observations are thrown away upon you.  Authorship is\r\na mania to conquer which no reasons are sufficiently strong; and\r\nyou might as easily persuade me not to love, as I persuade you\r\nnot to write.

The Friends advanced towards it.  Every thing was still\r\nand dark.  The Prioress was anxious to keep the story a secret,\r\nfearing lest the crime of one of its members should bring\r\ndisgrace upon the whole community, or that the interposition of\r\npowerful Relations should deprive her vengeance of its intended\r\nvictim.  She took care therefore to give the Lover of Agnes no\r\ncause to suppose that his design was discovered, and his\r\nMistress on the point of suffering the punishment of her fault.\r\nThe same reason made her reject the idea of arresting the unknown\r\nSeducer in the Garden; Such a proceeding would have created much\r\ndisturbance, and the disgrace of her Convent would have been\r\nnoised about Madrid.  She contented herself with confining Agnes\r\nclosely; As to the Lover, She left him at liberty to pursue his\r\ndesigns.  What She had expected was the result.

Lorenzo did not credit a syllable of this account:\r\nHe insisted upon seeing his Sister; If She was unable to come to\r\nthe Grate, He desired to be admitted to her Cell.

It was sunk within the\r\nhollow of a wall, and almost concealed by thick festoons of ivy\r\nhanging over it.

Pity is a sentiment so\r\nnatural, so appropriate to the female character, that it is\r\nscarcely a merit for a Woman to possess it, but to be without it\r\nis a grievous crime.  Ambrosio could not easily forgive his\r\nMistress for being deficient in this amiable quality.

Unfortunately\r\nas her passion grew ardent, Ambrosio's grew cold; The very marks\r\nof her fondness excited his disgust, and its excess served to\r\nextinguish the flame which already burned but feebly in his\r\nbosom.

Still, however,\r\ntheir illicit Commerce continued:  But it was clear that He was\r\nled to her arms, not by love, but the cravings of brutal\r\nappetite.  His constitution made a Woman necessary to him, and\r\nMatilda was the only one with whom He could indulge his passions\r\nsafely:  In spite of her beauty, He gazed upon every other Female\r\nwith more desire; But fearing that his Hypocrisy should be made\r\npublic, He confined his inclinations to his own breast."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"It was by no means his nature to be timid:  But his education had\r\nimpressed his mind with fear so strongly, that apprehension was\r\nnow become part of his character. Had his Youth been passed in\r\nthe world, He would have shown himself possessed of many\r\nbrilliant and manly qualities.  He was naturally enterprizing,\r\nfirm, and fearless:  He had a Warrior's heart, and He might have\r\nshone with splendour at the head of an Army.  There was no want\r\nof generosity in his nature:  The Wretched never failed to find\r\nin him a compassionate Auditor: His abilities were quick and\r\nshining, and his judgment, vast, solid, and decisive.  With such\r\nqualifications He would have been an ornament to his Country:\r\nThat He possessed them, He had given proofs in his earliest\r\ninfancy, and his Parents had beheld his dawning virtues with the\r\nfondest delight and admiration.  Unfortunately, while yet a Child\r\nHe was deprived of those Parents.  He fell into the power of a\r\nRelation whose only wish about him was never to hear of him\r\nmore; For that purpose He gave him in charge to his Friend, the\r\nformer Superior of the Capuchins.  The Abbot, a very Monk, used\r\nall his endeavours to persuade the Boy that happiness existed\r\nnot without the walls of a Convent.  He succeeded fully.  To\r\ndeserve admittance into the order of St. Francis was Ambrosio's\r\nhighest ambition.  His Instructors carefully repressed those\r\nvirtues whose grandeur and disinterestedness were ill-suited to\r\nthe Cloister.  Instead of universal benevolence, He adopted a\r\nselfish partiality for his own particular establishment:  He was\r\ntaught to consider compassion for the errors of Others as a crime\r\nof the blackest dye:  The noble frankness of his temper was\r\nexchanged for servile humility; and in order to break his natural\r\nspirit, the Monks terrified his young mind by placing before him\r\nall the horrors with which Superstition could furnish them:  They\r\npainted to him the torments of the Damned in colours the most\r\ndark, terrible, and fantastic, and threatened him at the\r\nslightest fault with eternal perdition.  No wonder that his\r\nimagination constantly dwelling upon these fearful objects should\r\nhave rendered his character timid and apprehensive.  Add to this,\r\nthat his long absence from the great world, and total\r\nunacquaintance with the common dangers of life, made him form of\r\nthem an idea far more dismal than the reality.  While the Monks\r\nwere busied in rooting out his virtues and narrowing his\r\nsentiments, they allowed every vice which had fallen to his\r\nshare to arrive at full perfection.  He was suffered to be\r\nproud, vain, ambitious, and disdainful:  He was jealous of his\r\nEquals, and despised all merit but his own:  He was implacable\r\nwhen offended, and cruel in his revenge. Still in spite of the\r\npains taken to pervert them, his natural good qualities would\r\noccasionally break through the gloom cast over them so carefully:"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"At such times the contest for superiority between his real and\r\nacquired character was striking and unaccountable to those\r\nunacquainted with his original disposition.

He resolved to be the\r\nConfessor himself.  He could leave the Abbey unobserved without\r\ndifficulty:  By wrapping up his head in his Cowl He hoped to pass\r\nthrough the Streets without being recognised: By taking these\r\nprecautions, and by recommending secrecy to Elvira's family, He\r\ndoubted not to keep Madrid in ignorance that He had broken his\r\nvow never to see the outside of the Abbey walls.

But Elvira insisted upon her taking the\r\njourney, conscious that in her Daughter's forlorn situation no\r\nincrease of fortune, however trifling, ought to be neglected.\r\nAccordingly, Leonella left Madrid, sincerely grieved at her\r\nSister's illness, and giving some few sighs to the memory of the\r\namiable but inconstant Don Christoval.  She was fully persuaded\r\nthat at first She had made a terrible breach in his heart:  But\r\nhearing nothing more of him, She supposed that He had quitted the\r\npursuit, disgusted by the lowness of her origin, and knowing upon\r\nother terms than marriage He had nothing to hope from such a\r\nDragon of Virtue as She professed herself; Or else, that being\r\nnaturally capricious and changeable, the remembrance of her\r\ncharms had been effaced from the Conde's heart by those of some\r\nnewer Beauty.

She strove in vain, as She assured every\r\nbody who was kind enough to listen to her, to tear his image from\r\nher too susceptible heart.  She affected the airs of a lovesick\r\nVirgin, and carried them all to the most ridiculous excess.  She\r\nheaved lamentable sighs, walked with her arms folded, uttered\r\nlong soliloquies, and her discourse generally turned upon some\r\nforsaken Maid who expired of a broken heart!

He was wilfully blind to the\r\ndanger of exposing himself to Antonia's charms:  He only\r\nremembered the pleasure which her society had afforded him, and\r\nrejoiced in the prospect of that pleasure being repeated.  He\r\nfailed not to profit by Elvira's indisposition to obtain a sight\r\nof her Daughter every day.  At first He bounded his wishes to\r\ninspire Antonia with friendship:  But no sooner was He convinced\r\nthat She felt that sentiment in its fullest extent, than his aim\r\nbecame more decided, and his attentions assumed a warmer colour.\r\nThe innocent familiarity with which She treated him, encouraged\r\nhis desires:  Grown used to her modesty, it no longer commanded\r\nthe same respect and awe:  He still admired it, but it only made\r\nhim more anxious to deprive her of that quality which formed her\r\nprincipal charm.  Warmth of passion, and natural penetration, of\r\nwhich latter unfortunately both for himself and Antonia He\r\npossessed an ample share, supplied a knowledge of the arts of\r\nseduction.  He easily distinguished the emotions which were\r\nfavourable to his designs, and seized every means with avidity of\r\ninfusing corruption into Antonia's bosom.  This He found no easy\r\nmatter.  Extreme simplicity prevented her from perceiving the aim\r\nto which the Monk's insinuations tended; But the excellent morals\r\nwhich She owed to Elvira's care, the solidity and correctness of\r\nher understanding, and a strong sense of what was right implanted\r\nin her heart by Nature, made her feel that his precepts must be\r\nfaulty. By a few simple words She frequently overthrew the whole\r\nbulk of his sophistical arguments, and made him conscious how\r\nweak they were when opposed to Virtue and Truth.  On such\r\noccasion He took refuge in his eloquence; He overpowered her\r\nwith a torrent of Philosophical paradoxes, to which, not\r\nunderstanding them, it was impossible for her to reply; And thus\r\nthough He did not convince her that his reasoning was just, He at\r\nleast prevented her from discovering it to be false.

He depended upon finding Antonia in some unguarded\r\nmoment; And seeing no other Man admitted into her society, nor\r\nhearing any mentioned either by her or by Elvira, He imagined\r\nthat her young heart was still unoccupied. While He waited for\r\nthe opportunity of satisfying his unwarrantable lust, every day\r\nincreased his coldness for Matilda.  Not a little was this\r\noccasioned by the consciousness of his faults to her.  To hide\r\nthem from her He was not sufficiently master of himself:  Yet He\r\ndreaded lest, in a transport of jealous rage, She should betray\r\nthe secret on which his character and even his life depended.\r\nMatilda could not but remark his indifference:  He was conscious\r\nthat She remarked it, and fearing her reproaches, shunned her\r\nstudiously.  Yet when He could not avoid her, her mildness might\r\nhave convinced him that He had nothing to dread from her\r\nresentment.  She had resumed the character of the gentle\r\ninteresting Rosario: She taxed him not with ingratitude; But her\r\neyes filled with involuntary tears, and the soft melancholy of\r\nher countenance and voice uttered complaints far more touching\r\nthan words could have conveyed.  Ambrosio was not unmoved by her\r\nsorrow; But unable to remove its cause, He forbore to show that\r\nit affected him.  As her conduct convinced him that He needed not\r\nfear her vengeance, He continued to neglect her, and avoided her\r\ncompany with care.

Antonia sat\r\nupon a Sopha with her back towards the door, and read\r\nattentively.  She heard not his approach, till He had seated\r\nhimself by her.  She started, and welcomed him with a look of\r\npleasure:  Then rising, She would have conducted him to the\r\nsitting-room; But Ambrosio taking her hand, obliged her by gentle\r\nviolence to resume her place.  She complied without difficulty:\r\nShe knew not that there was more impropriety in conversing with\r\nhim in one room than another.

That prudent Mother, while She admired\r\nthe beauties of the sacred writings, was convinced that,\r\nunrestricted, no reading more improper could be permitted a young\r\nWoman.  Many of the narratives can only tend to excite ideas the\r\nworst calculated for a female breast:  Every thing is called\r\nplainly and roundly by its name; and the annals of a Brothel\r\nwould scarcely furnish a greater choice of indecent expressions.\r\nYet this is the Book which young Women are recommended to study;\r\nwhich is put into the hands of Children, able to comprehend\r\nlittle more than those passages of which they had better remain\r\nignorant; and which but too frequently inculcates the first\r\nrudiments of vice, and gives the first alarm to the still\r\nsleeping passions.  Of this was Elvira so fully convinced, that\r\nShe would have preferred putting into her Daughter's hands\r\n'Amadis de Gaul,' or 'The Valiant Champion, Tirante the\r\nWhite;' and would sooner have authorised her studying the lewd\r\nexploits of 'Don Galaor,' or the lascivious jokes of the\r\n'Damsel Plazer di mi vida.'  She had in consequence made two\r\nresolutions respecting the Bible.  The first was that Antonia\r\nshould not read it till She was of an age to feel its beauties,\r\nand profit by its morality:  The second, that it should be copied\r\nout with her own hand, and all improper passages either altered\r\nor omitted.  She had adhered to this determination, and such was\r\nthe Bible which Antonia was reading:  It had been lately\r\ndelivered to her, and She perused it with an avidity, with a\r\ndelight that was inexpressible.

She reflected on\r\nseveral circumstances, which though trifling, on being put\r\ntogether seemed to authorize her fears.

I speak of those arts which\r\nrelate to the world of Spirits.  His deep researches into causes\r\nand effects, his unwearied application to the study of natural\r\nphilosophy, his profound and unlimited knowledge of the\r\nproperties and virtues of every gem which enriches the deep, of\r\nevery herb which the earth produces, at length procured him the\r\ndistinction which He had sought so long, so earnestly.

To preserve that life\r\nwhich your love had taught me to prize, I had recourse to means\r\nwhich I trembled at employing.  You remember that night which I\r\npast in St. Clare's Sepulchre?  Then was it that, surrounded by\r\nmouldering bodies, I dared to perform those mystic rites which\r\nsummoned to my aid a fallen Angel.

She was convinced that Ambrosio had meditated her\r\nDaughter's ruin:  And when She reflected that her death would\r\nleave Antonia friendless and unprotected in a world so base, so\r\nperfidious and depraved, her heart swelled with the bitterness of\r\napprehension.  At such times She would sit for hours gazing upon\r\nthe lovely Girl; and seeming to listen to her innocent prattle,\r\nwhile in reality her thoughts dwelt upon the sorrows into which\r\na moment would suffice to plunge her.

That amiable Boy quitted not his\r\nMaster for a moment, and put every means in practice to console\r\nand alleviate his sufferings.  The Marquis had conceived so\r\nrooted an affection for his deceased Mistress, that it was\r\nevident to all that He never could survive her loss:  Nothing\r\ncould have prevented him from sinking under his grief but the\r\npersuasion of her being still alive, and in need of his\r\nassistance.  Though convinced of its falsehood, his Attendants\r\nencouraged him in a belief which formed his only comfort.

As soon as He\r\nrecovered his speech, He broke out into execrations against the\r\nAssassins of his Beloved, and vowed to take upon them a signal\r\nvengeance.  He continued to rave and torment himself with\r\nimpotent passion till his constitution, enfeebled by grief and\r\nillness, could support itself no longer, and He relapsed into\r\ninsensibility.

Consequently, He\r\ngranted the order of arrest without difficulty:  He also gave\r\nLorenzo a letter to a principal Officer of the Inquisition,\r\ndesiring him to see his mandate executed.

She shuddered at the\r\nidea of passing the night in the same House with a dead Body:\r\nShe was persuaded that Elvira's Ghost would appear to her, and no\r\nless certain that such a visit would kill her with fright.  From\r\nthis persuasion, She resolved to pass the night at a Neighbour's,\r\nand insisted that the Funeral should take place the next day.\r\nSt. Clare's Cemetery being the nearest, it was determined that\r\nElvira should be buried there.  Dame Jacintha engaged to defray\r\nevery expence attending the burial.  She knew not in what\r\ncircumstances Antonia was left, but from the sparing manner in\r\nwhich the Family had lived, She concluded them to be indifferent."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Consequently, She entertained very little hope of ever being\r\nrecompensed; But this consideration prevented her not from taking\r\ncare that the Interment was performed with decency, and from\r\nshowing the unfortunate Antonia all possible respect."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Nobody dies of mere grief; Of this Antonia was an instance.\r\nAided by her youth and healthy constitution, She shook off the\r\nmalady which her Mother's death had occasioned; But it was not\r\nso easy to remove the disease of her mind.  Her eyes were\r\nconstantly filled with tears: Every trifle affected her, and She\r\nevidently nourished in her bosom a profound and rooted\r\nmelancholy.  The slightest mention of Elvira, the most trivial\r\ncircumstance recalling that beloved Parent to her memory, was\r\nsufficient to throw her into serious agitation.  How much would\r\nher grief have been increased, had She known the agonies which\r\nterminated her Mother's existence!  But of this no one\r\nentertained the least suspicion.  Elvira was subject to strong\r\nconvulsions:  It was supposed that, aware of their approach, She\r\nhad dragged herself to her Daughter's chamber in hopes of\r\nassistance; that a sudden access of her fits had seized her, too\r\nviolent to be resisted by her already enfeebled state of health;\r\nand that She had expired ere She had time to reach the medicine\r\nwhich generally relieved her, and which stood upon a shelf in\r\nAntonia's room.  This idea was firmly credited by the few people,\r\nwho interested themselves about Elvira:  Her Death was esteemed a\r\nnatural event, and soon forgotten by all save by her, who had but\r\ntoo much reason to deplore her loss."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In truth Antonia's situation was sufficiently embarrassing and\r\nunpleasant.  She was alone in the midst of a dissipated and\r\nexpensive City; She was ill provided with money, and worse with\r\nFriends.  Her aunt Leonella was still at Cordova, and She knew\r\nnot her direction.  Of the Marquis de las Cisternas She heard no\r\nnews:  As to Lorenzo, She had long given up the idea of\r\npossessing any interest in his bosom.  She knew not to whom She\r\ncould address herself in her present dilemma.  She wished to\r\nconsult Ambrosio; But She remembered her Mother's injunctions to\r\nshun him as much as possible, and the last conversation which\r\nElvira had held with her upon the subject had given her\r\nsufficient lights respecting his designs to put her upon her\r\nguard against him in future.  Still all her Mother's warnings\r\ncould not make her change her good opinion of the Friar.  She\r\ncontinued to feel that his friendship and society were requisite\r\nto her happiness:  She looked upon his failings with a partial\r\neye, and could not persuade herself that He really had intended\r\nher ruin.  However, Elvira had positively commanded her to drop\r\nhis acquaintance, and She had too much respect for her orders to\r\ndisobey them."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"At length She resolved to address herself for advice and\r\nprotection to the Marquis de las Cisternas, as being her nearest\r\nRelation.  She wrote to him, briefly stating her desolate\r\nsituation; She besought him to compassionate his Brother's Child,\r\nto continue to her Elvira's pension, and to authorise her\r\nretiring to his old Castle in Murcia, which till now had been her\r\nretreat.  Having sealed her letter, She gave it to the trusty\r\nFlora, who immediately set out to execute her commission.  But\r\nAntonia was born under an unlucky Star.  Had She made her\r\napplication to the Marquis but one day sooner, received as his\r\nNiece and placed at the head of his Family, She would have\r\nescaped all the misfortunes with which She was now threatened.\r\nRaymond had always intended to execute this plan:  But first, his\r\nhopes of making the proposal to Elvira through the lips of Agnes,\r\nand afterwards, his disappointment at losing his intended Bride,\r\nas well as the severe illness which for some time had confined\r\nhim to his Bed, made him defer from day to day the giving an\r\nAsylum in his House to his Brother's Widow.  He had commissioned\r\nLorenzo to supply her liberally with money:  But Elvira,\r\nunwilling to receive obligations from that Nobleman, had assured\r\nhim that She needed no immediate pecuniary assistance.\r\nConsequently, the Marquis did not imagine that a trifling delay\r\non his part could create any embarrassment; and the distress and\r\nagitation of his mind might well excuse his negligence."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Had He been informed that Elvira's death had left her Daughter\r\nFriendless and unprotected, He would doubtless have taken such\r\nmeasures, as would have ensured her from every danger:  But\r\nAntonia was not destined to be so fortunate.  The day on which\r\nShe sent her letter to the Palace de las Cisternas was that\r\nfollowing Lorenzo's departure from Madrid.  The Marquis was in\r\nthe first paroxysms of despair at the conviction that Agnes was\r\nindeed no more:  He was delirious, and his life being in danger,\r\nno one was suffered to approach him.  Flora was informed that He\r\nwas incapable of attending to Letters, and that probably a few\r\nhours would decide his fate.  With this unsatisfactory answer She\r\nwas obliged to return to her Mistress, who now found herself\r\nplunged into greater difficulties than ever."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Flora and Dame Jacintha exerted themselves to console her.  The\r\nLatter begged her to make herself easy, for that as long as She\r\nchose to stay with her, She would treat her like her own Child.\r\nAntonia, finding that the good Woman had taken a real affection\r\nfor her, was somewhat comforted by thinking that She had at\r\nleast one Friend in the World.  A Letter was now brought to her,\r\ndirected to Elvira.  She recognized Leonella's writing, and\r\nopening it with joy, found a detailed account of her Aunt's\r\nadventures at Cordova.  She informed her Sister that She had\r\nrecovered her Legacy, had lost her heart, and had received in\r\nexchange that of the most amiable of Apothecaries, past, present,\r\nand to come.  She added that She should be at Madrid on the\r\nTuesday night, and meant to have the pleasure of presenting her\r\nCaro Sposo in form.  Though her nuptials were far from pleasing\r\nAntonia, Leonella's speedy return gave her Niece much delight.\r\nShe rejoiced in thinking that She should once more be under a\r\nRelation's care.  She could not but judge it to be highly\r\nimproper, for a young Woman to be living among absolute\r\nStrangers, with no one to regulate her conduct, or protect her\r\nfrom the insults to which, in her defenceless situation, She was\r\nexposed.

Still, Antonia resolved to sit up\r\ntill her Aunt's arrival, and in spite of all her remonstrances,\r\nDame Jacintha and Flora insisted upon doing the same.  The hours\r\npassed on slow and tediously.  Lorenzo's departure from Madrid\r\nhad put a stop to the nightly Serenades:  She hoped in vain to\r\nhear the usual sound of Guitars beneath her window.  She took up\r\nher own, and struck a few chords: But Music that evening had lost\r\nits charms for her, and She soon replaced the Instrument in its\r\ncase.  She seated herself at her embroidery frame, but nothing\r\nwent right: The silks were missing, the thread snapped every\r\nmoment, and the needles were so expert at falling that they\r\nseemed to be animated.  At length a flake of wax fell from the\r\nTaper which stood near her upon a favourite wreath of Violets:\r\nThis compleatly discomposed her; She threw down her needle, and\r\nquitted the frame.

Accordingly\r\nShe took her Taper from the table, passed through the little\r\nCloset, and entered the adjoining apartment.  As She looked\r\naround her, the sight of this room brought to her recollection a\r\nthousand painful ideas.  It was the first time of her entering it\r\nsince her Mother's death.  The total silence prevailing through\r\nthe chamber, the Bed despoiled of its furniture, the cheerless\r\nhearth where stood an extinguished Lamp, and a few dying Plants\r\nin the window which, since Elvira's loss, had been neglected,\r\ninspired Antonia with a melancholy awe.  The gloom of night gave\r\nstrength to this sensation.  She placed her light upon the Table,\r\nand sank into a large chair, in which She had seen her Mother\r\nseated a thousand and a thousand times.  She was never to see her\r\nseated there again!

She read a few Stanzas of one of them:\r\nThey excited her curiosity.  She took down the Book, and seated\r\nherself to peruse it with more ease.

All in my power to keep clear of such\r\nabomination have I done, and yet that all is too little.  What\r\nsignifies my telling my beads four times a day, and observing\r\nevery fast prescribed by the Calendar?  What signifies my having\r\nmade three Pilgrimages to St. James of Compostella, and purchased\r\nas many pardons from the Pope as would buy off Cain's\r\npunishment?  Nothing prospers with me!  All goes wrong, and God\r\nonly knows, whether any thing will ever go right again!  Why now,\r\nbe your Holiness the Judge.  My Lodger dies in convulsions; Out\r\nof pure kindness I bury her at my own expence; (Not that She is\r\nany Relation of mine, or that I shall be benefited a single\r\npistole by her death:  I got nothing by it, and therefore you\r\nknow, reverend Father, that her living or dying was just the same\r\nto me.

And how do you think the Lady repays me for\r\nmy kindness?  Why truly by refusing to sleep quietly in her\r\ncomfortable deal Coffin, as a peaceable well-disposed Spirit\r\nought to do, and coming to plague me, who never wish to set eyes\r\non her again.  Forsooth, it well becomes her to go racketing\r\nabout my House at midnight, popping into her Daughter's room\r\nthrough the Keyhole, and frightening the poor Child out of her\r\nwits!  Though She be a Ghost, She might be more civil than to\r\nbolt into a Person's House, who likes her company so little.  But\r\nas for me, reverend Father, the plain state of the case is this:\r\nIf She walks into my House, I must walk out of it, for I cannot\r\nabide such Visitors, not I!  Thus you see, your Sanctity, that\r\nwithout your assistance I am ruined and undone for ever.  I shall\r\nbe obliged to quit my House; Nobody will take it, when 'tis known\r\nthat She haunts it, and then I shall find myself in a fine\r\nsituation!  Miserable Woman that I am!  What shall I do!

Done\r\nto a turn, for I superintended the cooking of it myself: It was\r\na little Gallician of my own raising, may it please your\r\nHoliness, and the flesh was as white as an egg-shell, as indeed\r\nDonna Elvira told me herself.

Jacintha was obstinate:  She\r\nwas not to be convinced, and pressed him so urgently not to leave\r\nher a prey to the Devil, that at length He granted her request.\r\nAll this show of resistance imposed not upon Flora, who was\r\nnaturally of a suspicious temper.  She suspected the Monk to be\r\nacting a part very contrary to his own inclinations, and that He\r\nwished for no better than to remain where He was.

But instead of showing that He perceived her\r\nsuspicions; He replied mildly that He approved the Duenna's\r\nprecautions, and advised her to persevere in her intention.\r\nThis, She assured him faithfully that He might depend upon her\r\ndoing.

He bolted the door, placed the light\r\nupon the Table, and seated himself in the Chair which on the\r\nformer night had sustained Antonia.  In spite of Matilda's\r\nassurances that the Spectre was a mere creation of fancy, his\r\nmind was impressed with a certain mysterious horror.  He in vain\r\nendeavoured to shake it off.  The silence of the night, the story\r\nof the Apparition, the chamber wainscotted with dark oak\r\npannells, the recollection which it brought with it of the\r\nmurdered Elvira, and his incertitude respecting the nature of the\r\ndrops given by him to Antonia, made him feel uneasy at his\r\npresent situation.  But He thought much less of the Spectre, than\r\nof the poison.  Should He have destroyed the only object which\r\nrendered life dear to him; Should the Ghost's prediction prove\r\ntrue; Should Antonia in three days be no more, and He the\r\nwretched cause of her death . . . . . . The supposition was too\r\nhorrible to dwell upon.  He drove away these dreadful images, and\r\nas often they presented themselves again before him.  Matilda had\r\nassured him that the effects of the Opiate would be speedy.  He\r\nlistened with fear, yet with eagerness, expecting to hear some\r\ndisturbance in the adjoining chamber.  All was still silent.  He\r\nconcluded that the drops had not begun to operate.  Great was\r\nthe stake, for which He now played:  A moment would suffice to\r\ndecide upon his misery or happiness.  Matilda had taught him the\r\nmeans of ascertaining that life was not extinct for ever:  Upon\r\nthis assay depended all his hopes.  With every instant his\r\nimpatience redoubled; His terrors grew more lively, his anxiety\r\nmore awake.  Unable to bear this state of incertitude, He\r\nendeavoured to divert it by substituting the thoughts of Others\r\nto his own.  The Books, as was before mentioned, were ranged upon\r\nshelves near the Table: This stood exactly opposite to the Bed,\r\nwhich was placed in an Alcove near the Closet door.  Ambrosio\r\ntook down a Volume, and seated himself by the Table:  But his\r\nattention wandered from the Pages before him.  Antonia's image\r\nand that of the murdered Elvira persisted to force themselves\r\nbefore his imagination.  Still He continued to read, though his\r\neyes ran over the characters without his mind being conscious of\r\ntheir import. Such was his occupation, when He fancied that He\r\nheard a footstep.

He\r\nhastened to raise her from the ground, and besought her to take\r\ncourage.  He promised to protect her from the Rioters, assured\r\nher that her retreat was still a secret, and that She might\r\ndepend upon his readiness to defend her to the last drop of his\r\nblood.  During this conversation, the Nuns had thrown themselves\r\ninto various attitudes:  One knelt, and addressed herself to\r\nheaven; Another hid her face in the lap of her Neighbour; Some\r\nlistened motionless with fear to the discourse of the supposed\r\nAssassin; while Others embraced the Statue of St. Clare, and\r\nimplored her protection with frantic cries.  On perceiving their\r\nmistake, they crowded round Lorenzo and heaped benedictions on\r\nhim by dozens.  He found that, on hearing the threats of the Mob,\r\nand terrified by the cruelties which from the Convent Towers\r\nthey had seen inflicted on the Superior, many of the Pensioners\r\nand Nuns had taken refuge in the Sepulchre.  Among the former was\r\nto be reckoned the lovely Virginia.  Nearly related to the\r\nPrioress, She had more reason than the rest to dread the Rioters,\r\nand now besought Lorenzo earnestly not to abandon her to their\r\nrage.  Her Companions, most of whom were Women of noble family,\r\nmade the same request, which He readily granted.  He promised not\r\nto quit them, till He had seen each of them safe in the arms of\r\nher Relations:  But He advised their deferring to quit the\r\nSepulchre for some time longer, when the popular fury should be\r\nsomewhat calmed, and the arrival of military force have dispersed\r\nthe multitude."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"'Would to God!' cried Virginia, 'That I were already safe in my\r\nMother's embraces!

To be in this melancholy\r\nplace in the middle of night, surrounded by the mouldering bodies\r\nof my deceased Companions, and expecting every moment to be torn\r\nin pieces by their Ghosts who wander about me, and complain, and\r\ngroan, and wail in accents that make my blood run cold, . . . . .\r\n.

The noise\r\nseemed to come from the midst of the small Vault in which He and\r\nthe Nuns then were, and which a multitude of passages branching\r\nout in various directions, formed into a sort of Star.  Lorenzo's\r\ncuriosity which was ever awake, made him anxious to solve this\r\nmystery.  He desired that silence might be kept.  The Nuns obeyed\r\nhim.  All was hushed, till the general stillness was again\r\ndisturbed by the groaning, which was repeated several times\r\nsuccessively.

Not having equal faith in the miraculous Saint,\r\nLorenzo did not think this solution of the mystery quite so\r\nsatisfactory, as the Nuns, who subscribed to it without\r\nhesitation.

In what?' replied Helena, ever eager to relate a\r\nmiraculous adventure; 'If you had only heard the hundredth part\r\nof those marvellous Stories about this Statue which the Domina\r\nused to recount!  She assured us often and often, that if we only\r\ndared to lay a finger upon it, we might expect the most fatal\r\nconsequences. Among other things She told us that a Robber\r\nhaving entered these Vaults by night, He observed yonder Ruby,\r\nwhose value is inestimable.  Do you see it, Segnor?  It sparkles\r\nupon the third finger of the hand, in which She holds a crown of\r\nThorns.  This Jewel naturally excited the Villain's cupidity.  He\r\nresolved to make himself Master of it.  For this purpose He\r\nascended the Pedestal:  He supported himself by grasping the\r\nSaint's right arm, and extended his own towards the Ring.  What\r\nwas his surprize, when He saw the Statue's hand raised in a\r\nposture of menace, and heard her lips pronounce his eternal\r\nperdition!  Penetrated with awe and consternation, He desisted\r\nfrom his attempt, and prepared to quit the Sepulchre.  In this He\r\nalso failed.  Flight was denied him.  He found it impossible to\r\ndisengage the hand, which rested upon the right arm of the\r\nStatue.  In vain did He struggle:  He remained fixed to the\r\nImage, till the insupportable and fiery anguish which darted\r\nitself through his veins, compelled his shrieking for assistance."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The Sepulchre was now filled with Spectators.

Now I\r\nthink of it, those which we have just heard, may very possibly\r\nhave been uttered by the Ghost of this Sinner: But of this I will\r\nnot be positive.  All that I can say is, that since that time no\r\none has ever dared to touch the Statue:  Then do not be\r\nfoolhardy, good Segnor!

This proof, as they imagined, must\r\nconvince him. It was very far from doing so; and they were\r\ngreatly scandalized when he declared his suspicion that the\r\ndried and shrivelled fingers had been placed there by order of\r\nthe Prioress.  In spite of their prayers and threats He\r\napproached the Statue.  He sprang over the iron Rails which\r\ndefended it, and the Saint underwent a thorough examination.\r\nThe Image at first appeared to be of Stone, but proved on further\r\ninspection to be formed of no more solid materials than coloured\r\nWood.  He shook it, and attempted to move it; But it appeared to\r\nbe of a piece with the Base which it stood upon.  He examined it\r\nover and over:  Still no clue guided him to the solution of this\r\nmystery, for which the Nuns were become equally solicitous, when\r\nthey saw that He touched the Statue with impunity.  He paused,\r\nand listened:  The groans were repeated at intervals, and He was\r\nconvinced of being in the spot nearest to them.  He mused upon\r\nthis singular event, and ran over the Statue with enquiring eyes.\r\nSuddenly they rested upon the shrivelled hand.  It struck him,\r\nthat so particular an injunction was not given without cause, not\r\nto touch the arm of the Image.  He again ascended the Pedestal;\r\nHe examined the object of his attention, and discovered a small\r\nknob of iron concealed between the Saint's shoulder and what was\r\nsupposed to have been the hand of the Robber.  This observation\r\ndelighted him.  He applied his fingers to the knob, and pressed\r\nit down forcibly.  Immediately a rumbling noise was heard within\r\nthe Statue, as if a chain tightly stretched was flying back.\r\nStartled at the sound the timid Nuns started away, prepared to\r\nhasten from the Vault at the first appearance of danger.  All\r\nremaining quiet and still, they again gathered round Lorenzo, and\r\nbeheld his proceedings with anxious curiosity."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Finding that nothing followed this discovery, He descended.  As\r\nHe took his hand from the Saint, She trembled beneath his touch.\r\nThis created new terrors in the Spectators, who believed the\r\nStatue to be animated.  Lorenzo's ideas upon the subject were\r\nwidely different. He easily comprehended that the noise which He\r\nhad heard, was occasioned by his having loosened a chain which\r\nattached the Image to its Pedestal.  He once more attempted to\r\nmove it, and succeeded without much exertion.  He placed it upon\r\nthe ground, and then perceived the Pedestal to be hollow, and\r\ncovered at the opening with an heavy iron grate."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This excited such general curiosity that the Sisters forgot both\r\ntheir real and imaginary dangers.  Lorenzo proceeded to raise the\r\nGrate, in which the Nuns assisted him to the utmost of their\r\nstrength.  The attempt was accomplished with little difficulty.\r\nA deep abyss now presented itself before them, whose thick\r\nobscurity the eye strove in vain to pierce.  The rays of the Lamp\r\nwere too feeble to be of much assistance.  Nothing was\r\ndiscernible, save a flight of rough unshapen steps which sank\r\ninto the yawning Gulph and were soon lost in darkness.  The\r\ngroans were heard no more; But All believed them to have ascended\r\nfrom this Cavern.  As He bent over it, Lorenzo fancied that He\r\ndistinguished something bright twinkling through the gloom.  He\r\ngazed attentively upon the spot where it showed itself, and was\r\nconvinced that He saw a small spark of light, now visible, now\r\ndisappearing.  He communicated this circumstance to the Nuns:\r\nThey also perceived the spark; But when He declared his intention\r\nto descend into the Cave, they united to oppose his resolution.\r\nAll their remonstrances could not prevail on him to alter it.\r\nNone of them had courage enough to accompany him; neither could\r\nHe think of depriving them of the Lamp.

This He was several\r\ntimes on the point of doing.  However, He arrived sooner upon\r\nsolid ground than He had expected:  He now found that the thick\r\ndarkness and impenetrable mists which reigned through the Cavern\r\nhad deceived him into the belief of its being much more profound\r\nthan it proved upon inspection.  He reached the foot of the\r\nStairs unhurt:  He now stopped, and looked round for the spark\r\nwhich had before caught his attention.  He sought it in vain: All\r\nwas dark and gloomy.  He listened for the groans; But his ear\r\ncaught no sound, except the distant murmur of the Nuns above, as\r\nin low voices they repeated their Ave-Marias.  He stood\r\nirresolute to which side He should address his steps.  At all\r\nevents He determined to proceed:  He did so, but slowly, fearing\r\nlest instead of approaching, He should be retiring from the\r\nobject of his search.  The groans seemed to announce one in pain,\r\nor at least in sorrow, and He hoped to have the power of\r\nrelieving the Mourner's calamities.  A plaintive tone, sounding\r\nat no great distance, at length reached his hearing; He bent his\r\ncourse joyfully towards it.  It became more audible as He\r\nadvanced; and He soon beheld again the spark of light, which a\r\nlow projecting Wall had hitherto concealed from him."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"It proceeded from a small Lamp which was placed upon an heap of\r\nstones, and whose faint and melancholy rays served rather to\r\npoint out, than dispell the horrors of a narrow gloomy dungeon\r\nformed in one side of the Cavern; It also showed several other\r\nrecesses of similar construction, but whose depth was buried in\r\nobscurity.  Coldly played the light upon the damp walls, whose\r\ndew-stained surface gave back a feeble reflection.  A thick and\r\npestilential fog clouded the height of the vaulted dungeon.  As\r\nLorenzo advanced, He felt a piercing chillness spread itself\r\nthrough his veins.  The frequent groans still engaged him to move\r\nforwards.  He turned towards them, and by the Lamp's glimmering\r\nbeams beheld in a corner of this loathsome abode, a Creature\r\nstretched upon a bed of straw, so wretched, so emaciated, so\r\npale, that He doubted to think her Woman.

She supported the\r\nSufferer's head upon her knees, bathing her temples with\r\nrose-water, chafing her cold hands, and sprinkling her face with\r\ntears which were drawn from her by compassion.  The Strangers\r\napproaching nearer, Lorenzo was enabled to dispel the fears of\r\nthe Suppliants.  His name, pronounced by a number of voices among\r\nwhich He distinguished the Duke's, pealed along the Vaults, and\r\nconvinced him that He was the object of their search.  He\r\ncommunicated this intelligence to the Nuns, who received it with\r\nrapture.  A few moments after confirmed his idea.  Don Ramirez,\r\nas well as the Duke, appeared, followed by Attendants with\r\nTorches.  They had been seeking him through the Vaults, in order\r\nto let him know that the Mob was dispersed, and the riot entirely\r\nover.  Lorenzo recounted briefly his adventure in the Cavern, and\r\nexplained how much the Unknown was in want of medical\r\nassistance.

In truth, She made\r\nthis promise more from consideration for herself than for either\r\nLorenzo or the Captive.  She had witnessed his politeness,\r\ngentleness, and intrepidity with sensible emotion.  She wished\r\nearnestly to preserve his acquaintance; and in addition to the\r\nsentiments of pity which the Prisoner excited, She hoped that her\r\nattention to this Unfortunate would raise her a degree in the\r\nesteem of Lorenzo.  She had no occasion to trouble herself upon\r\nthis head.  The kindness already displayed by her and the tender\r\nconcern which She had shown for the Sufferer had gained her an\r\nexalted place in his good graces.  While occupied in alleviating\r\nthe Captive's sorrows, the nature of her employment adorned her\r\nwith new charms, and rendered her beauty a thousand times more\r\ninteresting.  Lorenzo viewed her with admiration and delight:  He\r\nconsidered her as a ministering Angel descended to the aid of\r\nafflicted innocence; nor could his heart have resisted her\r\nattractions, had it not been steeled by the remembrance of\r\nAntonia."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The Duke now conveyed the Nuns in safety to the Dwellings of\r\ntheir respective Friends.

Lorenzo and Don Ramirez still remained in\r\nthe Sepulchre.  After deliberating upon their proceedings, it was\r\nresolved that to prevent losing time, the Archers should be\r\ndivided into two Bodies:  That with one Don Ramirez should\r\nexamine the cavern, while Lorenzo with the other might penetrate\r\ninto the further Vaults.  This being arranged, and his Followers\r\nbeing provided with Torches, Don Ramirez advanced to the Cavern.\r\nHe had already descended some steps when He heard People\r\napproaching hastily from the interior part of the Sepulchre.\r\nThis surprized him, and He quitted the Cave precipitately."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"'Do you hear footsteps?' said Lorenzo; 'Let us bend our course\r\ntowards them.

Antonia had drank the opiate, was\r\nburied in the vaults of St. Clare, and absolutely in his\r\ndisposal.  Matilda, who was well acquainted with the nature and\r\neffects of the soporific medicine, had computed that it would not\r\ncease to operate till one in the Morning.

The affection which She\r\nhad ever exprest for him, warranted this persuasion:  But He\r\nresolved that should She prove obstinate, no consideration\r\nwhatever should prevent him from enjoying her.  Secure from a\r\ndiscovery, He shuddered not at the idea of employing force:  If\r\nHe felt any repugnance, it arose not from a principle of shame\r\nor compassion, but from his feeling for Antonia the most sincere\r\nand ardent affection, and wishing to owe her favours to no one\r\nbut herself."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The Monks quitted the Abbey at midnight.

He\r\ndeclared himself sincerely penitent, and that He would gladly\r\nshed a drop of his blood, for every tear which his barbarity had\r\nforced from her.  Wretched and hopeless, Antonia listened to him\r\nin silent grief:  But when He announced her confinement in the\r\nSepulchre, that dreadful doom to which even death seemed\r\npreferable roused her from her insensibility at once.  To linger\r\nout a life of misery in a narrow loathsome Cell, known to exist\r\nby no human Being save her Ravisher, surrounded by mouldering\r\nCorses, breathing the pestilential air of corruption, never more\r\nto behold the light, or drink the pure gale of heaven, the idea\r\nwas more terrible than She could support. It conquered even her\r\nabhorrence of the Friar. Again She sank upon her knees:  She\r\nbesought his compassion in terms the most pathetic and urgent.\r\nShe promised, would He but restore her to liberty, to conceal her\r\ninjuries from the world; to assign any reason for her\r\nreappearance which He might judge proper; and in order to\r\nprevent the least suspicion from falling upon him, She offered to\r\nquit Madrid immediately.  Her entreaties were so urgent as to\r\nmake a considerable impression upon the Monk.  He reflected that\r\nas her person no longer excited his desires, He had no interest\r\nin keeping her concealed as He had at first intended; that He was\r\nadding a fresh injury to those which She had already suffered;\r\nand that if She adhered to her promises, whether She was confined\r\nor at liberty, his life and reputation were equally secure.  On\r\nthe other hand, He trembled lest in her affliction Antonia should\r\nunintentionally break her engagement; or that her excessive\r\nsimplicity and ignorance of deceit should permit some one more\r\nartful to surprize her secret.  However well-founded were these\r\napprehensions, compassion, and a sincere wish to repair his fault\r\nas much as possible solicited his complying with the prayers of\r\nhis Suppliant.  The difficulty of colouring Antonia's unexpected\r\nreturn to life, after her supposed death and public interment,\r\nwas the only point which kept him irresolute.  He was still\r\npondering on the means of removing this obstacle, when He heard\r\nthe sound of feet approaching with precipitation.

Aiding myself by the irregularity of the Walls some of\r\nwhose stones projected beyond the rest, I contrived to ascend\r\nthem, and drag myself out of my prison.

Several Tombs, similar in appearance\r\nto that whence I had just escaped, were ranged along the sides in\r\norder, and seemed to be considerably sunk within the earth.  A\r\nsepulchral Lamp was suspended from the roof by an iron chain, and\r\nshed a gloomy light through the dungeon.  Emblems of Death were\r\nseen on every side:  Skulls, shoulder-blades, thigh-bones, and\r\nother leavings of Mortality were scattered upon the dewy ground.\r\nEach Tomb was ornamented with a large Crucifix, and in one corner\r\nstood a wooden Statue of St. Clare.  To these objects I at first\r\npaid no attention:  A Door, the only outlet from the Vault, had\r\nattracted my eyes.  I hastened towards it, having wrapped my\r\nwinding-sheet closely round me.

From this I concluded that\r\nbeing to all appearance dead I had received the rites of burial;\r\nand that deprived of the power of making my existence known, it\r\nwould be my fate to expire of hunger.  This idea penetrated me\r\nwith horror, not merely for my own sake, but that of the innocent\r\nCreature, who still lived within my bosom.  I again endeavoured\r\nto open the door, but it resisted all my efforts.  I stretched my\r\nvoice to the extent of its compass, and shrieked for aid:  I was\r\nremote from the hearing of every one:  No friendly voice replied\r\nto mine.  A profound and melancholy silence prevailed through the\r\nVault, and I despaired of liberty.  My long abstinence from food\r\nnow began to torment me.  The tortures which hunger inflicted on\r\nme, were the most painful and insupportable: Yet they seemed to\r\nincrease with every hour which past over my head.  Sometimes I\r\nthrew myself upon the ground, and rolled upon it wild and\r\ndesperate:  Sometimes starting up, I returned to the door, again\r\nstrove to force it open, and repeated my fruitless cries for\r\nsuccour. Often was I on the point of striking my temple against\r\nthe sharp corner of some Monument, dashing out my brains, and\r\nthus terminating my woes at once; But still the remembrance of my\r\nBaby vanquished my resolution: I trembled at a deed which\r\nequally endangered my Child's existence and my own.  Then would I\r\nvent my anguish in loud exclamations and passionate complaints;\r\nand then again my strength failing me, silent and hopeless I\r\nwould sit me down upon the base of St. Clare's Statue, fold my\r\narms, and abandon myself to sullen despair.  Thus passed several\r\nwretched hours.  Death advanced towards me with rapid strides,\r\nand I expected that every succeeding moment would be that of my\r\ndissolution.  Suddenly a neighbouring Tomb caught my eye:  A\r\nBasket stood upon it, which till then I had not observed.  I\r\nstarted from my seat:  I made towards it as swiftly as my\r\nexhausted frame would permit.

Hope answered my doubts in the\r\naffirmative.  Yet who could guess me to be in need of such\r\nassistance?  If my existence was known, why was I detained in\r\nthis gloomy Vault?  If I was kept a Prisoner, what meant the\r\nceremony of committing me to the Tomb?  Or if I was doomed to\r\nperish with hunger, to whose pity was I indebted for provisions\r\nplaced within my reach?  A Friend would not have kept my dreadful\r\npunishment a secret; Neither did it seem probable that an Enemy\r\nwould have taken pains to supply me with the means of existence.\r\nUpon the whole I was inclined to think that the Domina's designs\r\nupon my life had been discovered by some one of my Partizans in\r\nthe Convent, who had found means to substitute an opiate for\r\npoison: That She had furnished me with food to support me, till\r\nShe could effect my delivery:  And that She was then employed in\r\ngiving intelligence to my Relations of my danger, and pointing\r\nout a way to release me from captivity.  Yet why then was the\r\nquality of my provisions so coarse?  How could my Friend have\r\nentered the Vault without the Domina's knowledge?

Headlong\r\nfell the Monk through the airy waste; The sharp point of a rock\r\nreceived him; and He rolled from precipice to precipice, till\r\nbruised and mangled He rested on the river's banks.  Life still\r\nexisted in his miserable frame: He attempted in vain to raise\r\nhimself; His broken and dislocated limbs refused to perform their\r\noffice, nor was He able to quit the spot where He had first\r\nfallen.  The Sun now rose above the horizon; Its scorching beams\r\ndarted full upon the head of the expiring Sinner.  Myriads of\r\ninsects were called forth by the warmth; They drank the blood\r\nwhich trickled from Ambrosio's wounds; He had no power to drive\r\nthem from him, and they fastened upon his sores, darted their\r\nstings into his body, covered him with their multitudes, and\r\ninflicted on him tortures the most exquisite and insupportable.\r\nThe Eagles of the rock tore his flesh piecemeal, and dug out his\r\neyeballs with their crooked beaks.  A burning thirst tormented\r\nhim; He heard the river's murmur as it rolled beside him, but\r\nstrove in vain to drag himself towards the sound.  Blind, maimed,\r\nhelpless, and despairing, venting his rage in blasphemy and\r\ncurses, execrating his existence, yet dreading the arrival of\r\ndeath destined to yield him up to greater torments, six miserable\r\ndays did the Villain languish.  On the Seventh a violent storm\r\narose: The winds in fury rent up rocks and forests:  The sky was\r\nnow black with clouds, now sheeted with fire:  The rain fell in\r\ntorrents; It swelled the stream; The waves overflowed their\r\nbanks; They reached the spot where Ambrosio lay, and when they\r\nabated carried with them into the river the Corse of the\r\ndespairing Monk."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"End XFIR\ufffd\x17MZ\ufffd"})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,o.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>i,x:()=>s});var r=t(96540);const o={},a=r.createContext(o);function i(e){const n=r.useContext(a);return r.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:i(e.components),r.createElement(a.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
