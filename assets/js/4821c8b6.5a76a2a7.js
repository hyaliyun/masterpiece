I have lent a Chinaman money, taking his father\'s corpse as a\r\npledge, slept in an Arab\'s tent on the security of his bare word,\r\nsigned contracts in every capital of Europe, and left my gold without\r\nhesitation in savage wigwams.

Thought is a key to all treasures; the\r\nmiser\'s gains are ours without his cares. Thus I have soared above\r\nthis world, where my enjoyments have been intellectual joys.

I have\r\nwalked to and fro in the world as in a garden round about my own\r\ndwelling. Troubles, loves, ambitions, losses, and sorrows, as men call\r\nthem, are for me ideas, which I transmute into waking dreams; I\r\nexpress and transpose instead of feeling them; instead of permitting\r\nthem to prey upon my life, I dramatize and expand them; I divert\r\nmyself with them as if they were romances which I could read by the\r\npower of vision within me.

My relaxations were lawsuits, and memorials still furnished the\r\nstaple of my conversation. Hitherto my life had been blameless, from\r\nthe sheer impossibility of indulging the desires of youth; but now I\r\nbecame my own master, and in dread of involving us both in ruin by\r\nsome piece of negligence, I did not dare to allow myself any pleasure\r\nor expenditure."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"\"While we are young, and before the world has rubbed off the delicate\r\nbloom from our sentiments, the freshness of our impressions, the noble\r\npurity of conscience which will never allow us to palter with evil,\r\nthe sense of duty is very strong within us, the voice of honor clamors\r\nwithin us, and we are open and straightforward.

He\r\ncannot spare the time from his work, and how can he afford to humble\r\nhimself and go a-masquerading! I was ready to give my life once and\r\nfor all, but I could not degrade it in detail. Besides, there is\r\nsomething indescribably paltry in a stockbroker's tactics, who runs on\r\nerrands for some insipid affected woman; all this disgusts an artist.\r\nLove in the abstract is not enough for a great man in poverty; he has\r\nneed of its utmost devotion.

It seemed to divert her to be told that the human\r\nwill was a material force like steam; that in the moral world nothing\r\ncould resist its power if a man taught himself to concentrate it, to\r\neconomize it, and to project continually its fluid mass in given\r\ndirections upon other souls. Such a man, I said, could modify all\r\nthings relatively to man, even the peremptory laws of nature. The\r\nquestions Foedora raised showed a certain keenness of intellect.

The countess sat in silence for a\r\nmoment when I told her that our ideas were complete organic beings,\r\nexisting in an invisible world, and influencing our destinies; and for\r\nwitnesses I cited the opinions of Descartes, Diderot, and Napoleon,\r\nwho had directed, and still directed, all the currents of the age.'}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"So I had the honor of amusing this woman; who asked me to come to see\r\nher when she left me; giving me les grande entrees, in the language of\r\nthe court. Whether it was by dint of substituting polite formulas for\r\ngenuine expressions of feeling, a commendable habit of mine, or\r\nbecause Foedora hailed in me a coming celebrity, an addition to her\r\nlearned menagerie; for some reason I thought that I had pleased her. I\r\ncalled all my previous physiological studies and knowledge of woman to\r\nmy aid, and minutely scrutinized this singular person and her ways all\r\nevening. I concealed myself in the embrasure of a window, and sought\r\nto discover her thoughts from her bearing. I studied the tactics of\r\nthe mistress of the house, as she came and went, sat and chatted,\r\nbeckoned to this one or that, asked questions, listened to the\r\nanswers, as she leaned against the frame of the door; I detected a\r\nlanguid charm in her movements, a grace in the flutterings of her\r\ndress, remarked the nature of the feelings she so powerfully excited,\r\nand became very incredulous as to her virtue. If Foedora would none of\r\nlove to-day, she had had strong passions at some time; past experience\r\nof pleasure showed itself in the attitudes she chose in conversation,\r\nin her coquettish way of leaning against the panel behind her; she\r\nseemed scarcely able to stand alone, and yet ready for flight from too\r\nbold a glance. There was a kind of eloquence about her lightly folded\r\narms, which, even for benevolent eyes, breathed sentiment. Her fresh\r\nred lips sharply contrasted with her brilliantly pale complexion. Her\r\nbrown hair brought out all the golden color in her eyes, in which blue\r\nstreaks mingled as in Florentine marble; their expression seemed to\r\nincrease the significance of her words. A studied grace lay in the\r\ncharms of her bodice. Perhaps a rival might have found the lines of\r\nthe thick eyebrows, which almost met, a little hard; or found a fault\r\nin the almost invisible down that covered her features. I saw the\r\nsigns of passion everywhere, written on those Italian eyelids, on the\r\nsplendid shoulders worthy of the Venus of Milo, on her features, in\r\nthe darker shade of down above a somewhat thick under-lip. She was not\r\nmerely a woman, but a romance. The whole blended harmony of lines, the\r\nfeminine luxuriance of her frame, and its passionate promise, were\r\nsubdued by a constant inexplicable reserve and modesty at variance\r\nwith everything else about her. It needed an observation as keen as my\r\nown to detect such signs as these in her character. To explain myself\r\nmore clearly; there were two women in Foedora, divided perhaps by the\r\nline between head and body: the one, the head alone, seemed to be\r\nsusceptible, and the other phlegmatic.

This axiom is as deeply engraved on\r\nthe heart of woman as in the minds of kings. In Raphael, therefore,\r\nFoedora saw the deathblow of her influence and her ability to please.\r\nAn epigram of his, made at the Opera the day before, was already known\r\nin the salons of Paris. The biting edge of that terrible speech had\r\nalready given the Countess an incurable wound. We know how to\r\ncauterize a wound, but we know of no treatment as yet for the stab of\r\na phrase. As every other woman in the house looked by turns at her and\r\nat the Marquis, Foedora would have consigned them all to the\r\noubliettes of some Bastille; for in spite of her capacity for\r\ndissimulation, her discomfiture was discerned by her rivals.

The lace and tulle that\r\ncaressed him imparted the delicious warmth of her bare, white\r\nshoulders. By a freak in the ordering of things, these two creatures,\r\nkept apart by social conventions, with the abysses of death between\r\nthem, breathed together and perhaps thought of one another. Finally,\r\nthe subtle perfume of aloes completed the work of Raphael's\r\nintoxication. Opposition heated his imagination, and his fancy, become\r\nthe wilder for the limits imposed upon it, sketched a woman for him in\r\noutlines of fire.

The surfaces of the rustic wooden\r\nfurniture shone with cleanliness. A kitten, attracted by the odor of\r\nmilk, had established itself upon the table; it allowed Pauline to\r\nbedabble it in coffee; she was playing merrily with it, taking away\r\nthe cream that she had just allowed the kitten to sniff at, so as to\r\nexercise its patience, and keep up the contest.

It was\r\npleasant to see her in this negligent dress; she was delightful as\r\nsome fanciful picture by Westall; half-girl, half-woman, as she seemed\r\nto be, or perhaps more of a girl than a woman, there was no alloy in\r\nthe happiness she enjoyed, and of love she knew as yet only its first\r\necstasy. When Raphael, absorbed in happy musing, had forgotten the\r\nexistence of the newspaper, Pauline flew upon it, crumpled it up into\r\na ball, and threw it out into the garden; the kitten sprang after the\r\nrotating object, which spun round and round, as politics are wont to\r\ndo.

Its\r\npowers of sight vie in precision and accuracy with those of man; it is\r\nrather larger than our largest domestic donkeys, and is possessed of\r\nextraordinary courage. If it is surprised by any chance, it defends\r\nitself against the most dangerous wild beasts with remarkable success;\r\nthe rapidity of its movements can only be compared with the flight of\r\nbirds; an onager, sir, would run the best Arab or Persian horses to\r\ndeath. According to the father of the conscientious Doctor Niebuhr,\r\nwhose recent loss we are deploring, as you doubtless know, the\r\nordinary average pace of one of these wonderful creatures would be\r\nseven thousand geometric feet per hour. Our own degenerate race of\r\ndonkeys can give no idea of the ass in his pride and independence.

A tame onager, in short, is worth an enormous amount; it is\r\nwell-nigh impossible to catch them among the mountains, where they\r\nleap like roebucks, and seem as if they could fly like birds. Our myth\r\nof the winged horse, our Pegasus, had its origin doubtless in these\r\ncountries, where the shepherds could see the onager springing from one\r\nrock to another. In Persia they breed asses for the saddle, a cross\r\nbetween a tamed onager and a she-ass, and they paint them red,\r\nfollowing immemorial tradition. Perhaps it was this custom that gave\r\nrise to our own proverb, 'Surely as a red donkey.'

A\r\nmysterious artist comes and adapts that flame to his own ends; by a\r\nsecret of his own he draws a visionary face in the midst of those\r\nflaming violet and crimson hues, a face with unimaginable delicate\r\noutlines, a fleeting apparition which no chance will ever bring back\r\nagain. It is a woman\'s face, her hair is blown back by the wind, her\r\nfeatures speak of a rapture of delight; she breathes fire in the midst\r\nof the fire. She smiles, she dies, you will never see her any more.\r\nFarewell, flower of the flame! Farewell, essence incomplete and\r\nunforeseen, come too early or too late to make the spark of some\r\nglorious diamond."'}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"But, Pauline?"'}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"You do not see, then? I will begin again. Make way! make way! She\r\ncomes, she is here, the queen of illusions, a woman fleeting as a\r\nkiss, a woman bright as lightning, issuing in a blaze like lightning\r\nfrom the sky, a being uncreated, of spirit and love alone. She has\r\nwrapped her shadowy form in flame, or perhaps the flame betokens that\r\nshe exists but for a moment. The pure outlines of her shape tell you\r\nthat she comes from heaven. Is she not radiant as an angel? Can you\r\nnot hear the beating of her wings in space? She sinks down beside you\r\nmore lightly than a bird, and you are entranced by her awful eyes;\r\nthere is a magical power in her light breathing that draws your lips\r\nto hers; she flies and you follow; you feel the earth beneath you no\r\nlonger. If you could but once touch that form of snow with your eager,\r\ndeluded hands, once twine the golden hair round your fingers, place\r\none kiss on those shining eyes! There is an intoxicating vapor around,\r\nand the spell of a siren music is upon you. Every nerve in you is\r\nquivering; you are filled with pain and longing. O joy for which there\r\nis no name! You have touched the woman\'s lips, and you are awakened at\r\nonce by a horrible pang. Oh! ah! yes, you have struck your head\r\nagainst the corner of the bedpost, you have been clasping its brown\r\nmahogany sides, and chilly gilt ornaments; embracing a piece of metal,\r\na brazen Cupid."'}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"But how about Pauline, sir?"'}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"\"What, again? Listen. One lovely morning at Tours a young man, who\r\nheld the hand of a pretty woman in his, went on board the Ville\r\nd'Angers.

This translucent form was a sylph or a naiad by turns;\r\nshe hovered in the air like a word that haunts the memory, which seeks\r\nin vain to grasp it; she glided among the islands, she nodded her head\r\nhere and there among the tall poplar trees; then she grew to a giant's\r\nheight; she shook out the countless folds of her drapery to the light;\r\nshe shot light from the aureole that the sun had litten about her\r\nface; she hovered above the slopes of the hills and their little\r\nhamlets, and seemed to bar the passage of the boat before the Chateau\r\nd'Usse.
