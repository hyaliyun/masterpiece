I may as well say that it is Rodney Ropes.  I live near him, and last evening I saw him carry a bundle to his room when he went back from the store.  I think if you would send round today when he is out, you would find in his room one or more of the stolen articles.  I don't want to get him into trouble, but I don't like to see you robbed, and so I tell you what I know.

Well, after a time it was ascertained that articles were missing, and search was made for the thief.
