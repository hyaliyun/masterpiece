When I\r\nwas a young married woman, going about the slums of New York with my husband, I\r\nused to come home and look at my two babies as they lay in their little cots,\r\nand say to him, \'What are we going to do to keep these children from selfishness\r\nthe curse of the world?\''}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"'Get them to do something for somebody outside themselves,' he always said. And\r\nI have tried to act on that principle. Laura is naturally unselfish. With her\r\ntiny, baby fingers, she would take food from her own mouth and put it into\r\nJack's, if we did not watch her. I have never had any trouble with her. But the\r\nboys were born selfish, tiresomely, disgustingly selfish. They were good boys in\r\nmany ways. As they grew older they were respectful, obedient, they were not\r\nuntidy, and not particularly rough, but their one thought was for themselves\r\neach one for himself, and they used to quarrel with each other in regard to\r\ntheir rights. While we were in New York, we had only a small, back yard. When we\r\ncame here, I said, 'I am going to try an experiment.' We got this house because\r\nit had a large garden, and a stable that would do for the boys to play in. Then\r\nI got them together, and had a little serious talk. I said I was not pleased\r\nwith the way in which they were living. They did nothing for any one but\r\nthemselves from morning to night. If I asked them to do an errand for me, it was\r\ndone unwillingly. Of course, I knew they had their school for a part of the day,\r\nbut they had a good deal of leisure time when they might do something for some\r\none else. I asked them if they thought they were going to make real, manly\r\nChristian boys at this rate, and they said no. Then I asked them what we should\r\ndo about it. They all said, 'You tell us mother, and we'll do as you say.' I\r\nproposed a series of tasks. Each one to do something for somebody, outside and\r\napart from himself, every day of his life. They all agreed to this, and told me\r\nto allot the tasks. If I could have afforded it, I would have gotten a horse and\r\ncow, and had them take charge of them; but I could not do that, so I invested in\r\na pair of rabbits for Jack, a pair of canaries for Carl, pigeons for Ned, and\r\nbantams for Willie. I brought these creatures home, put them into their hands,\r\nand told them to provide for them. They were delighted with my choice, and it\r\nwas very amusing to see them scurrying about to provide food and shelter for\r\ntheir pets, and hear their consultations with other boys. The end of it all is,\r\nthat I am perfectly satisfied with my experiment. My boys, in caring for these\r\ndumb creatures, have become unselfish and thoughtful. They had rather go to\r\nschool without their own breakfast than have the inmates of the stable go\r\nhungry. They are getting a humane education, a heart education, added to the\r\nintellectual education of their schools. Then it keeps them at home. I used to\r\nbe worried with the lingering about street corners, the dawdling around with\r\nother boys, and the idle, often worse than idle, talk indulged in. Now they have\r\nsomething to do, they are men of business. They are always hammering and\r\npounding at boxes and partitions out there in the stable, or cleaning up, and if\r\nthey are sent out on an errand, they do it and come right home. I don't mean to\r\nsay that we have deprived them of liberty. They have their days for base-ball,\r\nand foot-ball, and excursions to the woods, but they have so much to do at home,\r\nthat they won't go away unless for a specific purpose.\""}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'While Mrs. Morris was talking, her visitor leaned forward in her chair, and\r\nlistened attentively.

I was timid and did not dare speak to them. Very\r\noften, I ran home and flung myself in my mother's arms with a burst of tears,\r\nand asked her if nothing could be done to help the poor animals. With mistaken,\r\nmotherly kindness, she tried to put the subject out of my thoughts. I was\r\ncarefully guarded from seeing or hearing of any instances of cruelty. But the\r\nanimals went on suffering just the same, and when I became a woman, I saw my\r\ncowardice. I agitated the matter among my friends, and told them that our whole\r\ndumb creation was groaning together in pain, and would continue to groan, unless\r\nmerciful human beings were willing to help them. I was able to assist in the\r\nformation of several societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, and\r\nthey have done good service. Good service not only to the horses and cows, but\r\nto the nobler animal, man. I believe that in saying to a cruel man, 'You shall\r\nnot overwork, torture, mutilate, nor kill your animal, or neglect to provide it\r\nwith proper food and shelter,' we are making him a little nearer the kingdom of\r\nheaven than he was before.

I was reading the other day about the\r\npolicemen in a big city in England that have to catch stray dogs, and dogs\r\nsupposed to be mad, and all kinds of dogs, and they get bitten over and over\r\nagain, and never think anything about it.

They imagine they've got hydrophobia, and they've got it because they\r\nimagine it. I believe if I fixed my attention on that right thumb of mine, and\r\nthought I had a sore there, and picked at it and worried it, in a short time a\r\nsore would come, and I'd be off to the doctor to have it cured.

I believe that a careful examination of the\r\nrecords of death reported in Boston from hydrophobia for the space of thirty-two\r\nyears, shows that two people actually died from it. Dogs are like all other\r\nanimals. They're liable to sickness, and they've got to be watched. I think my\r\nhorses would go mad if I starved them, or over-fed them, or over-worked them, or\r\nlet them stand in laziness, or kept them dirty, or didn't give them water\r\nenough. They'd get some disease, anyway. If a person owns an animal, let him\r\ntake care of it, and it's all right. If it shows signs of sickness, shut it up\r\nand watch it. If the sickness is incurable, kill it. Here's a sure way to\r\nprevent hydrophobia. Kill off all ownerless and vicious dogs. If you can't do\r\nthat, have plenty of water where they can get at it. A dog that has all the\r\nwater he wants, will never go mad. This dog of mine has not one single thing the\r\nmatter with him but pure ugliness. Yet, if I let him loose, and he ran through\r\nthe village with his tongue out, I'll warrant you there'd be a cry of 'mad dog!'\r\nHowever, I'm going to kill him. I've no use for a bad dog. Have plenty of\r\nanimals, I say, and treat them kindly, but if there's a vicious one among them,\r\nput it out of the way, for it is a constant danger to man and beast. It's queer\r\nhow ugly some people are about their dogs. They'll keep them no matter how they\r\nworry other people, and even when they're snatching the bread out of their\r\nneighbors' mouths. But I say that is not the fault of the four-legged dog. A\r\nhuman dog is the worst of all. There's a band of sheep-killing dogs here in\r\nRiverdale, that their owners can't, or won't, keep out of mischief. Meek-looking\r\nfellows some of them are. The owners go to bed at night, and the dogs pretend to\r\ngo, too; but when the house is quiet and the family asleep, off goes Rover or\r\nFido to worry poor, defenseless creatures that can't defend themselves. Their\r\ntaste for sheep's blood is like the taste for liquor in men, and the dogs will\r\ntravel as far to get their fun, as the men will travel for theirs.

Away in the distance some moose would hear it,\r\nand with answering grunts would start off to come to it. If a young male moose\r\nwas coming, he'd mind his steps, I can assure you, on account of fear of the old\r\nones; but if it was an old fellow, you'd hear him stepping out bravely and\r\nrapping his horns against the trees, and plunging into any water that came in\r\nhis way. When he got pretty near, he'd stop to listen, and then the caller had\r\nto be very careful and put his trumpet down close to the ground, so as to make a\r\nlower sound. If the moose felt doubtful he'd turn; if not, he'd come on, and\r\nunlucky for him if he did, for he got a warm reception, either from the rifles\r\nin our hands as we lay hid near the caller, or from some of the party stationed\r\nat a distance."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"In stalking, we crept on them the way a cat creeps on a mouse.

They easily take\r\nthe scent of men, and we'd have to keep well to the leeward. Sometimes we'd come\r\nupon them lying down, but, if in walking along, we'd broken a twig, or made the\r\nslightest noise, they'd think it was one of their mortal enemies, a bear\r\ncreeping on them, and they'd be up and away.

I'd often go off\r\nfor the day with my hounds. Sometimes in the early morning they'd find a track\r\nin the snow. The leader for scent would go back and forth, to find out which way\r\nthe fox was going. I can see him now. All the time that he ran, now one way and\r\nnow another on the track of the fox, he was silent, but kept his tail aloft,\r\nwagging it as a signal to the hounds behind. He was leader in scent, but he did\r\nnot like bloody, dangerous fights. By-and-by, he would decide which way the fox\r\nhad gone. Then his tail, still kept high in the air, would wag more violently.\r\nThe rest followed him in single file, going pretty slow, so as to enable us to\r\nkeep up to them. By-and-by, they would come to a place where the fox was\r\nsleeping for the day. As soon as he was disturbed he would leave his bed under\r\nsome thick fir or spruce branches near the ground. This flung his fresh scent\r\ninto the air. As soon as the hounds sniffed it, they gave tongue in good\r\nearnest. It was a mixed, deep baying, that made the blood quicken in my veins.\r\nWhile in the excitement of first fright, the fox would run fast for a mile or\r\ntwo, till he found it an easy matter to keep out of the way of the hounds. Then\r\nhe, cunning creature, would begin to bother them. He would mount to the top pole\r\nof the worm fence dividing the fields from the woods. He could trot along here\r\nquite a distance and then make a long jump into the woods. The hounds would come\r\nup, but could not walk the fence, and they would have difficulty in finding\r\nwhere the fox had left it. Then we saw generalship. The hounds scattered in all\r\ndirections, and made long detours into the woods and fields. As soon as the\r\ntrack was lost, they ceased to bay, but the instant a hound found it again, he\r\nbayed to give the signal to the others. All would hurry to the spot, and off\r\nthey would go baying as they went."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"Then Mr. Fox would try a new trick. He would climb a leaning tree, and then\r\njump to the ground. This trick would soon be found out. Then he'd try another.\r\nHe would make a circle of a quarter of a mile in circumference. By making a loop\r\nin his course, he would come in behind the hounds, and puzzle them between the\r\nscent of his first and following tracks. If the snow was deep, the hounds had\r\nmade a good track for him. Over this he could run easily, and they would have to\r\nfeel their way along, for after he had gone around the circle a few times, he\r\nwould jump from the beaten path as far as he could, and make off to other cover\r\nin a straight line. Before this was done it was my plan to get near the circle;\r\ntaking care to approach it on the leeward side. If the fox got a sniff of human\r\nscent, he would leave his circle very quickly, and make tracks fast to be out of\r\ndanger. By the baying of the hounds, the circle in which the race was kept up\r\ncould be easily known. The last runs to get near enough to shoot had to be done\r\nwhen the hounds' baying came from the side of the circle nearest to me. For then\r\nthe fox would be on the opposite side farthest away. As soon as I got near\r\nenough to see the hounds when they passed, I stopped. When they got on the\r\nopposite side, I then kept a bright lookout for the fox. Sometimes when the\r\nbrush was thick, the sight of him would be indistinct. The shooting had to be\r\nquick. As soon as the report of the gun was heard, the hounds ceased to bay, and\r\nmade for the spot. If the fox was dead, they enjoyed the scent of his blood. If\r\nonly wounded, they went after him with all speed. Sometimes he was overtaken and\r\nkilled, and sometimes he got into his burrow in the earth, or in a hollow log,\r\nor among the rocks."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"One day, I remember, when I was standing on the outside of the circle, the fox\r\ncame in sight.

Here we set snares, with spring poles\r\nthat would throw them into the river when they made struggles to get free, and\r\ndrown them. Did you ever hear of the fox, Laura, that wanted to cross a river,\r\nand lay down on the bank pretending that he was dead, and a countryman came\r\nalong, and, thinking he had a prize, threw him in his boat and rowed across,\r\nwhen the fox got up and ran away?"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Now, uncle," said Miss Laura, "you\'re laughing at me.

If they do a thing once, they will do it again.\r\nWhen she came to us, she had a trick of biting at a person who gave her oats.\r\nShe would do it without fail, so father put a little stick under his arm, and\r\nevery time she would bite he would give her a rap over the nose. She soon got\r\ntired of biting, and gave it up. Sometimes now, you'll see her make a snap at\r\nfather as if she was going to bite, and then look under his arm to see if the\r\nstick is there. He cured some of her tricks in one way, and some in another. One\r\nbad one she had was to start for the stable the minute one of the traces was\r\nunfastened when we were unharnessing. She pulled father over once, and another\r\ntime she ran the shaft of the sulky clean through the barn door. The next time\r\nfather brought her in, he got ready for her. He twisted the lines around his\r\nhands, and the minute she began to bolt, he gave a tremendous jerk, that pulled\r\nher back upon her haunches, and shouted, 'Whoa!' It cured her, and she never\r\nstarted again, till he gave her the word. Often now, you'll see her throw her\r\nhead back when she is being unhitched. He only did it once, yet she remembers.\r\nIf we'd had the training of Scamp, she'd be a very different animal. It's nearly\r\nall in the bringing up of a colt, whether it will turn out vicious or gentle. If\r\nany one were to strike Fleetfoot, he would not know what it meant. He has been\r\nbrought up differently from Scamp."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"She was probably trained by some brutal man who inspired her with distrust of\r\nthe human species.

He always stayed pretty late, and on the way\r\nhome he'd tie the reins to the whip-stock and go to sleep, and never wake up\r\ntill Cleve or Pacer, whichever one he happened to have, would draw up in the\r\nbarnyard. They would pass any rigs they happened to meet, and turn out a little\r\nfor a man. If Davids wasn't asleep, he could always tell by the difference in\r\ntheir gait which they were passing. They'd go quickly past a man, and much\r\nslower, with more of a turn out, if it was a team. But I dare say father told\r\nyou this. He has a great stock of horse stories, and I am almost as bad.

You have noticed how low the\r\npartitions are between the boxes in the horse stable. Father says you wouldn't\r\nput a lot of people in separate boxes in a room, where they couldn't see each\r\nother, and horses are just as fond of company as we are. Cleve and Pacer are\r\nalways nosing each other. A horse has a long memory. Father has had horses\r\nrecognize him, that he has been parted from for twenty years. Speaking of their\r\nmemories reminds me of another good story about Pacer that I never heard till\r\nyesterday, and that I would not talk about to any one but you and mother.

On this occasion father took the\r\nPost Road. The snow wasn't deep, and he wanted to inquire after an old man who\r\nhad been robbed and half frightened to death, a few days before. He was a\r\nmiserable old creature, known as Miser Jerrold, and he lived alone with his\r\ndaughter. He had saved a little money that he kept in a box under his bed. When\r\nfather got near the place, he was astonished to see by Pacer's actions that he\r\nhad been on this road before, and recently, too. Father is so sharp about\r\nhorses, that they never do a thing that he doesn't attach a meaning to. So he\r\nlet the reins hang a little loose, and kept his eye on Pacer. The horse went\r\nalong the road, and seeing father didn't direct him, turned into the lane\r\nleading to the house. There was an old red gate at the end of it, and he stopped\r\nin front of it, and waited for father to get out.

The\r\ndaughter said that they had gone to bed at dark the night her father was robbed.\r\nShe slept up stairs, and he down below. About ten o'clock she heard him scream,\r\nand running down stairs, she found him sitting up in bed, and the window wide\r\nopen. He said a man had sprung in upon him, stuffed the bedclothes into his\r\nmouth, and dragging his box from under the bed, had made off with it.

Father said the fellow\r\nturned all the colors of the rainbow, for he thought he had covered up his\r\ntracks so cleverly that he would never be found out. Then father said, 'Sit\r\ndown, Jacobs, for I have got to have a long talk with you.' He had him there\r\nabout an hour, and when he finished, the fellow was completely broken down.\r\nFather told him that there were just two courses in life for a young man to\r\ntake; and he had gotten on the wrong one.

Though the pony was only a scrub of a creature, he had a\r\ngentle disposition, and every other animal on the farm liked him. A gander, in\r\nparticular, had such an admiration for him that he followed him wherever he\r\nwent, and if he lost him for an instant, he would mount one of the knolls on the\r\nfarm and stretch out his neck looking for him. When he caught sight of him, he\r\ngabbled with delight, and running to him, waddled up and down beside him. Every\r\nlittle while the pony put his nose down, and seemed to be having a conversation\r\nwith the goose. If the farmer whistled the pony and he started to run to him,\r\nthe gander, knowing he could not keep up, would seize the pony's tail in his\r\nbeak, and flapping his wings, would get along as fast as the pony did.

After\r\nthis story was over, the Italian made another bow, and then told the pony to\r\nbow. He nodded his head at the people, and they all laughed. Then the Italian\r\nasked him to favor us with a waltz, and the pony got up on his hind legs and\r\ndanced.

They helped the Italian on with his coat,\r\nthey pulled off his rubbers, they took his coat away and brought him a chair,\r\nand dragged a table up to it. They brought him letters and papers, and rang\r\nbells, and rolled barrels, and swung the Italian in a big swing, and jumped a\r\nrope, and walked up and down steps they just went around that stage as handy\r\nwith their teeth as two boys would be with their hands, and they seemed to\r\nunderstand every word their master said to them."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"The best trick of all was telling the time and doing questions in arithmetic.\r\nThe Italian pulled his watch out of his pocket and showed it to the first pony,\r\nwhose name was Diamond, and said, 'What time is it?'

The pony\r\nscratched again five times. The Italian showed his watch to the audience, and\r\nsaid that it was just five minutes past four. Then he asked the pony how old he\r\nwas. He scratched four times. That meant four years. He asked him how many days\r\nin a week there were, how many months in a year; and he gave him some questions\r\nin addition and subtraction, and the pony answered them all correctly. Of\r\ncourse, the Italian was giving him some sign; but, though we watched him\r\nclosely, we couldn't make out what it was. At last, he told the pony that he had\r\nbeen very good, and had done his lessons well; if it would rest him, he might be\r\nnaughty a little while. All of a sudden a wicked look came into the creature's\r\neyes. He turned around, and kicked up his heels at his master, he pushed over\r\nthe table and chairs, and knocked down a blackboard where he had been rubbing\r\nout figures with a sponge held in his mouth. The Italian pretended to be cross,\r\nand said, 'Come, come; this won't do,' and he called the other pony to him, and\r\ntold him to take that troublesome fellow off the stage. The second one nosed\r\nDiamond, and pushed him about, finally bit him by the ear, and led him squealing\r\noff the stage.

The man\r\ncracked his whip once, and they began; twice, and they did backward what they\r\nhad done forward; three times, and they stopped, and every animal, dogs, goats,\r\nponies, and monkeys, after they had finished their tricks, ran up to their\r\nmaster, and he gave them a lump of sugar. They seemed fond of him, and often\r\nwhen they weren't performing went up to him, and licked his hands or his sleeve.\r\nThere was one boss dog, Joe, with a head like yours. Bob, they called him, and\r\nhe did all his tricks alone.

The audience howled for an encore, and didn't he come out alone, make\r\nanother bow, and retire. I saw old Judge Brown wiping the tears from his eyes,\r\nhe'd laughed so much. One of the last tricks was with a goat, and the Italian\r\nsaid it was the best of all, because the goat is such a hard animal to teach. He\r\nhad a big ball, and the goat got on it and rolled it across the stage without\r\ngetting off.

From the windows above came a steady\r\nstream of articles, thrown among the crowd. A mirror struck Mr. Morris on the\r\narm, and a whole package of clothes fell on his head and almost smothered him;\r\nbut he brushed them aside and scarcely noticed them. There was something the\r\nmatter with Mr. Morris I knew by the worried sound of his voice when he spoke to\r\nany one. I could not see his face, though it was as light as day about us, for\r\nwe had got jammed in the crowd, and if I had not kept between his feet, I should\r\nhave been trodden to death.

Five minutes to dress and get\r\nout,\' and papa told me to put on my clothes and go downstairs, and he ran up to\r\nmamma."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Where was she?" asked Mr. Morris, quickly.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"On the fourth flat.

Mr. Morris soothed him as best he could, and drew him a\r\nlittle to the edge of the crowd.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'While he was doing this, there was a piercing cry. I could not see the person\r\nmaking it, but I knew it was the Italian\'s voice. He was screaming, in broken\r\nEnglish that the fire was spreading to the stables, and his animals would be\r\nburned. Would no one help him to get his animals out? There was a great deal of\r\nconfused language. Some voices shouted, "Look after the people first. Let the\r\nanimals go." And others said, "For shame. Get the horses out." But no one seemed\r\nto do anything, for the Italian went on crying for help. I heard a number of\r\npeople who were standing near us say that it had just been found out that\r\nseveral persons who had been sleeping in the top of the hotel had not got out.\r\nThey said that at one of the top windows a poor housemaid was shrieking for\r\nhelp.

He put him down on the brick sidewalk,\r\nand unfastened his little shirt, and left me to watch him, while he held his\r\nhands under a leak in a hose that was fastened to a hydrant near us. He got\r\nenough water to dash on Charlie's face and breast, and then seeing that the boy\r\nwas reviving, he sat down on the curbstone and took him on his knee. Charlie lay\r\nin his arms and moaned. He was a delicate boy, and he could not stand rough\r\nusage as the Morris boys could."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Mr. Morris was terribly uneasy. His face was deathly white, and he shuddered\r\nwhenever there was a cry from the burning building. \"Poor souls God help them.\r\nOh, this is awful,\" he said; and then he turned his eyes from the great sheets\r\nof flame and strained the little boy to his breast. At last there were wild\r\nshrieks that I knew came from no human throats. The fire must have reached the\r\nhorses. Mr. Morris sprang up, then sank back again. He wanted to go, yet he\r\ncould be of no use. There were hundreds of men standing about, but the fire had\r\nspread so rapidly, and they had so little water to put on it that there was very\r\nlittle they could do. I wondered whether I could do anything for the poor\r\nanimals. I was not afraid of fire, as most dogs, for one of the tricks that the\r\nMorris boys had taught me was to put out a fire with my paws. They would throw a\r\npiece of lighted paper on the floor, and I would crush it with my forepaws; and\r\nif the blaze was too large for that, I would drag a bit of old carpet over it\r\nand jump on it. I left Mr. Morris, and ran around the corner of the street to\r\nthe back of the hotel. It was not burned as much here as in the front, and in\r\nthe houses all around, people were out on their roofs with wet blankets, and\r\nsome were standing at the window watching the fire, or packing up their\r\nbelongings ready to move if it should spread to them. There was a narrow lane\r\nrunning up a short distance toward the hotel, and I started to go up this, when\r\nin front of me I heard such a wailing, piercing noise, that it made me shudder\r\nand stand still. The Italian's animals were going to be burned up and they were\r\ncalling to their master to come and get them out. Their voices sounded like the\r\nvoices of children in mortal pain. I could not stand it. I was seized with such\r\nan awful horror of the fire that I turned and ran, feeling so thankful that I\r\nwas not in it. As I got into the street I stumbled over something. It was a\r\nlarge bird a parrot, and at first I thought it was Bella. Then I remembered\r\nhearing Jack say that the Italian had a parrot. It was not dead, but seemed\r\nstupid with the smoke. I seized it in my mouth, and ran and laid it at Mr.\r\nMorris's feet.

The inside of the budding had burned away, and nothing more could\r\nbe gotten out. The firemen and all the people drew back, and there was no noise.\r\nEverybody stood gazing silently at the flames. A man stepped quietly up to Mr.\r\nMorris, and looking at him, I saw that it was Mr. Montague. He was usually a\r\nwell-dressed man, with a kind face, and a head of thick, grayish brown hair.

Oh, what fun it was. I got to know a lot of street dogs, and\r\nwe had gay times, barking under people's windows and making them mad, and\r\ngetting into back yards and chasing cats. We used to kill a cat nearly every\r\nnight. Policeman would chase us, and we would run and run till the water just\r\nran off our tongues, and we hadn't a bit of breath left. Then I'd go home and\r\nsleep all day, and go out again the next night. When I was about a year old, I\r\nbegan to stay out days as well as nights. They couldn't keep me home. Then I ran\r\naway for three months. I got with an old lady on Fifth Avenue, who was very fond  of dogs. She had four white poodles, and her servants used to wash them, and tie  up their hair with blue ribbons, and she used to take them for drives in her  phaeton in the park, and they wore gold and silver collars. The biggest poodle  wore a ruby in his collar worth five hundred dollars. I went driving, too, and  sometimes we met my master. He often smiled, and shook his head at me.

Each one had a high  chair at the table, and a plate, and they always sat in these chairs and had  meals with her, and the servants all called them Master Bijou, and Master Tot,  and Miss Tiny, and Miss Fluff. One day they tried to make me sit in a chair, and  I got cross and bit Mrs. Tibbett, and she beat me cruelly, and her servants  stoned me away from the house."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Speaking about fools, Dandy," I said, "if it is polite to call a lady one, I  should say that that lady was one.

Only knowing dogs like me can make their way about.\" I rather  doubted this speech; but I said nothing, and he went on patronizingly: \"However,  Joe, thou hast reason, as the French say. Mrs. Judge Tibbett didn't give her  dogs exercise enough. Their claws were as long as Chinamen's nails, and the hair  grew over their pads, and they had red eyes and were always sick, and she had to  dose them with medicine, and call them her poor, little, 'weeny-teeny sicky- wicky doggies.' Bah! I got disgusted with her. When I left her, I ran away to  her niece's, Miss Ball's. She was a sensible young lady, and she used to scold  her aunt for the way in which she brought up her dogs. She was almost too  sensible, for her pug and I were rubbed and scrubbed within an inch of our  lives, and had to go for such long walks that I got thoroughly sick of them. A  woman, whom the servants called Trotsey, came every morning, and took the pug  and me by our chains, and sometimes another dog or two, and took us for long  tramps in quiet streets. That was Trotsey's business, to walk dogs, and Miss  Ball got a great many fashionable young ladies who could not exercise their  dogs, to let Trotsey have them, and they said that it made a great difference in  the health and appearance of their pets. Trotsey got fifteen cents an hour for a  dog. Goodness, what appetites those walks gave us, and didn't we make the dog  biscuits disappear? But it was a slow life at Miss Ball's. We only saw her for a  little while every day. She slept till noon. After lunch she played with us for  a little while in the greenhouse, then she was off driving or visiting, and in  the evening she always had company, or went to a dance, or to the theatre. I  soon made up my mind that I'd run away. I jumped out of a window one fine  morning, and ran home. I stayed there for a long time. My mother had been run  over by a cart and killed, and I wasn't sorry. My master never bothered his head  about me, and I could do as I liked. One day when I was having a walk, and  meeting a lot of dogs that I knew, a little boy came behind me, and before I  could tell what he was doing, he had snatched me up, and was running off with  me. I couldn't bite him, for he had stuffed some of his rags in my mouth. He  took me to a tenement house, in a part of the city that I had never been in  before. He belonged to a very poor family. My faith, weren't they badly off six  children, and a mother, and father, all living in two tiny rooms. Scarcely a bit  of meat did I smell while I was there.

It's awful to be chained, especially for a dog like me that loves his  freedom. The flies worried me, and the noises distracted me, and my flesh would  fairly creep from getting no exercise. I was there nearly a month, while they  were waiting for a reward to be offered. But none came; and one day, the boy's  father, who was a street peddler, took me by my chain and led me about the  streets till he sold me. A gentleman got me for his little boy, but I didn't  like the look of him, so I sprang up and bit his hand, and he dropped the chain,  and I dodged boys and policemen and finally got home more dead than alive, and  looking like a skeleton.

He made fun  of the Morrises all the time, and said they had a dull, poky, old house, and he  only stayed because Miss Laura was nursing him. He had a little sore on his back  that she soon found out was mange. Her father said it was a bad disease for dogs  to have, and Dandy had better be shot; but she begged so hard for his life, and  said she would cure him in a few weeks that she was allowed to keep him. Dandy  wasn't capable of getting really angry, but he was as disturbed about having  this disease as he could be about anything. He said that he had got it from a  little, mangy dog, that he had played with a few weeks before. He was only with  the dog a little while, and didn't think he would take it, but it seemed he knew  what an easy thing it was to get."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Until he got well he was separated from us. Miss Laura kept him up in the loft  with the rabbits, where we could not go; and the boys ran him around the garden  for exercise. She tried all kinds of cures for him, and I heard her say that  although it was a skin disease, his blood must be purified. She gave him some of  the pills that she made out of sulphur and butter for Jim, and Billy, and me, to  keep our coats silky and smooth. When they didn't cure him, she gave him a few  drops of arsenic every day, and washed the sore, and, indeed his whole body,  with tobacco water or carbolic soap. It was the tobacco water that cured him."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Miss Laura always put on gloves when she went near him, and used a brush to wash  him, for if a person takes mange from a dog, they may lose their hair and their  eyelashes.

He was right glad, he  said, for he had got heartily sick of the rabbits. He used to bark at them and  make them angry, and they would run around the loft, stamping their hind feet at  him, in the funny way that rabbits do. I think they disliked him as much as he  disliked them. Jim and I did not get the mange. Dandy was not a strong dog, and  I think his irregular way of living made him take diseases readily. He would  stuff himself when he was hungry, and he always wanted rich food. If he couldn't  get what he wanted at the Morrises', he went out and stole, or visited the dumps  at the back of the town."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When he did get ill, he was more stupid about doctoring himself than any dog  that I have ever seen. He never seemed to know when to eat grass or herbs, or a  little earth, that would have kept him in good condition. A dog should never be  without grass. When Dandy got ill he just suffered till he got well again, and  never tried to cure himself of his small troubles. Some dogs even know enough to  amputate their limbs. Jim told me a very interesting story of a dog the Morrises  once had, called Gyp, whose leg became paralyzed by a kick from a horse. He knew  the leg was dead, and gnawed it off nearly to the shoulder, and though he was  very sick for a time, yet in the end he got well."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To return to Dandy.

The first fine day he was off, and during the rest of the spring  and summer we occasionally met him running about the town with a set of fast  dogs. One day I stopped and asked him how he concealed himself in such a quiet  place as Fairport, and he said he was dying to get back to New York, and was  hoping that his master's yacht would come and take him away."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Poor Dandy never left Fairport. After all, he was not such a bad dog. There was  nothing really vicious about him, and I hate to speak of his end. His master's  yacht did not come, and soon the summer was over, and the winter was coming, and  no one wanted Dandy, for he had such a bad name. He got hungry and cold, and one  day sprang upon a little girl, to take away a piece of bread and butter that she  was eating. He did not see the large house-dog on the door sill, and before he  could get away, the dog had seized him, and bitten and shaken him till he was  nearly dead.

He was so weak that he could scarcely eat the food that  she put in his mouth, so she let him lick some milk from her finger. As she was  going to church, I could not go with her, but I ran down the lane and watched  her out of sight. When I came back, Dandy was gone. I looked till I found him.  He had crawled into the darkest corner of the stable to die, and though he was  suffering very much, he never uttered a sound. I sat by him and thought of his  master in New York. If he had brought Dandy up properly he might not now be here  in his silent death agony. A young pup should be trained just as a child is, and  punished when he goes wrong. Dandy began badly, and not being checked in his  evil ways, had come so this. Poor Dandy! Poor, handsome dog of a rich master! He  opened his dull eyes, gave me one last glance, then, with a convulsive shudder,  his torn limbs were still.

She married Mr. Harry four years ago, and lives with him and Mr. and Mrs. Wood,  on Dingley Farm. Mr. and Mrs. Morris live in a cottage near by. Mr. Morris is  not very strong, and can preach no longer. The boys are all scattered. Jack  married pretty Miss Bessie Drury, and lives on a large farm near here. Miss  Bessie says that she hates to be a farmer's wife, but she always looks very  happy and contented, so I think that she must be mistaken.

He is very handsome, and is a  constant attendant of Miss Laura\'s. We are great friends, he and I, but he can  get about much better than I can. One day a friend of Miss Laura\'s came with a  little boy and girl, and "Collie" sat between the two children, and their father  took their picture with a "kodak."

The Morrises and a great many of their friends  went to his performance, and Miss Laura said afterward, that when cunning little  Billy came on the stage, and made his bow, and went through his antics of  jumping through hoops, and catching balls, that she almost had hysterics. The  Italian had made a special pet of him for the Morrises' sake, and treated him  more like a human being than a dog. Billy rather put on airs when he came up to  the farm to see us, but he was such a dear, little dog, in spite of being almost  spoiled by his master, that Jim and I could not get angry with him. In a few  days they went away, and we heard nothing but good news from them, till last  winter. Then a letter came to Miss Laura from a nurse in a New York hospital.  She said that the Italian was very near his end, and he wanted her to write to  Mrs. Gray to tell her that he had sold all his animals but the little dog that  she had so kindly given him. He was sending him back to her, and with his latest  breath he would pray for heaven's blessing on the kind lady and her family that  had befriended him when he was in trouble."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The next day Billy arrived, a thin, white scarecrow of a dog.

He knew what they meant, and from that instant he ceased  listening for footsteps, and lay quite still till he died.
