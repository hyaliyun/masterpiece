It is common to the modern\ncivilised peoples only in so far as these peoples have come\nthrough substantially the same historical experience and have\nthereby acquired substantially the same habits of thought and\nhave fallen into somewhat the same prevalent frame of mind. This\nmodern point of view, therefore, is limited both in time and\nspace. It is characteristic of the modern historical era and of\nsuch peoples as lie within the range of that peculiar\ncivilisation which marks off the modern world from what has gone\nbefore and from what still prevails outside of its range. In\nother words, it is a trait of modern Christendom, of Occidental\ncivilisation as it has run within the past few centuries. This\ngeneral statement is not vitiated by the fact that there has been\nsome slight diffusion of these modern and Western ideas outside\nof this range in recent times.\nBy historical accident it happens that the modern point of\nview has reached its maturest formulation and prevails with the\nleast faltering among the French and English-speaking peoples; so\nthat these peoples may be said to constitute the center of\ndiffusion for that system of ideas which is called the modern\npoint of view. Outward from this broad center the same range of\nideas prevail throughout Christendom, but they prevail with less\nsingleness of conviction among the peoples who are culturally\nmore remote from this center; increasingly so with each farther\nremove. These others have carried over a larger remainder of the\nhabits of thought of an earlier age, and have carried them over\nin a better state of preservation. It may also be that these\nothers, or some of them, have acquired habits of thought of a new\norder which do not altogether fit into that system of ideas that\nis commonly spoken of as the modern point of view. That such is\nthe case need imply neither praise nor blame. It is only that, by\ncommon usage, these remainders of ancient habits of thought and\nthese newer preconceptions that do not fit into the framework of\nWest-European conventional thinking are not ordinarily rated as\nintrinsic to the modern point of view. They need not therefore be\nless to the purpose as a guide and criterion of human living; it\nis only that they are alien to those purposes which are\nconsidered to be of prime consequence in civilised life as it is\nguided and tested by the constituent principles of the modern\npoint of view.\nWhat is spoken of as a point of view is always a composite\naffair; some sort of a rounded and balanced system of principles\nand standards, which are taken for granted, at least\nprovisionally, and which serve as a base of reference and\nlegitimation in all questions of deliberate opinion. So when any\ngiven usage or any line of conduct or belief is seen and approved\nfrom the modern point of view, it comes to the same as saying\nthat these things are seen and accepted in the light of those\nprinciples which modern men habitually consider to be final and\nsufficient. They are principles of right, equity, propriety,\nduty, perhaps of knowledge, belief, and taste.\nIt is evident that these principles and standards of what is\nright, good, true, and beautiful, will vary from one age to\nanother and from one people to another, in response to the\nvarying conditions of life; inasmuch as these principles are\nalways of the nature of habit; although the variation will of\ncourse range only within the limits of that human nature that\nfinds expression in these same principles of right, good, truth,\nand beauty. So also, it will be found that something in the way\nof a common measure of truth and sufficiency runs through any\nsuch body of principles that are accepted as final and\nself-evident at any given time and place, -- in case this\nhabitual body of principles has reached such a degree of poise\nand consistency that they can fairly be said to constitute a\nstable point of view. It is only because there is such a degree\nof consistency and such a common measure of validity among the\ncommonly accepted principles of conduct and belief today, that it\nis possible to speak intelligently of the modern point of view,\nand to contrast it with any other point of view which may have\nprevailed earlier or elsewhere, as, e.g., in the Middle Ages or\nin Pagan Antiquity.\nThe Romans were given to saying. Tempora mutantur, and the\nSpanish have learned to speak indulgently in the name of\nCostumbres del pais. The common law of the English-speaking\npeoples does not coincide at all points with what was\nindefeasibly right and good in the eyes of the Romans; and still\nless do its principles countenance all the vagaries of the Mosaic\ncode. Yet, each and several, in their due time and institutional\nsetting, these have all been tried and found valid and have\napproved themselves as securely and eternally right and good in\nprinciple.\nEvidently these principles, which so are made to serve as\nstandards of validity in law and custom, knowledge and belief,\nare of the nature of canons, established rules, and have the\nauthority of precedent, prescription. They have been defined by\nthe attrition of use and wont and disputation, and they are\naccepted in a somewhat deliberate manner by common consent, and\nare upheld by a deliberate public opinion as to what is right and\nseemly. In the popular apprehension, and indeed in the\napprehension of the trained jurists and scholars for the time\nbeing, these constituent principles of the accepted point of view\nare "fundamentally and eternally right and good." But this\nperpetuity with which they so are habitually invested in the\npopular apprehension, in their time, is evidently such a\nqualified perpetuity only as belongs to any settled outgrowth of\nuse and wont. They are of an institutional character and they are\nendowed with that degree of perpetuity only that belongs to any\ninstitution. So soon as a marked change of circumstances comes\non, -- a change of a sufficiently profound, enduring and\ncomprehensive character, such as persistently to cross or to go\nbeyond those lines of use and wont out of which these settled\nprinciples have emerged, -- then these principles and their\nstandards of validity and finality must presently undergo a\nrevision, such as to bring on a new balance of principles,\nembodying the habits of thought enforced by a new situation, and\nexpressing itself in a revised scheme of authoritative use and\nwont, law and custom. In the transition from the medieval to the\nmodern point of view, e. g., there is to be seen such a pervasive\nchange in men\'s habitual outlook, answering to the compulsion of\na new range of circumstances which then came to condition the\ndaily life of the peoples of Christendom. In this mutation of the\nhabitual outlook, between medieval and modern times, the contrast\nis perhaps most neatly shown in the altered standards of\nknowledge and belief, rather than in the settled domain of law\nand morals. Not that the mutation of habits which then overtook\nthe Western world need have been less wide or less effectual in\nmatters of conduct; but the change which has taken effect in\nscience and philosophy, between the fourteenth century and the\nnineteenth, e. g., appears to have been of a more recognizable\ncharacter, more easily defined in succinct and convincing terms.\nIt has also quite generally attracted the attention of those men\nwho have interested themselves in the course of historical\nevents, and it has therefore become something of a commonplace in\nany standard historical survey of modern civilisation to say that\nthe scheme of knowledge and belief underwent a visible change\nbetween the Middle Ages and modern times.\nIt will also be found true that the canons of knowledge and\nbelief, the principles governing what is fact and what is\ncredible, are more intimately and intrinsically involved in the\nhabitual behavior of the human spirit than any factors of human\nhabit in other bearings. Such is necessarily the case, because\nthe principles which guide and limit knowledge and belief are the\nways and means by which men take stock of what is to be done and\nby which they take thought of how it is to be done. It is by the\nuse of their habitual canons of knowledge and belief, that men\nconstruct those canons of conduct which serve as guide and\nstandards in practical life. Men do not pass appraisal on matters\nwhich lie beyond the reach of their knowledge and belief, nor do\nthey formulate rules to govern the game of life beyond that\nlimit.\nSo, congenitally blind persons do not build color schemes;\nnor will a man without an "ear for music" become a master of\nmusical composition. So also, "the medieval mind" took no thought\nand made no provision for those later-arisen exigencies of life\nand those later-known facts of material science which lay yet\nbeyond the bounds of its medieval knowledge and belief; but this\n"medieval mind" at the same time spent much thought and took many\nexcellent precautions about things which have now come to be\naccounted altogether fanciful, -- things which the maturer\ninsight, or perhaps the less fertile conceit, of a more\nexperienced age has disowned as being palpably not in accord with\nfact.\nThat is to say, things which once were convincingly\nsubstantial and demonstrable, according to the best knowledge and\nbelief of the medieval mind, can now no longer be discerned as\nfacts, according to those canons of knowledge and belief that are\nnow doing duty among modern men as conclusive standards of\nreality. Not that all persons who are born within modern times\nare thereby rendered unable to know and to believe in such\nmedieval facts, e. g., as horoscopes, or witchcraft, or gentle\nbirth, or the efficacy of prayer, or the divine right of kings;\nbut, taken by and large, and in so far as it falls under the\ncontrol of the modern point of view, the deliberate consensus of\nknowledge and belief now runs to the effect that these and other\nimponderables like them no longer belong among ascertained or\nascertainable facts; but that they are on the other hand wholly\nillusory conceits, traceable to a mistaken point of view\nprevalent in that earlier and cruder age.\nThe principles governing knowledge and belief at any given\ntime are primary and pervasive, beyond any others, in that they\nunderlie all human deliberation and comprise the necessary\nelements of all human logic. But it is also to be noted that\nthese canons of knowledge and belief are more immediately exposed\nto revision and correction by experience than the principles of\nlaw and morals. So soon as the conditions of life shift and\nchange in any appreciable degree, experience will enforce a\nrevision of the habitual standards of actuality and credibility,\nbecause of the habitual and increasingly obvious failure of what\nhas before habitually been regarded as an ascertained fact.\nThings which, under the ancient canons of knowledge, have\nhabitually been regarded as known facts, -- as, e. g., witchcraft\nor the action of bodies at a distance, -- will under altered\ncircumstances prove themselves by experience to have only a\nsupposititious reality.\nAny knowledge that runs in such out-worn terms turns out to\nbe futile, misleading, meaningless; and the habit of imputing\nqualities and behavior of this kind to everyday facts will then\nfall into disuse, progressively as experience continues to bring\nhome the futility of all that kind of imputation. And presently\nthe habit of perceiving that class of qualities and behavior in\nthe known facts is therefore gradually lost. So also, in due time\nthe observances and the precautions and provisions embodied in\nlaw and custom for the preservation or the control of these lost\nimponderables will also fall into disuse and disappear out of the\nscheme of institutions, by way of becoming dead letter or by\nabrogation. Particularly will such a loss of belief and insight,\nand the consequent loss of those imponderables whose ground has\nthereby gone out from under them, take effect with the passing of\ngenerations.\nAn Imponderable is an article of make-believe which has\nbecome axiomatic by force of settled habit. It can accordingly\ncease to be an Imponderable by a course of unsettling habit.\nThose elders in whom the ancient habits of faith and insight have\nbeen ingrained, and in whose knowledge and belief the\nimponderables in question have therefore had a vital reality,\nwill presently fall away; and the new generation whose experience\nhas run on other lines are in a fair way to lose these articles\nof faith and in. sight, by disuse. It is a case of obsolescence\nby habitual disuse. And the habitual disuse which so allows the\nancient canons of knowledge and belief to fall away, and which\nthereby cuts the ground from under the traditional system of law\nand custom, is re-enforced by the advancing discipline of a new\norder of experience, which exacts an habitual apprehension of\nworkday facts in terms of a different kind and thereby brings on\na revaluation and revision of the traditional rules governing\nhuman relations. The new terms of workday knowledge and belief,\nwhich do not conform to the ancient canons, go to enforce and\nstabilise new canons and standards, of a character alien to the\ntraditional point of view. It is, in other words, a case of\nobsolescence by displacement as well as by habitual disuse.\nThis unsettling discipline that is brought to bear by workday\nexperience is chiefly and most immediately the discipline\nexercised by the material conditions of life, the exigencies that\nbeset men in their everyday dealings with the material means of\nlife; inasmuch as these material facts are insistent and\nuncompromising. And the scope and method of knowledge and belief\nwhich is forced on men in their everyday material concerns will\nunavoidably, by habitual use, extend to other matters as well; so\nas also to affect the scope and method of knowledge and belief in\nall that concerns those imponderable facts which lie outside the\nimmediate range of material experience. It results that, the\nfurther course of in changing habituation, those imponderable\nrelations, conventions, claims and perquisites, that make up the\ntime-worn system of law and custom will unavoidably also be\nbrought under review and will be revised and reorganised in the\nlight of the same new principles of validity that are found to be\nsufficient in dealing with material facts.\nGiven time and a sufficiently exacting run of experience, and\nit will follow necessarily that much the same standards of truth\nand finality will come to govern men\'s knowledge and valuation of\nfacts throughout; whether the facts in question lie in the domain\nof material things or in the domain of those imponderable\nconventions and preconceptions that decide what is right and\nproper in human intercourse. It follows necessarily, because the\nsame persons, bent by the same discipline and habituation, take\nstock of both and are required to get along with both during the\nsame lifetime. More or less rigorously the same scope and method\nof knowledge and valuation will control the thinking of the same\nindividuals throughout; at least to the extent that any given\narticle of faith and usage which is palpably at cross purposes\nwith this main intellectual bent will soon begin to seem\nimmaterial and irrelevant and will tend to become obsolete by\nneglect.\nSuch has always been the fate which overtakes any notable\narticles of faith and usage that belong to a bygone point of\nview. Any established system of law and order will remain\nsecurely stable only on condition that it he kept in line or\nbrought into line to conform with those canons of validity that\nhave the vogue for the time being; and the vogue is a matter of\nhabits of thought ingrained by everyday experience. And the moral\nis that any established system of law and custom is due to\nundergo a revision of its constituent principles so soon as a new\norder of economic life has had time materially to affect the\ncommunity\'s habits of thought. But all the while the changeless\nnative proclivities of the race will assert themselves in some\nmeasure in any eventual revision of the received institutional\nsystem; and always they will stand ready eventually to break the\nordered scheme of things into a paralytic mass of confusion if it\ncan not be bent into some passable degree of congruity with the\nparamount native needs of life.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"What is likely to arrest the attention of any student of the \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'modern era from the outset is the peculiar character of its\nindustry and of its intellectual outlook; particularly the scope\nand method of modern science and technology. The intellectual\nlife of modern Europe and its cultural dependencies differs\nnotably from what has gone before. There is all about it an air\nof matter-of-fact both in its technology and in its science;\nwhich culminates in a "mechanistic conception" of all those\nthings with which scientific inquiry is concerned and in the\nlight of which many of the dread realities of the Middle Ages\nlook like superfluous make-believe.\nBut it has been only during the later decades of the modern\nera -- during that time interval that might fairly be called the\npost-modern era -- that this mechanistic conception of things has\nbegun seriously to affect the current system of knowledge and\nbelief; and it has not hitherto seriously taken effect except in\ntechnology and in the material sciences. So that it has not\nhitherto seriously invaded the established scheme of\ninstitutional arrangements, the system of law and custom, which\ngoverns the relations of men to one another and defines their\nmutual rights, obligations, advantages and disabilities. But it\nshould reasonably be expected that this established system of\nrights, duties, proprieties and disabilities will also in due\ntime come in for something in the way of a revision, to bring it\nall more nearly into congruity with that matter-of-fact\nconception of things that lies at the root of the late-modern\ncivilisation.\nThe constituent principles of the established system of law\nand custom are of the nature of imponderables, of course; but\nthey are imponderables which have been conceived and formulated\nin terms of a different order from those that are convincing to\nthe twentieth-century scientists and engineers. Whereas the line\nof advance of the scientists and engineers, dominated by their\nmechanistic conception of things, appears to be the main line of\nmarch for modern civilisation. It should seem reasonable to\nexpect, therefore, that the scheme of law and custom will also\nfall into line with this mechanistic conception that appears to\nmark the apex of growth in modern intellectual life. But hitherto\nthe "due time" needed for the adjustment has apparently not been\nhad, or perhaps the experience which drives men in the direction\nof a mechanistic conception of all things has not hitherto been\ndriving them hard enough or unremittingly enough to carry such a\nrevision of ideas out in the system of law and custom. The modern\npoint of view in matters of law and custom appears to be somewhat\nin arrears, as measured by the later advance in science and\ntechnology.\nBut just now the attention of thoughtful men centers on\nquestions of practical concern, questions of law and usage,\nbrought to a focus by the flagrant miscarriage of that\norganisation of Christendom that has brought the War upon the\ncivilised nations. The paramount question just now is, what to do\nto save the civilised nations from irretrievable disaster, and\nwhat further may be accomplished by taking thought so that no\nsimilar epoch of calamities shall be put in train for the next\ngeneration. It is realised that there must be something in the\nway of a "reconstruction" of the scheme of things; and it is also\nrealised, though more dimly, that the reconstruction must be\ncarried out with a view to the security of life under such\nconditions as men will put up with, rather than with a view to\nthe impeccable preservation of the received scheme of law and\ncustom. All of which is only saying that the constituent\nprinciples of the modern point of view are to be taken under\nadvisement, reviewed and -- conceivably -- revised and brought\ninto line, in so far as these principles are constituent elements\nof that received scheme of law and custom that is spoken of as\nthe status quo. It is the status quo in respect of law and\ncustom, not in respect of science and technology or of knowledge\nand belief, that is to be brought under review. Law and custom,\nit is believed, may be revised to meet the requirements of\ncivilised men\'s knowledge and belief; but no man of sound mind\nhopes to revise the modern system of knowledge and belief so as\nto bring it all into conformity with the time-worn scheme of law\nand custom of the status quo.\nTherefore the bearing of this stabilised modern point of\nview, stabilised in the eighteenth century, on these questions of\npractical concern is of present interest, -- its practical value\nas ground for a reasonably hopeful reconstruction of the\nwar-shattered scheme of use and wont; its possible serviceability\nas a basis of enduring settlement; as well as the share which its\nconstituent principles have had in the creation of that status\nquo out of which this epoch of calamities has been precipitated.\nThe status quo ante, in which the roots of this growth of\nmisfortunes and impossibilities are to be found, lies within the\nmodern era, of course, and it is nowise to be decried as an\nalien, or even as an unforeseen, outgrowth of this modern era. By\nand large, this eighteenth-century stabilised modern point of\nview has governed men\'s dealings within this era, and its\nconstituent principles of right and honest living must therefore,\npresumptively, be held answerable for the disastrous event of it\nall, -- at least to the extent that they have permissively\ncountenanced the growth of those sinister conditions which have\nnow ripened into a state of world-wide shame and confusion.\nHow and how far is this modern point of view, this body of\nlegal and moral principles established in the eighteenth century,\nto be accounted an accessory to this crime? And if it be argued\nthat this complication of atrocities has come on, not because of\nthese principles of conduct which are so dear to civilised men\nand so blameless in their sight, but only in spite of them; then,\nwhat is the particular weakness or shortcoming inherent in this\nbody of principles which has allowed such a growth of malignant\nconditions to go on and gather head? If the modern point of view,\nthese settled principles of conduct by which modern men\ncollectively are actuated in what they will do and in what they\nwill permit, -- if these canons and standards of clean and honest\nliving have proved to be a fatal snare; then it becomes an urgent\nquestion: Is it safe, or sane to go into the future by the light\nof these same established canons of right, equity, and propriety\nthat so have been tried and found wanting?\nPerhaps the question should rather take the less didactic\nform: Will the present experience of calamities induce men to\nrevise these established principles of conduct, and the\nspecifications of the code based on them, so effectually as to\nguard against any chance of return to the same desperate\nsituation in the calculable future? Can the discipline of recent\nexperience and the insight bred by the new order of knowledge and\nbelief, re-enforced by the shock of the present miscarriage, be\ncounted on to bring such a revision of these principles of law\nand custom as will preclude a return to that status quo ante from\nwhich this miscarriage of civilisation has resulted? The latter\nquestion is more to the point. History teaches that men, taken\ncollectively, learn by habituation rather than by precept and\nreflection; particularly as touches those underlying principles\nof truth and validity on which the effectual scheme of law and\ncustom finally rests.\nIn the last analysis it resolves itself into a question as to\nhow and how far the habituation of the recent past, mobilised by\nthe shock of the present conjuncture, will have affected the\nframe of mind of the common man in these civilised countries; for\nin the last analysis and with due allowance for a margin of\ntolerance it is the frame of mind of the common man that makes\nthe foundation of society in the modern world; even though the\nelder statesmen continue to direct its motions from day to day by\nthe light of those principles that were found good some time\nbefore yesterday. And the fortunes of the civilised world, for\ngood or ill, have come to turn on the deeds of commission and of\nomission of these advanced peoples among whom the frame of mind\nof the common man is the finally conditioning circumstance in\nwhat may safely be done or left undone. The advice and consent of\nthe common run has latterly come to be indispensable to the\nconduct of affairs among civilised men, somewhat in the same\ndegree in which the community is to be accounted a civilised\npeople. It is indispensable at least in a permissive way, at\nleast to the extent that no line of policy can long be pursued\nsuccessfully without the permissive tolerance of the common run;\nand the margin of tolerance in the case appears to be narrower\nthe more alert and the more matter-of-fact the frame of mind of\nthe common man.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 2"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The Stability of Law and Custom"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"In so far as concerns the present question, that is to say as \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'regards those standards and principles which underlie the\nestablished system of law and custom, the modern point of view\nwas stabilised and given a definitive formulation in the\neighteenth century; and in so far as concerns the subsequent\nconduct of practical affairs, its constituent principles have\nstood over without material change or revision since that time.\nSo that for practical purposes it is fair to say that the modern\npoint of view is now some one hundred and fifty years old.\nIt will not do to say that it is that much behind the times;\nbecause its time-worn standards of truth and validity are a very\nmaterial factor in the makeup of "our time." That such is the\ncase is due in great part to the fact that this body of\nprinciples was stabilised at that time and that they have\ntherefore stood over intact, in spite of other changes that have\ntaken place. It is only that the principles which had been tested\nand found good under the conditions of life in the modern era up\nto that time were at that time held fast, canvassed, defined,\napproved, and stabilised by being reduced to documentary form. In\nsome sense they were then written into the constitution of\ncivilised society, and they have continued to make up the nucleus\nof the document from that time forth; and so they have become\ninflexible, after the fashion of written constitutions.\nIn the sight of those generations who so achieved the\ndefinite acceptance of these enlightened modern principles, and\nwho finally made good their formal installation in law and usage\nas self-balanced canons of human conduct, the principles which\nthey so arrived at had all the sanction of Natural Law, --\nimpersonal, dispassionate, indefeasible and immutable;\nfundamentally and eternally right and good. That generation of\nmen held "these truths to be self-evident"; and they have\ncontinued so to be held since that epoch by all those peoples who\nmake up the effectual body of modern civilisation. And the\nbackward peoples, those others who have since then been coming\ninto line and making their claim to a place in the scheme of\nmodern civilised life, have also successively been accepting and\n(passably) assimilating the same enlightened principles of clean\nand honest living. Christendom, as a going concern of civilised\npeoples, has continued to regulate its affairs by the help of\nthese principles, which are still held to be a competent\nformulation of the aspirations of civilised mankind. So that\nthese modern principles of the eighteenth century, stabilised in\ndocumentary form a hundred and fifty years ago, have stood over\nin immutable perfection until our time,a monument more enduring\nthan brass.\nThese principles are of the nature of habits of thought, of\ncourse; and it is the nature of habits of thought forever to\nshift and change in response to the changing impact of\nexperience, since they are creatures of habituation. But inasmuch\nas they have once been stabilised in a thoroughly competent\nfashion in the eighteenth century, and have been drafted into\nfinished documentary form, they have been enabled to stand over\nunimpaired into the present with all that weight and stability\nthat a well-devised documentary formulation will give. It is\ntrue, so far as regards the conditions of civilised life during\nthe interval that has passed since these modern principles of law\nand custom took on their settled shape in the eighteenth century,\nit has been a period of unexampled change, -- swift, varied,\nprofound and extensive beyond example. And it follows of\nnecessity that the principles of conduct which were approved and\nstabilised in the eighteenth century, under the driving\nexigencies of that age, have not altogether escaped the\ncomplications of changing circumstances. They have at least come\nin for some shrewd interpretation in the course of the nineteenth\ncentury. There have been refinements of definition, extensions of\napplication, scrutiny and exposition of implications, as new\nexigencies have arisen and the established canons have been\nrequired to cover unforeseen contingencies; but it has all been\ndone with the explicit reservation that no material innovation\nshall be allowed to touch the legacy of modern principles handed\ndown from the eighteenth century, and that the vital system of\nNatural Rights installed in the eighteenth century must not be\nderanged at any point or at any cost.\nIt is scarcely necessary to describe this modern system of\nprinciples that still continues to govern human intercourse among\nthe civilised peoples, or to attempt an exposition of its\nconstituent articles. It is all to be had in exemplary form, ably\nincorporated in such familiar documents as the American\nDeclaration of Independence, the French Declaration of the Rights\nof Man, and the American Constitution; and it is all to be found\nset forth with all the circumstance of philosophical and juristic\nscholarship in the best work of such writers as John Locke.\nMontesquieu. Adam Smith, or Blackstone. It has all been\nsufficiently canvassed, through all its dips, spurs and angles,\nby the most competent authorities, who have brought their best\nwill and their best abilities to bear on its elucidation at every\npoint, with full documentation. Besides which, there is no need\nof recondite exposition for the present purpose; since all that\nis required by the present argument is such a degree of\ninformation on these matters as is familiar to English-speaking\npersons by common notoriety.\nAt the same time it may be to the purpose to call to mind\nthat this secular profession of faith enters creatively into that\nestablished order of things which has now fallen into a state of\nhavoc because it does not meet the requirements of the new order.\nThis eighteenth-century modern plan specifically makes provision\nfor certain untoward rights, perquisites and disabilities which\nhave, in the course of time and shifting circumstance, become\nincompatible with continued peace on earth and good-will among\nmen.\nThere are two main counts included in this modern --\neighteenth-century -- plan, which appear unremittingly to make\nfor discomfort and dissension under the conditions offered by the\nNew Order of things: -- National Ambition, and the Vested Rights\nof ownership. Neither of the two need be condemned as being\nintrinsically mischievous. Indeed, it may be true, as has often\nbeen argued, that both have served a good purpose in their due\ntime and place; at least there is no need of arguing the\ncontrary. Both belong in the settled order of civilised life; and\nboth alike are countenanced by those principles of truth, equity\nand validity that go to make up the modern point of view. It is\nonly that now, as things have been turning during the later one\nhundred years, both of these immemorially modern rights of man\nhave come to yield a net return of hardship and ill-will for all\nthose peoples who have bound up their fortunes with that kind of\nenterprise. The case might be stated to this effect, that the\nfault lies not in the nature of these untoward institutions of\nnational sovereignty and vested rights, nor in those principles\nof self-help which underlie them, but only in those latter-day\nfacts which stubbornly refuse to fall into such lines as these\nforms of human enterprise require for their perfect and\nbeneficent working. The facts, particularly the facts of industry\nand science, have outrun these provisions of law and custom; and\nso the scheme of things has got out of joint by that much,\nthrough no inherent weakness in the underlying principles of law\nand custom. The ancient and honorable principles of self-help are\nas sound as ever; it is only that the facts have quite\nunwarrantably not remained the same. The fault lies in the\nlatter-day facts, which have not continued in suitable shape.\nSuch, in effect, has been the view habitually spoken for by many\nthoughtful persons of a conservative turn, who take an interest\nin concerting measures for holding fast that which once was good,\nin the face of distasteful facts.\nThe vested right of ownership in all kinds of property has\nthe sanction of the time-honored principles of individual\nself-direction, equal opportunity, free contract, security of\nearnings and belongings, self-help, in the simple and honest\nmeaning of the word. It would be quite bootless to find fault\nwith these reasonable principles of tolerance and security. Their\ndefinitive acceptance and stabilisation in the eighteenth century\nare among the illustrious achievements of Western civilisation;\nand their roots lie deep in the native wisdom of mankind. They\nare obvious corollaries under the rule of Live and let live, --\nan Accidental version of the Golden Rule. Yet in practical effect\nthose vested rights which rest blamelessly on these reasonable\ncanons of tolerance and good faith have today become the focus of\nvexation and misery in the life of the civilised peoples.\nCircumstances have changed to such effect that provisions which\nwere once framed to uphold a system of neighborly good-will have\nnow begun to run counter to one another and are working mischief\nto the common good.\nAny impartial survey of the past one-hundred-fifty years will\nshow that the constituent principles of this modern point of view\ngoverning the mutual rights and obligations of men within the\ncivilised nations have held their ground, on the whole, without\nmaterial net gain or net loss. It is the ground of Natural\nRights, of self-help and free bargaining. Civil rights and the\nperquisites and obligations of ownership have remained\nsubstantially intact over this interval of a hundred and fifty\nyears, but with some slight advance in the way of Live and let\nlive at certain points, and some slight retrenchment at other\npoints. So far as regards the formal stipulations, in law and\ncustom, the balance of class interests within these countries\nhas, on the whole, not been seriously disturbed. In this system\nof Natural Rights, as it has worked out in practice, the rights\nof ownership are paramount; largely because the other personal\nrights in the case have come to be a matter of course and so have\nceased to hold men\'s attention.\nSo, in the matter of the franchise, e.g., the legal\nprovisions more nearly meet the popular ideals of the modern\npoint of view today than ever before. An the other hand the\nguiding principles in the case at certain other points have\nundergone a certain refinement of interpretation with a view to\ngreater ease and security for trade and investment; and there\nhas, in effect, been some slight abridgement of the freedom of\ncombination and concerted action at any point where an unguarded\nexercise of such freedom would hamper trade or curtail the\nprofits of business, -- for the modern era has turned out to be\nan era of business enterprise, dominated by the paramount claims\nof trade and investment. In point of formal requirements, these\nrestrictions imposed on concerted action "in restraint of trade"\nfall in equal measure on the vested interests engaged in business\nand on the working population engaged in industry. So that the\nmeasures taken to safeguard the natural rights of ownership apply\nwith equal force to those who own and those who do not. "The\nmajestic equality of the law forbids the rich as well as the poor\nto sleep under bridges or to beg on the street corners." But it\nhas turned out on trial that the vested interests of business are\nnot seriously hampered by these restrictions; inasmuch as any\nformal restriction on any concerted action between the owners of\nsuch vested interests can always be got around by a formal\ncoalition of ownership in the shape of a corporation. The\nextensive resort to corporate combination of ownership, which is\nso marked a feature of the nineteenth century, was not foreseen\nand was not taken into account in the eighteenth century, when\nthe constituent principles of the modern point of view found\ntheir way into the common law. The system of Natural Rights is a\nsystem of personal rights, among which the rights of ownership\nare paramount; and among the rights of ownership is the right of\nfree disposal and security of ownership and of credit\nobligations.\nThe same line of evasion is not available in the same degree\nfor concerted action between persons who own nothing. Still, in\nneither case, neither as regards the owners of the country\'s\nwealth nor as regards the common man, can these restrictions on\npersonal freedom of action be said to be a serious burden. And\nany slight mutilation or abridgement of the rule of self-help in\ntheir economic relations has been offset by an increasingly broad\nand liberal construction of the principles of self-direction and\nequality among men in their civil capacity and their personal\nrelations. Indeed, the increasingly exacting temper of the common\nman in these countries during this period has made such an\noutcome unavoidable. By and large, in its formal vindication of\npersonal liberty and equality before the law, the modern point of\nview has with singular consistency remained intact in the shape\nin which its principles were stabilised in the eighteenth\ncentury, in spite of changing circumstances. In point of formal\ncompliance with their demands, the enlightened ideals of the\neighteenth century are, no doubt, more commonly realised in\npractice today than at any earlier period. So that the modern\ncivilised countries are now, in point of legal form and perhaps\nalso in practical effect, more nearly a body of ungraded and\nmasterless men than any earlier generation has known how to be.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"In this modern era, as well as elsewhere and in other times, \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'the circumstances that make for change and reconstruction have\nbeen chiefly the material circumstances of everyday life, --\ncircumstances affecting the ordinary state of industry and\nordinary intercourse. These material circumstances have changed\nnotably during the modern era. There has been a progressive\nchange in the state of the industrial arts, which has materially\naltered the scope and method of industry and the conditions under\nwhich men live in all the civilised countries. Accordingly, as a\npoint of comparison, it will be to the purpose to call to mind\nwhat were the material circumstances, and more particularly the\nstate of the industrial arts, which underlay and gave character\nto the modern point of view at the period when its constituent\nprinciples were found good and worked out as a stable and\narticulate system, in the shape in which they have continued to\nbe held since then.\nThe material conditions of industry, trade and daily life\nduring the period of transition and approach to this modern\nground created that frame of mind which we call the modern point\nof view and dictated that reconstruction of institutional\narrangements which has been worked out under its guidance.\nTherefore the economic situation which so underlay and\nconditioned this modern point of view at the period when it was\ngiven its stable form becomes the necessary point of departure\nfor any argument bearing on the changes that have been going\nforward since then, or on any prospective reconstruction that may\nbe due to follow from these changed conditions in the calculable\nfuture. An this head, the students of history are in a singularly\nfortunate position. The whole case is set forth in the works of\nAdam Smith, with a comprehension and lucidity which no longer\ncalls for praise. Beyond all other men Adam Smith is the approved\nand faithful spokesman of this modern point of view in all that\nconcerns the economic situation which it assumes as its material\nground; and his description of the state of civilised society,\ntrade and industry, as he saw it in his time and as he wished it\nto stand over into the future, is to be taken without abatement\nas a competent exposition of those material conditions which were\nthen conceived to underlie civilised society and to dictate the\nonly sound reconstruction of civil and economic institutions\naccording to the modern plan.\nBut like other men. Adam Smith was a creature of his own\ntime, and what he has to say applies to the state of things as he\nsaw them. What he describes and inquires into is that state of\nthings which was to him the "historical present"; which always\nsignifies the recent past, -- that is to say, the past as it had\ncome under his observation and as it had shaped his outlook.\nAs it is conventionally dated, the Industrial Revolution took\neffect within Adam Smith\'s active lifetime, and some of its more\nsignificant beginnings passed immediately under his eyes; indeed,\nit is related that he took an active personal interest in at\nleast one of the epoch-making mechanical inventions from which\nthe era of the machine industry takes its date. Yet the\nIndustrial Revolution does not lie within Adam Smith\'s\n"historical present," nor does his system of economic doctrines\nmake provision for any of its peculiar issues. What he has to say\non the mechanics of industry is conceived in terms derived from\nan older order of things than that machine industry which was\nbeginning to get under way in his own life-time; and all his\nillustrative instances and arguments on trade and industry are\nalso such as would apply to the state of things that was passing,\nbut they are not drawn with any view to that new order which was\nthen coming on in the world of business enterprise.\nThe economic situation contemplated by Adam Smith as the\nnatural (and ultimate) state of industry and trade in any\nenlightened society, conducted on sane and sound lines according\nto the natural order of human relations, was of a simple\nstructure and may be drawn in few lines, -- neglecting such minor\nextensions and exceptions as would properly be taken account of\nin any exhaustive description. Industry is conceived to be of the\nnature of handicraft; not of the nature of mechanical\nengineering, such as it has in effect and progressively come to\nbe since his time. It is described as a matter of workmanlike\nlabor, "and of the skill, dexterity and judgment with which it is\ncommonly applied." It is a question of the skilled workman and\nhis use of tools. Mechanical inventions are "labor-saving\ndevices," which "facilitate and abridge labor." The material\nequipment is the ways and means by manipulation of which the\nworkman gets his work done. "Capital stock" is spoken of as\nsavings parsimoniously accumulated out of the past industry of\nits owner, or out of the industry of those persons from whom he\nhas legally acquired it by inheritance or in exchange for the\nproducts of his own labor. Business is of the nature of "petty\ntrade" and the business man is a "middle man" who is employed for\na livelihood in the distribution of goods to the consumers. Trade\nis subsidiary to industry, and money is a vehicle designed to be\nused for the distribution of goods. Credit is an expedient of the\nneedy; a dubious expedient. Profits (including interest) are\njustified as a reasonable remuneration for productive work done,\nand for the labor-saving use of property derived from the owner\'s\npast labor. The efforts of masters and workmen alike are\nconceived to be bent on turning out the largest and most\nserviceable output of goods; and prices are competitively\ndetermined by the labor-cost of the goods.\nLike other men Adam Smith did not see into the future beyond\nwhat was calculable on the data given by his own historical\npresent; and in his time that later and greater era of investment\nand financial enterprise which has made industry subsidiary to\nbusiness was only beginning to get under way and only obscurely\nso. So that he was still able to think of commercial enterprise\nas a middle-man\'s traffic in merchandise, subsidiary to a\nsmall-scale industry on the order of handicraft, and due to an\nassumed propensity in men "to truck, barter, and exchange one\nthing for another." And so much as he could not help seeing of\nthe new order of business enterprise which was coming in was not\nrated by him as a sane outgrowth of that system of Natural\nLiberty for which he spoke and about which his best affections\ngathered. In all this he was at one with his thoughtful\ncontemporaries.\nThat generation of public-spirited men went, perforce, on the\nscant data afforded by their own historical present, the economic\nsituation as they saw it in the perspective and with the\npreconceptions of their own time; and to them it was accordingly\nplain that when all unreasonable restrictions are taken away,\n"the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes\nitself of its own accord." To this "natural" plan of free\nworkmanship and free trade all restraint or retardation by\ncollusion among business men was wholly obnoxious, and all\ncollusive control of industry or of the market was accordingly\nexecrated as unnatural and subversive. It is true, there were\neven then some appreciable beginnings of coercion and retardation\n-- lowering of wages and limitation of output -- by collusion\nbetween owners and employers who should by nature have been\ncompetitive producers of an unrestrained output of goods and\nservices according to the principles of that modern point of view\nwhich animated Adam Smith and his generation; but coercion and\nunearned gain by a combination of ownership, of the now familiar\ncorporate type, was virtually unknown in his time. So Adam Smith\nsaw and denounced the dangers of unfair combination between\n"masters" for the exploitation of their workmen, but the modern\nuse of credit and corporation finance for the collective control\nof the labor market and the goods market of course does not come\nwithin his horizon and does not engage his attention.\nSo also Adam Smith knows and denounces the use of protective\ntariffs for private gain. That means of pilfering was familiar\nenough in his time. But he spends little indignation on the\nequally nefarious use of the national establishment for\nsafe-guarding and augmenting the profits of traders,\nconcessionaires, investors and creditors in foreign parts at the\ncost of the home community. That method of taxing the common man\nfor the benefit of the vested interests has also grown to more\nformidable proportions since his time. The constituent principles\nof the modern point of view, as accepted advisedly or by\noversight by Adam Smith and his generation, supply all the\nlegitimation required for this larcenous use of the national\nestablishment; but the means of communication were still too\nscant, and the larger use of credit was too nearly untried, as\ncontrasted with what has at a later date gone to make the\ncommercial ground and incentive of imperialist politics.\nTherefore the imperialist policies of public enterprise for\nprivate gain also do not come greatly within the range of Adam\nSmith\'s vision of the future, nor does the "obvious and simple\nsystem" on which he and his generation of thoughtful men take\ntheir stand comprise anything like explicit declarations for or\nagainst this later-matured chicane of the gentlemen-investors who\nhave been managing the affairs of the civilised nations.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Adam Smith's work and life-time falls in with the high tide \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"of eighteenth-century insight and understanding, and it marks an\nepoch of spiritual achievement and stabilisation in civil\ninstitutions, as well as in those principles of conduct that have\ngoverned economic rights and relations since that date. But it\nmarks also the beginning of a new order in the state of the\nindustrial arts as well as in those material sciences which come\ndirectly in touch with the industrial arts and which take their\nlogical bent from the same range of tangible experience. So it\nhappens that this modern point of view reached a stable and\nsymmetrical finality about the same date when the New Order of\nexperience and insight was beginning to bend men's habits of\nthought into lines that run at cross purposes with this same\nstabilised point of view. It is in the ways and means of industry\nand in the material sciences that the new order of knowledge and\nbelief first comes into evidence; because it is in this domain of\nworkday facts that men's experience began about that time to take\na decisive turn at variance with the received canons. A\nmechanistic conception of things began to displace those\nessentially romantic notions of untrammeled initiative and\nrationality that governed the intellectual life of the era of\nenlightenment which was then drawing to a close.\nIt is logically due to follow that the same general\nprinciples of knowledge and validity will presently undergo a\nrevision of the same character where they have to do with those\nimponderable facts of human conduct and those conventions of law\nand custom that govern the duties and obligations of men in\nsociety. Here and now as elsewhere and in other times the\nstubborn teaching that comes of men's experience with the\ntangible facts of industry should confidently be counted on to\nmake the outcome, so as to bring on a corresponding revision of\nwhat is right and good in that world of make-believe that always\nunderlies any established system of law and custom. The material\nexigencies of the state of industry are unavoidable, and in great\npart unbending; and the economic conditions which follow\nimmediately from these exigencies imposed by the ways and means\nof industry are only less uncompromising than the mechanical\nfacts of industry itself. And the men who live under the rule of\nthese economic exigencies are constrained to make their peace\nwith them, to enter into such working arrangements with one\nanother as these unbending conditions of the state of the\nindustrial arts will tolerate, and to cast their system of\nimponderables on lines which can be understood by the same men\nwho understand the industrial arts and the system of material\nscience which underlies the industrial arts. So that, in due\ncourse, the accredited schedule of legal and moral rights,\nperquisites and obligations will also presently be brought into\npassable consistency with the ways and means whereby the\ncommunity gets its living.\nBut it is also logically to be expected that any revision of\nthe established rights, obligations, perquisites and vested\ninterests will trail along behind the change which has taken\neffect in the material circumstances of the community and in the\ncommunity's knowledge and belief with regard to these material\ncircumstances; since any such revision of ancient rights and\nperquisites will necessarily be consequent upon and conditioned\nby that change, and since the axioms of law and custom that\nunderlie any established schedule of rights and perquisites are\nalways of the nature of make-believe; and the make-believe is\nnecessarily built up out of conceptions derived from the\naccustomed range of knowledge and belief.\nOut-worn axioms of this make-believe order become\nsuperstitions when the scope and method of workday knowledge has\noutgrown that particular range of preconceptions out of which\nthese make-believe axioms are constructed; which comes to saying\nthat the underlying principles of the system of law and morals\nare therewith caught in a process of obsolescence, --\n\"depreciation by supersession and disuse.\" By a figure of speech\nit might be said that the community's intangible assets embodied\nin this particular range of imponderables have shrunk by that\nmuch, through the decay of these imponderables that are no longer\nseasonable, and through their displacement by other figments of\nthe human brain, -- a consensus of brains trained into closer\nconsonance with the latter-day material conditions of life.\nSomething of this kind, something in the way of depreciation by\ndisplacement, appears now to be overtaking that system of\nimponderables that has been handed down into current law and\ncustom out of that range of ideas and ideals that had the vogue\nbefore the coming of the machine industry and the material\nsciences.\nSince the underlying principles of the established order are\nof this make-believe character, that is to say, since they are\nbuilt up out of the range of conceptions that have habitually\nbeen doing duty as the substance of knowledge and belief in the\npast, it follows in the nature of the case that any\nreconstruction of institutions will be made only tardily,\nreluctantly, and sparingly; inasmuch as settled habits of thought\nare given up tardily, reluctantly and sparingly. And this will\nparticularly be true when the reconstruction of unseasonable\ninstitutions runs counter to a settled and honorable code of\nancient principles and a stubborn array of vested interests, as\nin this instance.

The truths which it holds to be self-evident and\nindefeasible are conceived to be intrinsically bound up in an\nover-ruling Order of Nature; in which thoughtful men habitually\nbelieved at that time and in which less thoughtful men have\ncontinued to believe since then. This eighteenth-century order of\nnature, in the magic name of which Adam Smith was in the habit of\nspeaking, was conceived on lines of personal initiative and\nactivity. It is an order of things in which men were conceived to\nbe effectually equal in all those respects that are of any\ndecided consequence, -- in intelligence, working capacity,\ninitiative, opportunity, and personal worth; in which the\ncreative factor engaged in industry was the workman, with his\npersonal skill, dexterity and judgment; in which, it was\nbelieved, the employer ("master") served his own ends and sought\nhis own gain by consistently serving the needs of creative labor,\nand thereby serving the common good; in which the traders\n("middle-men") made an honest living by supplying goods to\nconsumers at a price determined by labor cost, and so serving the\ncommon good.\nThis characterisation of the "obvious and simple system" that\nlies at the root of the liberal ideals may seem too much of a\ndream to any person who shuns "the scientific use of the\nimagination"; its imponderables may seem to lack that axiomatic\nself-sufficiency which one would like to find in the spiritual\nfoundations of a working system of law and custom. Indeed, the\nbest of its imponderables are in a fair way now to drop back into\nthe discard of uncertified make-believe. But in point of\nhistorical fact it appears to have stood the test of time and\nuse, so far as appears formally on the face of law and custom.\nFor a hundred years and more it has continued to stand as a\nfamiliar article of faith and aspiration among the advocates of a\nLiberal policy in civil and economic affairs; and Adam Smith\'s\nfollowers -- the economists and publicists of the Liberal\nmovement -- have spoken for it as being the normal system of\neconomic life, the "natural state of man," from which the course\nof events has been conceived to depart only under pressure of\n"disturbing causes," and to which the course of events must be\npruned back at all hazards in the event of any threatened advance\nor departure beyond the "natural" bounds set by this working\nideal.\nHowever, the subsequent course of events has shown no\nindisposition to depart from this normal system of economic life,\nthis "natural state of man," on the effectual reality of which\nthe modern point of view rests its inviolate principles of law\nand morals and economic expediency. A new order of things has\nbeen taking effect in the state of the industrial arts and in the\nmaterial sciences that lie nearest to that tangible body of\nexperience out of which the state of the industrial arts is\nframed. And the new order of industrial ways and means has been\nprogressively going out of touch with the essential requirements\nof this established scheme of individual self-help and personal\ninitiative, on the realisation and maintenance of which the best\nendeavors of the Liberals have habitually been spent.\nUnder the new order the first requisite of ordinary\nproductive industry is no longer the workman and his manual\nskill, but rather the mechanical equipment and the standardised\nprocesses in which the mechanical equipment is engaged. And this\nlatter-day industrial equipment and process embodies not the\nmanual skill, dexterity and judgment of an individual workman,\nbut rather the accumulated technological wisdom of the community.\nUnder the new order of things the mechanical equipment -- the\n"industrial plant" -- takes the initiative, sets the pace, and\nturns the workman to account in the carrying-on of those\nstandardised processes of production that embody this mechanistic\nstate of the industrial arts; very much as the individual\ncraftsman in his time held the initiative in industry, set the\npace, and made use of his tools according to his own discretion\nin the exercise of his personal skill, dexterity and judgment,\nunder that now obsolescent industrial order which underlies the\neighteenth-century modern point of view, and which still colors\nthe aspirations of Liberal statesmen and economists, as well as\nthe standard economic theories.\nThe workman -- and indeed it is still the skilled workman --\nis always indispensable to the due working of this mechanistic\nindustrial process, of course; very much as the craftsman\'s\ntools, in his time, were indispensable to the work which he had\nin hand. But the unit of industrial organization and procedure,\nwhat may be called the "going concern" in production, is now the\noutfit of industrial equipment, a works, engaged in a given\nstandardised mechanical process designed to turn out a given\noutput of standardised product; it is the plant, or the shop. And\nunder this new order of industrial methods and values it has\nalready come to be a commonplace of popular "knowledge and\nbelief" that the mechanical equipment is the creative factor in\nindustry, and the "production" of the output is credited to the\nplant\'s working capacity and set down to its account as a going\nconcern; whereas the other factors engaged, as e.g., workmen and\nmaterials, are counted in as auxiliary factors which are\nindispensable but subsidiary -- items of production-cost which\nare incorporated in the running expenses of the plant and its\nproductive process.\nUnder the new order the going concern in production is the\nplant or shop, the works, not the individual workman. The plant\nembodies a standardised industrial process. The workman is made\nuse of according as the needs of the given mechanical process may\nrequire. The time, place, rate, and material conditions of the\nwork in hand are determined immediately by the mechanically\nstandardised process in which the given plant is engaged; and\nbeyond that all these matters are dependent on the exigencies and\nmanoeuvres of business, largely by way of moderating the rate of\nproduction and keeping the output reasonably short of maximum\ncapacity. The workman has become subsidiary to the mechanical\nequipment, and productive industry has become subservient to\nbusiness, in all those countries which have come in for the\nlatter-day state of the industrial arts, and which so have fallen\nunder the domination of the price system.\nSuch is the state of things throughout in those greater\nindustries that are characteristic of the New Order; and these\ngreater industries now set the pace and make the standards of\nmanagement and valuation for the rest. At the same time these\ngreater industries of the machine era extend their domination\nbeyond their own immediate work, and enforce a standardisation of\nmuch the same mechanical character in the community at large; in\nthe ways and means of living as well as in the ways and means of\nwork. The effects of their mechanically standardised production,\nin the way of goods and services as well as in the similarly\nstandardised traffic through which these goods and services are\ndistributed to the consumers, reach out into the everyday life of\nall classes; but most immediately and imperatively they reach the\nworking class of the industrial centers. So they largely set the\npace for the ordinary occupations of the common man even apart\nfrom any employment in the greater mechanical industries. It is\nespecially the latter-day system of transport and communication\nas it works out under the new order highly mechanical and\nexactingly scheduled for time, rate and place -- that so controls\nand standardises the ordinary life of the common man on\nmechanical lines.\nThe training enforced by this mechanical standardisation,\ntherefore, is of much the same order throughout the community as\nit is within the mechanical industries proper, and it drives to\nthe same outcome, -- submergence of the personal equation. So\nthat the workday information and the reasoning by use of which\nall men carry on their daily life under the new order is of the\nsame general character as that information and reasoning which\nguides the mechanical engineers; and the unremitting habituation\nto its scope and method, its principles of knowledge and belief,\nleads headlong to a mechanistic conception of things, ways,\nmeans, ends, and values, whether it is called by that name or\nnot. The resulting frame of mind is often spoken of as\nMaterialism. This impersonal character of workday habituation is\nparticularly to be counted on to take decisive effect wherever\nthe latter-day scheme of mechanical standardisation takes effect\nwith all that wide sweep and massive drift with which it now\ndominates the larger centers of population.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Since the modern era began, the state of the industrial arts \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'has been undergoing a change of type. Such as the followers of\nMendel would call a "mutation." And in the course of this\nmutation the workman and his part in the conduct of industry have\nsuffered as great a dislocation as any of the other factors\ninvolved. But it is also to be admitted that the typical\nowner-employer of the earlier modern time, such as he stood in\nthe mind\'s eye of the eighteenth-century doctrinaires, -- this\ntraditional owner-employer has also come through the period of\nthe mutation in a scarcely better state of preservation. At the\nperiod of this stabilisation of principles in the eighteenth\ncentury, he could still truthfully be spoken of as a "master," a\nforeman of the shop, and he was then still invested with a large\nreminiscence of the master-craftsman, as known in the time of the\ncraft-gilds. He stood forth in the eighteenth-century argument on\nthe Natural Order of things as the wise and workmanlike designer\nand guide of his workmen\'s handiwork, and he was then still\npresumed to be living in workday contact and communion with them\nand to deal with them on an equitable footing of personal\ninterest.\nSuch a characterisation of the capitalist-employer who was\ndoing business at the time of the Industrial Revolution may seem\nover-drawn; and there is no need of insisting on its precise\naccuracy as a description of eighteenth-century facts. But it\nshould not be extremely difficult to show that substantially such\na figure of an employer-owner was had in mind by those who then\nargued the questions of wages and employment and laid down the\nlines on which the employment of labor would be expected to\narrange itself under the untroubled system of natural liberty.\nBut what is more to the point is that which is beyond question.\nIn practical fact, almost as fully as in the speculations of the\ndoctrinaires, the employer of labor in the staple industries of\nthat time was, in his own person, commonly also the owner of the\nestablishment in which his hired workmen were employed; and also\n-- again in passable accord with the facts -- he was presumed\npersonally to come to terms with his workmen about wages and\nconditions of work. Employment was considered to be a relation of\nman to man. That much is explicit in the writings which bear the\ndate-mark of this modern Liberal point of view; and the same\nassumption has continued to stand over as a self-sufficient\npremise among the defenders of the free competitive system in\nindustry, for three or four generations after that period.\nBut the course of events has gone its own way, and about that\ntime -- somewhere along in the middle half of the eighteenth\ncentury -- that type of employer began to be displaced in those\nstaple industries which have since then set the pace and made the\noutcome for wages and conditions of work. So soon as the machine\nindustry began to make headway, the industrial plant increased in\nsize, and the number of workmen employed in each establishment\ngrew continually larger; until in the course of time the large\nscale of organisation in industry has put any relation of man to\nman out of the question between employers and workmen in the\nleading industries. Indeed, it is not unusual to find that in an\nindustrial plant of a large or middling size, a factory, mill,\nworks, mine, shipyard or railway of the ordinary sort, very few\nof the workmen would be able, under oath, to identify their\nowner. At the same time, and owing to the same requirements of\nlarge-scale and mechanical organisation, the ownership of the\nworks has also progressively been changing character; so that\ntoday, in the large and leading industries, the place of the\npersonal employer-owner is taken by a composite business concern\nwhich represents a combination of owners, no one of whom is\nindividually responsible for the concern\'s transactions. So true\nis this, that even where the ownership of a given industrial\nestablishment still vests wholly or mainly in a single person, it\nhas commonly been found expedient to throw the ownership into the\ncorporate form, with limited liability.\nThe personal employer-owner has virtually disappeared from\nthe great industries. His place is now filled by a list of\ncorporation securities and a staff of corporation officials and\nemployees who exercise a limited discretion. The personal note is\nno longer to be had in the wage relation, except in those\nbackward, obscure and subsidiary industries in which the\nmechanical reorganisation of the new order has not taken effect.\nSo, even that contractual arrangement which defines the workman\'s\nrelation to the establishment in which he is employed, and to the\nanonymous corporate ownership by which he is employed, now takes\nthe shape of a statistical reckoning, in which virtually no trace\nof the relation of man to man is to be found. Yet the principles\nof the modern point of view governing this contractual relation,\nin current law and custom, are drawn on the assumption that wages\nand conditions of work are arranged for by free bargaining\nbetween man and man on a footing of personal understanding and\nequal opportunity.\nThat the facts of the New Order have in this way departed\nfrom the ground on which the constituent principles of the modern\npoint of view are based, and on which therefore the votaries of\nthe established system take their stand, -- this state of things\ncan not be charged to anyone\'s personal account and made a\nsubject of recrimination. In fact, it is not a case for personal\ndiscretion and responsibility in detail, but rather for concerted\naction looking to some practicable working arrangement.\nThe personal equation is no longer a material factor in the\nsituation. Ownership, too, has been caught in the net of the New\nOrder and has been depersonalised to a degree beyond what would\nhave been conceivable a hundred years ago, especially so far as\nit has to do with the use of material resources and man power in\nthe greater industries. Ownership has been "denatured" by the\ncourse of events; so that it no longer carries its earlier duties\nand responsibilities. It used to be true that personally\nresponsible discretion in all details was the chief and abiding\npower conferred by ownership; but wherever it has to do with the\nmachine industry and large-scale organisation, ownership now has\nvirtually lost this essential part of its ordinary functions. It\nhas taken the shape of an absentee ownership of anonymous\ncorporate capital, and in the ordinary management of this\ncorporate capital the greater proportion of the owners have no\nvoice.\nThis impersonal corporate capital, which is taking the place\nof the personal employer-owner of earlier times, is the outcome\nof a mutation of the scheme of things in business enterprise,\nscarcely less profound than the change which has overtaken the\nmaterial equipment in the shift from handicraft methods to the\nmachine technology. In practical fact today, corporate capital is\nthe capitalised earning capacity of the corporation considered as\na going business concern; and the ownership of this capital\ntherefore foots up to a claim on the earnings of the corporation.\nCorporate capital of this kind is impersonal in more than one\nsense: it may be transferred piecemeal from one owner to another\nwithout visibly affecting the management or the rating of the\nconcern whose securities change hands in this way; and the\npersonal identity of the owner of any given block of this capital\nneed not be known even to the concern itself, to its\nadministrative officers, or to those persons whose daily work and\nneeds are bound up with the daily transactions of the concern.\nFor most purposes and as regards the greater proportion of the\ninvestors who in this way own the corporation\'s capital, these\nowners are, in effect, anonymous creditors, whose sole effectual\nrelation to the enter prise is that of a fixed "overhead charge"\non its operations. Such is the case even in point of form as\nregards the investors in corporate bonds and preferred stock. The\nordinary investor is, in effect, an anonymous pensioner on the\nenterprise; his relation to industry is in the nature of a\nliability, and his share in the conduct of this industry is much\nlike the share which the Old Man of the Sea once had in the\npromenades of Sinbad.\nNo doubt, any reasonably skilful economist any certified\naccountant of economic theory -- could successfully question the\ngoodness of this characterisation of corporate capital. It is, in\nfact, not such a description as is commonly met with in those\ntheories of ownership and investment that trace back to the\nformal definitions of Ricardo and Adam Smith. Nor is this\ndescription of latter-day facts here set down as a formal\ndefinition of corporate capital and its uses; nor is it designed\nto fit into that traditional scheme of conceptions that still\nholds the attention of the certified economists. Its aim is the\nless ambitious one of describing, in a loose and informal way,\nwhat is the nature and uses of this corporate capital and its\nownership, in the apprehension of the common man out of doors. He\nis not so familiar with the recondite wisdom of the past, or with\nsubtle definitions, other than the latter-day subtleties of the\nmarket, the crop season, the blast-furnace and refinery, the\ninternal-combustion engine, and such like hard and fast matters\nwith which he is required to get along from day to day. The\npurpose here is only to bring out, without undue precision, what\nthese interesting phenomena of capital, investment, fixed\ncharges, and the like, may be expected to foot up to in terms of\ntangible performance, in the unschooled reflections of the common\nman, who always comes in as "the party of the second part" in all\nthese manoeuvres of corporation finance. He commonly has no more\nthan a slender and sliding grasp of those honorable principles of\ncertified make-believe that distinguish the modern point of view\nin all that relates to property and its uses; but he has had the\nbenefit of some exacting experience in the ways of the new order\nand its standards of reckoning. By consequence of much untempered\nexperience the common man is beginning to see these things in the\nglaring though fitful light of that mechanistic conception that\nrates men and things on grounds of tangible performance, --\nwithout much afterthought. As seen in this light, and without\nmuch afterthought, very much of the established system of\nobligations, earnings, perquisites and emoluments, appears to\nrest on a network of make-believe. Now, it may be deplorable,\nperhaps inexcusable, that the New Order in industry should\nengender habits of thought of this unprofitable kind; but then,\nafter all, regrets and excuses do not make the outcome, and with\nsufficient reason attention today centers on the outcome.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"To the common man who has taken to reckoning in terms of \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'tangible performance, in terms of man power and material\nresources, these returns on investment that rest on productive\nenterprise as an overhead charge are beginning to look like\nunearned income. Indeed, the same unsympathetic preconception has\nlately come in for a degree of official recognition. High\nofficials who are presumed to speak with authority, discretion\nand an unbiassed mind have lately spoken of incomes from\ninvestments as "unearned incomes," and have even entertained a\nproject for subjecting such incomes to a differential rate of\ntaxation above what should fairly be imposed on "earned incomes,"\nAll this may, of course, be nothing more than an unseasonable\nlapse of circumspection on the part of the officials, who have\notherwise, on the whole, consistently lived up to the best\ntraditions of commercial sagacity; and a safe and sane\nlegislature has also canvassed the matter and solemnly disallowed\nany such invidious distinction between earned and unearned\nincomes. Still, this passing recognition of unearned incomes is\nscarcely less significant for being unguarded; and the occurrence\nlends a certain timeliness to any inquiry into the source and\nnature of that net product of industry out of which any fixed\noverhead charges of this kind are drawn.\nTo come to an understanding of the source and origin of this\nmargin of disposable revenue that goes to the earnings of\ncorporate capital, it is necessary to come to an understanding of\nthe industrial system out of which the disposable margin of\nrevenue arises. Productive industry yields a margin of net\nproduct over cost, counting cost in terms of man power and\nmaterial resources; and under the established rule of self-help\nand free bargaining as it works out in corporation finance, this\nmargin of net product has come to rest upon productive industry\nas an overhead charge payable to anonymous outsiders who own the\ncorporation securities.\nThere need be no question of the equity of this arrangement,\nas between the men at work in the industries and the\nbeneficiaries to whom the overhead charge is payable. At least\nthere is no intention here to question the equity of it, or to\ndefend the arrangement against any question that may be brought.\nIt is also to be remarked that the whole arrangement has this\nappearance of gratuitous handicap and hardship only when it is\nlooked at from the crude ground level of tangible performance.\nWhen seen in the dry light of the old and honest principles of\nself-help and equal opportunity, as understood by the substantial\nand well-meaning citizens, it all casts no shadow of iniquity or\ninexpediency.\nSo, without prejudice to any ulterior question which may be\nharbored by one and another, the question which is here had in\nmind is quite simply as to the production of this disposable\nmargin of net product over human cost. And to pass muster today,\nany attempted answer will be required to meet that exacting and\noften inconvenient insistence on palpable fact which is of the\nessence of the new order of knowledge and belief. It is necessary\nto reach an understanding of these things in terms of tangible\nperformance, in such terms as are germane to that new order of\nknowledge and belief out of which the perplexity arises, rather\nthan in those terms of equitable imputation that lie at the root\nof the certified economic doctrines and of corporation finance.\nThese relevant facts are neither particularly obscure nor\nparticularly elusive; only, they have had little attention in the\nargument of economists and politicians. Still less in the\nspeculations of the captains of finance. The partition of incomes\nhas always been more easily understood by these\npractically-minded persons, and it is also a more engrossing\nsubject of argumentation than the production of goods. This would\nbe particularly true for these economists and politicians, who\nare imbued with that legalistic spirit which pervades the modern\npoint of view and all its votaries.\nBut it is known to all, even to the most safely guarded\npersons who do not come in contact with industry or production,\nor even with the products of the staple industries, that industry\nat large will always turn out something in the way of a net\nmargin of product over human cost, -- over human effort and\nnecessary consumption. It holds true as far back as the records\nhave anything to say. It is evidently a question of the\nproductivity of the industrial arts. Men at work turn out a net\nproduct because they know how and are interested in doing it; and\ntheir output is limited by the industrial methods which they have\nthe use of. But the output is limited in such a way that it\nalways exceeds the cost by more or less, barring accident. By and\nlarge, throughout past time the industrial arts have been gaining\nin efficiency, and the ordinary margin of net product over cost\nhas consequently gone on widening. This is much of the meaning of\n"an advance in the industrial arts."\nIn an earlier time, by law and custom, the net margin of\nproduct habitually went to a master class, so-called, as the\n"earnings" or the due emoluments of their mastery over those\nindustrious classes who carried forward and gave effect to the\nstate of the industrial arts as known in their time. By virtue of\ntheir mastery and its incorporation in the institutions of the\ntime, they had an equitable, and effectual, vested interest in\nthe net product of the community\'s industry; and by virtue of the\nsame settled principles of law and custom it was for them to see\nto the due consumption of any such net product above cost. In\nlater times, and particularly in modern times and in the\ncivilised countries, those immemorial principles of privilege\nequitably vested in the master class have fallen into discredit\nas being not sufficiently grounded in fact; so that mastery and\nservitude are disallowed and have disappeared from the range of\nlegitimate institutions. The enlightened principles of self-help\nand personal equality do not tolerate these things. However, they\ndo tolerate free income from investments. Indeed, the most\nconsistent and most reputable votaries of the modern point of\nview commonly subsist on such income.\nEver since these enlightened principles of the modern point\nof view were first installed in the eighteenth century as the\nself-evident rule of reason in civilised life, the industrial\narts have also continued to gain in productive efficiency, at an\never-accelerated rate of gain; so that today the industrial\nmethods of the machine era are highly productive, beyond any\nearlier state of the industrial arts or anything that is known\noutside the range of this new order of industry. The output of\nthis industrial system yields a wider margin of net product over\ncost than has ever been obtainable by any other or earlier known\nmethod of work. It consequently affords ground for an uncommonly\nsubstantial vested interest in this disposable net margin.\nBut the industrial system of the new order will work at the\nhigh rate of efficiency of which it is capable, only under\nsuitable conditions. It is a comprehensive system of\ninterdependent working parts, organised on a large scale and with\nan exacting articulation of parts, -- works, mills, railways,\nshipping, groups and lines of industrial establishments, all\nworking together on a somewhat delicately balanced plan of mutual\ngive and take. No one member or section of this system is a\nself-sufficient industrial enterprise, even if it is true that no\none member is strictly dependent on any other one. Indeed, no one\nmember or section, group or line of industrial establishments, in\nthis industrial universe of the new order, is a productive factor\nat all, except as it fits into and duly gives and takes its share\nin the work of the system as a whole. Such exceptions to this\nrule of interlocking processes as may appear on first\nexamination, are likely to prove exceptions in appearance only.\nThey are chiefly the backward trades and occupations which have\nnot had the benefit of the Industrial Revolution and do not\nbelong under the new, mechanistic order of industry; or they are\ntrades, occupations and works devoted to the consumption of goods\nor to the maintenance of the rules governing the distribution and\nconsumption of wealth, as, for instance, banking, menial service,\npolice service and the apparatus of the law, the learned\nprofessions and the fine arts.\nIt is also of the essence of this industrial system and its\ntechnology that it necessarily involves the industrial community\nas a whole, its working population and its material resources;\nand the measure of its successful operation is determined by the\neffectual team-work of its constituent parts. And the industrial\nsystem of the new order is drawn on a large scale and rests on a\ncomprehensive specialisation of processes and standardisation of\noutput; so that the "community" which is required for the\nnecessary team-work is necessarily a large community; larger than\nthe total population and resources that would have served the\nlike purpose under any earlier state of the industrial arts, at\nthe same time that the needed coordination of processes is also\nwider and more delicately balanced than ever before. Indeed, the\n"industrial community" of the new order is always and necessarily\nlarger than any existing national unit. The ramification of give\nand take under the new industrial system invariably overlaps the\nnational frontiers, among all those peoples who occupy what would\nbe called an "advanced" place in industry. The system, and\ntherefore the industrial community engaged in team-work under\nthis system, is drawn on cosmopolitan or international lines,\nboth in respect of the body of technological knowledge which is\nturned to account and in respect of the range and volume of\nmaterials necessary to be used according to this new order in\nproductive industry.\nEvidently the total output of product turned out under this\nindustrial system, the "annual production," to use Adam Smith\'s\nphrase, or the "annual dividend," to use a phrase taken from\nlater usage, -- this total output is the output of the total\ncommunity working together as a balanced organisation of\nindustrial forces engaged in a moving equilibrium of production.\nNo part or fraction of the community is a productive factor in\nits own right and taken by itself, since no work can be done by\nany segment of the community in isolation from the rest; no one\nplant or works would be a producer in the absence of all the\nrest. The total product is the product of the total community\'s\nwork; or rather it is the product of the work of that fraction of\nthe people who are employed in productive work, which is not\nquite the same thing, since there is much work spent on the\nconsumption of goods, and on ways and means for such consumption,\nas well as on their production.\nIndeed, it is by no means certain that there is not more\ntime, strain and ingenuity spent on the consumption of goods than\non their production. Apart from sports, menial service,\nfashionable dress and equipage, pet animals and mandatory social\namenities, there would also have to be included under the ways\nand means of consumption virtually all that goes into\nsalesmanship and advertising. Virtually all of these things have\nto do with the organised consumption of goods; and virtually all\nare therefore to be written off as waste motion, so far as\nregards their effect on the net productive efficiency of the\nindustrial community, or of the industrial system whose tissues\nare consumed in enterprise of that kind. The amount which is to\nbe written off as consumptive waste in this way is approximately\nthe same as the net margin of product over cost; and according to\nthe enlightened principles of self-help and equal opportunity, as\nthese principles work out under the new order of industry, it is\nfor the investors to take care of this consumptive waste and to\nsee that no unconsumed residue is left over to cumber the market\nand produce a glut.\nEvidently, too, the amount of the annual production depends\non the state of the industrial arts which the working population\nhas the use of for the time being; which is in the main a matter\nof technological knowledge and popular education. So that the\nquestion of productivity and net productivity may be stated in\ngeneral terms to the following effect: The possible or potential\nproductive capacity of any given community, having the disposal\nof a given complement of man power and material resources, is a\nmatter of the state of the industrial arts, the technological\nknowledge, which the community has the use of. This sets the\nlimit, determines the "maximum" production of which the community\nis capable. The actual production in such a community will then\nbe determined by the extent to which the available technological\nefficiency is turned to account; which is regulated in part by\nthe intelligence, or "education," of the working population, and\nin greater part by market conditions which decide how large a\nproduct it will be profitable for the business men to turn out.\nThe net product is the amount by which this actual production\nexceeds its own cost, as counted in terms of subsistence, and\nincluding the cost of the necessary mechanical equipment; this\nnet product will then approximately coincide with the annual\nkeep, the cost of maintenance and replacement, of the investors\nor owners of capitalised property who are not engaged in\nproductive industry; and who are on this account sometimes spoken\nof as the "kept classes," Indeed, it would seem that the number\nand average cost per capita of the kept classes, communibus\nannis, affords something of a rough measure of the net product\nhabitually derived from the community\'s annual production.\nThe state of the industrial arts, therefore, is the\nindispensable conditioning circumstance which determines the\nproductive capacity of any given community; and this is true in a\npeculiar degree under this new order of industry, in which the\nindustrial arts have reached an unexampled development. The same\ndecisive factor may also be described as "the community\'s joint\nstock of technological knowledge." This common stock of\ntechnological knowledge decides what will be the ordinary ways\nand means of industry, and so it decides what will be the\ncharacter and volume of the output of product which a given man\npower is capable of turning out. Evidently no man power and no\nworking population can turn out any annual product without the\nuse of something in the way of technological knowledge, that is\nto say some state of the industrial arts. The working community\nis a productive factor only by virtue of, and only up to the\nlimit set by, the state of the industrial arts which it has the\nuse of. The contrast of industrial Japan or of industrial Germany\nbefore the middle of the nineteenth century and after the close\nof the century will serve for illustration; that is to say before\nand after those peoples had come in for the use of the technology\nof the machine era. The disposable excess of the yearly product\nover cost is a matter of the efficiency of the available state of\ntechnological knowledge, and of the measure in which the working\npopulation is put in a position to make use of it. These, of\ncourse, are obvious facts, which it should scarcely be necessary\nto recite, except that they are habitually overlooked, perhaps\nbecause they are obvious.\nThe Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century was a\nrevolution in the state of the industrial arts, of course; it was\na mutation of character in the common stock of technological\nknowledge held and used by the industrial population of the\ncivilised countries from that time forward. The shift from the\nolder to the new order of industry was of such a nature as to\ncall for the use of an extensive equipment of mechanical\napparatus, progressively more and more extensive as the change to\nthe machine technology went on; and at the same time the\ndisposable margin of product above cost also progressively went\non increasing with each further increase of the community\'s joint\nstock of technological knowledge.\nThis body of technological knowledge, the state of the\nindustrial arts, of course has always continued to be held as a\njoint stock. Indeed this joint stock of technology is the\nsubstance of the community\'s civilisation on the industrial side,\nand therefore it constitutes the substantial core of that\ncivilisation. Like any other phase or element of the cultural\nheritage, it is a joint possession of the community, so far as\nconcerns its custody, exercise, increase and transmission; but it\nhas turned out, under the peculiar circumstances that condition\nthe use of this technology among these civilised peoples, that\nits ownership or usufruct has come to be effectually vested in a\nrelatively small number of persons. Unforeseen and undesigned,\nthe mechanical circumstances of the new order in industry have\nreversed the practical effects of the common law in respect of\nself-help, equal opportunity and free bargaining. The mechanics\nof the case has worked out this result by cutting away the ground\non which those principles were based at the time of their\nacceptance and installation.\nThe machine technology requires for its working a large and\nspecialised mechanical apparatus, an ever increasingly large and\nincreasingly elaborate material equipment. So also it requires a\nlarge and diversified supply of material resources, both in raw\nmaterials and in the way of motive power. It is only on condition\nthat these requirements are met in some passable fashion that\nthis industrial system will work at all, and it is only as these\nrequirements are freely met that the machine industry will work\nat a high efficiency. At the same time the settled principles of\nlaw and usage and public policy handed down from the eighteenth\ncentury have in effect decided, and continue to decide, that all\nmaterial wealth is, rightly, to be held in private ownership, and\nis to be made use of only subject to the unhampered discretion of\nthe legally rightful owner. Meantime the highly productive state\nof the industrial arts embodied in the technological knowledge of\nthe new order can be turned to account only by use of this\nmaterial equipment and these natural resources which continue to\nbe held in private ownership. From which it follows that these\nmaterial means of industry, and the state of the industrial arts\nwhich these material means are to serve, can be turned to\nproductive use only so far and on such conditions as the rightful\nowners of the material equipment and resources may choose to\nimpose; which enables the owners of this indispensable material\nwealth, in effect, to take over the use of these industrial arts\nfor their own sole profit. So that the usufruct of the\ncommunity\'s technological knowledge has come to vest in the\nowners of such material wealth as is held in sufficiently large\nblocks for the purpose.\nTherefore, by award of the settled principles of equity and\nself-help embodied in the modern point of view, as stabilised in\nthe eighteenth century, the owners of the community\'s material\nresources -- that is to say the investors in industrial business\n-- have in effect become "seized and possessed of" the\ncommunity\'s joint stock of technological knowledge and\nefficiency. Not that this accumulated knowledge of industrial\nforces and processes has passed into the intellectual keeping of\nthe investors and been assimilated into their mentality, even to\nthe extent of a reasonably scanty modicum. It remains true, of\ncourse, that the investors, owners, kept classes, or whatever\ndesignation is preferred, are quite exceptionally ignorant of all\nthat mechanics of industry whose usufruct is vested in them; they\nare, in effect, fully occupied with other things, and their\nknowledge of industry ordinarily does not, and need not, extend\nto any rudiments of technology or industrial process. It is not\nas intelligent persons, but only as owners of material ways and\nmeans, as vested interests, that they come into the case. The\nexceptions to this rule are only sufficiently numerous to call\nattention to themselves as exceptions.\nAs an intellectual achievement and as a working force the\nstate of the industrial arts continues, of course, to be held\njointly in and by the community at large; but equitable title to\nits usufruct has, in effect, passed to the owners of the\nindispensable material means of industry. Though not hitherto by\nformal specification and legal provision, their assets include,\nin effect, the state of the industrial arts as well as the\nmechanical appliances and the materials without which these\nindustrial arts are of no effect. It is true, a little something,\nand indeed more than a little, has been done toward the due legal\nrecognition of the investor\'s usufruct of the community\'s\ntechnological efficiency, in the recognition of vested interests\nand intangible assets as articles of private property defensible\nat law. But on the whole, and until a relatively recent date, the\ninvestors\' tenure of this usufruct has been allowed to rest\ninformally on their control of the community\'s material assets.\nStill, the outlook now appears to be that something further may\npresently be done toward a more secure and unambiguous tenure of\nthis usufruct, by suitable legal decisions bearing on the\ninviolability of vested interests and intangible assets. The\noutcome is, in effect, that these owners have equitably become\nthe sole legitimate beneficiaries of the possible margin of\nproduct above cost.\nThese are also simple facts and patent, and should seem\nsufficiently obvious without argument. They have also been\nexplained at some length elsewhere. But this recital of what\nshould already be commonplace information seems necessary here\nfor the sake of a more perspicuous continuity in the present\nargument. To many persons, perhaps to the greater proportion of\nthose unpropertied persons that are often spoken of collectively\nas "the common man," the state of things which has just been\noutlined may seem untoward. And further reflection on the\ncharacter and prospective consequences of this arrangement is\nlikely to add something more to the common man\'s apprehension of\nhardship and insecurity to come. Therefore it may be well to\nrecall that this state of things has been brought to pass not by\nthe failure of those principles of equity and self-help that lie\nat the root of it all, but rather by the eminently unyielding\nstability and sufficiency of these principles under new\nconditions. It is not due to any inherent weakness or shiftiness\nin these principles of law and custom; which have faithfully\nremained the same as ever, and which all men admit were good and\nsound at the period of their installation. But it is beginning to\nappear now, after the event, that the inclusion of unrestricted\nownership among those rights and perquisites which were allowed\nto stand over when the transition was made to the modern point of\nview is likely to prove inexpedient in the further course of\ngrowth and change.\nUnrestricted ownership of property, with inheritance, free\ncontract, and self-help, is believed to have been highly\nexpedient as well as eminently equitable under the circumstances\nwhich conditioned civilised life at the period when the civilised\nworld made up its mind to that effect. And the discrepancy which\nhas come in evidence in this later time is traceable to the fact\nthat other things have not remained the same. The odious outcome\nhas been made by disturbing causes, not by these enlightened\nprinciples of honest living. Security and unlimited discretion in\nthe rights of ownership were once rightly made much of as a\nsimple and obvious safeguard of self-direction and self-help for\nthe common man; whereas, in the event, under a new order of\ncircumstances, it all promises to be nothing better than a means\nof assured defeat and vexation for the common man.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 4"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Free Income"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Industry of the modern sort -- mechanical, specialised, \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'standardised, drawn on a large scale -- is highly productive.\nWhen this industrial system of the new order is not hindered by\noutside control it will yield a very large net return of output\nover cost, -- counting cost in terms of man power and necessary\nconsumption; so large, indeed, that the cost of what is\nnecessarily consumed in productive work, in the way of materials,\nmechanical appliances, and subsistence of the workmen, is\ninconsiderable by comparison. The same thing may be described by\nsaying that the necessary consumption of subsistence and\nindustrial plant amounts to but an inconsiderable deduction from\nthe gross output of industry at any time. So inordinately\nproductive is this familiar new order of industry that in\nordinary times it is forever in danger of running into excesses\nand turning out an output in excess of what the market -- that is\nto say the business situation -- will tolerate. There is constant\ndanger of "overproduction," So that there is commonly a large\nvolume of man power unemployed and an appreciable proportion of\nthe industrial plant lying idle or half idle. It is quite\nunusual, perhaps altogether out of the question, to let all or\nnearly all the available plant and man power run at full capacity\neven for a limited time.\nIt is, of course, impossible to say how large the net\naggregate product over cost would be -- counting the product in\npercentages of the necessary cost -- in case this industrial\nsystem were allowed to work at full capacity and with free use of\nall the available technological knowledge. There is no safe\nground for an estimate, for such a thing has never been tried,\nand no near approach to such a state of things is to be looked\nfor under the existing circumstances of ownership and control.\nEven under the most favorable conditions of brisk times the\nbusiness situation will not permit it. There will at least always\nbe an indefinitely large allowance to be reckoned for work and\nsubstance expended on salesmanship, advertising, and competitive\nmanagement designed to increase sales. This line of expenditures\nis a necessary part of businesslike management, although it\ncontributes nothing to the output of goods, and in that sense it\nis to be counted as a necessary deduction from the net productive\ncapacity of the industrial system as it runs. It would also be\nextremely difficult to make allowance for this deduction, since\nmuch of it is not recognised as such by the men in charge and\ndoes not appear on their books under any special descriptive\nheading. In one way and another, and for divers and various\nreasons, the net production of goods serviceable for human use\nfalls considerably short of the gross output, and the gross\noutput is always short of the productive capacity of the\navailable plant and man power.\nStill, taken as it goes, with whatever handicap of these\nvarious kinds is to be allowed for, it remains patently true that\nthe net product greatly exceeds the cost. So much so that\nwhatever is required for the replacement of the material\nequipment consumed in production, plus "reasonable returns" on\nthis equipment, commonly amounts to no more than a fraction of\nthe total output. The resulting margin of excess product over\ncost plus reasonable returns on the material equipment is due to\nthe high productive efficiency of the current state of the\nindustrial arts and is the source of that free income which gives\nrise to intangible assets. The distinction between tangible\nassets and intangible is not a hard and fast one, of course, but\nthe difference is sufficiently broad and sufficiently well\nunderstood for use in the present connection, so long as no pains\nis taken to confuse these terms with needless technical verbiage.\nTo avoid debate and digression, it may be remarked that\n"reasonable returns" is also here used in the ordinary sense of\nthe expression, without further definition, as being sufficiently\nunderstood and precise enough for the argument. The play of\nmotives and transactions by which a rough common measure of\nreasonable returns has been arrived at is taken for granted. A\ndetailed examination of all that matter would involve an extended\ndigression, and nothing would be gained for the argument.\nAccording to the traditional view, which was handed on from the\nperiod before the coming of corporation finance, and which still\nstands over as an article of common belief in the certified\neconomic theories, "capital" represents the material equipment,\nvalued at its cost, together with funds in hand required as a\n"working capital" to provide materials and a labor force. On this\nview, corporation securities are taken to cover ownership of the\nplant and the needed working capital; and there has been a\nslow-dying prejudice against admitting that anything less\ntangible than these items should properly be included in the\ncorporate capitalisation and made a basis on which to issue\ncorporate securities. Hence that stubborn popular prejudice\nagainst "watered stock" which corporation finance had to contend\nwith all through the latter half of the nineteenth century.\n"Watered stock" is now virtually a forgotten issue. Corporation\nfinance has disposed of the quarrel by discontinuing the relevant\nfacts.\nThere is still a recognised distinction between tangible\nassets and intangible; but it has come to be recognised in\ncorporation practice that the only reasonable basis of\ncapitalisation for any assets, tangible or intangible, is the\nearning-capacity which they represent. And the amount of capital\nis a question of capitalisation of the available assets. So that,\nif the material equipment, e.g., is duly capitalised on its\nearning-capacity, any question as to its being "watered" is no\nlonger worth pursuing; since stock can be said to be "watered"\nonly by comparison with the cost of the assets which it covers,\nnot in relation to its earning-capacity. The latter point is\ntaken care of by the stock quotations of the market. On the other\nhand, intangible assets neither have now nor ever have had any\nother basis than capitalisation of earning capacity, and any\nquestion of "water" in their case is consequently quite idle.\nIntangible assets will not hold water.\nCorporation finance is one of the outgrowths of the New\nOrder. And one of the effects wrought by corporation finance is a\nblurring of the distinction between tangible assets and\nintangible; inasmuch as both are now habitually determined by a\ncapitalisation of earning-capacity, rather than by their\nascertained cost, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to draw\na hard and fast line between that part of a concern\'s\nearning-capacity which is properly to be assigned to its plant\nand that which is due to its control of the market. Still, an\nintelligible distinction is maintained in common usage, between\ntangible assets and intangible, even if the distinction is\nsomewhat uncertain in detail; and such a distinction is\nconvenient, so long as too sharp a contrast between the two is\nnot insisted on.\nThe earning-capacity of the tangible assets is presumed to\nrepresent the productive capacity of the plant, considered as a\nmechanical apparatus engaged in an industrial process for the\nproduction of goods or services; it is presumed to rest on the\nmarket value of the mechanical output of the plant. The plant is\na productive factor because and in so far as it turns to\npractical account the state of the industrial arts now in use, --\nthe community\'s joint stock of technological knowledge. So soon,\nor so far, as the plant and its management falls short of meeting\nthe ordinary requirements of this current state of the industrial\narts, and fails to make use of such technological knowledge as is\ncommonly employed, the whole works ceases by that much to be a\nproductive factor. The productive efficiency, and the productive\nvalue, of any given item of industrial equipment is measured by\nits effective use of the technological knowledge current in the\ncommunity for the time being. So also, the productive value of\nany given body of natural resources land, raw materials, motive\npower -- is strictly dependent on the degree in which it fits\ninto the industrial system as it runs.\nThis dependence of productive value on conformity to and use\nof the state of the industrial arts is constantly shown in the\ncase of land and similar natural resources, by the fluctuation of\nrental values. Land and other resources will be more valuable the\nmore suitable they are for present and prospective use. The like\nis true for the mechanical equipment, perhaps in a more\npronounced degree. Industrial plant, e.g., is always liable to\ndepreciation by obsolescence in case the state of the industrial\narts changes in such a way that the method of work embodied in\nthe particular article of equipment is displaced by new and more\nsuitable methods, more suitable under the altered circumstances.\nIn such a case, which is of very frequent occurrence under the\nnew order of industry, any given plant, machine, or similar\ncontrivance may lose all its value as a means of production. And\nso also, on the other hand, a given plant, as, for instance, a\ngiven railway system or dock, may acquire additional productive\nvalue through changes in the industrial system which make it more\nsuitable for present use.\nEvidently the chief, or at least the indispensable, element\nof productive efficiency in any item of industrial equipment or\nresources is the use which it makes of the available\ntechnological knowledge; and evidently, too, its earning-capacity\nas a productive factor depends strictly on the same fact, -- the\nusufruct of the state of the industrial arts. And all the while\nthe state of the industrial arts, which the industrial equipment\nso turns to account for the benefit of its owner, continues to be\na joint stock of industrial knowledge and proficiency\naccumulated, held, exercised, increased and transmitted by the\ncommunity at large; and all the while the owner of the equipment\nis some person who has contributed no more than his per-capita\nquota to this state of the industrial arts out of which his\nearnings arise. Indeed the chances are that the owner has\ncontributed less than his per-capita quota, if anything, to that\ncommon fund of knowledge on the product of which he draws by\nvirtue of his ownership, because he is likely to be fully\noccupied with other things, -- such things as lucrative business\ntransactions, e.g., or the decent consumption of superfluities.\nAnd at this point the difference between tangible assets and\nintangible comes in sight, or at least the ground of the habitual\ndistinction between the two. Tangible assets, it appears, are\nsuch assets as represent the earning-capacity of any mechanically\nproductive property; whereas intangible assets represent assured\nincome which can not be assigned to any specific material factor\nas its productive source. Intangible assets are the capitalised\nvalue of income not otherwise accounted for. Such income arises\nout of business relations rather than out of industry; it is\nderived from advantages of salesmanship, rather than from\nproductive work; it represents no contribution to the output of\ngoods and services, but only an effectual claim to a share in the\n"annual dividend," -- on grounds which appear to be legally\nhonest, but which can not be stated in terms of mechanical cause\nand effect, or of productive efficiency, or indeed in any terms\nthat involve notions of physical dimensions or of mechanical\naction.\nWhen the theoreticians explain and justify these returns that\ngo to adroit salesmanship, or "managerial ability," as it is also\ncalled, it invariably turns but that the grounds assigned for it\nare of the nature of figures of speech -- metaphor or analogy.\nNot that these standard theoretical explanations are to be set\naside as faulty, inadequate or incomplete; their great volume and\nsincerity forbids that. It is rather that they are to be accepted\nas a faithful account of an insubstantial fact in insubstantial\nterms. And they are probably as good an account of the equitable\ndistribution of free income as the principles of the modern point\nof view will tolerate.\nBut while intangible assets represent income which accrues\nout of certain immaterial relations between their owners and the\nindustrial system, and while this income is accordingly not a\nreturn for mechanically productive work done, it still remains\ntrue, of course, that such income is drawn from the annual\nproduct of industry, and that its productive source is therefore\nthe same as that of the returns on tangible assets. The material\nsource of both is the same; and it is only that the basis on\nwhich the income is claimed is not the same for both. It is not a\ndifference in respect of the ways and means by which they are\ncreated, but only in respect of the ways and means by which these\ntwo classes of income are intercepted and secured by the\nbeneficiaries to whom they accrue. The returns on tangible assets\nare assumed to be a return for the productive use of the plant;\nreturns on intangible assets are a return for the exercise of\ncertain immaterial relations involved in the ownership and\ncontrol of industry and trade.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Best known by name among intangible assets is the ancient \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'rubric of "good-will," technically so called; which has stood\nover from before the coming of the new order in business\nenterprise. This has long been considered the original type-form\nof intangible assets as a class. By ancient usage the term\ndenotes a customary preferential advantage in trade; it is not\ndesigned to describe a body of benevolent sentiments. Good-will\nhas long been known, discussed and allowed for as a legitimate,\nordinary and valuable immaterial possession of men engaged in\nmercantile enterprise of all kinds. It has been held to be a\nproduct of exemplary courtesy and fair dealing with customers,\ndue to turning out goods or services of an invariably sound\nquality and honest measure, and indeed due to the conspicuous\npractice of the ordinary Christian virtues, but chiefly to common\nhonesty. Similarly valuable, and of a similarly immaterial\nnature, is the possession of a trade-secret, a trade-mark, a\npatent-right, a franchise, any statutory monopoly, or a monopoly\nsecured by effectually cornering the supply or the market for any\ngiven line of goods or services. From any one of these a\nprofitable advantage may be derived, and they have therefore a\nmarket value. They afford their possessor a preferential gain, as\nagainst his competitors or as against the general body of\ncustomers which the state of the industrial arts and the\norganisation of business throws in his way. After the analogy of\ngood-will, it has been usual to trace any such special run of\nfree income to the profitable use of a special advantage in the\nmarket, which is then appraised as a valuable means of gain and\ncomes to figure as an asset of its possessor. But all this goes\nto explain how these benefits go to these beneficiaries; it does\nnot account for the fact that there is produced a net output of\nproduct available for free distribution to these persons.\nThese supernumerary and preferential gains, "excess profits,"\nor whatever words may best describe this class of free income,\nmay be well deserved by these beneficiaries, or they may not. The\nincome in question is, in any case, not created by the good\ndeserts of the beneficiaries, however meritorious their conduct\nmay be. Honesty may conceivably be the best policy in mercantile\npursuits, and it may also greatly serve the convenience of any\ncommunity in which an honest merchant is found; yet honest\ndealing, strictly speaking, is an agency of conservation rather\nthan of creation. A trade-secret may also be profitable to the\nconcern which has the use of it, and the special process which it\ncovers may be especially productive; but the same article of\ntechnological knowledge would doubtless contribute more to the\ntotal productivity of industry if it were shared freely by the\nindustrial community at large. Such technological knowledge is an\nagency of production, but it is the monopoly of it that is\nprofitable to its possessor as a special source of gain. The like\napplies to patent-rights, of course. Whereas monopolies of the\nusual kind, which control any given line of industry by charter,\nconspiracy, or combination of ownership, derive their special\ngains from their ability to restrain trade, limit the output of\ngoods or services, and so "maintain prices."\nIntangible assets of this familiar kind are very common among\nthe business concerns of the new order, particularly among the\nlarger and more prosperous of them, and they afford a rough\nmeasure of the ability of these concerns profitably to restrict\nproduction. The very large aggregate value of such assets\nindicates how imperative it is for the conduct of industrial\nbusiness under the new order to restrict output within reasonable\nlimits, and at the same time how profitable it is to be able to\nprevent the excessively high productive capacity of modern\nindustry from outrunning the needs of profitable business. For\nthe prosperity of business it is necessary to keep the output\nwithin reasonable limits; that is to say, within such limits as\nwill serve to maintain reasonably profitable prices; that is to\nsay, such prices as will yield the largest obtainable net return\nto the concerns engaged in the business. In this connection, and\nunder the existing conditions of investment and credit,\n"reasonable returns" means the same thing as "the largest\npracticable net returns." It all foots up to an application of\nthe familiar principle of "charging what the traffic will bear";\nfor in the matter of profitable business there is no reasonable\nlimit short of the maximum. In business, the best price is always\ngood enough; but, so also, nothing short of the best price is\ngood enough. Buy cheap and sell dear.\nIntangibles of this kind, which represent a "conscientious\nwithdrawal of efficiency," an effectual control of the rate or\nvolume of output, are altogether the most common of immaterial\nassets, and they make up altogether the largest class of\nintangibles and the most considerable body of immaterial wealth\nowned. Land values are of much the same nature as these corporate\nassets which represent capitalised restriction of output, in that\nthe land values, too, rest mostly on the owner\'s ability to\nwithhold his property from productive use, and so to drive a\nprofitable bargain. Rent is also a case of charging what the\ntraffic will bear; and rental values should properly be classed\nwith these intangible assets of the larger corporations, which\nare due to their effectual control of the rate and volume of\nproduction. And apart from the rental values of land, which are\nalso in the nature of monopoly values, it is doubtful if the\ntotal material wealth in any of the civilised countries will\nnearly equal the total amount of this immaterial wealth that is\nowned by the country\'s business men and the investors for whom\nthey do business. Which evidently comes to much the same as\nsaying that something more than one-half of the net product of\nthe country\'s industry goes to those persons in whom the existing\nstate of law and custom vests a plenary power to hinder\nproduction.\nIt is doubtful if the total of this immaterial wealth exceeds\nthe total material wealth in the advanced industrial countries;\nalthough it is at least highly probable that such is the case,\nparticularly in the richer and more enlightened of these\ncountries; as, e. g., in America or the United Kingdom, where the\nprinciples of self-help and free bargain have consistently had\nthe benefit of a liberal -- that is a broad -- construction and\nan unbending application. The evidence in the case is not to be\nhad in such unambiguous shape as to carry conviction, for the\ndistinction between tangible assets and intangible is not\nconsistently maintained or made a matter of record. So, e.g., it\nis not unusual to find that corporation bonds -- railroad or\nindustrial -- which secure their owner a free income and are\ncarried as an overhead charge by the corporation, are at the same\ntime a lien on the corporation\'s real property; which in turn is\nlikely to be of less value than the corporation\'s total\nliabilities. Evidently the case is sufficiently confusing,\nconsidered as a problem in the economic theory of capital, but it\noffers no particular difficulty when considered as a proposition\nin corporation finance.\nThere is another curious question that will also have to be\nleft as a moot question, in the absence of more specific\ninformation than that which is yet available; more a question of\nidle curiosity, perhaps, than of substantial consequence. How\nnearly is it likely that the total gains which accrue to these\nprosperous business concerns and their investors from their\nconscientious withdrawal of efficiency will equal the total loss\nsuffered by the community as a whole from the incidental\nreduction of the output? Net production is kept down in order to\nget a profitable price for the output; but it is not certain\nwhether the net production has to be lowered by as much or more\nthan the resulting increased gain which this businesslike\nstrategy brings to the businesslike strategists. The strategic\ncurtailment of net production below productive capacity is net\nloss to the community as a whole, including both the business men\nand their customers; the gains which go to these business\nconcerns in this way are net loss to the community as a whole,\nexclusive of the business concerns and their investors. The\nresulting question is, therefore, not whether the rest of the\ncommunity loses as much as the business men gain, -- that goes\nwithout saying, since the gains of the business men in the case\nare paid over to them by the rest of the community in the\nenhanced (or maintained) price of the products, but rather it is\na question whether the rest of the community, the common man,\nloses twice as much as the business concerns and their investors\ngain.\nThe whole case has some analogy with the phenomena of\nblackmail, ransom, and any similar enterprise that aims to get\nsomething for nothing; although it is carefully to be noted that\nits analogy with these illegitimate forms of gainful enterprise\nmust, of course, not be taken to cast any shadow of suspicion on\nthe legitimacy of all the businesslike sabotage that underlies\nthis immaterial corporate capital and its earning-capacity. In\nthe case of blackmail, ransom, and such like illegal traffic in\nextortion, it is known that the net loss suffered by the loser\nand the gainer together exceeds the net gain which accrues to the\nbeneficiary, by as much as the cost of enforcement plus the\nincidental inconvenience to both parties to the transaction. At\nthe same time, the beneficiary\'s subsequent employment and\nconsumption of his "ill-gotten gains," as they are sometimes\ncalled, whether he consumes them in riotous living or in the\nfurther pursuit of the same profitable line of traffic, -- all\nthis, it is believed, does not in any degree benefit the rest of\nthe community. As seen in the perspective of the common good,\nsuch enterprise in extortion is believed to be quite wastefully\ndisserviceable.\nNow, this analogy may be taken for what it is worth;\n"Analogies do not run on all-fours." But when seen in the same\nperspective, the question of loss and gain involved in the case\nof these intangible assets and their earning-capacity falls into\nsomething like this shape: Does the total net loss suffered by\nthe community at large, exclusive of the owners of these\nintangibles, exceed two-hundred percent of the returns which go\nto these owners? or, Do these intangibles cost the community more\nthan twice what they are worth to the owners? -- the loss to the\ncommunity being represented by the sum of the overhead burden\ncarried on account of these intangibles plus the necessary\ncurtailment of production involved in maintaining profitable\nprices. The overhead burden is paid out of the net annual\nproduction, after the net annual production has been reduced by\nso much as may be necessary to "maintain prices at a reasonably\nprofitable figure."\nA few years ago any ordinarily observant person would\ndoubtless have answered this question in the negative, probably\nwithout hesitation. So also, any ordinarily intelligent votary of\nthe established order, as, e.g., a corporation lawyer, a\ncommercial trade journal, or a trade-union official, would\ndoubtless, at that period, have talked down such a question out\nof hand, as being fantastically preposterous. That would have\nbeen before the war experience began to throw light into the dark\nplaces of business enterprise as conducted under the new order of\nindustry. Today (October, 1918) -- it is to be admitted with such\nemotion as may come to hand -- this question is one which can be\nentertained quite seriously, in the light of experience. In the\nrecent past, as matters have stood up to the outbreak of the war,\nthe ordinary rate of production in the essential industries under\nbusinesslike management has habitually and by deliberate\ncontrivance fallen greatly short of productive capacity. This is\nan article of information which the experience of the war has\nshifted from the rubric of "Interesting if True" to that of\n"Common Notoriety."\nThe question as to how much this "incapacity by advisement"\nhas commonly amounted to may be attempted somewhat after this\nfashion. Today, under compulsion of patriotic devotion, fear,\nshame and bitter need, and under the unprecedentedly shrewd\nsurveillance of public officers bent on maximum production, the\ngreat essential industries controlled by the vested interests\nmay, one with another, be considered to approach -- perhaps even\nconceivably to exceed -- a fifty-percent efficiency; as counted\non the basis of what should ordinarily be accomplished by use of\nan equally costly equipment having the disposal of an equally\nlarge and efficient labor force and equally good natural\nresources, in case the organisation were designed and managed\nwith an eye single to turning out a serviceable product, instead\nof, as usual, being managed with an eye single to private gain in\nterms of price.\nTo the spokesmen of "business as usual" this rating of\ncurrent production under the pressure of war needs may seem\nextravagantly low; whereas, to the experts in industrial\nengineering, who are in the habit of arguing in terms of material\ncost and mechanical output, it will seem extravagantly high.\nPublicly, and concessively, this latter class will speak of a 25\npercent efficiency; in private and confidentially they appear\ndisposed to say that the rating should be nearer to 10 percent\nthan 25. To avoid any appearance of an ungenerous bias, then,\npresent actual production in these essential industries may be\nplaced at something approaching 50 percent of what should be\ntheir normal productive capacity in the absence of a businesslike\ncontrol looking to "reasonable profits." It is necessary at this\npoint to call to mind that the state of the industrial arts under\nthe new order is highly productive, -- beyond example.\nThis state of the case, that production in the essential\nindustries presumably does not exceed 50 percent of the normal\nproductive capacity, even when driven under the jealous eye of\npublic officers vested with power to act, is presumably due in\ngreat part to the fact that these officers, too, are capable\nbusiness men; that their past training and present bent is such\nas has been given them by long, exacting and successful\nexperience in the businesslike management of industry; that their\nhorizon and perspective in all that concerns industry are limited\nby the frame of mind that is native to the countinghouse. They,\ntoo, have learned how to think of industry and its administration\nin terms of profit on investment, and, indeed, in no other terms;\nthat being as near as their daily work has allowed them to take\nstock of the ways and means of industry. So that they are still\nguided, in some considerable part, by considerations of what is\ndecent, equitable and prudent in the sight of conservative\nbusiness men; and this bias necessarily goes with them in their\ndealings with those ubiquitous, intricate and systematic\ndislocations of the industrial system which have been found\nprofitable in the management of industry on a footing of\ncompetitive sabotage. They still find it reasonable to avoid any\nderangement of those vested interests that live on this margin of\nintangible assets that represents capitalised withdrawal of\nefficiency.\nIn so characterising the situation there is, of course, no\ninclination to impute blame to these businesslike officials who\nare patriotically giving their best abilities and endeavors to\nthis work of enforcing an increased production in the essential\nindustries and diverting needed labor and materials from the\nchannels of waste; nor is it intended to cast aspersions on the\ngood faith or the honorable motives of those grave captains of\nindustry whom the officials find it so difficult to divert from\nthe business man\'s straight and narrow path of charging what the\ntraffic will bear. "They are all honorable men," But like other\nmen they are creatures of habit; and their habit of mind is the\noutcome of experience in that class of large, responsible and\nremunerative business affairs that lie somewhat remote from the\ndomain of technology, from that field where the mechanistic logic\nof the industrial arts has something to say. It is only that the\nsituation as here spoken of rests on settled usage, and that the\nusage is such as the businesslike frame of mind is suited to; at\nthe same time that this businesslike usage, of fixed charges,\nvested interests and reasonable profits, does not fully comport\nwith the free swing of the industrial arts as they run under the\nnew order of technology. Nor is there much chance of getting away\nfrom this situation of "incapacity by advisement," even under\npressure of patriotic devotion, fear, shame and need, inasmuch as\nthe effectual public opinion has learned the same bias and will\nscarcely entrust the conduct of its serious interests to any\nother than business men and business methods.\nTo return to the argument. It may be conceded that production\nin the essential industries, under pressure of the war needs,\nrises to something like a 50 percent efficiency. At the same time\nit is presumably well within the mark to say that this current\noutput in these essential industries will amount to something\nlike twice their ordinary output in time of peace and business as\nusual, One-half of 50 percent is 25 percent; and so one comes in\nsight of the provisional conclusion that under ordinary\nconditions of businesslike management the habitual net production\nis fairly to be rated at something like one-fourth of the\nindustrial community\'s productive capacity; presumably under that\nfigure rather than over.\nIn the absence of all reflection this crude estimate may seem\nrecklessly hasty, perhaps it may even be thought scandalously\nunflattering to our substantial citizens who have the keeping of\nthe community\'s material welfare; but a degree of observation and\nreflection will quickly ease any feeling of annoyance on that\nscore. So, e.g., if the account as presented above does not\nappear to foot up to as much as the conclusion would seem to\nrequire, further account may be taken of that side-line of\nbusiness enterprise that spends work and materials in an effort\nto increase the work to be done, and to increase the cost per\nunit of the increased work; all for the benefit of the earnings\nof the concern for whose profit it is arranged. It may be called\nto mind that there still are half-a-dozen railway passenger\nstations in such a town as Chicago, especially designed to work\nat cross purposes and hinder the traffic of competing railway\ncorporations; that on the basis of this ingeniously contrived\nretardation of traffic there has been erected a highly prosperous\nmonopoly in the transfer of baggage and passengers, employing a\nlarge equipment and labor force and costing the traveling public\nsome millions of useless outlay yearly; with nothing better to\nshow for it than delay, confusion, wear and tear, casualties and\nwrangles, twenty-four hours a day; and that this arrangement is,\nquite profitably, duplicated throughout the country as often and\non as large a scale as there are towns in which to install it. So\nagain, there is an exemplary weekly periodical of the most widely\nreputable and most profitable class, with a circulation of more\nthan two million, which habitually carries some 60 to 80 large\npages of competitive advertising matter, at a time when the most\nexacting economy of work and materials is a matter of urgent and\nacknowledged public need; with nothing better to show for it than\nan increased cost of all the goods advertised, most of which are\nsuperfluities. This, too, is only a typical case, duplicated by\nthe thousand, as nearly as the businesslike management of the\nother magazines and newspapers can achieve the same result. These\nare familiar instances of business as usual under the new order\nof industry. They are neither extreme nor extraordinary. Indeed\nthe whole business community is run through with enterprise of\nthis kind so thoroughly that this may fairly be said to be the\nwarp of the fabric. In effect, of course, it is an enterprise in\nsubreption; but in point of moral sentiment and conscious motive\nit is nothing of the kind.\nAll these intricate arrangements for doing those things that\nwe ought not to have done and leaving undone those things that we\nought to have done are by no means maliciously intended. They are\nonly the ways and means of diverting a sufficient share of the\nannual product to the benefit of the legitimate beneficiaries,\nthe kept classes. But this apparatus and procedure for capturing\nand dividing this share of the community\'s annual dividend is\ncostly -- one is tempted to say unduly costly. It foots up to,\nperhaps, something like one-half of the work done, and it is\noccupied with taking over something like one-half of the output\nproduced by the remaining one-half of the year\'s work. And yet,\nas a business proposition it seems sound enough, inasmuch as the\nincome which it brings to the beneficiaries will presumably foot\nup to something like one-half of the country\'s annual production.\nThere is nothing gained by finding fault with any of this\nbusinesslike enterprise that is bent on getting something for\nnothing, at any cost. After all, it is safe and sane business,\nsound and legitimate, and carried on blamelessly within the rules\nof the game, One may also dutifully believe that there is really\nno harm done, or at least that it might have been worse. It is\nreassuring to note that at least hitherto the burden of this\noverhead charge of 50 percent plus has not broken the back of the\nindustrial community. It also serves to bring under a strong\nlight the fact that the state of the industrial arts as it runs\nunder the new order is highly productive, inordinately\nproductive. And, finally, there should be some gain of serenity\nin realising how singularly consistent has been the run of\neconomic law through the ages, and recalling, once more the\nreflection which John Stuart Mill arrived at some half-a-century\nago, that, "Hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical\ninventions yet made have lightened the day\'s toil of any human\nbeing."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 5"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The Vested Interests"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"There are certain saving clauses in common use among persons \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'who speak for that well-known order of pecuniary rights and\nobligations which the modern point of view assumes as "the\nnatural state of man."

All that was, in effect,\nbefore the coming of the machine technology and the later growth\nof population.\nBut as it runs today, according to the new industrial order\nset afoot by the machine technology, the carrying-on of the\ncommunity\'s industry is not well taken care of by the loose\ncorrective control which is exercised by a competitive market.\nThat method is too slow, at the best, and too disjointed. The\nindustrial system is now a wide-reaching organisation of\nmechanical processes which work together on a comprehensive\ninterlocking plan of give and take, in which no one section,\ngroup, or individual unit is free to work out its own industrial\nsalvation except in active copartnership with the rest; and the\nwhole of which runs on as a moving equilibrium of forces in\naction. This system of interlocking processes and mutually\ndependent working units is a more or less delicately balanced\naffair. Evidently the system has to be taken as a whole, and\nevidently it will work at its full productive capacity only on\ncondition that the coordination of its interlocking processes be\nmaintained at a faultless equilibrium, and only when its\nconstituent working units are allowed to run full and smooth. But\na moderate derangement will not put it out of commission. It will\nwork at a lower efficiency, and continue running, in spite of a\nvery considerable amount of dislocation; as is habitually the\ncase today.\nAt the same time any reasonably good working efficiency of\nthe industrial system is conditioned on a reasonably good\ncoordination of these working forces; such as will allow each and\nseveral of the working units to carry on at the fullest working\ncapacity that will comport with the unhampered working of the\nsystem as a balanced whole. But evidently, too, any dislocation,\nderangement or retardation of the work at any critical point --\nwhich comes near saying at any point -- in this balanced system\nof work will cause a disproportionately large derangement of the\nwhole. The working units of the industrial system are no longer\nindependent of one another under the new order.\nIt is, perhaps, necessary to add that the industrial system\nhas not yet reached anything like the last degree of development\nalong this line; it is at least not yet a perfected automatic\nmechanism. But it should also be added that with each successive\nadvance into the new order of industry created by the machine\ntechnology, and at a continually accelerated rate of advance, the\nprocesses of industry are being more thoroughly standardised, the\nworking units of the system as a whole demand a more undeviating\nmaintenance of its moving equilibrium, a more exacting mechanical\ncorrelation of industrial operations and equipment. And it seems\nreasonable to expect that things are due to move forward along\nthis line still farther in the calculable future, rather than the\nreverse.\nThis state of things would reasonably suggest that the\ncontrol of the industrial system had best be entrusted to men\nskilled in these matters of technology. The industrial system\ndoes its work in terms of mechanical efficiency, not in terms of\nprice. It should accordingly seem reasonable to expect that its\ncontrol would be entrusted to men experienced in the ways and\nmeans of technology, men who are in the habit of thinking about\nthese matters in such terms as are intelligible to the engineers.\nThe material welfare of the community is bound up with the due\nworking of this industrial system, which depends on the expert\nknowledge, insight, and disinterested judgment with which it is\nadministered. It should accordingly have seemed expedient to\nentrust its administration to the industrial engineers, rather\nthan to the captains of finance. The former have to do with\nproductive efficiency, the latter with the higgling of the\nmarket.\nHowever, by historical necessity the discretionary control in\nall that concerns this highly technological system of industry\nhas come to vest in those persons who are highly skilled in the\nhiggling of the market, the masters of financial intrigue. And so\ngreat is the stability of that system of law and custom by grace\nof which these persons claim this power, that any disallowance of\ntheir plenary control over the material fortunes of the community\nis scarcely within reason. All the while the progressive shifting\nof ground in the direction of a more thoroughly mechanistic\norganisation of industry goes on and works out into a more and\nmore searching standardisation of works and methods and a more\nexacting correlation of industries, in an ever increasingly large\nand increasingly sensitive industrial system. All the while the\nwhole of it grows less and less manageable by business methods;\nand with every successive move the control exercised by the\nbusiness men in charge grows wider, more arbitrary, and more\nincompatible with the common good.\nBusiness affairs, in the narrow sense of the expression, have\nin time necessarily come in for an increasing share of the\nattention of those who exercise the control. The businesslike\nmanager\'s attention is continually more taken up with "the\nfinancial end" of the concern\'s interests; so that by enforced\nneglect he is necessarily leaving more of the details of shop\nmanagement and supervision of the works to subordinates, largely\nto subordinates who are presumed to have some knowledge of\ntechnological matters and no immediate interest in the run of the\nmarket. They are in fact persons who are presumed to have this\nknowledge by the business men who have none of it. But the larger\nand final discretion, which affects the working of the industrial\nsystem as a whole, or the orderly management of any considerable\ngroup of industries within the general system,- all that is still\nunder the immediate control of the businesslike managers, each of\nwhom works for his own concern\'s gain without much afterthought.\nThe final discretion still rests with the businesslike\ndirectorate of each concern -- the owner or the board -- even in\nall questions of physical organisation and technical management;\nalthough this businesslike control of the details of production\nnecessarily comes to little else than acceptance, rejection, or\nrevision of measures proposed by the men immediately in charge of\nthe works; together with a constant check on the rate and volume\nof output, with a view to the market.\nIn very great part the directorate\'s control of the industry\nhas practically taken the shape of a veto on such measures of\nproduction as are not approved by the directorate for\nbusinesslike reasons, that is to say for purposes of private\ngain. Business is a pursuit of profits, and profits are to be had\nfrom profitable sales, and profitable sales can be made only if\nprices are maintained at a profitable level, and prices can be\nmaintained only if the volume of marketable output is kept within\nreasonable limits; so that the paramount consideration in such\nbusiness as has to do with the staple industries is a reasonable\nlimitation of the output. "Reasonable" means "what the traffic\nwill bear"; that is to say, "what will yield the largest net\nreturn."\nHence in the larger mechanical industries, which set the pace\nfor the rest and which are organised on a standardised and more\nor less automatic plan, the current oversight of production by\ntheir businesslike directorate does not effectually extend much\nbeyond the regulation of the output with a view to what the\ntraffic will bear; and in this connection there is very little\nthat the business men in charge can do except to keep the output\nshort of productive capacity by so much as the state of the\nmarket seems to require; it does not lie within their competence\nto increase the output beyond that point, or to increase the\nproductive capacity of their works, except by way of giving the\ntechnical men permission to go ahead and do it.\nThe business man\'s place in the economy of nature is to "make\nmoney," not to produce goods. The production of goods is a\nmechanical process, incidental to the making of money; whereas\nthe making of money is a pecuniary operation, carried on by\nbargain and sale, not by mechanical appliances and powers. The\nbusiness men make use of the mechanical appliances and powers of\nthe industrial system, but they make a pecuniary use of them. And\nin point of fact the less use a business man can make of the\nmechanical appliances and powers under his charge, and the\nsmaller a product he can contrive to turn out for a given return\nin terms of price, the better it suits his purpose. The highest\nachievement in business is the nearest approach to getting\nsomething for nothing. What any given business concern gains must\ncome out of the total output of productive industry, of course;\nand to that extent any given business concern has an interest in\nthe continued production of goods. But the less any given\nbusiness concern can contrive to give for what it gets, the more\nprofitable its own traffic will be. Business success means\n"getting the best of the bargain."\nThe common good, so far as it is a question of material\nwelfare, is evidently best served by an unhampered working of the\nindustrial system at its full capacity, without interruption or\ndislocation. But it is equally evident that the owner or manager\nof any given concern or section of this industrial system may be\nin a position to gain something for himself at the cost of the\nrest by obstructing, retarding or dislocating this working system\nat some critical point in such a way as will enable him to get\nthe best of the bargain in his dealings with the rest. This\nappears constantly in the altogether usual, and altogether\nlegitimate, practice of holding out for a better price. So also\nin the scarcely less usual, and no less legitimate, practice of\nwithholding needed ground or right of way, or needed materials or\ninformation, from a business rival. Indeed it has been rumored\nthat one of the usual incentives which drew the patriotic\none-dollar-a-year men from their usual occupations to the service\nof their country was the chance of controlling information by\nmeans of which to "put it over" their business rivals. All these\nthings are usual and a matter of course, because business\nmanagement under the conditions created by the new order of\nindustry is in great part made up of these things. Sabotage of\nthis kind is indispensable to any large success in industrial\nbusiness.\nBut it is also evident that the private gain which the\nbusiness concerns come in for by this management entails a loss\non the rest of the community, and that the loss suffered by the\nrest of the community is necessarily larger than the total gains\nwhich these manoeuvres bring to the business concerns; inasmuch\nas the friction, obstruction and retardation of the moving\nequilibrium of production involved in this business-like sabotage\nnecessarily entails a disproportionate curtailment of output.\nHowever, it is well to call to mind that the community will\nstill be able to get along, perhaps even to get along very\ntolerably, in spite of a very appreciable volume of sabotage of\nthis kind; even though it does reduce the net productive capacity\nto a fraction of what it would be in the absence of all this\ninterference and retardation; for the current state of the\nindustrial arts is highly productive. So much so that in spite of\nall this deliberate waste and confusion that is set afoot in this\nway for private gain, there still is left over an absolutely\nlarge residue of net production over cost. The community still\nhas something to go on. The available margin of free income --\nthat is to say, the margin of production over cost -- is still\nwide; so that it allows a large latitude for playing fast and\nloose with the community\'s livelihood.\nNow, these businesslike manoeuvres of deviation and delay are\nby no means to be denounced as being iniquitous or unfair,\nalthough they may have an unfortunate effect on the conditions of\nlife for the common man. That is his misfortune, which law and\ncustom count on his bearing with becoming fortitude. These are\nthe ordinary and approved means of carrying on business according\nto the liberal principles of free bargain and self-help as\nestablished in the eighteenth century; and they are in the main\nstill looked on as a meritorious exercise of thrift and sagacity\n-- duly so looked on, it is to be presumed. At least such is the\nprevailing view among the substantial citizens, who are in a\nposition to speak from first-hand knowledge. It is only that the\nexercise of these homely virtues on the large scale on which\nbusiness is now conducted, and when dealing with the\nwide-reaching articulations of the industrial system under the\nnew order of technology, -- under these uncalled-for\ncircumstances the unguarded exercise of these virtues entails\nbusiness disturbances which are necessarily large, and which\nbring on mischievous consequences in industry which are\ndisproportionately larger still.\nIt is also true, the businesslike managers of industrial\nenterprise have also other things to do, besides holding the\nmarketable supply of goods and services down to such an amount as\nis expected to bring the most profitable prices, or diverting\ncredulous customers from one seller to another by competitive\nadvertising. But it should also be noted that there is next to no\nbusiness enterprise, if any, whose chief end is not profitable\nsales, or profitable bargains which mean the same thing as\nprofitable sales. They are therefore engaged unremittingly in one\nor another of the approved lines of competitive management with a\nview to profitable traffic for themselves, and to creating an\nadvantage for themselves in the market. It is a poor-spirited\nconcern that does not constantly aim to create for itself such a\nposition of advantage as will give it something of a vested\ninterest in the traffic. Such a concern is scarcely fit to\nsurvive; nor is it likely to.\nIt is not that business enterprise is wholly taken up with\nsuch like manoeuvres of restraint, obstruction and competitive\nselling. This is only part of the business men\'s everyday work,\nalthough it is not a minor part. In any competitive business\ncommunity this line of duties will take up a large share of the\nbusiness men\'s attention and will engage their best and most\nbusinesslike abilities. More particularly in the management of\nthe greater industrial enterprises of the present day, the larger\nas well as the more lucrative part of the duties of those who\ndirect affairs appears commonly to be of this nature. That such\nshould be the case lies in the nature of things under the\ncircumstances which now prevail. It would not be far out of the\nway to say that any occupations in which this rule does not apply\nare occupations which have not, or have not yet, come into line\nas members in good standing in that new order of business\nenterprise which is based on the machine industry governed by the\nliberal principles of the eighteenth century.\n"Our people, moreover, do not wait to be coached and led.\nThey know their own business, are quick and resourceful at every\nreadjustment, definite in purpose, and self-reliant in action...\nThe American business man is of quick initiative. The ordinary\nand normal processes of private initiative will not, however,\nprovide immediate employment for all of the men of our returning\narmies," Such is the esteem in which American business men are\nheld by American popular opinion and such is also the view which\nAmerican business men are inclined to take of their own place and\nvalue in the community. There need be no quarrel with it. But it\nwill be in place to call attention to the statement that "The\nordinary and normal processes of private initiative will not,\nhowever, provide immediate employment for all the men." It should\nbe added, as is plain to all men, that these ordinary and normal\nprocesses of private initiative never do provide employment for\nall the men available. In fact, unemployment is an ordinary and\nnormal phenomenon. So that even in the present emergency, when\nthe peoples of Christendom are suffering privation together for\nwant of goods needed for immediate use, the ordinary and normal\nprocesses of private initiative are not to be depended on to\nemploy all the available man power for productive industry. The\nreason is well known to all men; so well known as to be uniformly\ntaken for granted as a circumstance which is beyond human remedy.\nIt is the simple and obvious fact that the ordinary and normal\nprocesses of private initiative are the same thing as "business\nas usual," which controls industry with a view to private gain in\nterms of price; and the largest private, gain in terms of price\ncan not be had by employing all the available man power and\nspeeding up the industries to their highest productivity, even\nwhen all the peoples of Christendom are suffering privation\ntogether for want of the ordinary necessaries of life. Private\ninitiative means business enterprise, not industry.\nBut all the same, the profits of business come out of the\nproduct of industry; and industry is controlled, accelerated and\nslowed down with a view to business profits; and one outcome of\nthis arrangement so far, in America, has been the complacent\nestimate of this business enterprise formulated in the passage\nquoted above. The result of a businesslike management of industry\nfor private gain in America has on the whole been a fairly high\nlevel of prosperity. For this there are two main reasons: (a) the\nexceptionally great natural resources of the country; and (b) the\ncontinued growth and spread of population, (a) Business\nenterprise, that is to say private ownership, has taken over\nthese resources, by a process of legalised seizure, and has used\nthem up as rapidly as may be, with a view to private gain; all of\nwhich has gone to make private business profitable to that\nextent, although it has impoverished the underlying community by\nusing up its natural resources, (b) The continued growth and\nspread of population, by natural increase and by immigration, has\nfurnished the business men of this country a continually\nexpanding market for goods; both for goods to be used in\nproduction and transportation and for finished articles of\nconsumption. Hence the American business men have been in the\nfortunate position of not having to curtail the output of\nindustry harshly and persistently at all points. It is, in\neffect, for this continued growth of their market, caused by the\ngrowth of population, that the business men claim credit when\nthey "point with pride" to the resourcefulness and quick\ninitiative with which they have "developed the country," To their\ncredit be it said, they have on the whole not hindered the\ncountry\'s prosperity beyond what the traffic would bear; and the\npeculiar situation of this country hitherto has been such that\nthe traffic of business would bear a nearly uninterrupted\nexpansion of industry at perhaps something like one-half of its\npossible rate of expansion. To their own gain, and to the relief\nof the underlying community, they have been enabled profitably to\nlet the country\'s industry run on a moderately high level of\nefficiency,with more or less, but always a very appreciable\namount, of unemployment, idle plant, and waste of resources.\nAll that industry which comes in under the dominant machine\ntechnology -- that is to say all that fairly belongs in the new\norder of industry -- is now governed by business men for business\nends, in what is to be done and what is to be left undone. And\nwherever business enterprise has taken over the direction of\nthings the management is directed in part to the production of a\nmarketable supply, and in part to arranging for a profitable sale\nof the supply; and the strategy available for this latter, and\nindispensable, work lies almost wholly within the lines of\ncompetitive management already spoken of. In case these\nmanoeuvres of businesslike deviation and defeat are successful\nand fall into an orderly system whose operation may be continued\nat will, or in so far as this management creates an assured\nstrategic advantage for any given business concern, the result is\na vested interest. This may then eventually be capitalised in due\nform, as a body of intangible assets. As such it goes to augment\nthe business community\'s accumulated wealth. And the country is\nstatistically richer per capita.\nA vested interest is a marketable right to get something for\nnothing. This does not mean that the vested interests cost\nnothing. They may even come high. Particularly may their cost\nseem high if the cost to the community is taken into account, as\nwell as the expenditure incurred by their owners for their\nproduction and up-keep. Vested interests are immaterial wealth,\nintangible assets. As regards their nature and origin, they are\nthe outgrowth of three main lines of businesslike management: (a)\nLimitation of supply, with a view to profitable sales; (b)\nObstruction of traffic, with a view to profitable sales; and (c)\nMeretricious publicity, with a view to profitable sales. It will\nbe remarked that these are matters of business, in the strict\nsense. They are devices of salesmanship, not of workmanship; they\nare ways and means of driving a bargain, not ways and means of\nproducing goods or services. The residue which stands over as a\nproduct of these endeavors is in the nature of an intangible\nasset, an article of immaterial wealth; not an increase of the\ntangible equipment or the material resources in hand. The\nenterprising owners of the concern may be richer by that much,\nand so perhaps may the business community as a whole -- though\nthat is a precariously dubious point -- but the community at\nlarge is no better off in any material respect.\nThis account, of course, assumes that all this business is\nconducted strictly within the lines of commercial honesty. It\nwould only be tedious and misleading to follow up and take\naccount of that scattering recourse to force or fraud that will\nnever wholly be got rid of in the pursuit of gain, whether by way\nof business traffic or by more direct methods. Still, it may well\nbe in place to recall that the code of commercial honesty applies\nonly between the parties to a bargain, and takes no account of\nthe interests of any third party, except by express injunction of\nthe, law, still less does it imply any degree of regard for the\ncommon good. Commercial honesty, of course, is the honesty of\nself-help, or caveat emptor, which is Latin for the same thing.\nIn the ordinary course of management some considerable amount\nof means and effort is spent in the pursuit of profitable sales\nand in creating or acquiring an advantage in their further\npursuit. The enduring result, if any, is a body of intangible\nassets in the nature of what is called good-will. The ordinary\nexpenditure incurred for this purpose is so considerable, in\nfact, that the "selling cost" will not infrequently be far and\naway the larger part of those costs that are to be covered by the\nprice of advertised goods or advertised traffic. This necessary\nconsumption of work and means with a view to increase sales and\nto create a prospective increase of profits is to be counted as\nnet waste, of course; in the sense that it contributes nothing to\nthe total output of serviceable goods, present or prospective.\nThe net aggregate result is to lay equipment idle, hinder\ntraffic, and induce credulous persons now and again to change\ntheir mind about what things they will buy.\nRoughly, any business concern which so comes in for an\nhabitual run of free income comes to have a vested right in this\n"income stream," and this preferred standing of the concern in\nthis respect is recognised by calling such a concern a "vested\ninterest," or a "special interest," Free income of this kind, not\notherwise accounted for, may be capitalised if it promises to\ncontinue, and it can then be entered on the books as an item of\nimmaterial wealth, a prospective source of gain. So long as it\nhas not been embodied in a marketable legal instrument, any such\nitem of intangible assets will be nothing more than a method of\nnotation, a book-keeper\'s expedient. But it can readily be\ncovered with some form of corporation security, as, e.g.,\npreferred stock or bonds, and it then becomes an asset in due\nstanding and a vested interest endowed with legal tenure.\nOrdinarily any reasonably uniform and permanent run of free\nincome of this kind will be covered by an issue of corporate\nsecurities with a fixed rate of interest or dividends; whereupon\nthe free income in question becomes a fixed overhead charge on\nthe concern\'s business, to be carried as an item of ordinary and\nunavoidable outlay and included in the necessary cost of\nproduction of the concern\'s output of goods or services. But\nwhether it is covered by an issue of vendible securities or\ncarried in a less formal manner as a source of income not\notherwise accounted for, such a vested right to get something for\nnothing will rightly be valued and defended against infraction\nfrom outside as a proprietary right, an item of immaterial but\nvery substantial wealth.\nThere is nothing illegitimate or doubtful about this\nincorporation of unearned income into the ordinary costs of\nproduction on which "reasonable profits" are computed. "The law\nallows it and the court awards it." To indicate how utterly\ncongruous it all is with the new order of business enterprise it\nmay be called to mind that not only do the captains of\ncorporation finance habitually handle the matter in that way, but\nthe same view is accepted by those public authorities who are\ncalled in to review and regulate the traffic of the business\nconcerns governed by these captains of finance. The later\nfindings are apparently unequivocal, to the effect that when once\na run of free income has been capitalised and docketed as an\nasset it becomes a legitimate overhead charge, and it is then\njustly to be counted among necessary costs and covered by the\nprice which consumers should reasonably pay for the concern\'s\noffering of goods or services.\nSuch a finding has come to be a fairly well settled matter of\ncourse both among the officials and among the law-abiding\ninvestors, so far as regards those intangible assets that are\ncovered by vendible securities carrying a fixed rate; and the\nlogic of this finding is doubtless sound according to the\nprinciples of the modern point of view, which were put into\nstable form before the coming of corporation finance. There may\nstill be a doubt or a question whether valuable perquisites of\nthe same nature, which continue to be held loosely as an informal\nvested interest, as, e.g., merchantable good-will, are similarly\nentitled to the benefit of the common law which secures any owner\nin the usufruct of his property. To such effect have commonly\nbeen the findings of courts and boards of inquiry, of Public\nUtility Commissions, of such bodies as the Interstate Commerce\nCommission, the Federal Trade Commission, and latterly of divers\nrecently installed agencies for the control of prices and output\nin behalf of the public interest; so, for instance, right lately,\ncertain decisions and recommendations of the War Labor Board.\nAny person with a taste for curiosities of human behavior\nmight well pursue this question of capitalised free income into\nits further convolutions, and might find reasonable entertainment\nin so doing. The topic also has merits as a subject for economic\ntheory. But for the present argument it may suffice to note that\nthis free income and the business-like contrivances by which it\nis made secure and legitimate are of the essence of this new\norder of business enterprise; that the abiding incentive to such\nenterprise lies in this unearned income; and that the intangible\nassets which are framed to cover this line of "earnings,"\ntherefore, constitute the substantial core of corporate capital\nunder the new order. In passing, it may also be noted that there\nis room for a division of sentiment as regards this disposal of\nthe community\'s net production, and that peremptory questions of\nclass interest and public policy touching these matters may\npresently be due to come to a hearing.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"To some, this manner of presenting the case may seem \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"unfamiliar, and it may therefore be to the purpose to restate the\nupshot of this account in the briefest fashion: Capital -- at\nleast under the new order of business enterprise -- is\ncapitalised prospective gain. From this arises one of the\nsingularities of the current situation in business and its\ncontrol of industry; viz., that the total face value, or even the\ntotal market value of the vendible securities which cover any\ngiven block of industrial equipment and material resources, and\nwhich give title to its ownership, always and greatly exceeds the\ntotal market value of the equipment and resources to which the\nsecurities give title of ownership, and to which alone in the\nlast resort they do give title. The margin by which the\ncapitalised value of the going concern exceeds the value of its\nmaterial properties is commonly quite wide. Only in the case of\nsmall and feeble corporations, or such concerns as are balancing\nalong the edge of bankruptcy, does this margin of intangible\nvalues narrow down and tend to disappear. Any industrial business\nconcern which does not enjoy such a margin of capitalised free\nearning-capacity has fallen short of ordinary business success\nand is possessed of no vested interest.\nThis margin of free income which is capitalised in the value\nof the going concern comes out of the net product of industry\nover cost. It is secured by successful bargaining and an\nadvantageous position in the market; which involves some\nderangement and retardation of the industrial system, -- so much\nso as greatly to reduce the net margin of production over cost.\nApproximately the whole of this remaining margin of free income\ngoes to the business men in charge, or to the business concerns\nfor whom this management is carried on. In case the free income\nwhich is gained in this way promises to continue, it presently\nbecomes a vested right. It may then be formally capitalised as an\nimmaterial asset having a recognised earning-capacity equal to\nthis prospective free income. That is to say, the outcome is a\ncapitalised claim to get something for nothing; which constitutes\na vested interest. The total gains which hereby accrue to the\nowners of these vested rights amount to something less than the\ntotal loss suffered by the community at large through that delay\nof production and derangement of industry that is involved in the\ndue exercise of these rights. In other words, and as seen from\nthe other side, this free income which the community allows its\nkept classes in the way of returns on these vested rights and\nintangible assets is the price which the community is paying to\nthe owners of this imponderable wealth for material damage\ngreatly exceeding that amount. But it should be kept in mind and\nshould be duly credited to the good intentions of these\nbusinesslike managers, that the ulterior object sought by all\nthis management is not the 100 per cent of mischief to the\ncommunity but only the 10 per cent of private gain for themselves\nand their clients,"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"So far as they bear immediately on the argument at this point \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"the main facts are substantially as set forth. But to avoid any\nappearance of undue novelty, as well as to avoid the appearance\nof neglecting relevant facts, something more is to be said in the\nsame connection. It is particularly to be noted that credit for\ncertain material benefits should be given to this same business\nenterprise whose chief aim and effect is the creation of these\nvested rights to unearned income. It will be apparent to anyone\nwho is at all familiar with the situation, that much of the\nintangible assets included in the corporate capital of this\ncountry, e.g., does not represent derangement which is actually\ninflicted on the industrial system from day to day, but rather\nthe price of delivery from derangement which the businesslike\nmanagers of industry have taken measures to discontinue and\ndisallow.\nA concrete illustration will show what is intended. For some\ntime past, and very noticeably during the past quarter-century,\nthe ownership of the large industrial concerns has constantly\nbeen drawing together into larger and larger aggregations, with a\nmore centralised control. The case of the steel industry is\ntypical. For a considerable period, beginning in the early\nnineties, there went on a process of combination and\nrecombination of corporations in this industry, resulting in\nlarger and larger aggregations of corporate ownership. Commonly,\nthough perhaps not invariably, some of the unprofitable\nduplication and work at cross purposes that was necessarily\ninvolved in the earlier parcelment of ownership was got rid of in\nthis way, gradually with each successive move in this\nconcentration of ownership and control. Perhaps also invariably\nthere was a substantial saving made in the aggregate volume of\nbusiness dealings that would necessarily be involved in carrying\non the industry. Under the management of many concerns each\nintent on its own pecuniary interest, the details of business\ntransactions would be voluminous and intricate, in the way of\ncontracts, orders, running accounts, working arrangements, as\nwell as the necessary financial operations, properly so called.\nMuch of this would be obviated by taking over the ownership of\nthese concerns into the hands of a centralised control; and there\nwould be a consequent lessening of that delay and uncertainty\nthat always is to be counted on wherever the industrial\noperations have to wait on the completion of various business\narrangements, as they habitually do. There is circumstantial\nevidence that very material gains in economy and expedition\ncommonly resulted from these successive moves of consolidation in\nthe steel business. And this discontinuance of businesslike delay\nand calculated maladjustment was at each successive move brought\nto a secure footing and capitalised in an increased issue of\nnegotiable corporation securities.\nIt will also be recalled that, as a matter of routine, each\nsuccessive consolidation of ownership involved a recapitalization\nof the concerns so brought together under a common head, and that\ncommonly if not invariably the resulting recapitalisation would\nbe larger than the aggregate earlier capital of the underlying\ncorporations. Even where, as sometimes has happened, there was no\nincrease made in the nominal capitalisation, there would still\nresult an effectual increase; in that the market value of the\nsecurities outstanding would be larger after the operation than\nthe value of the aggregate capital of the underlying corporations\nhad been before. There has commonly been some gain in aggregate\ncapitalisation, and the resulting increased capitalisation has\nalso commonly proved to be valid. The market value of the larger\nand more stable capitalisation has presently proved to be larger\nand more stable than the capitalisation of the same properties\nunder the earlier r\ufffdgime of divided ownership and control. What\nhas so been added to the aggregate capitalisation has in the main\nbeen the relative absence of work at cross purposes, which has\nresulted from the consolidation of ownership; and it is to be\naccounted a typical instance of intangible assets. The new and\nlarger capitalisation has commonly made good; and this is\nparticularly true for those later, larger and more conclusive\nrecombinations of corporate ownership with which the so-called\nera of trust-making in the steel business came to a provisional\nconclusion. The U.S. Steel Corporation has vindicated the wisdom\nof an unreserved advance on lines of consolidation and\nrecapitalisation in the financing of the large and technical\nindustries.\nFor reasons well understood by those who are acquainted with\nthese things, no one can offer a confident estimate, or even a\nparticularly intelligent opinion, as to the aggregate amount of\noverhead burden and intangible assets which has been written into\nthe corporate capital of the steel business in the course of a\nfew years of consolidation. For reasons of depreciation, disuse,\nreplacement, extension, renewal, changes in market conditions and\nin technical requirements, the case is too intricate to admit\nanything like a clear-cut identification of the immaterial items\nincluded in the capitalisation. But there is no chance to doubt\nthat in the aggregate these immaterial items foot up to a very\nformidable proportion of the total capital.\nAnd what is true for the steel business in this respect will\ndoubtless apply even more unreservedly in transportation, or in\nsuch a case as the oil business. The latter may be taken as a\ntypical case, differing from steel in some of the circumstances\nwhich condition its business organisation, but comparable with\nsteel in respect of the necessity for a centralised control. In\nthe oil business a rough classification of assets would take some\nsuch shape as this: (a) Monopolisation of natural resources, (b)\nControl of markets by limitation of the supply, (c) Plant. Of\nthese three, the last named, the material equipment, would\nunquestionably be found to be altogether the slightest and least\nvaluable. What is not doubtful, in the steel business or in any\nof the other industrial enterprises that run on a similar scale\nand a similar level of technology, is that the owners of the\ncorporate capital have come in for a very substantial body of\nintangible assets of this kind, and that these assets of\ncapitalised free income will foot up to several times the total\nvalue of the material assets which underlie them.\nIt is evident that the businesslike management of industry\nunder these conditions need not involve derangement and cross\npurposes at every turn. It should always be likely that the\nbusiness men in charge will find it to their profit to combine\nforces, eliminate wasteful traffic, allow a reasonably free and\neconomical working of the country's productive powers within the\nlimits of a profitable price, and so come in for a larger total\nof free income to be divided amicably among themselves on a\nconcerted plan. This can be done by means of a combination of\nownership, such as the corporations of the present time. But\nthere is a difficulty of principle involved in this use of\nincorporation as a method of combining forces. Such a\nconsolidation of ownership and control on a large scale appears\nto be, in effect, a combination of forces against the rest of the\ncommunity or in contravention of the principles of free\ncompetition. In effect it foots up to the same thing as a\ncombination in restraint of trade; in form it is a concentration\nof ownership. Combination of owners in restraint of trade is\nobnoxious to the liberal principles of free bargaining and\nself-help; consolidation of ownership by purchase or\nincorporation appears to be a reasonable exercise of the right of\nfree bargaining and self-help. There is accordingly some chance\nof a difference of opinion at this point and some risk of playing\nfast and loose with these liberal principles that disallow\nconspiracy in restraint of trade. This difficulty of principle\nhas been sought to be got over by believing that a combination of\nownership in restraint of trade does not amount to a conspiracy\nin restraint of trade, within the purport of these liberal\nprinciples. There is a great and pressing need of such a\nconstruction of these principles, which would greatly facilitate\nthe work of corporation finance; but it is to be admitted that\nsome slight cloud still rests on this manner of disposing of\nownership. It involves abdication or delegation of that\ndiscretionary exercise of property rights which has been held to\nbe of the essence of ownership.\nThe new state of things brought about by such a consolidation\nis capitalised as a permanent source of free income. And if it\nproves to be a sound business proposition the new capitalisation\nwill measure the increase of income which goes to its promoter or\nto the corporation in whose name the move has been made; and if\nthe work is well and neatly done, no one else will get any gain\nfrom it or be in any way benefited by the arrangement. It is a\nbusiness proposition, not a fanciful project of public utility.\nThe capitalised value of such a coalition of ownership is not\nmeasured by any heightened production or any retrenchment of\nwaste that may come in its train, nor need the new move bring any\nsaving or any addition to the community's net productive\nresources in any respect. Indeed, it happens not infrequently\nthat such a waste-conserving coalition of ownership leads\ndirectly to a restriction of output, according to the familiar\nrun of monopoly rule. So frequently will restriction, enhanced\nprices, unemployment, and hardship follow in such a case, that it\nhas come to be an article of popular knowledge and belief that\nthis is the logical aim and outcome of any successful manoeuvre\nof the kind.\nSo also, though its output of marketable goods or services\nmay be got on easier terms, the new and larger business concern\nwhich results from the coalition need be no more open-handed or\nhumane in its dealings with its workmen. There will, in fact, be\nsome provocation to the contrary. A more powerful corporation is\nin a position to make its own terms with greater freedom, which\nit then is for the workmen to take or leave, but ordinarily to\ntake; for the universal rule of businesslike management -- to\ncharge what the traffic will bear -- continues to hold unbroken\nfor any business concern, irrespective of its size or its\nfacilities. As has already been noted in an earlier passage,\ncharging what the traffic will bear is the same as charging what\nwill yield the largest net profit."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"There stand over two main questions touching the nature and \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'uses of these vested interests: -- Why do not these powerful\nbusiness concerns exercise their autocratic powers to drive the\nindustrial system at its full productive capacity, seeing that\nthey are in a position to claim any increase of net production\nover cost? and, What use is made of the free income which goes to\nthem as the perquisite of their vested interest? The answer to\nthe former question is to be found in the fact that the great\nbusiness concerns as well as the smaller ones are all bound by\nthe limitations of the price system, which holds them to the\npursuit of a profitable price, not to the pursuit of gain in\nterms of material goods.

The\ngroup of belligerents has included primarily the great industrial\nnations, and the outcome of the war is being decided by the\nindustrial superiority of the advanced industrial peoples. A host\nof slightly backward peoples -- backward in the industrial\nrespect -- have been drawn into this contest of the great powers,\nbut these have taken part only as interested outliers and as\nauxiliaries to be drawn on at the discretion of the chief\nbelligerents. It has been a contest of technological superiority\nand industrial resources, and in the end the decision of it rests\nwith the greater aggregation of industrial forces. Frightfulness\nand warlike abandon and all the beastly devices of the heathen\nhave proved to be unavailing against the great industrial powers;\npartly because these things do not enduringly serve the\ntechnological needs of the contest, partly because they have run\ncounter to that massive drift of sentiment which animates the\ngreat industrial peoples.\nThe center of the warlike disturbance has been the same as\nthe center of growth and diffusion of the new order of industry.\nAnd in both respects, both as regards participation in the war\nand as regards their share in the new order of industry, it is\nnot a question of geographical nearness to a geographical center,\nbut of industrial affiliation and technological maturity. The\ncenter of disturbance and participation is a center in the\ntechnological respect; and in the end the battle goes to those\nfew great industrial peoples who are nearest, technologically\nspeaking, to the apex of growth of the new order. These need be\nsuperior in no other respect; the contest is decided on the\nmerits of the industrial arts. And in this connection it may be\nin place to call to mind again that the state of the industrial\narts is always a joint stock of knowledge and proficiency held,\nexercised, augmented and carried forward by the industrial\ncommunity at large as a going concern. What the war has\nvindicated, hitherto, is the great efficiency of the mechanical\nindustry.\nBut the ambitions and animosities which precipitated this\ncontest, and which now stand ready to bring on a renewal of it in\ndue time, are not of the industrial order, and eminently not of\nthe new order of technology. They have been more nearly bound up\nwith those principles of self-help that have stood over from the\nrecent past, from the time before the new order of industry came\ninto bearing. And there is a curious parallel between the\nconsequences worked out by these principles in the economic\nsystem within each of these nations, on the one hand, and in the\nconcert of nations, on the other hand. Within the nation the\nenlightened principles of self-help and free contract have given\nrise to vested interests which control the industrial system for\ntheir own use and thereby come in for a legal right to the\ncommunity\'s net output of product over cost. Each of these vested\ninterests habitually aims to take over as much as it can of the\nlucrative traffic that goes on and to get as much as it can out\nof the traffic, at the cost of the rest of the community. After\nthe same analogy, and by sanction of the same liberal principles,\nthe civilised nations, each and several, are vested with an\ninalienable right of "self-determination"; which being\ninterpreted means the self-aggrandisement of each and several at\nthe cost of the rest, by a reasonable use of force and fraud. And\nthere has been, on the whole, no sense of shame or of moral\nobliquity attaching to the use of so much force and fraud as the\ntraffic would bear, in this national enterprise of\nself-aggrandisement. Such has been use and wont among the\ncivilised nations.\nMeantime the new order of industry has come into bearing,\nwith the result that any disturbance which is set afoot by any\none of these self-determining nations in pursuing its own ends is\nsure to derange the conditions of life for all the others, just\nso far as these others are bound up in the same comprehensive\norganization of trade and industry. Full and free\nself-determination runs counter to the rule of Live and let live.\nAfter the same fashion the businesslike manoeuvres of the vested\ninterests within the nations, each managing its own affairs with\nan eye single to its own advantage, deranges the ordinary\nconditions of life for the common man, and violates the rule of\nLive and let live by that much. Self-determination, full and\nfree, necessarily encroaches on the conditions of life for all\nthe others.\nSo, just now there is talk of disallowing or abridging the\ninalienable right of free nations by so much as is imperatively\ndemanded for reasonably secure conditions of life among these\ncivilised peoples, and especially so far as is required for the\norderly pursuit of profitable business by the many vested\ninterests domiciled in these civilised countries. The project has\nmuch in common with the measures which have been entertained for\nthe restraint of any insufferably extortionate vested interests\nwithin the national frontiers.\nIn both cases alike, both in the proposed regulation of\nbusinesslike excesses at home and in the proposed league of\npacific nations, the projected measures of sobriety and tolerance\nappear to be an infraction of that inalienable right of\nself-direction that makes up the substantial core of law and\ncustom according to the modern point of view. There is much alarm\nfelt by the demagogues at the danger which is said to threaten\nthe national "sovereignty"; just as the vested interests are\nvolubly apprehensive of the "sacred rights of property." And in\nboth cases alike the projected measure of sobriety, tolerance and\nincidental infraction are designed to go no farther than is\nunequivocally demanded by the imperative needs of continued life\non earth; leaving the benefit of the doubt always on the side of\nthe insufferable vested interests or the mischievous national\nambitions, as the case may be; and leaving the impression that it\nall is a concessive surrender of principles under compulsion of\ncircumstances that will not wait. There is also in both cases\nalike a well-assured likelihood that the tentative revision of\nvested interests and of national pretensions is to be no more\nthan an incompetent remedial precaution, a makeshift shelter from\nthe wrath to come.\nIt is evident that in both cases alike we have to do with an\nincursion of ideas and considerations that are alien to the\nestablished liberal principles of human intercourse; but it is\nalso evident that these ideas and considerations have the\nsanction of that new order of things that runs in terms of\ntangible performance and enforces its requisitions with cruel and\nunusual punishments. It is these punishments that are to be\nevaded or suspended, and immunity is sought by diplomatic\nmeasures of formality and delay rather than by tangible\nperformance. In such a case the keepers of the established order\nwill always look to evasion and entertain a hope of avoiding\ncasualties and holding the line by the use of a cleverly designed\nmasquerade.\nIt is the express purpose of the projected league of pacific\nnations to keep the sovereign rights of national\nself-determination intact for all comers; it is to be a league of\nnations, not a league of peoples. But it should be sufficiently\nobvious, whether it is avowed or not, that these sovereign rights\ncan be maintained by these means only in a mutilated form. Within\nthe framework of any such league or common understanding the\nnations, each and several, can continue to exercise these rights\nonly on the basis of a mutual agreement to give up so much of\ntheir national pretensions as are patently incompatible with the\ncommon good. It involves a concessive surrender of the sovereign\nright of self-aggrandisement, and perhaps also an extension of\nthe rule of Live and let live to cover minor nationalities within\nthe national frontiers; a mutual agreement to play fair under the\nnew rules that are to govern the conduct of national enterprise.\nAny injunction to play fair is an infraction of national\nsovereignty. Hitherto no liberal statesman has been so audacious\nas to "imagine the king\'s death" and lay profane hands on the\ndivine right of nations to seek their own advantage at the cost\nof the rest by such means as the rule of reason shall decide to\nbe permissible. It is only that licence is to be hedged about,\nand all insufferable superfluity of naughtiness is provisionally\nto be disallowed. There is this evident resemblance and kinship\nbetween the vested interests of business and the sovereign rights\nof nations, but it does not amount to identity.\nThere is always something more to the national sovereignty\nand the national pretensions; although these precautionary\nmeasures that are now under advisement as touches the legitimate\nbounds of both do run on singularly similar lines and are of a\nsimilarly tentative and equivocal nature. In the prudent measures\nby which statesmen have set themselves to curb the excesses of\nthe greater vested interests within the nation their aim has\nquite consistently been to guard the free income of the lesser\nvested interests against the unseasonable rapacity of the greater\nones; all the while that the underlying community has come into\nthe case only as a fair field of business enterprise at large,\nwithin which there is to be maintained a reasonable degree of\nequal opportunity among these interests, big and little, in whom,\none with another, vests the effectual usufruct of the underlying\ncommunity.\nIt may be necessary to remark, by way of parenthesis, that\nwhile this description of these corrective measures may seem to\nhint at a fault, that is by no means its purpose. The fault may\nbe there, of course, but if so it has no bearing on the argument\nat this point. It should also be remarked in the same connection\nthat this description of facts does not overlook the\nwell-conceived verbal reservations and preambles with which\ncautious statesmen habitually surround the common good in the\nface of any unseasonable rapacity on the part of the greater\nvested interests; it is only that the run of the facts has been\nquite patently to the effect so indicated. In the same connection\nit may also not be out of place to recall that a vested interest\nis a prescriptive right to get something for nothing; in which\nagain the kinship and resemblance between vested interests in\nbusiness and the sovereign rights of nations comes into view.\nSo, on the other hand, the great war has brought into a\nstrong light the obvious fact that, given the existing state of\nthe industrial arts, any unseasonable rapacity on the part of the\ngreat Powers in exercising their inalienable right of national\nself-determination will effectually suppress the similarly\ninalienable right of self-determination in any minor nationality\nthat gets in the way. All of which is obnoxious to the liberal\nprinciple of self-help or to that of equal opportunity.\nUnhappily, these two guiding principles of the modern point of\nview self-help and equal opportunity -- have proved to be\nincompatible with one another under the circumstances of the new\norder of things. So there has come into view this project of a\nleague, by which it is proposed to play fast and loose with the\ninalienable right of national self-help by setting up some sort\nof a collusive arrangement between the Powers, a conspiracy in\nrestraint of national intrigue, looking to a reasonable\ndisallowance of force and fraud in the pursuit of national\nambitions.\nUnder the material circumstances of the new order those\ncorrectives that were once counted on to keep the run of things\nwithin the margin of tolerance have ceased to be a sufficient\nsafeguard. By use and wont, in the Liberal scheme of statecraft\nas well as in the scheme of freely competitive business, implicit\nfaith has hitherto been given to the remedial effect of punitive\ncompetition and the punitive correction of excesses by law and\ncustom. It has been a system of adjustment by punitive\nafterthought. All of which may once have been well enough in its\ntime, so long as the rate and scale of the movement of things\nwere slow enough and small enough to be effectually overtaken and\nset to rights by afterthought. The modern -- eighteenth-century\n-- point of view presumes an order of things which is amenable to\nremedial adjustment after the event. But the new order of\nindustry, and that sweeping equilibrium of material forces that\nembodies the new order, is not amenable to afterthought. Where\nhuman life and human fortunes are exposed to the swing of the\nmachine system, or to the onset of national ambitions that are\nserved by the machine industry, it is safety first or none.\nHowever, ripe statesmen and over-ripe captains of finance have so\nsecure a grasp of first principles that they are still able to\nbelieve quite sincerely in the good old plan of remedial\nafterthought, and it still commands the affectionate service of\nthe jurists and the diplomatic corps. Meantime the far-reaching,\nswift-moving, wide-sweeping machine technology has been drawn\ninto the service of national pretensions, as well as of the\nvested interests that find shelter under the national\npretensions, and both the remedial diplomats and the\nself-determination of nations are on the way to become a tale\nthat was told.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The divine right of nations appears to be a blurred \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'after-image of the divine rights of kings. It rests on ground\nmore archaic and less open to scrutiny than the Natural Right of\nself-direction as it applies in the case of individual persons.\nIt is a highly prized national asset, in the nature of an\nimponderable; and, very much as is true of the divine right of\nkings, any spoken doubt of its paramount validity comes near\nbeing a sin against the Holy Ghost. It can not safely be\nscrutinised or defined in matter-of-fact words. As is true of the\ndivine right of kings, so also as regards the divine right of\nnations, it is extremely difficult to show that it serves the\ncommon good in any material way, in any way that can be\nformulated or verified in terms of tangible performance.\nEvidently it does not come in under that mechanistic conception\nthat rules the scheme of knowledge and belief wherever and so far\nas material science and the machine technology have reshaped\nmen\'s habits of thought. Indeed, it is not a technological\nconception, late or early. It is not statable in terms of\nmechanical efficiency, or even in terms of price. Hence it is\nspoken of, often and eloquently, as being "beyond price." It is\nmore nearly akin to magic and religion. It should perhaps best be\nconceived as an end in itself, or a thing-in-itself -- again in\nclose analogy with the divine right of kings. But there is no\nquestion of its substantial reality and its paramount efficacy\nfor good and ill.\nThe divine -- that is to say inscrutable and irresponsible --\nright of kings reached its best estate and put on divinity in the\nstirring times of the Era of State-making; when the princes and\nprelates "tore each other in the slime." It was of a proprietary\nnature, a vested interest, something in the nature of intangible\nassets which embodied the usufruct of the realm, including its\npopulation and resources, and which could be turned to account in\nthe pursuit of princely or dynastic advantages at home and\nabroad. This divine right of princes was disallowed among the\nmore civilised peoples on the transition to modern ways of\nthinking, and the sovereign rights of the prince were then taken\nover -- at least in form and principle -- by the people at large,\nand they have continued to be held by them as some sort of\nimponderable "community property," -- at least in point of form\nand profession. The vested interest of the prince or the dynasty\nin the usufruct of the underlying community is thereby presumed\nto have become a collective interest vested in the people of the\nnations and giving them a "right of user" in their own persons,\nknowledge, skill and resources.\nThe mantle of princely sovereignty has fallen on the common\nman -- formally and according to the letter of the legal\ninstruments. In practical effect, as "democratic sovereignty" it\nhas been converted into a cloak to cover the nakedness of a\ngovernment which does business for the kept classes. In practical\neffect, the shift from the dynastic politics of the era of\nstate-making to the Liberal policies based on the enlightened\nprinciples of the eighteenth century has been a shift from the\npursuit of princely dominion to an imperialistic enterprise for\nthe protection and furtherance of those vested interests that are\ndomiciled within the national frontiers. That such has been the\npractical outcome is due to the fact that these enlightened\nprinciples of the eighteenth century comprise as their chief\narticle the "natural" right of ownership. The later course of\nevents has decided that the ownership of property in sufficiently\nlarge blocks will control the country\'s industrial system and\nthereby take over the disposal of the community\'s net output of\nproduct over cost; on which the vested interests live and on\nwhich, therefore, the kept classes feed. Hence the chief concern\nof those gentlemanly national governments that have displaced the\ndynastic states is always and consistently the maintenance of the\nrights of ownership and investment.\nHowever, these pecuniary interests of investment and free\nincome are not all that is covered by the mantle of democratic\nsovereignty. Nor will it hold true that the common man has no\nshare in the legacy of sovereignty and national enterprise which\nthe enlightened democratic commonwealth has taken over from the\ndeparted dynastic r\ufffdgime. The divine right of the prince included\ncertain imponderables, as well as the usufruct of the material\nresources of the realm. There were the princely dignity and\nhonor, which were no less substantial an object of value and\nambition and were no less tenaciously held by the princes of the\ndynastic r\ufffdgime than the revenues and material "sinews of war" on\nwhich the prestige and honor rested. And the common man of the\ndemocratic commonwealth has at least come in for a ratable share\nin these imponderables of prestige and honor that so are\ncomprised under the divine right of the nation. He has an\nundivided interest in the glamour of national achievement, and he\ncan swell with just pride in contemplating the triumphs of his\ngentlemanly government over the vested interests domiciled in any\nforeign land, or with just indignation at any diplomatic setback\nsuffered by the vested interests domiciled in his own.\nThere is also a more tangible, though more petty, advantage\ngained for the common man in having formally taken over the\nsovereignty from the dead hand of the dynastic prince. The common\nman being now vested with the divine right of national\nsovereignty, held in undivided community ownership, it is\nceremonially necessary for the gentlemanly stewards of the kept\nclasses to consult the wishes of this their sovereign on any\nmatters of policy that can not wholly be carried through in a\ndiplomatic corner and under cover of night and cloud. He,\ncollectively, holds an eventual power of veto. And this power of\nveto has in practice been found to be something of a safeguard\nagainst any universal and enduring increase of hardship at the\nhands of the gentlemen-investors to whom the conduct of the\nnation\'s affairs has been "entrusted;" a very modest safeguard,\nit is true, but always of some eventual consequence. There is the\ndifference that in the democratic commonwealth the common man has\nto be managed rather than driven, -- except for minor groups of\ncommon men who live on the lower-common levels, and except for\nrecurrent periods of legislative hysteria and judiciary\nblind-staggers. And it is pleasanter to be managed than to be\ndriven. Chicane is a more humane art than corporal punishment.\nImperial England is, after all, a milder-mannered stepmother than\nImperial Germany.\nAnd always the common man comes in for his ratable share in\nthe glamour of national achievement, in war and peace; and this\nimponderable gain of the spirit is also something. The value of\nthese collective imponderables of national prestige and\ncollective honor is not to be made light of. These count for very\nmuch in the drift and set of national sentiment, and moral issues\nof national moment are wont to arise out of them. Indeed, they\nconstitute the chief incentive which holds the common man to an\nunrepining constancy in the service of the "national interests,"\nSo that, while the tangible shell of material gain appears to\nhave fallen to the democratic community\'s kept classes, yet the\n"psychic income" that springs from national enterprise, the\nspiritual kernel of national elation they share with the common\nman on an equitable footing of community interest.\nThe vested rights of the nation are of the essence of that\norder of things which enjoys the unqualified sanction of the\nmodern point of view, Like any other vested interest, these\nrights are conceived in other terms than those which are native\nto the new order of material science and technology. They are of\nan older and more spiritual order, so far as regards the\nprinciples of knowledge and belief on which they rest. But\nwhatever may be their remoter pedigree, they have the sanction of\nthat body of principles that is called the modern point of view,\nand they belong in the scheme of things handed on by the Liberal\nmovement of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Apart from the\nimponderable values which fall under the head of national\nprestige, these vested rights of the nation can be defined as an\nextension to the commonwealth of the same natural rights of\nself-direction and personal security -- free contract and\nself-help -- that are secured to the individual citizen under the\ncommon law.\nYet, while the national policies of the democratic\ncommonwealths are managed by Liberal statesmen in behalf of the\nvested interests, they still run on the ancient lines of dynastic\nstatecraft, as worked out by the statesmen of the ancient r\ufffdgime;\nand the common man is still passably content to see the traffic\nrun along on those lines. The things which are considered\ndesirable to be done in the way of national enterprise, as well\nas the sufficient reasons for doing them, still have much of the\nmedieval color. National pretensions, enterprise, rivalry,\nintrigue and dissensions among the democratic commonwealths are\nstill such as would have been intelligible to Macchiavelli,\nFrederick the Great, Metternich, Bismarck, or the Elder Statesmen\nof Japan. Diplomatic intercourse still runs in the same terms of\nsystematised prevarication, and still turns about the same\nschedule of national pretensions that contented the medieval\nspirit of these masters of dynastic intrigue. As a matter of\ncourse and of common sense the nations still conceive themselves\nto be rivals, whose national interests are incompatible, and\nwhose divine right it is to gain something at one another\'s cost,\nafter the fashion of rival bandits or business concerns. They\nstill seek dominion and still conceive themselves to have\nextra-territorial interests of a proprietary sort. They still\nhold and still seek vested rights in colonial possessions and in\nextra-territorial priorities and concessions of divers and\ndubious kinds. There still are conferences, stipulations and\nguarantees between the Powers, touching the "Open Door" in China,\nor the equitable partition of Africa, which read like a chapter\non Honor among Thieves.\nAll this run of national pretensions, wrangles, dominion,\naggrandisement, chicane, and ill-will, is nothing more than the\nold familiar trading stock of the diplomatic brokers who do\nbusiness in dynastic force and fraud -- also called Realpolitik.\nThe democratic nations have taken over in bulk the whole job-lot\nof vested interests and divine rights that once made the monarch\nof the old order an unfailing source of outrage and desolation.\nIn the hands of those "Elder Statesmen" who once did business\nunder the signature of the dynasty, the traffic in statecraft\nyielded nothing better than a mess of superfluous affliction; and\nthere is no reason to apprehend that a continuation of the same\ntraffic under the management of the younger statesmen who now do\nbusiness in the name of the democratic commonwealth is likely to\nbring anything more comfortable, even though the legal\ninstruments in the case may carry the rubber-stamp O. K. of the\ncommon man. The same items will foot up to the same sum; and in\neither case the net gain is always something appreciably less\nthan nothing.\nThese national interests are part of the medieval system of\nends, ways and means, as it stood, complete and useless, at that\njuncture when the democratic commonwealth took over the divine\nrights of the crown. It should not be extremely difficult to\nunderstand why they have stood over, or why they still command\nthe dutiful approval of the common man. It is a case of aimless\nsurvival, on the whole, due partly to the inertia of habit and\ntradition, partly to the solicitous advocacy of these assumed\nnational interests by those classes -- the trading and\noffice-holding classes -- who stand to gain something by the\npursuit of them at the cost of the rest. By tenacious tradition\nout of the barbarian past these peoples have continued to be\nrival nations living in a state of habitual enmity and distrust,\nfor no better reason than that they have not taken thought and\nchanged their mind.\nAfter some slackening of national animosities and some\ndisposition to neglect national pretensions during the earlier\ndecades of the great era of Liberalism, the democratic nations\nhave been gradually shifting back to a more truculent attitude\nand a more crafty and more rapacious management in all\ninternational relations. This aggressive chauvinistic policy has\nbeen called Imperialism. The movement has visibly kept pace, more\nor less closely, with the increasing range and volume of commerce\nand foreign investments during the same period. And to further\nthis business enterprise there has been an ever increasing resort\nto military power. It is reasonably believed that traders and\ninvestors in foreign parts are able to derive a larger profit\nfrom their business when they have the backing of a powerful and\naggressive national government; particularly in their dealings\nwith helpless and backward peoples, and more particularly if\ntheir own national government is sufficiently unscrupulous and\noverbearing, -- which may confidently be counted on so long as\nthese governments continue to be administered by the gentlemanly\ndelegates of the vested interests and the kept classes.\nAs regards the intrinsic value which is popularly attached to\nthe imponderable national possessions, in the way of honor and\nprestige, there is little to be said, beyond the stale reflection\nthat there is no disputing about tastes. It all is at least a\nprofitable illusion, for the use of those who are in a position\nto profit by it. Such as the crown and the officeholders. But the\npeople of the civilised nations believe themselves to have also a\nmaterial interest of some sort in enlarging the national\ndominions and in extending the foreign trade of their business\nmen and safe-guarding the foreign claims of their vested\ninterests. And the Americans, like many others, harbor the\nsingular delusion that they can derive a collective benefit from\nobstructing the country\'s trade at the national frontiers by\nmeans of a tariff barrier, and so defeating their own industry by\nthat much. It is a survival out of the barbarian past, out of the\ntime when the dynastic politicians were occupied with isolating\nthe nation and making it self-sufficient, as an engine of warlike\nenterprise for the pursuit of dynastic ambitions and the greater\ndiscomfort of their neighbors. In an increasing degree as the new\norder of industry has come into bearing, any such policy of\nindustrial isolation and self-sufficiency has become more\ndifficult and more injurious; for a free range and unhindered\nspecialisation is of the essence of the new industrial order.\nThe experience of the war has shown conclusively that no one\ncountry can hereafter supply its own needs either in raw\nmaterials or in finished goods. Both the winning and the losing\nside have shown that. The new industrial order necessarily\noverlaps the national frontiers, even in the case of a nation\npossessed of so extensive and varied natural resources as\nAmerica. So that in spite of all the singularly ingenious\nobstruction of the American tariff the Americans still continue\nto draw on foreign sources for most or all of their tea, coffee,\nsugar, tropical and semi-tropical fruits, vegetable oils,\nvegetable gums and pigments, cordage fibers, silks, rubber, and a\nbewildering multitude of minor articles of daily use. Even so\npeculiarly American an industry as chewing-gum is wholly\ndependent on foreign raw material, and quite unavoidably so. The\nmost that can be accomplished by any tariff under these\ncircumstances is more or less obstruction. Isolation and\nself-sufficiency are already far out of the question.\nBut there are certain vested interests which find their\nprofit in maintaining a tariff barrier as a means of keeping the\nprice up and keeping the supply down; and the common man still\nfaithfully believes that the profits which these vested interests\nderive in this way from increasing the cost of his livelihood and\ndecreasing the net productivity of his industry will benefit him\nin some mysterious way. He is persuaded that high prices and a\nscant supply of goods at a high labor cost is a desirable state\nof things. This is incredible, but there is no denying the fact.\nHe knows, of course, that the profits of business go to the\nbusiness men, the vested interests, and to no one else; but he is\nstill beset with the picturesque hallucination that any unearned\nincome which goes to those vested interests whose central office\nis in New Jersey is paid to himself in some underhand way, while\nthe gains of those vested interests that are domiciled in Canada\nare obviously a grievous net loss to him. The tariff moves in a\nmysterious way, its wonders to perform.\nTo all adult persons of sound mind, and not unduly clouded\nwith the superstitions of the price system, it is an obvious\nmatter of fact that any protective tariff is an obstruction to\nindustry and a means of impoverishment, just so far as it is\neffective. The arguments to the contrary invariably turn out to\nbe pettifogger\'s special pleading for some vested interest or for\na warlike national policy, and these arguments convince only\nthose persons who are able to believe that a part is greater than\nthe whole. It also lies in the nature of protective tariffs that\nthey always cost the nation disproportionately much more than\nthey are worth to those vested interests which profit by them. In\nthis respect they are like any other method of businesslike\nsabotage. Their aim, and presumably their effect, is to keep the\nprice up by keeping the supply down, to hinder competitors and\nretard production. As in other instances of businesslike\nsabotage, therefore, the net margin of advantage to those who\nprofit by it is greatly less than what it costs the community.\nYet it is to be noted that the Americans have prospered, on\nthe whole, under protective tariffs which have been as\ningeniously and comprehensively foolish as could well be\ncontrived. There is even some color of reason in the contentions\nof the protectionists that the more reasonable tariffs have\ncommonly been more depressing to industry than the most imbecile\nof them. All of which should be disquieting to the advocates of\nfree trade. The defect of the free-trade argument, and the\ndisappointment of free-trade policies, lies in overlooking the\nfact that in the absence of an obstructive tariff substantially\nthe same amount of obstruction has to be accomplished by other\nmeans, if business is to prosper. And business prosperity is the\nonly manner of prosperity known or provided for among the\ncivilised nations. It is the only manner of prosperity on which\nthe divine right of the nation gives it a claim. A protective\ntariff is only an alternative method of businesslike sabotage. If\nand so far as this method of keeping the supply of goods within\nsalutary bounds is not resorted to, other means of accomplishing\nthe same result must be employed. For so long as investment\ncontinues to control industry the welfare of the community is\nbound up with the prosperity of its business; and business can\nnot be carried on without reasonably profitable prices; and\nreasonably profitable prices can not be maintained without a\nsalutary limitation of the supply; which means slowing down\nproduction to such a rate and volume as the traffic will bear.\nA protective tariff is only one means of crippling the\ncountry\'s industrial forces, for the good of business. In its\nabsence all that matter will be taken care of by other means. The\ntariff may perhaps be a little the most flagrant method of\nsabotage by which the vested interests are enabled to do a\nreasonably profitable business; but there is nothing more than a\ndifference of degree, and not a large difference at that. So long\nas industry is managed with a view to a profitable price it is\nquite indispensable to guard against an excessive rate and volume\nof output. In the absence of all businesslike sabotage the\nproductive capacity of the industrial system would very shortly\npass all reasonable bounds, prices would decline disastrously and\noverhead charges would not be covered, fixed charges on\ncorporation securities and other credit instruments could not be\nmet, and the whole structure of business enterprise would\ncollapse, as it occasionally has done in times of\n"over-production." There is no doing business without a fair\nprice, since the net price over cost is the motive of business. A\nprotective tariff is, in effect, an auxiliary safeguard against\noverproduction. Incidentally the fact that its imposition does\nnot result in insufferable hardship serves also to show that the\nnew order of industry is highly productive, quite inordinately\nproductive in fact. And it is a divine right of the nation to use\nits discretion and offset this inordinate efficiency of its\ncommon stock of knowledge by adroitly crippling its own commerce\nand the commerce of its neighbors, for the benefit of those\nvested interests that are domiciled within the national\nfrontiers.\nBut the divine right of national self-direction also covers\nmuch else of the same description, besides the privilege of\nsetting up a tariff in restraint of trade. There are many\nchannels of such discrimination, of divers kinds, but always it\nwill be found that these channels are channels of sabotage and\nthat they serve the advantage of some group of vested interests\nwhich do business under the shelter of the national pretensions.\nThere are foreign investments and concessions to be procured and\nsafeguarded for the nation\'s business men by moral suasion backed\nwith warlike force, and the common man pays the cost; there is\ndiscrimination to be exercised and perhaps subsidies and credits\nto be accorded those of the nation\'s business men who derive a\nprofit from shipping, for the discomfiture of alien competitors,\nand the common man pays the cost; there are colonies to be\nprocured and administered at the public expense for the private\ngain of certain traders, concessionaires and administrative\noffice-holders, and the common man pays the cost. Back of it all\nis the nation\'s divine right to carry arms, to support a\ncompetitive military and naval establishment, which has ceased,\nunder the new order, to have any other material use than to\nenforce or defend the businesslike right of particular vested\ninterests to get something for nothing in some particular place\nand in some particular way, and the common man pays the cost and\nswells with pride.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 7"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Live and Let Live"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The Nation's inalienable right of self-direction and \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['self-help is of the same nature and derivation as the like\ninalienable right of self-help vested in an irresponsible king by\nthe grace of God. In both cases alike it is a divine right, in\nthe sense that it is irresponsible and will not bear scrutiny,\nbeing an arbitrary right of self-help at the cost of any whom it\nmay concern. There is the further parallel that in both cases\nalike the ordinary exercise of these rights confers no material\nbenefit on the underlying community. In practical effect the\nexercise of such divine rights, whether by a sovereign monarch or\nby the officials of a sovereign nation, works damage and\ndiscomfort to one and another, within the national frontiers or\nbeyond them, with nothing better to show for it than some\nrelatively slight gain in prestige or in wealth for some\nrelatively small group of privileged persons or vested interests.\nAnd the gain of those who profit by this means is always got at\nthe cost of the common man at home and abroad. These inalienable\nrights are an abundant source of grievances to be redressed at\nthe cost of the common man.\nIt has long been a stale commonplace that the quarrels of\ncompetitive kings in pursuit of their divine rights have brought\nnothing but damage and discomfort to the underlying peoples whose\nmaterial wealth and man power have been made use of for national\nenterprise of this kind. And it is no less evident, though\nperhaps less notorious, that the pursuit of national advantages\nby competitive nations by use of the same material wealth and man\npower unavoidably brings nothing better than the same net output\nof damage and discomfort to all the peoples concerned. There is\nof course the reservation that in the one case the kings and\ntheir accomplices and pensioners have come in for some gain in\nprestige and in perquisites, while in the case of the competitive\nnations certain vested interests and certain groups of the kept\nclasses stand to gain something in the way of perquisites and\nfree income; but always and in the nature of the case the total\ngain is less than the cost; and always the gain goes to the kept\nclasses and the cost falls on the common man. So much is\nnotorious, particularly so far as it is a question of material\ngain and loss. So far as it is an immaterial question of jealousy\nand prestige, the line of division runs between nations, but as\nregards material gain and loss it is always a division between\nthe kept classes and the common man; and always the common man\nhas more to lose than the kept classes stand to gain.\nThe war is now concluded, provisionally, and peace is in\nprospect for the immediate future, also provisionally. As is true\nbetween individuals, so also among the nations, peace means the\nsame thing as Live and Let Live, which also means the same thing\nas a world made safe for democracy. And the rule of Live and Let\nLive means the discontinuance of animosity and discrimination\nbetween the nations. Therefore it involves the disallowance of\nsuch incompatible national pretensions as are likely to afford\nground for international grievances, -- which comes near\ninvolving the disallowance of all those claims and perquisites\nthat habitually go in under the captions of "national\nself-determination" and "national integrity," as these phrases\nare employed in diplomatic intercourse. At the same time it\ninvolves the disallowance of all those class pretensions and\nvested interests that make for dissension within the nation.\nIll-will is not a practicable basis of peace, whether within the\nnation or between the nations. So much is plain matter of course.\nWhat may be the chances of peace and war, at home and abroad, in\nthe light of these blunt and obvious principles taken in\nconjunction with the diplomatic negotiations now going forward at\nhome and abroad, -- all that is sufficiently perplexing.\nAt home in America for the transient time being, the war\nadministration has under pressure of necessity somewhat loosened\nthe strangle-hold of the vested interests on the country\'s\nindustry; and in so doing it has shocked the safe and sane\nbusiness men into a state of indignant trepidation and has at the\nsame time doubled the country\'s industrial output. But all that\nhas avowedly been only for the transient time being, "for the\nperiod of the war," as a distasteful concession to demands that\nwould not wait. So that the country now faces a return to the\nprecarious conditions of a provisional peace on the lines of the\nstatus quo ante. Already the vested interests are again\ntightening their hold and are busily arranging for a return to\nbusiness as usual; which means working at cross-purposes as\nusual, waste of work and materials as usual, restriction of\noutput as usual, unemployment as usual, labor quarrels as usual,\ncompetitive selling as usual, mendacious advertising as usual,\nwaste of superfluities as usual by the kept classes, and\nprivation as usual for the common man. All of which may\nconceivably be put up with by this people "lest a worse evil\nbefall," All this runs blamelessly in under the rule of Live and\nLet Live as interpreted in the light of those enlightened\nprinciples of self-help that have come down from the eighteenth\ncentury and that go to make up the established scheme of law and\norder, although it does not meet the needs of the same rule as it\nwould be enforced by the exigencies of the new order in industry.\nMeanwhile, abroad, the gentlemen of the old school who direct\nthe affairs of the nations are laying down the lines on which\npeace is to be established and maintained, with a painstaking\nregard for all those national pretensions and discriminations\nthat have always made for international embroilment, and with an\nequally painstaking disregard for all those exigencies of the new\norder that call for a de facto observance of the rule of Live and\nLet Live. It is notorious beyond need of specification that the\nnew order in industry, even more insistently than any industrial\nsituation that has gone before, calls for a wide and free\nintercourse in trade and industry, regardless of national\nfrontiers and national jealousies. In this connection a national\nfrontier, as it is commonly made use of in current statecraft, is\na line of demarkation for working at cross-purposes, for mutual\nobstruction and distrust, it is only necessary to recall that the\nerection of a new national frontier across any community which\nhas previously enjoyed the privilege of free intercourse\nunburdened with customs frontiers will be felt to be a grievous\nburden; and that the erection of such a line of demarkation for\nother diplomatic work at mutual cross-purposes is likewise an\nunmistakable nuisance.\nYet, in the peace negotiations now going forward the\ngentlemen of the old school to whom the affairs of the nations\nhave been "entrusted" -- by shrewd management on their own part\n-- continue to safeguard all this apparatus of mutual defeat and\ndistrust, -- and indeed this is the chief or sole object of their\nsolicitude, as it also is the chief or sole object of those\nvested interests for whose benefit the diplomatic gentlemen of\nthe old school continue to manage the affairs of the nations.',(0,a.jsx)(n.br,{}),'\nThe state of the case is plainly to be seen in the proposals\nof those nationalities that are now coming forward with a new\nclaim to national self-determination, invariably any examination\nof the bill of particulars set up by the spokesmen of these\nproposed new national establishments will show that the material\npoint of it all is an endeavor to set up a national apparatus for\nworking at mutual cross-purposes with their neighbors, to add\nsomething to the waste and confusion caused by the national\ndiscriminations already in force, to violate the rule of Live and\nLet Live at some new point and by some further apparatus of\ndiscomfort.\nThere are nationalities that get along well enough, to all\nappearance, without being "nations" in that militant and\nobstructive fashion that is aimed at in these projected creations\nof the diplomatic nation-makers. Such are the Welsh and the\nScotch, for instance. But it is not the object-lesson of Welsh or\nScottish experience that guides the new projects. The\nnationalities which are now escaping from a rapacious imperialism\nof the old order are being organized and managed by the safe and\nsane gentlemen of the old school, who have got their notions of\nsafety and sanity from the diplomatic intrigue of that outworn\nimperialism out of which these oppressed nationalities aim to\nescape. And these gentlemen of the old school are making no move\nin the direction of tolerance and good will -- as how should they\nwhen all their conceptions of what is right and expedient are the\ndiplomatic preconceptions of the old regime. They, being\ngentlemen of the old school, will have none of that amicable and\nunassuming nationality which contents the Welsh and the Scotch\nwho have tried out this matter and have in the end come to hold\nfast only so much of their national pretensions as will do no\nmaterial harm. What is aimed at is not a disallowance of bootless\nnational jealousies, but only a shift from an intolerable\nimperialism on a large scale to an ersatz-imperialism drawn on a\nsmaller scale, conducted on the same general lines of competitive\ndiplomacy and serving interests of the same general kind --\nvested interests of business or of privilege.',(0,a.jsx)(n.br,{}),'\nThe projected new nations are not patterned on the Welsh or\nthe Scottish model, but for all that there is nothing novel in\ntheir design; and how should there be when they are the offspring\nof the imagination of these safe and sane gentlemen of the old\nschool fertilised with the ancient conceptions of imperialistic\ndiplomacy and national prestige? In effect it is all drawn to the\nscale and pattern already made notorious by the Balkan states. It\nshould also be safe to presume that the place and value of these\nnewly emerging nations in the comity of peoples under the\nprospective r\ufffdgime of provisional peace will be something not\nnotably different from what the Balkan states have habitually\nplaced on view; which may be deprecated by many well-meaning\npersons, but which is scarcely to be undone by well-wishing. The\nchances of war and politics have thrown the fortunes of these\nprojected new nations into the hands of these politic gentlemen\nof the old school, and by force of inveterate habit these very\npractical persons are unable to conceive that anything else than\na Balkan state is fit to take the place of that imperial rule\nthat has now fallen into decay. So Balkan-state national\nestablishments appear to be the best there is in prospect in the\nnew world of safe democracy.\nSo true is this, that even in those instances, such as the\nFinns and other fragments of the Russian imperial dominions,\nwhere a newly emerging nation has set out to go on its way\nwithout taking pains to safeguard the grievances of the old\norder, -- even in these instances that should seem to concern no\none but themselves, the gentlemen of the old school who guard the\npolitical institutions of the old order in the world at large\nfind it impossible to keep their Wands off and to let these\nadventurous pilgrims of hope go about their own business in their\nown way. Self-determination proves to be insufferable if it\npartakes of the new order rather than of the old, at least so\nlong as the safe and sane gentlemen of the old school can hinder\nit by any means at their command. It is felt that the vested\ninterests which underlie the gentlemen of the old school would\nnot be sufficiently secure in the keeping of these unshorn and\nunshaven pilgrims of hope, and the doubt may be well taken. So\nthat, within the intellectual horizon of the practical statesmen,\nthe only safe, sane, and profitable manner of national\nestablishment and national policy for these newcomers is\nsomething after the familiar fashion of the Balkan states; and it\nmay also be admitted quite broadly that these newly arriving\npeoples commonly are content to seek their national fortunes\nalong precisely these Balkan state lines; although the Finns and\ntheir like are perhaps to be counted as an unruly exception to\nthe rule.\nThese Balkan states, whose spirit, aims, and ways are so\nadmirable in the eyes of the gentlemanly keepers of the old\npolitical and economic order, are simply a case of imperialism in\nthe raw. They are all and several still in the pickpocket stage\nof dynastic state-making, comparable with the state of Prussia\nbefore Frederick the Great Pickpocket came to the throne. And\nnow, with much sage counsel from the safe and sane statesmen of\nthe status quo ante. Czechs. Slovaks. Slovenes, Ruthenians,\nUkrainians, Croats, Poles and Polaks are breathlessly elbowing\ntheir way into line with these minuscular Michiavellians. Quite\nunchastened by their age-long experience in adversity they are\nall alike clamoring for national establishments stocked up with\nall the time-tried contrivances for discomfort and defeat. With\none hand they are making frantic gestures of distress for an\n"outlet to the sea" by means of which to escape insufferable\nobstruction of their overseas trade by their nationally minded\nneighbors, while with the other hand they are feverishly at work\nto contrive a customs frontier of their own, together with other\nstandard devices for obstructing their neighbors\' trade and their\nown, so soon as they shall have any trade to obstruct. Such is\nthe force of habit and tradition. In other words, these peoples\nare aiming to become self-determining nations in good standing.\nAnd all the while it is plain to all men that a national\n"outlet to the sea" has no meaning in time of pence and in the\nabsence of national governments working at cross-purposes. Which\ncomes near to saying that the sole material object of these new\nprojects in nation-making is to work at cross-purposes with their\nneighbors across the new-found national frontiers. So also it is\nplain that this mutual working at cross-purposes between the\nnations hinders the keeping of the peace, even when it is all\nmitigated with all the approved apparatus of diplomatic\nmake-believe, compromise, and intrigue. Just as it is plain that\nthe peace is not to be kept by use of armaments, but all the\nwhile national armaments are also included as an indispensable\nadjunct of national life, in all the projects of these new\nnations of the Balkan pattern. The right to carry arms is an\ninalienable right of national self-determination and an\nindispensable means of self-help, as understood by these\nnation-makers of the old school. So also it is plain that\nnational pretensions in the field of foreign trade and\ninvestment, and all the diversified expedients for furthering and\nprotecting the profitable enterprise of the vested interests in\nforeign parts, run consistently at cross-purposes with the\nkeeping of the peace.\nAnd all the while the rule of Live and Let Live, as it works\nout within the framework of the new industrial order, will not\ntolerate these things. But the rule of Live and Let Live, which\nembodies the world\'s hope of peace on earth and a practicable\nmodicum of good will among men, is not of the essence of that\ntime-worn statesmanship which is now busily making the world safe\nfor the vested interests. Neglect and disallowance of those\nthings that make for embroilment does not enter into the counsels\nof the nation-makers or of those stupendous figures of veiled\nstatecraft that now move in the background and are shaping the\ndestinies of these and other nations with a view to the status\nquo ante.']}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"All these peoples that now hope to be nations have long been \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'nationalities. A nation is an organisation for collective offence\nand defence, in peace and war, -- essentially based on hate and\nfear of other nations; a nationality is a cultural group, bound\ntogether by home-bred affinities of language, tradition, use and\nwont, and commonly also by a supposed community race, --\nessentially based on sympathies and sentiments of\nself-complacency within itself. The Welsh and the Scotch are\nnationalities, more or less well defined, although they are not\nnations in the ordinary meaning of the word; so also are the\nIrish, with a difference, and such others as the Finns and the\nArmenians. The American republic is a nation, but not a\nnationality in any full measure. The Welsh and the Scotch have\nlearned the wisdom of Live and Let Live, within the peace of the\nEmpire, and they are not moving to break bounds and set up a\nnational integrity after the Balkan pattern.\nThe case of the Irish is peculiar; at least so they say.\nThey, that is to say the Irish by sentiment rather than by\ndomicile, the Irish people as contrasted with the vested\ninterests of Ulster, of the landlords, of the Church, and of the\nbureaucracy,these Irish have long been a nationality and are now\nmobilising all their force to set up a Balkan state, autonomous\nand defensible, within the formal bounds of the Empire or\nwithout. Their case is peculiar and instructive. It throws a\nlight on the margin of tolerance, of what the traffic will bear,\nbeyond which an increased pressure on a subject population will\nbring no added profit to the vested interests for whose benefit\nthe pressure is brought to bear. It is a case of the Common Man\nhard ridden in due legal form by the vested interests of the\nIsland, and of the neighboring island, which are duly backed by\nan alien and biased bureaucracy aided and abetted by the priestly\npickpockets of the poor. So caught in this way between the devil\nand the deep sea, it is small wonder if they have chosen in the\nend to follow counsels of desperation and are moving to throw\ntheir lot into the deep sea of national self-help and\ninternational intrigue. They have reached the point where they\nhave ceased to say: "It might have been worse." The case of the\nFinns, Jews, and Armenians is not greatly different in general\neffect.\nIt is easy to fall into a state of perturbation about the\nevil case of the submerged, exploited, and oppressed minor\nnationalities; and it is not unusual to jump to the conclusion\nthat national self-determination will surely mend their evil\ncase. National self-determination and national integrity are\nwords to conjure with, and there is no denying that very\nsubstantial results have been known to follow from such\nconjuring. But self-determination is not a sovereign remedy,\nparticularly not as regards the material conditions of life for\nthe common man, for that somewhat more than nine-tenths of the\npopulation who always finally have to bear the cost of any\nnational establishment. It has been tried, and the point is left\nin doubt. So the case of Belgium or of Serbia during the past\nfour years has been scarcely less evil than that of the Armenians\nor the Poles. Belgium and Serbia were nations, in due form, very\nmuch after the pattern aimed at in the new projected nations\nalready spoken of, whereas the Armenians and the Poles have been\nsubject minor nationalities. Belgium. Serbia, and Poland have\nbeen subject to the ravages of an imperial power which claims\nrank as a civilised people, whereas the Armenians have been\nmanhandled by the Turks. So, again, the Irish are a subject minor\nnationality, whereas the Roumanians are a nation in due form. In\nfact the Roumanians are just such a balkan state as the Irish\naspire to become. But no doubt the common man is appreciably\nworse off in his material circumstances in Roumania than in\nIreland. Japan, too, is not only a self-determining nation with a\nfull charge of national integrity, but it is a Great Power; yet\nthe common man -- the somewhat more than nine-tenths of the\npopulation -- is doubtless worse off in point of hard usage and\nprivation in Japan than in Ireland.\nIn further illustration of this doubt and perplexity with\nregard to the material value of national self-determination, the\ncase of the three Scandinavian countries may be worth citing.\nThey are all and several self-determining nations, in that\nPickwickian sense in which any country which is not a Great Power\nmay be self-determining in the twentieth century. But they differ\nin size, population, wealth, power, and political consequence. In\nthese respects the sequence runs: Sweden, Denmark. Norway, the\nlatter being the smallest, poorest, least self-determining, and\nin point of self-determining nationalism altogether the most\nspectacularly foolish of the lot. But so far as concerns the\nmaterial conditions of life for the common man, they are\nunmistakably the most favorable, or the most nearly tolerable, in\nNorway, and the least so in Sweden. The upshot of evidence from\nthese, and from other instances that might be cited, is to leave\nthe point in doubt. It is not evident that the common man has\nanything to gain by national self-determination, so far as\nregards his material conditions of life; nor does it appear, on\nthe evidence of these instances, that he has much to lose by that\nmeans.\nThese Scandinavians differ from the Balkan states in that\nthey perforce have no imperialistic ambitions. There may of\ncourse be a question on this head so far as concerns the frame of\nmind of the royal establishment in the greater one of the\nScandinavian kingdoms; there is not much that is worth saying\nabout that matter, and the less that is said, the less annoyance.\nIt is a matter of no significance, anyway. The Scandinavians are\nin effect not imperialistic, perforce. Which means that in their\ninternational relations they formally adhere to the rule of Live\nand Let Live. Not so in their domestic policy, however. They have\nall endowed themselves with all the encumbrances of national\npretensions and discrimination which their circumstances will\nadmit. Apart from a court and church which foot up to nothing\nmore comfortable than a gratuitous bill of expense, they are also\ncontent to carry the burden of a national armament, a protective\ntariff, a national consular service, and a diplomatic service\nwhich takes care of a moderately burdensome series of treaty\nagreements governing the trade relations of the Scandinavian\nbusiness community; all designed for the benefit of the vested\ninterests and the kept classes of the nation, and all at the cost\nof the common man.\nThe case of these relatively free, relatively unassuming, and\nrelatively equitable national establishments is also instructive.\nThey come as near the rule of Live and Let Live as any national\nestablishment well can and still remain a national establishment\nactuated by notions of competitive self-help. But all the while\nthe national administration runs along, with nothing better to\nshow to any impartial scrutiny than a considerable fiscal burden\nand a moderate volume of hindrance to the country\'s industry,\ntogether with some incidental benefit to the vested interests and\nthe kept classes at the cost of the underlying community. These\nScandinavians occupy a peculiar position in the industrial world.\nThey are each and several too small to make up anything like a\nself-contained industrial community, even under the most\nunreserved pressure of national exclusiveness. Their industries\nnecessarily are part and parcel of the industrial system at\nlarge, with which they are bound in relations of give and take at\nevery point. Yet they are content to carry a customs tariff of\nfairly grotesque dimensions and a national consular service of\nmore grotesque dimensions still. This situation is heightened by\ntheir relatively sterile soil, their somewhat special and narrow\nrange of natural resources, and their high latitude, which\nprecludes any home growth of many of the indispensable materials\nof industry under the new order. Yet they are content to carry\ntheir customs tariff, their special commercial treaties, and\ntheir consular service -- for the benefit of their vested\ninterests.\nIt should seem that this elaborate superfluity of national\noutlay and obstruction should work great hardship to the\nunderlying community whose industry is called on to carry this\nburden of lag, leak, and friction. And doubtless the burden is\nsufficiently real. It amounts, of course, to the nation\'s working\nat cross-purposes with itself, for the benefit of those special\ninterests that stand to gain a little something by it all. But in\nthis as in other works of sabotage there are compensating\neffects, and these should not be overlooked; particularly since\nthe case is fairly typical of what commonly happens. The waste\nand sabotage of the national establishment and its obstructive\npolicy works no intolerable hardship, because it all runs its\ncourse and eats its fill within that margin of sabotage and\nwasteful consumption that would have to be taken care of by some\nother agency in the absence of this one. That is to say,\nsomething like the same volume of sabotage and waste is\nindispensable to the prosperity of business under the conditions\nof the new order, so long as business and industry are managed\nunder the conditions imposed by the price system. By one means or\nanother prices must be maintained at a profitable level for\nreasons of business; therefore the output must be restricted to a\nreasonable rate and volume, and wasteful consumption must be\nprovided for, on pain of a failing market. And all this may as\nwell be taken care of by use of a princely court, an otiose\nchurch, a picturesque army, a well-fed diplomatic and consular\nservice, and a customs frontier. In the absence of all this\nnational apparatus of sabotage substantially the same results\nwould have to be got at by the less seemly means of a furtive\nconspiracy in restraint of trade among the vested interests.\nThere is always something to be said for the national integrity.\nThe case of these Scandinavian nations, taken in connection\nand comparison with what is to be seen elsewhere, appears to say\nthat a national establishment which has no pretensions to power\nand no imperialistic ambitions is preferable, in point of economy\nand peaceable behavior, to an establishment which carries these\nattributes of self-determination and self-help. The more nearly\nthe national integrity and self-determination approaches to make\nbelieve the less mischief is it likely to work at home and the\nmore nearly will it be compatible with the rule of Live and Let\nLive in dealing with its neighbors. And the further implication\nis plain without argument, that the most beneficent change that\ncan conceivably overtake any national establishment would be to\nlet it fall into "innocuous desuetude." Apparently, the less of\nit the better, with no apparent limit short of the vanishing\npoint.\nSuch appears to be the object-lesson enforced by recent and\ncurrent events, in so far as concerns the material fortunes of\nthe underlying community at large as well as the keeping of the\npeace. But it does not therefore follow that all men and classes\nwill have the same interest in so neutralising the nation\'s\npowers and disallowing the national pretensions. The existing\nnations are not of a homogeneous make-up within themselves --\nperhaps less so in proportion as they have progressively come\nunder the rule of the new order in industry and in business.\nThere is an increasingly evident cleavage of interest between\nindustry and business, or between production and ownership, or\nbetween tangible performance and free income, -- one phrase may\nserve as well as another, and neither is quite satisfactory to\nmark the contrast of interest between the common man on the one\nhand and the vested interests and kept classes on the other hand.\nBut it should be sufficiently plain that the national\nestablishment and its control of affairs has a value for the\nvested interests different from what it has for the underlying\ncommunity.\nQuite plainly the new order in industry has no use or place\nfor national discrimination or national pretensions of any kind;\nand quite plainly such a phrase as "national integrity" has no\nshadow of meaning for this new industrial order which overruns\nnational frontiers and overcomes national discrimination as best\nit can, in all directions and all the time. For industry as\ncarried on under the new order, the overcoming of national\ndiscrimination is part of the ordinary day\'s work. But it is\notherwise with the new order of business enterprise, --\nlarge-scale, corporate, resting on intangible assets, and turning\non free income which flows from managerial sabotage. The business\ncommunity has urgent need of an efficient national establishment\nboth at home and abroad. A settled government, duly equipped with\nnational pretensions, and with legal and military power to\nmaintain the sacredness of contracts at home and to enforce the\nclaims of its business men abroad, -- such an establishment is\ninvaluable for the conduct of business, though its industrial\nvalue may not unusually be less than nothing.\nIndustry is a matter of tangible performance in the way of\nproducing goods and services. And in this connection it is well\nto recall that a vested interest is a prescriptive right to get\nsomething for nothing. Now, any project of reconstruction, the\nscope and method of which are governed by considerations of\ntangible performance, is likely to allow only a subsidiary\nconsideration or something less to the legitimate claims of the\nvested interests, whether they are vested interests of business\nor of privilege. It is more than probable that in such a case\nnational pretensions in the way of preferential concessions in\ncommerce and investment will be allowed to fall into neglect, so\nfar as to lose all value to any vested interest whose fortunes\nthey touch. These things have no effect in the way of net\ntangible performance. They only afford ground for preferential\npecuniary rights, always at the cost of someone else; but they\nare of the essence of things in that pecuniary order within which\nthe vested interests of business live and move. So also such a\nmatter-of-fact project of reconstruction will be likely\nmaterially to revise outstanding credit obligations, including\ncorporation securities, or perhaps even bluntly to disallow\nclaims of this character to free income on the part of\nbeneficiaries who can show no claim on grounds of current\ntangible performance. All of which is inimical to the best good\nof the vested interests and the kept classes.\nReconstruction which partakes of this character in any\nsensible degree will necessarily be viewed with the liveliest\napprehension by the gentlemanly statesmen of the old school, by\nthe kept classes, and by the captains of finance. It will be\ndeplored as a subversion of the economic order, a destruction of\nthe country\'s wealth, a disorganisation of industry, and a sure\nway to poverty, bloodshed, and pestilence. In point of fact, of\ncourse, what such a project may be counted on to subvert is that\ndominion of ownership by which the vested interests control and\nretard the rate and volume of production. The destruction of\nwealth, in such a case will touch, directly, only the value of\nthe securities, not the material objects to which these\nsecurities have given title of ownership; it would be a\ndisallowance of ownership, not a destruction of useful goods. Nor\nneed any disorganisation or disability of productive industry\nfollow from such a move; indeed, the apprehended cancelment of\nthe claims to income covered by negotiable securities would by\nthat much cancel the fixed overhead charges resting on industrial\nenterprise, and so further production by that much. But for those\npersons and classes whose keep is drawn from prescriptive rights\nof ownership or of privilege the consequences of such a shifting\nof ground from vested interest to tangible performance would\ndoubtless be deplorable.

So far as\nconcerns economic relations the principles which so became\nincorporated into the system of civilised law and custom at that\ntime were the principles of equal opportunity,\nself-determination, and self-help. Chief among the specific\nrights by which this civilised scheme of equal opportunity and\nself-help were to be safeguarded were the rights of free contract\nand security of property. These make up the substantial core of\nthat system of principles which is called the modern point of\nview, in so far as concerns trade, industry, investment, credit\nobligations, and whatever else may properly be spoken of as\neconomic institutions. And these still stand over today,\nparamount among the inalienable rights of all free citizens in\nall free countries; they are the groundwork of the economic\nsystem as it runs today, and this existing system can undergo no\nmaterial change of character so long as these paramount rights of\ncivilised men continue to be inalienable. Any move to set these\nrights aside would be subversive of the modern economic order;\nwhereas no revision or alteration of established rights and\nusages will amount to a revolutionary move, so long as it does\nnot disallow these paramount economic rights.\nWhen the constituent principles of the modern point of view\nwere accepted and the modern scheme of civilised life was\ntherewith endorsed by the civilised peoples, in the eighteenth\ncentury, these rights of self-direction and self-help were\ncounted on as the particular and sufficient safeguard of equity\nand industry in any civilised country. They were counted on to\nestablish equality among men in all their economic relations and\nto maintain the industrial system at the highest practicable\ndegree of productive efficiency. They were counted on to give\nenduring effect to the rule of Live and Let Live. And such is\nstill the value ascribed to these rights in the esteem of modern\nmen. The maintenance of law and order still means primarily and\nchiefly the maintenance of these rights of ownership and\npecuniary obligation.\nBut things have changed since that time in such a way that\nthe rule of Live and Let Live is no longer completely safeguarded\nby maintaining these rights in the shape given them in the\neighteenth century, -- or at least there are large sections of\nthe people in these civilised countries who are beginning to\nthink so, which is just as good for practical purposes. Things\nhave changed in such a way since that time, that the ownership of\nproperty in large holdings now controls the nation\'s industry,\nand therefore it controls the conditions of life for those who\nare or wish to be engaged in industry; at the same time that the\nsame ownership of large wealth controls the markets and thereby\ncontrols the conditions of life for those who have to resort to\nthe markets to sell or to buy. In other words, it has come to\npass with the change of circumstances that the rule of Live and\nLet Live now waits on the discretion of the owners of large\nwealth. In fact, those thoughtful men in the eighteenth century\nwho made so much of these constituent principles of the modern\npoint of view did not contemplate anything like the system of\nlarge wealth, large-scale industry, and large-scale commerce and\ncredit which prevails today. They did not foresee the new order\nin industry and business, and the system of rights and\nobligations which they installed, therefore, made no provision\nfor the new order of things that has come on since their time.\nThe new order has brought the machine industry, corporation\nfinance, big business, and the world market, Under this new order\nin business and industry, business controls industry. Invested\nwealth in large holdings controls the country\'s industrial\nsystem, directly by ownership of the plant, as in the mechanical\nindustries, or indirectly through the market, as in farming. So\nthat the population of these civilised countries now falls into\ntwo main classes: those who own wealth invested in large holdings\nand who thereby control the conditions of life for the rest; and\nthose who do not own wealth in sufficiently large holdings, and\nwhose conditions of life are therefore controlled by these\nothers. It is a division, not between those who have something\nand those who have nothing -- as many socialists would be\ninclined to describe it -- but between those who own wealth\nenough to make it count, and those who do not.\nAnd all the while the scale on which the control of industry\nand the market is exercised goes on increasing; from which it\nfollows that what was large enough for assured independence\nyesterday is no longer large enough for tomorrow. Seen from\nanother direction, it is at the same time a division between\nthose who live on free income and those who live by work, -- a\ndivision between the kept classes and the underlying community\nfrom which their keep is drawn. It is sometimes spoken of in this\nbearing -- particularly by certain socialists -- as a division\nbetween those who do no useful work and those who do; but this\nwould be a hasty generalisation, since not a few of those persons\nwho have no assured free income also do no work that is of\nmaterial use, as e.g., menial servants. But the gravest\nsignificance of this cleavage that so runs through the population\nof the advanced industrial countries lies in the fact that it is\na division between the vested interests and the common man. It is\na division between those who control the conditions of work and\nthe rate and volume of output and to whom the net output of\nindustry goes as free income, on the one hand, and those others\nwho have the work to do and to whom a livelihood is allowed by\nthese persons in control, on the other hand. In point of numbers\nit is a very uneven division, of course.\nA vested interest is a legitimate right to get something for\nnothing, usually a prescriptive right to an income which is\nsecured by controlling the traffic at one point or another. The\nowners of such a prescriptive right are also spoken of as a\nvested interest. Such persons make up what are called the kept\nclasses. But the kept classes also comprise many persons who are\nentitled to a free income on other grounds than their ownership\nand control of industry or the market, as, e.g., landlords and\nother persons classed as "gentry," the clergy, the Crown -- where\nthere is a Crown -- and its agents, civil and military.\nContrasted with these classes who make up the vested interests,\nand who derive an income from the established order of ownership\nand privilege, is the common man. He is common in the respect\nthat he is not vested with such a prescriptive right to get\nsomething for nothing. And he is called common because such is\nthe common lot of men under the new order of business and\nindustry; and such will continue (increasingly) to be the common\nlot so long as the enlightened principles of secure ownership and\nself-help handed down from the eighteenth century continue to\nrule human affairs by help of the new order of industry.\nThe kept classes, whose free income is secured to them by the\nlegitimate rights of the vested interests, are less numerous than\nthe common man -- less numerous by some ninety-five per cent or\nthereabouts -- and less serviceable to the community at large in\nperhaps the same proportion, so far as regards any conceivable\nuse for any material purpose. In this sense they are uncommon.\nBut it is not usual to speak of the kept classes as the uncommon\nclasses, inasmuch they personally differ from the common run of\nmankind in no sensible respect. It is more usual to speak of them\nas "the better classes," because they are in better circumstances\nand are better able to do as they like. Their place in the\neconomic scheme of the civilised world is to consume the net\nproduct of the country\'s industry over cost, and so prevent a\nglut of the market.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"But this broad distinction between the kept classes and their \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'vested interests on the one side and the common man on the other\nside is by no means hard and fast. There are many doubtful cases,\nand a shifting across the line occurs now and again, but the\nbroad distinction is not doubtful for all that. The great\ndistinguishing mark of the common man is that he is helpless\nwithin the rules of the game as it is played in the twentieth\ncentury under the enlightened principles of the eighteenth\ncentury.\nThere are all degrees of this helplessness that characterises\nthe common lot. So much so that certain classes, professions, and\noccupations -- such as the clergy, the military, the courts,\npolice, and legal profession -- are perhaps to be classed as\nbelonging primarily with the vested interests, although they can\nscarcely be counted as vested interests in their own right, but\nrather as outlying and subsidiary vested interests whose tenure\nis conditioned on their serving the purposes of those principal\nand self-directing vested interests whose tenure rests\nimmediately on large holdings of invested wealth. The income\nwhich goes to these subsidiary or dependent vested interests is\nof the nature of free income, in so far that it is drawn from the\nyearly product of the underlying community; but in another sense\nit is scarcely to be counted as "free" income, in that its\ncontinuance depends on the good will of those controlling vested\ninterests whose power rests on the ownership of large invested\nwealth. Still it will be found that on any test vote these\nsubsidiary or auxiliary vested interests uniformly range\nthemselves with their superiors in the same class, rather than\nwith the common man. By sentiment and habitual outlook they\nbelong with the kept classes, in that they are staunch defenders\nof that established order of law and custom which secures the\ngreat vested interests in power and insures the free income of\nthe kept classes. In any twofold division of the population these\nare therefore, on the whole, to be ranged on the side of the old\norder, the vested interests, and the kept classes, both in\nsentiment and as regards the circumstances which condition their\nlife and comfort.\nBeyond these, whose life-interests are, after all, closely\nbound up with the kept classes, there are other vested interests\nof a more doubtful and perplexing kind; classes and occupations\nwhich would seem to belong with the common lot, but which range\nthemselves at least provisionally with the vested interests and\ncan scarcely be denied standing as such. Such, as an illustrative\ninstance, is the A. F. of L. Not that the constituency of the A.\nF. of L. can be said to live on free income, and is therefore to\nbe counted in with the kept classes -- the only reservation on\nthat head would conceivably be the corps of officials in the A.\nF. of L., who dominate the policies of that organisation and\nexercise a prescriptive right to dispose of its forces, at the\nsame time that they habitually come in for an income drawn from\nthe underlying organisation. The rank and file assuredly are not\nof the kept classes, nor do they visibly come in for a free\nincome. Yet they stand on the defensive in maintaining a vested\ninterest in the prerogatives and perquisites of their\norganisation. They are apparently moved by a feeling that so long\nas the established arrangements are maintained they will come in\nfor a little something over and above what would come to them if\nthey were to make common cause with the undistinguished common\nlot. In other words, they have a vested interest in a narrow\nmargin of preference over and above what goes to the common man.\nBut this narrow margin of net gain over the common lot, this\nvested right to get a narrow margin of something for nothing, has\nhitherto been sufficient to shape their sentiments and outlook in\nsuch a way as, in effect, to keep them loyal to the large\nbusiness interests with whom they negotiate for this narrow\nmargin of preference. As is true of the vested interests in\nbusiness, so in the case of the A. F. of L., the ordinary ways\nand means of enforcing their claim to a little something over and\nabove is the use of a reasonable sabotage, in the way of\nrestriction, retardation, and unemployment. Yet the constituency\nof the A. F. of L., taken man for man, is not readily to be\ndistinguished from the common sort so far as regards their\nconditions of life. The spirit of vested interest which animates\nthem may, in fact, be nothing more to the point than an aimless\nsurvival.\nFarther along the same line, larger and even more perplexing,\nis the case of the American farmers, who also are in the habit of\nranging themselves, on the whole, with the vested interests\nrather than with the common man. By sentiment and outlook the\nfarmers are, commonly, steady votaries of that established order\nwhich enables the vested interests to do a "big business" at\ntheir expense. Such is the tradition which still binds the\nfarmers, however unequivocally their material circumstances under\nthe new order of business and industry might seem to drive the\nother way. In the ordinary case the American farmer is now as\nhelpless to control his own conditions of life as the commonest\nof the common run. He is caught between the vested interests who\nbuy cheap and the vested interests who sell dear, and it is for\nhim to take or leave what is offered, -- but ordinarily to take\nit, on pain of "getting left."\nThere is still afloat among the rural population a slow-dying\ntradition of the "Independent Farmer," who is reputed once upon a\ntime to have lived his own life and done his own work as good him\nseemed, and who was content to let the world wag. But all that\nhas gone by now as completely as the other things that are told\nin tales which begin with "Once upon a time." It has gone by into\nthe same waste of regrets with the like independence which the\ncountry-town retailer is believed to have enjoyed once upon a\ntime. But the country-town retailer, too, still stands stiffly on\nthe vested rights of the trade and of the town; he is by\nsentiment and habitual outlook a business man who guides, or\nwould like to guide, his enterprise by the principle of charging\nwhat the traffic will bear, of buying cheap and selling dear. He\nstill manages to sell dear, but he does not commonly buy cheap,\nexcept what he buys of the farmer, for the massive vested\ninterests in the background now decide for him, in the main, how\nmuch his traffic will bear. He is not placed so very differently\nfrom the farmer in this respect, except that, being a middleman,\nhe can in some appreciable degree shift the burden to a third\nparty. The third party in the case is the farmer; the massive\nvested interests who move in the background of the market do not\nlend themselves to that purpose.\nExcept for the increasing number of tenant farmers, the\nAmerican farmers of the large agricultural sections still are\nowners who cultivate their own ground. They are owners of\nproperty, who might be said to have an investment in their own\nfarms, and therefore they fancy that they have a vested interest\nin the farm and its earning-capacity. They have carried over out\nof the past and its old order of things a delusion to the effect\nthat they have something to lose. It is quite a natural and\nrather an engaging delusion, since, barring incumbrances, they\nare seized of a good and valid title at law, to a very tangible\nand useful form of property. And by due provision of law and\ncustom they are quite free to use or abuse their holdings in the\nland, to buy and sell it and its produce altogether at their own\npleasure. It is small wonder if the farmers, with the genial\ntraditions of the day before yesterday still running full and\nfree in their sophisticated brains, are given to consider\nthemselves typical holders of a legitimate vested interest of a\nvery substantial kind. In all of which they count without their\nhost; their host, under the new order of business, being those\nmassive vested interests that move obscurely in the background of\nthe market, and whose rule of life it is to buy cheap and sell\ndear.\nIn the ordinary case the farmers of the great American\nfarming regions are owners of the land and improvements, except\nfor an increasing proportion of tenant farmers. But it is the\nfarmer-owner that is commonly had in mind in speaking of the\nAmerican farmers as a class. Barring incumbrances, these\nfarmer-owners have a good and valid title to their land and\nimprovements; but their title remains good only so long as the\nrun of the market for what they need and for what they have to\nsell does not take such a turn that the title will pass by\nprocess of liquidation into other hands, as may always happen.\nAnd the run of the market which conditions the farmer\'s work and\nlivelihood has now come to depend on the highly impersonal\nmanoeuvres of those massive interests that move in the background\nand find a profit in buying cheap and selling dear. In point of\nlaw and custom there is, of course, nothing to hinder the\nAmerican farmer from considering himself to be possessed of a\nvested interest in his farm and its working, if that pleases his\nfancy. The circumstances which decide what he may do with his\nfarm and its equipment, however, are prescribed for him quite\ndeliberately and quite narrowly by those other vested interests\nin the background, which are massive enough to regulate the\ncourse of things in business and industry at large. He is caught\nin the system, and he does not govern the set and motions of the\nsystem. So that the question of his effectual standing as a\nvested interest becomes a question of fact, not of preference and\ngenial tradition.\nA vested interest is a legitimate right to get something for\nnothing. The American farmer -- say, the ordinary farmer of the\ngrain-growing Middle West -- can be said to be possessed of such\na vested interest if he habitually and securely gets something in\nthe way of free income above cost, counting as cost the ordinary\nrate of wages for work done on the farm plus ordinary returns on\nthe replacement value of the means of production which he\nemploys. Now it is notorious that, except for quite exceptional\ncases, there are no intangible assets in farming; and intangible\nassets are the chief and ordinary indication of free income, that\nis to say, of getting something for nothing. Any concern that can\nclaim no intangible assets, in the way of valuable good-will,\nmonopoly rights, or outstanding corporation securities, has no\nsubstantial claim to be rated as a vested interest. What\nconstitutes a valid claim to standing as a vested interest is the\nassured customary ability to get something more in the way of\nincome than a full equivalent for tangible performance in the way\nof productive work.\nThe returns which these farmers are in the habit of getting\nfrom their own work and from the work of their household and\nhired help do not ordinarily include anything that can be called\nfree or unearned income, -- unless one should go so far as to\ndeclare that income reckoned at ordinary rates on the tangible\nassets engaged in this industry is to be classed as unearned\nincome, which is not the usual meaning of the expression. It may\nbe that popular opinion on these matters will take such a turn\nsome time that men will come to consider that income which is\nderived from the use of land and equipment is rightly to be\ncounted as unearned income, because it does not correspond to any\ntangible performance in the way of productive work on the part of\nthe person to whom it goes. But for the present that is not the\npopular sense of the matter, and that is not the meaning of the\nwords in popular usage. For the present, at least, reasonable\nreturns on the replacement value of tangible assets are not\nconsidered to be unearned income.\nIt is true, the habits of thought engendered by the machine\nsystem in industry and by the mechanically standardised\norganisation of daily life under this new order, as well as by\nthe material sciences, are of such a character as would incline\nthe common man to rate all men and things in terms of tangible\nperformance rather than in terms of legal title and ancient\nusage. And it may well come to pass, in time, that men will\nconsider any income unearned which exceeds a fair return for\ntangible performance in the way of productive work on the part of\nthe person to whom the income goes. The mechanistic logic of the\nnew order of industry drives in that direction, and it may well\nbe that the frame of mind engendered by this training in\nmatter-of-fact ways of thinking will presently so shape popular\nsentiment that all income from property, simply on the basis of\nownership, will be disallowed, whether the property is tangible\nor intangible. All that is a speculative question running into\nthe future. It is to be recognised and taken account of that the\nimmutable principles of law and equity, in matters of ownership\nand income as well as in other connections, are products of\nhabit, and that habits are always liable to change in response to\naltered circumstances, and the drift of circumstances is now\napparently setting in that direction. But popular sentiment has\nnot yet reached that degree of emancipation from those good old\nprinciples of self-help and secure ownership that go to make up\nthe modern (eighteenth-century) point of view in law and custom.\nThe equity of income derived from the use of tangible property\nmay presently become a moot question; but it is not so today,\noutside of certain classes in the population whom the law and the\ncourts are endeavoring to discourage. It is the business of the\nlaw and the courts to discourage any change of insight or\nopinion.\nIt appears, therefore, that his conditions of life should\nthrow the American farmer in with the common man who has\nsubstantially nothing to lose, beyond what the vested interests\nof business can always take over at their own discretion and in\ntheir own good time. In point of material fact he has ceased to\nbe a self-directing agent; and self-help has for him come\nsubstantially to be a make-believe; although, of course, in point\nof legal formality he still continues to enjoy all the ancient\nrights and immunities of secure ownership and self-help. Yet it\nis no less patent a fact of current history that the American\nfarmer continues, on the whole, to stand fast by those principles\nof self-help and free bargaining which enable the vested\ninterests to play fast and loose with him and all his works. Such\nis the force of habit and tradition.\nThe reason, or at least the preconception, by force of which\nthe American farmers have been led, in effect, to side with the\nvested interests rather than with the common man, comes of the\nfact that the farmers are not only farmers but also owners of\nspeculative real estate. And it is as speculators in land-values\nthat they find themselves on the side of unearned income. As\nland-owners they aim and confidently hope to get something for\nnothing in the unearned increase of land-values. But all the\nwhile they overlook the fact that the future increase of\nland-values, on which they pin their hopes, is already discounted\nin the present price of the land,- except for exceptional and\nfortuitous cases. As is known to all persons who are at all\ninformed on this topic, farmland holdings in the typical American\nfarming regions are over-capitalised, in the sense that the\ncurrent market value of these farm-lands is considerably greater\nthan the capitalised value of the income to be derived from their\ncurrent use as farmlands. This excess value of the farmlands is a\nspeculative value due to discounting the future increased value\nwhich these lands are expected to gain with the further growth of\npopulation and with increasing facilities for marketing the farm\nproducts of the locality. It is therefore as a land speculator\nholding his land for a rise, not as a husbandman cultivating the\nsoil for a livelihood, that the prairie farmer, e.g., comes in\nfor an excess value and an over-capitalisation of his holdings.\nAll of which has much in common with the intangible assets of the\nvested interests, and all of which persuades the prairie farmer\nthat he is of a class apart from the common man who has nothing\nto lose.\nBut he can come in for this unearned gain only by the\neventual sale of his holdings, not in their cur rent use as a\nmeans of production in farming. As a business man doing a\nspeculative business in farmlands the American farmer, in a small\nway, runs true to form and so is entitled to a modest place among\nthat class of substantial citizens who, get something for nothing\nby cornering the supply and "sitting tight." And all the while\nthe massive interests that move obscurely in the background of\nthe market are increasingly in a position, in their own good\ntime, to disallow the farmer just so much of this still-born gain\nas they may dispassionately consider to be convenient for their\nown ends. And so the farmer-speculator of the prairie continues\nto stand fast by the principles of equity which entitle these\nvested interests to play fast and loose with him and all his\nworks.\nThe facts of the case stand somewhat different as regards the\nAmerican farmer\'s gains from his work as a husbandman, or from\nthe use which he makes of his land and stock in farming. His\nreturns from his work are notably scant. So much so that it is\nstill an open question whether, taken one with another, the\nAmerican farmer\'s assets in land and other equipment enable him,\none year with another, to earn more than what would count as\nordinary wages for the labor which these assets enable him to put\ninto his product. But it is beyond question that the common run\nof those American farmers who "work their own land" get at the\nbest a very modest return for the use of their land and stock, --\nso scant, indeed, that if usage admitted such an expression, it\nwould be fair to say that the farmer, considered as a going\nconcern, should be credited with an appreciable item of "negative\nintangible assets," such as habitually to reduce the net average\nreturn on his total active assets appreciably below the ordinary\nrate of discount. His case, in other words, is the reverse of the\ntypical business concern of the larger sort, which comes in for a\nnet excess over ordinary rates of discount on its tangible\nassets, and which is thereby enabled to write into its accounts a\ncertain amount of intangible assets, and so come into line as a\nvested interest. The farmer, too, is caught in the net of the new\norder; but his occupation does not belong to that new order of\nbusiness enterprise in which earning-capacity habitually outruns\nthe capitalised value of the underlying physical property.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Evidently the cleavage due to be brought on by the new order \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'in business and industry, between the vested interests and the\ncommon man, has not vet fallen into clear lines, at least not in\nAmerica. The common man does not know himself as such, at least\nnot yet, and the sections of the population which go to make up\nthe common lot as contrasted with the vested interests have not\nyet learned to make common cause. The American tradition stands\nin the way. This tradition says that the people of the republic\nare made up of ungraded masterless men who enjoy all the rights\nand immunities of self-direction, self-help, free bargaining, and\nequal opportunity, quite after the fashion that was sketched into\nthe great constituent documents of the eighteenth century.\nMuch doubt and some discontent is afoot. It is becoming\nincreasingly evident that the facts of everyday life under the\nnew order do not fall in with the inherited principles of law and\ncustom; but the farmers, farm laborers, factory hands, mine\nworkmen, lumber hands, and retail tradesmen have not come to\nanything like a realisation of that new order of economic life\nwhich throws them in together on one side of a line of division,\non the other side of which stand the vested interests and the\nkept classes. They have not yet come to realise that all of them\ntogether have nothing to lose except such things as the vested\ninterests can quite legally and legitimately deprive them of,\nwith full sanction of law and custom as it runs, so soon and so\nfar as it shall suit the convenience of the vested interests to\nmake such a move. These people of the variegated mass have no\nsafeguard, in fact, against the control of their conditions of\nlife exercised by those massive interests that move obscurely in\nthe background of the market, except such considerations of\nexpediency as may govern the manoeuvres of those massive ones who\nso move obscurely in the background. That is to say, the\nconditions of life for the variegated mass are determined by what\nthe traffic will bear, according to the calculations of self-help\nwhich guide the vested interests, all the while that the farmers,\nworkmen, consumers, the common lot, are still animated with the\nfancy that they have themselves something to say in these\npremises.\nIt is otherwise with the vested interests, on the whole. They\ntake a more perspicuous view of their own case and of the\npredicament of the common man, the party of the second part.\nWhereas the variegated mass that makes up the common lot have not\nhitherto deliberately taken sides together or defined their own\nattitude toward the established system of law and order and its\ncontinuance, and so are neither in the right nor in the wrong as\nregards this matter, the vested interests and the kept classes,\non the other hand, have reached insight and definition of what\nthey need, want, and are entitled to. They have deliberated and\nchosen their part in the division, partly by interest and partly\nby ingrained habitual bent, no doubt, -- and they are always in\nthe right. They owe their position and the blessings that come of\nit -- free income and social prerogative -- to the continued\nenforcement of these eighteenth-century principles of law and\norder under conditions created by the twentieth-century state of\nthe industrial arts. Therefore, it is incumbent on them, in point\nof expediency, to stand strongly for the established order of\ninalienable eighteenth-century rights; and they are at the same\ntime in the right, in point of law and morals, in so doing, since\nwhat is right in law and morals is always a question of settled\nhabit, and settled habit is always a legacy out of the past. To\ntake their own part, therefore, the vested interests and the kept\nclasses have nothing more perplexing to do than simply to follow\nthe leadings of their settled code in all questions of law and\norder and thereby to fall neatly in with the leading of their own\npecuniary advantage, and always and on both counts to keep their\npoise as safe and sound citizens intelligently abiding by the\ngood old principles of right and honest living which safeguard\ntheir vested rights.\nThe common man is not so fortunate. He cannot effectually\ntake his own part in this difficult conjuncture of circumstances\nwithout getting on the wrong side of the established run of law\nand morals, Unless he is content to go on as the party of the\nsecond part in a traffic that is controlled by the massive\ninterests on the footing of what they consider that the traffic\nwill bear, he will find himself in the wrong and may even come in\nfor the comfortless attention of the courts. Whereas if he makes\nhis peace with the established run of law and custom, and so\ncontinues to be rated as a good man and true, he will find that\nhis livelihood falls into a dubious and increasingly precarious\ncase. It is not for nothing that he is a common man.\nSo caught in a quandary, it is small wonder if the common man\nis somewhat irresponsible and unsteady in his aims and conduct,\nso far as touches industrial affairs. A pious regard for the\nreceived code of right and honest living holds him to a\nsubmissive quietism, a make-believe of self-help and fair\ndealings; whereas the material and pecuniary circumstances that\ncondition his livelihood under this new order drive him to fall\nback on the underlying rule of Live and Let Live, and to revise\nthe established code of law and custom to such purpose that this\nunderlying rule of life shall be brought into bearing in point of\nfact as well as in point of legal formality. And the training to\nwhich the hard matter-of-fact logic of the machine industry and\nthe mechanical organisation of life now subjects him, constantly\nbends him to a matter-of-fact outlook, to a rating of men and\nthings in terms of tangible performance, and to an ever slighter\nrespect for the traditional principles that have come down from\nthe eighteenth century. The common man is constantly and\nincreasingly exposed to the risk of becoming an undesirable\ncitizen in the eyes of the votaries of law and order. In other\nwords, vested rights to free income are no longer felt to be\nsecure in case the common man should take over the direction of\naffairs.\nSuch a vested right to free income, that is to say this\nlegitimate right of the kept classes to their keep at the cost of\nthe underlying community, does not fall in with the lines of that\nmechanistic outlook and mechanistic logic which is forever\ngaining ground as the new order of industry goes forward. Such\nfree income, which measures neither the investor\'s personal\ncontribution to the production of goods nor his necessary\nconsumption while engaged in industry, does not fit in with that\nmechanistic reckoning that runs in terms of tangible performance,\nand that grows ever increasingly habitual and convincing with\nevery further habituation to the new order of things in the\nindustrial world. Vested perquisites have no place in the new\nscheme of things; hence the new scheme is a menace. It is true,\nthe well stabilised principles of the eighteenth century still\ncontinue to rate the investor as a producer of goods; but it is\nequally true that such a rating is palpable nonsense according to\nthe mechanistic calculus of the new order, brought into bearing\nby the mechanical industry and material science. This may all be\nan untoward and distasteful turn of circumstances, but there is\nno gain of tranquillity to be got from ignoring it.\nSo it comes about that, increasingly, throughout broad\nclasses in these industrial countries there is coming to be\nvisible a lack of respect and affection for the vested interests,\nwhether of business or of privilege; and it rises to the pitch of\ndistrust and plain disallowance among those peoples on whom the\npreconceptions of the eighteenth century sit more lightly and\nloosely. It still is all vague and shifty. So much so that the\nguardians of law and order are still persuaded that they "have\nthe situation in hand." But the popular feeling of incongruity\nand uselessness in the current run of law and custom under the\nrule of these timeworn preconceptions is visibly gaining ground\nand gathering consistency, even in so well ordered a republic as\nAmerica. A cleavage of sentiment is beginning to run between the\nvested interests and the variegated mass of the common lot., and\nincreasingly the common man is growing apathetic, or even\nimpervious, to appeals grounded on these timeworn preconceptions\nof equity and good usage.\nThe fact of such a cleavage, as well as the existence of any\nground for it, is painstakingly denied by the spokesmen of the\nvested interests; and in support of that comfortable delusion\nthey will cite the exemplary fashion in which certain\nmonopolistic labor organisations "stand pat," It is true, such a\nquasi-vested interest of the A. F. of L., which unbidden assumes\nto speak for the common man, can doubtless be counted on to\n"stand pat" on that system of imponderables in which its vested\nperquisites reside. So also the kept classes, and their stewards\namong the keepers of law and custom, are inflexibly content to\nlet well enough alone. They can be counted on to see nothing more\nto the point than a stupidly subversive rapacity in that\nloosening of the bonds of convention that so makes light of the\nsacred rights of vested interest. Interested motives may count\nfor something on both sides, but it is also true that the kept\nclasses and the businesslike managers of the vested interests,\nwhose place in the economy of nature it is to make money by\nconforming to the received law and custom, have not in the same\ndegree undergone the shattering discipline of the New Order. They\nare, therefore, still to be found standing blamelessly on the\nstable principles of the Modern Point of View.\nBut a large fraction of the people in the industrial\ncountries is visibly growing uneasy under these principles as\nthey work out under existing circumstances. So, e.g., it is\nevident that the common man within the United Kingdom, in so far\nas the Labor Party is his accredited spokesman, is increasingly\nrestive under the state of "things as they are," and it is\nscarcely less evident that he finds his abiding grievance in the\nVested Interests and that system of law and custom which\ncherishes them. And these men, as well as their like in other\ncountries, are still in an unsettled state of advance to\npositions more definitely at variance with the received law and\ncustom. In some instances, and indeed in more or less massive\nformation, this movement of dissent has already reached the limit\nof tolerance and has found itself sharply checked by the\nconstituted keepers of law and custom.\nIt is perhaps not unwarranted to count the I. W. W. as such a\nvanguard of dissent, in spite of the slight consistency and the\nexuberance of its movements. After all, these and their like,\nhere and in other countries are an element of appreciable weight\nin the population. They are also increasingly numerous, in spite\nof well-conceived repressive measures, and they appear to grow\nincreasingly sure. And it will not do to lose sight of the\npresumption that, while they may be gravely in the wrong, they\nare likely not to be far out of touch with the undistinguished\nmass of the common sort who still continue to live within the\nlaw. It should seem likely that the peculiar moral and\nintellectual bent which marks them as "undesirable citizens"\nwill, all the while, be found to run closer to that of the common\nman than the corresponding bent of the law-abiding beneficiaries\nunder the existing system.\nVaguely, perhaps, and with a picturesque irresponsibility,\nthese and their like are talking and thinking at cross-purposes\nwith the principles of free bargain and self-help. There is\nreason to believe that to their own thinking, when cast in the\nterms in which they conceive these things, their notions of\nreasonable human intercourse are not equally fantastic and\ninconclusive. So, there is the dread word. Syndicalism, which is\nquite properly unintelligible to the kept classes and the adepts\nof corporation finance, and which has no definable meaning within\nthe constituent principles of the eighteenth century. But the\nnotion of it seems to come easy, by mere lapse of habit, to these\nothers in whom the discipline of the New Order has begun to\ndisplace the preconceptions of the eighteenth century.\nThen there are, in this country, the agrarian syndicalists,\nin the shape of the Nonpartisan League, large, loose, animated,\nand untidy, but sure of itself in its settled disallowance of the\nVested Interests, and fast passing the limit of tolerance in its\ninattention to the timeworn principles of equity. How serious is\nthe moral dereliction and the subversive stupidity of these\nagrarian syndicalists, in the eyes of those who still hold fast\nto the eighteenth century, may be gathered from the animation of\nthe business community, the commercial clubs, the Rotarians, and\nthe traveling salesmen, in any glace where the League raises its\nuntidy head. And as if advisedly to complete the case, these\nagrarians, as well as their running-mates in the industrial\ncenters and along the open road, are found to be slack in respect\nof their national spirit. So, at least, it is said by those who\nare interested to know.\nIt is not that these and their like are ready with "a\nsatisfactory constructive program," such as the people of the\nuplift require to be shown before they will believe that things\nare due to change. It is something of the simpler and cruder\nsort, such as history is full of, to the effect that whenever and\nso far as the time-worn rules no longer fit the new material\ncircumstances they presently fail to carry conviction as they\nonce did. Such wear and tear of institutions is unavoidable where\ncircumstances change; and it is through the altered personal\nequation of those elements of the population which are most\ndirectly exposed to the changing circumstances that the wear and\ntear of institutions may be expected to take effect. To these\nuntidy creatures of the New Order common honesty appears to mean\nvaguely something else, perhaps something more exacting, than\nwhat was "nominated in the bond" at the time when the free\nbargain and self-help were written into the moral constitution of\nChristendom by the handicraft industry and the petty trade.
