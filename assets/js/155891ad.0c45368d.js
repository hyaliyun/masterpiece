She played and sang;--and drew\r\nin almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;\r\nand in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she\r\nwould have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.\r\nShe was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist\r\nor a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,\r\nor sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher\r\nthan it deserved."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most;\r\nher style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\r\nbeen ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\r\nwould have been the same.

Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.\r\nDear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion.\r\nShe would sit whenever I asked her.  There is my sister; and really\r\nquite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.\r\nI should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have\r\nsat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four\r\nchildren that she would not be quiet.  Then, here come all my\r\nattempts at three of those four children;--there they are,\r\nHenry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other,\r\nand any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so\r\neager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no\r\nmaking children of three or four years old stand still you know;\r\nnor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the\r\nair and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any\r\nof mama\'s children ever were.  Here is my sketch of the fourth,\r\nwho was a baby.  I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it\r\nis as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.\r\nHe had nestled down his head most conveniently.
