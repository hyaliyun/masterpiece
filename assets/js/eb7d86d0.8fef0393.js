In an\r\neloquent discourse, pronounced over his premature grave, Emile\r\nZola well defined this illusion: "We congratulated him," said he,\r\n"upon that health which seemed unbreakable, and justly credited\r\nhim with the soundest constitution of our band, as well as with\r\nthe clearest mind and the sanest reason.

Considered as documents revealing the\r\ncast of mind of him who composed them, these two lyrical essays\r\nare especially significant, since they were spontaneous. They\r\nexplain why De Maupassant, in the early years of production,\r\nvoluntarily chose, as the heroes of his stories, creatures very\r\nnear to primitive existence, peasants, sailors, poachers, girls\r\nof the farm, and the source of the vigor with which he describes\r\nthese rude figures. The robustness of his animalism permits him\r\nfully to imagine all the simple sensations of these beings, while\r\nhis pessimism, which tinges these sketches of brutal customs with\r\nan element of delicate scorn, preserves him from coarseness. It\r\nis this constant and involuntary antithesis which gives unique\r\nvalue to those Norman scenes which have contributed so much to\r\nhis glory.

How is one ambition to be satisfied\r\nat the same time as the other, since all gain in color and\r\nmovement brings about a diminution of sensibility, and\r\nconversely?

The first theory bears upon\r\nthe choice of personages and the story of the romance, the second\r\nupon the character of the style. The son of a physician, and\r\nbrought up in the rigors of scientific method, Flaubert believed\r\nthis method to be efficacious in art as in science. For instance,\r\nin the writing of a romance, he seemed to be as scientific as in\r\nthe development of a history of customs, in which the essential\r\nis absolute exactness and local color.

Beyond\r\neverything he tried to select details that were eminently\r\nsignificant. Consequently he was of the opinion that the romance\r\nwriter should discard all that lessened this significance, that\r\nis, extraordinary events and singular heroes. The exceptional\r\npersonage, it seemed to him, should be suppressed, as should also\r\nhigh dramatic incident, since, produced by causes less general,\r\nthese have a range more restricted.

It helped to make more\r\nintense and more systematic that dainty yet dangerous pessimism\r\nwhich in him was innate. The mid- dle-class personage, in\r\nwearisome society like ours, is always a caricature, and the\r\nhappenings are nearly always vulgar.

No\r\nwriter has felt and expressed this complex temperament with more\r\njustice than De Maupassant, and, as he was an infinitely careful\r\nobserver of milieu and landscape and all that constitutes a\r\nprecise middle distance, his novels can be considered an\r\nirrefutable record of the social classes which he studied at a\r\ncertain time and along certain lines. The Norman peasant and the\r\nProvencal peasant, for example; also the small officeholder, the\r\ngentleman of the provinces, the country squire, the clubman of\r\nParis, the journalist of the boulevard, the doctor at the spa,\r\nthe commercial artist, and, on the feminine side, the servant\r\ngirl, the working girl, the demigrisette, the street girl, rich\r\nor poor, the gallant lady of the city and of the provinces, and\r\nthe society woman--these are some of the figures that he has\r\npainted at many sittings, and whom he used to such effect that\r\nthe novels and romances in which they are painted have come to be\r\nhistory. Just as it is impossible to comprehend the Rome of the\r\nCaesars without the work of Petronius, so is it impossible to\r\nfully comprehend the France of 1850-90 without these stories of\r\nMaupassant.

He did not invent it, and\r\nhis method is not alien to that of "Madame Bovary," but he knew\r\nhow to give it a suppleness, a variety, and a freedom which were\r\nalways wanting in Flaubert. The latter, in his best pages, is\r\nalways strained. To use the expressive metaphor of the Greek\r\nathletes, he "smells of the oil." When one recalls that when\r\nattacked by hysteric epilepsy, Flaubert postponed the crisis of\r\nthe terrible malady by means of sedatives, this strained\r\natmosphere of labor--I was going to say of stupor--which pervades\r\nhis work is explained.

Robust in imagination and fired with natural passion, his\r\npsychological curiosity kept him true to human nature, while at\r\nthe same time his mental eye, when fixed upon the most ordinary\r\nphases of human conduct, could see some new motive or aspect of\r\nthings hitherto unnoticed by the careless crowd."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"It has been said by casual critics that Maupassant lacked one\r\nquality indispensable to the production of truly artistic work,\r\nviz: an absolutely normal, that is, moral, point of view.

No dissector of the gamut of\r\nhuman pas- sion and folly in all its tones could present aught\r\nthat could be called new, if ungifted with a viewpoint totally\r\nout of the ordinary plane. Cold and merciless in the use of this\r\npoint de vue De Maupassant undoubtedly is, especially in such\r\nvivid depictions of love, both physical and maternal, as we find\r\nin \"L'histoire d'une fille de ferme\" and \"La femme de Paul.\" But\r\nthen the surgeon's scalpel never hesitates at giving pain, and\r\npain is often the road to health and ease.

The purport of the story is clear to those\r\nwho recognize the ideas that governed Maupassant\'s work, and even\r\nthe hasty reader or critic, on reading "Mont Oriol," which was\r\npublished two years later and is based on a combination of the\r\nmotifs which inspired "Une Vie" and "Bel-Ami," will reconsider\r\nformer hasty judgments, and feel, too, that beneath the triumph\r\nof evil which calls forth Maupassant\'s satiric anger there lies\r\nthe substratum on which all his work is founded, viz: the\r\npersistent, ceaseless questioning of a soul unable to reconcile\r\nor explain the contradiction between love in life and inevitable\r\ndeath. Who can read in "Bel-Ami" the terribly graphic description\r\nof the consumptive journalist\'s demise, his frantic clinging to\r\nlife, and his refusal to credit the slow and merciless approach\r\nof death, without feeling that the question asked at Naishapur\r\nmany centuries ago is still waiting for the solution that is\r\nalways promised but never comes?'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In the romances which followed, dating from 1888 to 1890, a sort\r\nof calm despair seems to have settled down upon De Maupassant's\r\nattitude toward life.

Fatality is the keynote, and yet, sounding low, we detect\r\na genuine subtone of sorrow. Was it a prescience of 1893?

This was partly a consequence of his honesty and\r\npartly of mental despair. He never accepted other people's views\r\non the questions of life. He looked into such problems for\r\nhimself, arriving at the truth, as it appeared to him, by the\r\nlogic of events, often finding evil where he wished to find good,\r\nbut never hoodwinking himself or his readers by adapting or\r\ndistorting the reality of things to suit a preconceived idea."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Maupassant was essentially a worshiper of the eternal feminine.\r\nHe was persuaded that without the continual presence of the\r\ngentler sex man's existence would be an emotionally silent\r\nwilderness.

Take for\r\ninstance the wonderfully subtle analysis of a woman's heart as\r\nwife and mother that we find in \"Une Vie.\" Could aught be more\r\ndelicately incisive? Sometimes in describing the apparently\r\ninexplicable conduct of a certain woman he leads his readers to a\r\npoint where a false step would destroy the spell and bring the\r\nreproach of banality and ridicule upon the tale.

I know of no more poignant\r\nexpression of such a feeling than the cry of despair which rings\r\nout in the short story called "Solitude," in which he describes\r\nthe insurmountable barrier which exists between man and man, or\r\nman and woman, however intimate the friendship between them. He\r\ncould picture but one way of destroying this terrible loneliness,\r\nthe attainment of a spiritual--a divine--state of love, a\r\ncondition to which he would give no name utterable by human lips,\r\nlest it be profaned, but for which his whole being yearned.
