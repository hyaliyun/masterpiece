Mathematics is concerned with the abstractions of time and\r\nspace. But these are still the object of sense, although the sensible is abstract and idealised.\r\nThought bids adieu even to this last and abstract sensible: it asserts its own native independence,\r\nrenounces the field of the external and internal sense, and puts away the interests and inclinations\r\nof the individual.

As the distinction is of capital importance for\r\nunderstanding the nature and kinds of knowledge, it will help to explain matters if\r\nwe here call attention to it. For the explanation of Sense, the readiest method\r\ncertainly is to refer to its external source - the organs of sense. But to name the\r\norgan does not help much to explain what is apprehended by it. The real\r\ndistinction between sense and thought lies in this - that the essential feature of the\r\nsensible is individuality, and as the individual (which, reduced to its simplest\r\nterms, is the atom) is also a member of a group, sensible existence presents a\r\nnumber of mutually exclusive units - of units, to speak in more definite and\r\nabstract formulae, which exist side by side with, and after, one another.\r\nConception or picture-thinking works with materials from the same sensuous\r\nsource. But these materials when conceived are expressly characterised as in me\r\nand therefore mine; and secondly, as universal, or simple, because only referred\r\nto self. Nor is sense the only source of materialised conception. There are\r\nconceptions constituted by materials emanating from self-conscious thought, such\r\nas those of law, morality, religion, and even of thought itself, and it requires some\r\neffort to detect wherein lies the difference between such conceptions and\r\nthoughts having the same import. For it is a thought of which such conception is\r\nthe vehicle, and there is no want of the form of universality, without which no\r\ncontent could be in me, or be a conception at all. Yet here also the peculiarity of\r\nconception is, generally speaking, to be sought in the individualism or isolation of\r\nits contents. True it is that, for example, law and legal provisions do not exist in a\r\nsensible space, mutually excluding one another. Nor as regards time, though they\r\nappear to some extent in succession, are their contents themselves conceived as\r\naffected by time, or as transient and changeable in it. The fault in conception lies\r\ndeeper. These ideas, though implicitly possessing the organic unity of mind, stand\r\nisolated here and there on the broad ground of conception, with its inward and\r\nabstract generality. Thus cut adrift, each is simple, unrelated: Right, Duty, God.\r\nConception in these circumstances either rests satisfied with declaring that Right is\r\nRight, God is God; or in a higher grade of culture it proceeds to enunciate the\r\nattributes: as, for instance, God is the Creator of the world, omniscient, almighty,\r\netc. In this way several isolated, simple predicates are strung together: but in spite\r\nof the link supplied by their subject, the predicates never get beyond mere\r\ncontiguity. In this point Conception coincides with Understanding: the only\r\ndistinction being that the latter introduces relations of universal and particular, of\r\ncause and effect, etc., and in this way supplies a necessary connection to the\r\nisolated ideas of conception; which last has left them side by side in its vague\r\nmental spaces, connected only by a bare 'and'."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The difference between conception and thought is of special individuality and\r\nmutual exclusion of the members. It is well to remember that these very attributes\r\nof sense are thoughts and general terms. It will be shown in the Logic that thought\r\n(and the universal) is not a mere opposite of sense: it lets nothing escape it, but,\r\noutflanking its other, is at once that other and itself. Now language is the work of\r\nthought: and hence all that is expressed in language must be universal. What I\r\nonly mean or suppose is mine: it belongs to me - this particular individual. But\r\nlanguage expresses nothing but universality; and so I cannot say what I merely\r\nmean. And the unutterable - feeling or sensation - far from being the highest truth,\r\nis the most unimportant and untrue. If I say 'the individual', 'this individual',\r\n'here', 'now', all these are universal terms. Everything and anything is an\r\nindividual, a 'this', and if it be sensible, is here and now. Similarly when I say 'I', I\r\nmean my single self to the exclusion of all others; but what I say, viz. 'I', is just\r\nevery 'I', which in like manner excludes all others from itself. In an awkward\r\nexpression which Kant used, he said that I accompany all my conceptions -\r\nsensations, too, desires, actions, etc. 'I' is in essence and act the universal: and\r\nsuch partnership is a form, though an external form, of universality. All other men\r\nhave it in common with me to be 'I'; just as it is common to all my sensations and\r\nconceptions to be mine.

It might in that case seem arbitrary to devote a special science\r\nto thought, while will, imagination, and the rest were denied the same privilege. The selection of\r\none faculty however might even in this view be very well grounded on a certain authority\r\nacknowledged to belong to thought, and on its claim to be regarded as the true nature of man, in\r\nwhich consists his distinction from the brutes. Nor is it unimportant to study thought even as a\r\nsubjective energy. A detailed analysis of its nature would exhibit rules and laws, a knowledge of\r\nwhich is derived from experience. A treatment of the laws of thought, from this point of view, used\r\nonce to form the body of logical science. Of that science Aristotle was the founder. He succeeded\r\nin assigning to thought what properly belongs to it. Our thought is extremely concrete; but in its\r\ncomposite contents we must distinguish the part that properly belongs to thought, or to the\r\nabstract mode of its action. A subtle spiritual bond, consisting in the agency of thought, is what\r\ngives unity to all these contents, and it was this bond, the form as form, that Aristotle noted and\r\ndescribed. Up to the present day, the logic of Aristotle continues to be the received system. It has\r\nindeed been spun out to greater length, especially by the labours of the medieval Schoolmen who,\r\nwithout making any material additions, merely refined in details. The moderns also have left their\r\nmark upon this logic, partly by omitting many points of logical doctrine due to Aristotle and the\r\nSchoolmen, and partly by foisting in a quantity of psychological matter. The purport of the science\r\nis to become acquainted with the procedure of finite thought: and, if it is adapted to its\r\npresupposed object, the science is entitled to be styled correct. The study of this formal logic\r\nundoubtedly has its uses. It sharpens the wits, as the phrase goes, and teaches us to collect our\r\nthoughts and to abstract - whereas in common consciousness we have to deal with sensuous\r\nconceptions which cross and perplex one another. Abstraction moreover implies the concentration\r\nof the mind on a single point, and thus induces the habit of attending to our inward selves. An\r\nacquaintance with the forms of finite thought may be made a means of training the mind for the\r\nempirical sciences, since their method is regulated by these forms: and in this sense logic has been\r\ndesignated Instrumental. It is true, we may be still more liberal, and say: Logic is to be studied not\r\nfor its utility, but for its own sake; the superexcellent is not to be sought for the sake of mere utility.\r\nIn one sense this is quite correct; but it may be replied that the superexcellent is also the most\r\nuseful, because it is the all-sustaining principle which, having a subsistence of its own, may\r\ntherefore serve as the vehicle of special ends which it furthers and secures. And thus, special ends,\r\nthough they have no right to be set first, are still fostered by the presence of the highest good.\r\nReligion, for instance, has an absolute value of its own; yet at the same time other ends flourish and\r\nsucceed in its train.

In all human perception thought is present; so too thought is the universal in all the acts of\r\nconception and recollection; in short, in every mental activity, in willing, wishing, and the like. All\r\nthese faculties are only further specialisations of thought. When it is presented in this light, thought\r\nhas a different part to play from what it has if we speak of a faculty of thought, one among a\r\ncrowd of other faculties, such as perception, conception, and will, with which it stands on the\r\nsame level. When it is seen to be the true universal of all that nature and mind contain, it extends its\r\nscope far beyond all these, and becomes the basis of everything. From this view of thought, in its\r\nobjective meaning as nous, we may next pass to consider the subjective sense of the term. We\r\nsay first, Man is a being that thinks; but we also say at the same time, Man is a being that\r\nperceives and wills. Man is a thinker, and is universal; but he is a thinker only because he feels his\r\nown universality. The animal too is by implication universal, but the universal is not consciously felt\r\nby it to be universal: it feels only the individual. The animal sees a singular object, for instance, its\r\nfood, or a man. For the animal all this never goes beyond an individual thing. Similarly, sensation\r\nhas to do with nothing but singulars, such as this pain or this sweet taste. Nature does not bring its\r\nnous into consciousness: it is man who first makes himself double so as to be a universal for a\r\nuniversal. This first happens when man knows that he is 'I'. By the term 'I' I mean myself, a single\r\nand altogether determinate person. And yet I really utter nothing peculiar to myself, for every one\r\nelse is an 'I' or 'Ego', and when I call myself 'I', though I indubitably mean the single person myself,\r\nI express a thorough universal. 'I', therefore, is mere being-for-self, in which everything peculiar or\r\nmarked is renounced and buried out of sight; it is as it were the ultimate and unanalysable point of\r\nconsciousness. We may say 'I' and thought are the same, or, more definitely, 'I' is thought as a\r\nthinker. What I have in my consciousness is for me. 'I' is the vacuum or receptacle for anything\r\nand everything: for which everything is and which stores up everything in itself. Every man is a\r\nwhole world of conceptions, that lie buried in the night of the 'Ego'. It follows that the 'Ego' is the\r\nuniversal in which we leave aside all that is particular, and in which at the same time all the\r\nparticulars have a latent existence. In other words, it is not a mere universality and nothing more,\r\nbut the universality which includes in it everything. Commonly we use the word 'I' without attaching\r\nmuch importance to it, nor is it an object of study except to philosophical analysis. In the 'Ego', we\r\nhave thought before us in its utter purity. While the brute cannot say 'I', man can, because it is his\r\nnature to think. Now in the 'Ego' there are a variety of contents, derived both from within and from\r\nwithout, and according to the nature of these contents our state may be described as perception,\r\nor conception, or reminiscence. But in all of them the 'I' is found: or in them all thought is present.\r\nMan, therefore, is always thinking, even in his perceptions: if he observes anything, he always\r\nobserves it as a universal, fixes on a single point which he places in relief, thus withdrawing his\r\nattention from other points, and takes it as abstract and universal, even if the universality be only in\r\nform."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In the case of our ordinary conceptions, two things may happen. Either the contents are moulded\r\nby thought, but not the form; or, the form belongs to thought and not the contents.

I have\r\nleft out much that is particular and given the contents in their generality: but still the contents remain\r\nsense-derived. On the other hand, when I represent God, the content is undeniably a product of\r\npure thought, but the form still retains the sensuous limitations which it has as I find it immediately\r\npresent in myself. In these generalised images the content is not merely and simply sensible, as it is\r\nin a visual inspection; but either the content is sensuous and the form appertains to thought, or vice\r\nversa.

In the impulses or appetites the beginning is from something else, from something\r\nwhich we feel to be external. In this case then we speak of dependence.

The natural\r\nman, whose motions follow the rule only of his appetites, is not his own master. Be he as\r\nself-willed as he may, the constituents of his will and opinion are not his own, and his freedom is\r\nmerely formal.

Their problem in that case is only to recognise the logical forms under\r\nthe shapes they assume in Nature and Mind - shapes which are only a particular mode of\r\nexpression for the forms of pure thought. If for instance we take the syllogism (not as it was\r\nunderstood in the old formal logic, but as its real value), we shall find it gives expression to the law\r\nthat the particular is the middle term which fuses together the extremes of the universal and the\r\nsingular. The syllogistic form is a universal form of all things. Everything that exists is a particular,\r\nwhich couples together the universal and the singular. But Nature is weak and fails to exhibit the\r\nlogical forms in their purity. Such a feeble exemplification of the syllogism may be seen in the\r\nmagnet. In the middle or point of indifference of a magnet, its two poles, however they may be\r\ndistinguished, are brought into one.

In the first place it never\r\nwent beyond the province of the analytic understanding. Without preliminary inquiry it adopted the\r\nabstract categories of thought and let them rank as predicates of truth. But in using the term\r\nthought we must not forget the difference between finite or discursive thinking and the thinking\r\nwhich is infinite and rational. The categories, as they meet us prima facie and in isolation, are finite\r\nforms. But truth is always infinite, and cannot be expressed or presented to consciousness in finite\r\nterms. The phrase infinite thought may excite surprise, if we adhere to the modern conception\r\nthat thought is always limited. But it is, speaking rightly, the very essence of thought to be infinite.\r\nThe nominal explanation of calling a thing finite is that it has an end, that it exists up to a certain\r\npoint only, where it comes into contact with, and is limited by, its other. The finite therefore\r\nsubsists in reference to its other, which is its negation and presents itself as its limit. Now thought is\r\nalways in its own sphere its relations are with itself, and it is its own object. In having a thought for\r\nobject, I am at home with myself. The thinking power, the 'I', is therefore infinite, because, when it\r\nthinks, it is in relation to an object which is itself. Generally speaking, an object means a something\r\nelse, a negative confronting me. But in the case where thought thinks itself, it has an object which is\r\nat the same time no object: in other words, its objectivity is suppressed and transformed into an\r\nidea. Thought, as thought, therefore in its unmixed nature involves no limits; it is finite only when it\r\nkeeps to limited categories, which it believes to be ultimate. Infinite or speculative thought, on the\r\ncontrary, while it no less defines, does in the very act of limiting and defining make that defect\r\nvanish. And so infinity is not, as most frequently happens, to be conceived as an abstract away\r\nand away for ever and ever, but in the simple manner previously indicated."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The thinking of the old metaphysical system was finite. Its whole mode of action was regulated by\r\ncategories, the limits of which it believed to be permanently fixed and not subject to any further\r\nnegation. Thus, one of its questions was: Has God existence? The question supposes that\r\nexistence is an altogether positive term, a sort of ne plus ultra. We shall see however at a later\r\npoint that existence is by no means a merely positive term, but one which is too low for the\r\nAbsolute Idea, and unworthy of God. A second question in these metaphysical systems was: Is\r\nthe world finite or infinite ? The very terms of the question assume that the finite is a permanent\r\ncontradictory to the infinite: and one can easily see that, when they are so opposed, the infinite,\r\nwhich of course ought to be the whole, only appears as a single aspect and suffers restriction from\r\nthe finite. But a restricted infinity is itself only a finite. In the same way it was asked whether the\r\nsoul was simple or composite. Simpleness was, in other words, taken to be an ultimate\r\ncharacteristic, giving expression to a whole truth. Far from being so, simpleness is the expression\r\nof a half-truth, as one-sided and abstract as existence - a term of thought, which, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, is itself untrue and hence unable to hold truth.

Now these predicates are after all only\r\nlimited formulae of the understanding which, instead of expressing the truth, merely impose a limit.\r\nMore than this, it should be noted that the chief feature of the method lay in 'assigning' or\r\n'attributing' predicates to the object that was to be cognised, for example, to God. But attribution\r\nis no more than an external reflection about the object: the predicates by which the object is to be\r\ndetermined are supplied from the resources of picture-thought, and are applied in a mechanical\r\nway. Whereas, if we are to have genuine cognition, the object must characterise its own self and\r\nnot derive its predicates from without. Even supposing we follow the method of predicating, the\r\nmind cannot help feeling that predicates of this sort fail to exhaust the object. From the same point\r\nof view the Orientals are quite correct in calling God the many-named or the myriad-named One.\r\nOne after another of these finite categories leaves the soul unsatisfied, and the Oriental sage is\r\ncompelled unceasingly to seek for more and more of such predicates. In finite things it is no doubt\r\nthe case that they have to be characterised through finite predicates: and with these things the\r\nunderstanding finds proper scope for its special action. Itself finite, it knows only the nature of the\r\nfinite. Thus, when I call some action a theft, I have characterised the action in its essential facts;\r\nand such a knowledge is sufficient for the judge. Similarly, finite things stand to each other as cause\r\nand effect, force and exercise, and when they are apprehended in these categories, they are\r\nknown in their finitude.

God was accordingly defined to be the most real of all\r\nbeings. Anyone can see however that this most real of beings, in which negation forms no part, is\r\nthe very opposite of what it ought to be and of what understanding supposes it to be. Instead of\r\nbeing rich and full above all measure, it is so narrowly conceived that it is, on the contrary,\r\nextremely poor and altogether empty. It is with reason that the heart craves a concrete body of\r\ntruth; but without definite feature, that is, without negation, contained in the notion, there can only\r\nbe an abstraction. When the notion of God is apprehended only as that of the abstract or most\r\nreal being, God is, as it were, relegated to another world beyond: and to speak of a knowledge of\r\nhim would be meaningless.

Hence, if this mode of demonstration is applied to the existence of God, it\r\ncan only mean that the being of God is to depend on other terms, which will then constitute the\r\nground of his being. It is at once evident that this will lead to some mistake: for God must be\r\nsimply and solely the ground of everything, and in so far not dependent upon anything else. And a\r\nperception of this danger has in modern times led some to say that God's existence is not capable\r\nof proof, but must be immediately or intuitively apprehended. Reason, however, and even sound\r\ncommon sense give demonstration a meaning quite different from that of the understanding. The\r\ndemonstration of reason no doubt starts from something which is not God. But, as it advances, it\r\ndoes not leave the starting-point a mere unexplained fact, which is what it was. On the contrary it\r\nexhibits that point as derivative and called into being, and then God is seen to be primary, truly\r\nimmediate, and self-subsisting, with the means of derivation wrapped up and absorbed in himself.\r\nThose who say: 'Consider Nature, and Nature will lead you to God; you will find an absolute final\r\ncause' do not mean that God is something derivative: they mean that it is we who proceed to God\r\nhimself from another; and in this way God, though the consequence, is also the absolute ground of\r\nthe initial step.

To that extent therefore they were subjective. And yet in spite of this,\r\nKant gives the name objective to what is thought, to the universal and necessary,\r\nwhile he describes as subjective whatever is merely felt. This arrangement\r\napparently reverses the first-mentioned use of the word, and has caused Kant to\r\nbe charged with confusing language.

The vulgar believe that the objects of perception\r\nwhich confront them, such as an individual animal, or a single star, are\r\nindependent and permanent existences, compared with which thoughts are\r\nunsubstantial and dependent on something else. In fact however the perceptions\r\nof sense are the properly dependent and secondary feature, while the thoughts are\r\nreally independent and primary. This being so, Kant gave the title objective to the\r\nintellectual factor, to the universal and necessary: and he was quite justified in so\r\ndoing. Our sensations on the other hand are subjective; for sensations lack\r\nstability in their own nature, and are no less fleeting and evanescent than thought\r\nis permanent and self-subsisting. At the present day, the special line of distinction\r\nestablished by Kant between the subjective and objective is adopted by the\r\nphraseology of the educated world. Thus the criticism of a work of art ought, it is\r\nsaid, to be not subjective, but objective - in other words, instead of springing\r\nfrom the particular and accidental feeling or temper of the moment, it should keep\r\nits eye on those general points of view which the laws of art establish.

He particularly protests against the charge of being a special pleader and of grounding\r\nhis reasoning on illusions. Speaking honestly, however, the arguments which Kant offers for his\r\nthesis and antithesis are mere shams of demonstration. The thing to be proved is invariably implied\r\nin the assumption he starts from, and the speciousness of his proofs is only due to his prolix and\r\napagogic mode of procedure. Yet it was, and still is, a great achievement for the Critical\r\nPhilosophy when it exhibited these antinomies: for in this way it gave some expression (at first\r\ncertainly subjective and unexplained) to the actual unity of those categories which are kept\r\npersistently separate by the understanding. The first of the cosmological antinomies, for example,\r\nimplies a recognition of the doctrine that space and time present a discrete as well as a continuous\r\naspect: whereas the old metaphysic, laying exclusive emphasis on the continuity, had been led to\r\ntreat the world as unlimited in space and time. It is quite correct to say that we can go beyond\r\nevery definite space and beyond every definite time: but it is no less correct that space and time\r\nare real and actual only when they are defined or specialised into 'here' and 'now' - a specialisation\r\nwhich is involved in the very notion of them. The same observations apply to the rest of the\r\nantinomies. Take, for example, the antinomy of freedom and necessity. The main gist of it is that\r\nfreedom and necessity as understood by abstract thinkers are not independently real, as these\r\nthinkers suppose, but merely ideal factors (moments) of the true freedom and the true necessity,\r\nand that to abstract and isolate either conception is to make it false."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                               \ufffd\ufffd 49\n"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[c] The third object of the Reason is God (\ufffd\ufffd 36): he also must be known and\r\ndefined in terms of thought.

And then, at\r\nthe very moment after unification has been alleged to be the truth, we suddenly\r\ncome upon the doctrine that the two elements, which, in their true status of\r\nunification, had been refused all independent subsistence, are only true and actual\r\nin their state of separation. Philosophising of this kind wants the little penetration\r\nneeded to discover, that this shuffling only evidences how unsatisfactory each one\r\nof the two terms is. Arid it fails simply because it is incapable of bringing two\r\nthoughts together. (And in point of form there are never more than two.) It argues\r\nan utter want of consistency to say, on the one hand, that the understanding only\r\nknows phenomena, and, on the other, assert the absolute character of this\r\nknowledge, by such statements as 'Cognition can go no further'; 'Here is the\r\nnatural and absolute limit of human knowledge.' But 'natural' is the wrong word\r\nhere. The things of nature are limited and are natural things only to such extent as\r\nthey are not aware of their universal limit, or to such extent as their mode or\r\nquality is a limit from our point of view, and not from their own. No one knows,\r\nor even feels, that anything is a limit or defect, until he is at the same time above\r\nand beyond it. Living beings, for example, possess the privilege of pain which is\r\ndenied to the inanimate: even with living beings, a single mode or quality passes\r\ninto the feeling of a negative. For living beings as such possess within them a\r\nuniversal vitality, which overpasses and includes the single mode; and thus, as\r\nthey maintain themselves in the negative of themselves, they feel the\r\ncontradiction to exist within them. But the contradiction is within them only in so\r\nfar as one and the same subject includes both the universality of their sense of\r\nlife, and the individual mode which is in negation with it. This illustration will\r\nshow how a limit or imperfection in knowledge comes to be termed a limit or\r\nimperfection, only when it is compared with the actually present Idea of the\r\nuniversal, of a total and perfect.

But when Empiricism becomes reflective and logically consistent, it\r\nturns its arms against this dualism in the ultimate and highest species of fact; it\r\ndenies the independence of the thinking principle and of a spiritual world which\r\ndevelops itself in thought. Materialism or Naturalism, therefore, is the consistent\r\nand thoroughgoing system of Empiricism. In direct opposition to such an\r\nEmpiricism, Kant asserts the principle of thought and freedom, and attaches\r\nhimself to the first mentioned form of empirical doctrine, the general principles of\r\nwhich he never departed from. There is a dualism in his philosophy also. On one\r\nside stands the world of sensation, and of the understanding which reflects upon\r\nit. This world, it is true, he alleges to be a world of appearances. But that is only a\r\ntitle or formal description; for the source, the facts, and the modes of observation\r\ncontinue quite the same as in Empiricism. On the other side and independent\r\nstands a self-apprehending thought, the principle of freedom, which Kant has in\r\ncommon with ordinary and bygone metaphysic, but emptied of all that it held,\r\nand without his being able to infuse into it anything new. For, in the Critical\r\ndoctrine, thought, or, as it is there called, Reason, is divested of every specific\r\nform, and thus bereft of all authority. The main effect of the Kantian philosophy\r\nhas been to revive the consciousness of Reason, or the absolute inwardness of\r\nthought. Its abstractness indeed prevented that inwardness from developing into\r\nanything, or from originating any special forms, whether cognitive principles or\r\nmoral laws; but nevertheless it absolutely refused to accept or indulge anything\r\npossessing the character of an externality.

In fact, however, it is not because\r\nthey are subjective that the categories are finite: they are finite by their very nature, and it is on their\r\nown selves that it is requisite to exhibit their finitude. Kant however holds that what we think is\r\nfalse, because it is we who think it. A further deficiency in the system is that it gives only a\r\nhistorical description of thought, and a mere enumeration of the factors of consciousness. The\r\nenumeration is in the main correct: but not a word touches upon the necessity of what is thus\r\nempirically colligated.

Into details of the manner and the extent of this\r\nself-determination of thought, Kant never went. It was Fichte who first noticed the omission; and\r\nwho, after he had called attention to the want of a deduction for the categories, endeavoured really\r\nto supply something of the kind. With Fichte, the 'Ego' is the starting-point in the philosophical\r\ndevelopment: and the outcome of its action is supposed to be visible in the categories. But in\r\nFichte the 'Ego' is not really presented as a free, spontaneous energy; it is supposed to receive its\r\nfirst excitation by a shock or impulse from without. Against this shock the 'Ego' will, it is assumed,\r\nreact, and only through this reaction does it first become conscious of itself. Meanwhile, the nature\r\nof the impulse remains a stranger beyond our pale: and the 'Ego', with something else always\r\nconfronting it, is weighted with a condition. Fichte, in consequence, never advanced beyond\r\nKant's conclusion, that the finite only is knowable, while the infinite transcends the range of\r\nthought. What Kant calls the thing-by-itself, Fichte calls the impulse from without - that abstraction\r\nof something else than 'I', not otherwise describable or definable than as the negative or non-Ego\r\nin general. The 'I' is thus looked at as standing in essential relation with the not-I, through which its\r\nact of self-determination is first awakened. And in this manner the 'I' is but the continuous act of\r\nself-liberation from this impulse, never gaining a real freedom, because with the surcease of the\r\nimpulse the 'I', whose being is its action, would also cease to be.

Measure, like the other\r\nstages of Being, may serve as a definition of the Absolute; God, it has been said, is the Measure of\r\nall things. It is this idea which forms the ground-note of many of the ancient Hebrew hymns, in\r\nwhich the glorification of God tends in the main to show that he has appointed to everything its\r\nbound: to the sea and the solid land, to the rivers and mountains; and also to the various kinds of\r\nplants and animals.

On the one hand, the quantitative features of existence may be\r\naltered, without affecting its quality. On the other hand, this increase and diminution, immaterial\r\nthough it be, has its limit, by exceeding which the quality suffers change. Thus the temperature of\r\nwater is, in the first place, a point of no consequence in respect of its liquidity: still with the increase\r\nof diminution of the temperature of the liquid water, there comes a point where this state of\r\ncohesion suffers a qualitative change, and the water is converted into steam or ice. A quantitative\r\nchange takes place, apparently without any further significance: but there is something lurking\r\nbehind, and a seemingly innocent change of quantity acts as a kind of snare, to catch hold of the\r\nquality. The antinomy of Measure which this implies was exemplified under more than one garb\r\namong the Greeks. It was asked, for example, whether a single grain makes a heap of wheat, or\r\nwhether it makes a bald-tail to tear out a single hair from the horse's tail. At first, no doubt, looking\r\nat the nature of quantity as an indifferent and external character of being, we are disposed to\r\nanswer these questions in the negative. And yet, as we must admit, this indifferent increase and\r\ndiminution has its limit: a point is finally reached, where a single additional grain makes a heap of\r\nwheat; and the bald-tail is produced, if we continue plucking out single hairs.

It would be a\r\nmistake to treat these examples as pedantic futility; they really turn on thoughts, an acquaintance\r\nwith which is of great importance in practical life, especially in ethics. Thus in the matter of\r\nexpenditure, there is a certain latitude within which a more or less does not matter; but when the\r\nMeasure, imposed by the individual circumstances of the special case, is exceeded on the one side\r\nor the other, the qualitative nature of Measure (as in the above examples of the different\r\ntemperature of water) makes itself felt, and a course, which a moment before was held good\r\neconomy, turns into avarice or prodigality. The same principles may be applied in politics, when\r\nthe constitution of a state has to be looked at as independent of, no less than as dependent on, the\r\nextent of its territory, the number of its inhabitants, and other quantitative points of the same kind.\r\nIf we look, e.g. at a state with a territory of ten thousand square miles and a population of four\r\nmillions we should, without hesitation, admit that a few square miles of land or a few thousand\r\ninhabitants more or less could exercise no essential influence on the character of its constitution.\r\nBut on the other hand, we must not forget that by the continual increase or diminishing of a state,\r\nwe finally get to a point where, apart from all other circumstances, this quantitative alteration alone\r\nnecessarily draws with it an alteration in the quality of the constitution.

The affliction of the reader can\r\nscarcely be blamed when he is expected to consider himself hemmed in by an impervious circle of\r\npurely subjective conceptions. Apart from this subjective view of Appearance, however, we have\r\nall reason to rejoice that the things which environ us are appearances and not steadfast and\r\nindependent existences; since in that case we should soon perish of hunger, both bodily and\r\nmental."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                (a) The World of Appearances \ufffd\ufffd132\n"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Apparent or Phenomenal exists in such a way that its subsistence is ipso\r\nfacto thrown into abeyance or suspended and is only one stage in the form itself.\r\nThe form embraces in it the matter or subsistence as one of its characteristics.

The\r\nfirst and simplest evidence for the finitude of the mediated relation of force and its exercise is, that\r\neach and every force is conditioned and requires something else than itself for its subsistence.

The same thing is seen in all other forces, which from one end to the other are\r\nfound to be conditioned and mediated by something else than themselves. Another proof of the\r\nfinite nature of force is that it requires solicitation before it can put itself forth. That through which\r\nthe force is solicited, is itself another exertion of force, which cannot put itself forth without similar\r\nsolicitation. This brings us either to a repetition of the infinite progression, or to a reciprocity of\r\nsoliciting and being solicited. In either case we have no absolute beginning of motion.

The several manifestations of a force at first meet us in indefinite\r\nmultiplicity, and in their isolation seem accidental: but, reducing this multiplicity to its inner unity,\r\nwhich we term force, we see that the apparently contingent is necessary, by recognising the law\r\nthat rules it. But the different forces themselves are a multiplicity again, and in their mere\r\njuxtaposition seem to be contingent. Hence in empirical physics, we speak of the forces of gravity,\r\nmagnetism, electricity, etc., and in psychology of the forces of memory, imagination, will, and all\r\nthe other faculties. All this multiplicity again excites a craving to know these different forces as a\r\nsingle whole, nor would this craving be appeased even if the several forces were traced back to\r\none common primary force.

The argument of the Church was as follows. If it be the\r\nforces of gravitation, of vegetation, etc., which occasion the movements of the heavenly bodies,\r\nthe growth of plants, etc., there is nothing left for divine providence, and God sinks to the level of\r\na leisurely onlooker, surveying this play of forces. The students of nature, it is true, and Newton\r\nmore than others, when they employed the reflective category of force to explain natural\r\nphenomena, have expressly pleaded that the honour of God, as the Creator and Governor of the\r\nworld, would not thereby be impaired. Still the logical issue of this explanation by means of forces\r\nis that the inferential understanding proceeds to fix each of these forces, and to maintain them in\r\ntheir finitude as ultimate. And contrasted with this de-infinitised world of independent forces and\r\nmatters, the only terms in which it is possible still to describe God will present him in the abstract\r\ninfinity of an unknowable supreme Being in some other world far away. This Is precisely the\r\nposition of materialism, and of modern 'freethinking', whose theology ignores what God is and\r\nrestricts itself to the mere fact that he is.

Yet on the other side it is impossible to overlook the formal right which, in the first\r\nplace, entitles the empirical sciences to vindicate the right of thought to know the existent world in\r\nall the speciality of its content, and to seek something further than the bare statement of mere\r\nabstract faith that God created and governs the world. When our religious consciousness, resting\r\non the authority of the Church, teaches us that God created the world by his almighty will, that he\r\nguides the stars in their courses, and vouchsafes to all his creatures their existence and their\r\nwell-being, the question Why? is still left to answer. Now it is the answer to this ,question which\r\nforms the common task of empirical science and of philosophy.

It is the lesson of religion that nature, no less than the spiritual world, is a\r\nrevelation of God: but with this distinction, that while nature never gets so far as to be conscious of\r\nits divine essence, that consciousness is the express problem of the mind, which in the matter of\r\nthat problem is as yet finite. Those who look upon the essence of nature as mere inwardness, and\r\ntherefore inaccessible to us, take up the same line as that ancient creed which regarded God as\r\nenvious and jealous; a creed which both Plato and Aristotle pronounced against long ago.

Here there is no contrast to be seen, and therefore no sense\r\nof bondage, no pain, and no sorrow. True, indeed, as already remarked, this attitude towards\r\ndestiny is void of consolation.
