I was not acquainted with a single  street of Paris, and I was ignorant of the position of the large  burial grounds (though of course I had occasionally heard their  names), and yet every effort of my mind was directed toward  ascertaining whether we were turning to the right or to the left.

Then I heard a  psalm chanted and some Latin words mumbled by a priest, and  afterward I suddenly felt myself sinking, while the ropes rubbing  against the edges of the coffin elicited lugubrious sounds, as if a  bow were being drawn across the strings of a cracked violoncello.   It was the end.  On the left side of my head I felt a violent shock  like that produced by the bursting of a bomb, with another under my  feet and a third more violent still on my chest.

As we passed  through a tunnel a deafening roll thundered over our head, and a  sudden subsidence blocked up both issues of the tunnel, leaving our  train intact in the center.  We were walled up by blocks of rock in  the heart of a mountain.  Then a long and fearful agony commenced.   No assistance could possibly reach us; even with powerful engines  and incessant labor it would take a month to clear the tunnel.  We  were prisoners there with no outlet, and so our death was only a  question of time."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"My fancy had often dwelt on that hideous drama and had constantly  varied the details and touches.

Sometimes an aged man was driven back  with blows and slowly perished; a mother struggled like a she-wolf  to keep three or four mouthfuls for her child.  In my own  compartment a bride and bridegroom were dying, clasped in each  other's arms in mute despair."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The line was free along the whole length of the train, and people  came and went, prowling round the carriages like beasts of prey in  search of carrion.  All classes were mingled together.  A  millionaire, a high functionary, it was said, wept on a workman's  shoulder.  The lamps had been extinguished from the first, and the  engine fire was nearly out.  To pass from one carriage to another it  was necessary to grope about, and thus, too, one slowly reached the  engine, recognizable by its enormous barrel, its cold, motionless  flanks, its useless strength, its grim silence, in the overwhelming  night.  Nothing could be more appalling than this train entombed  alive with its passengers perishing one by one."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I gloated over the ghastliness of each detail; howls resounded  through the vault; somebody whom one could not see, whose vicinity  was not even suspected, would suddenly drop upon another's shoulder.

I have never felt so chilled; a mantle of snow seemed to enwrap me;  heavy moisture rained upon my skull; I was gasping; the rocky vault  seemed to crush my chest; the whole mountain was seemingly weighing  upon me."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Suddenly a cry of deliverance sounded.  For some time past we  fancied that we could hear a dull sound, and we tried to hope that  men were at work and that help was coming, but it came not thus.   One of the passengers, however, had discovered an air shaft in the  tunnel, and, crowding round, we all saw this shaft, above which we  could discern a blue patch about the size of a wafer.  That blue  patch filled us with rapture, for it was the sky.  We stretched  ourselves and stood on tiptoes to breathe more freely.  Then we  distinguished some black specks moving about, specks that must  surely be workmen about to deliver us.  A furious clamor arose.  The  cry "Saved! Saved!" burst from every mouth, while trembling arms  were uplifted toward the tiny azure patch above.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"That roar of voices aroused me.  Where was I?  In the tunnel, of  course.  I was lying at full length; hard walls were pressing  against my ribs.  Then I attempted to rise and struck my head  roughly.  Was it the rock closing in on all sides?  The blue speck  had vanished--aye, the sky had disappeared and I was still  suffocating, shivering, with chattering teeth."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"All at once I remembered.  Intense horror raised my hair on end.  I  felt the hideous truth freeze me from head to foot like ice.  I had  shaken off the long coma which for many hours had stricken me with  corpselike rigidity.  Yes, I could move; my hands could feel the  boards of my coffin; my lips parted; words came to me, and  instinctively I called out Marguerite's name.  It was a scream I  raised.  In that deal box my voice took so hoarse and weird a sound  that it terrified me.  Oh, my God, was this thing true?  I was able  to walk, speak, cry out that I was living, and yet my voice could  not be heard; I was entombed under the earth."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I made a desperate effort to remain calm and reflect.  Was there no  means of getting out?  Then my dream began afresh in my troubled  brain.  The fanciful air shaft with the blue bit of sky overhead was  mingled with the real grave in which I was lying.  I stared at the  darkness with widely opened eyes; perhaps I might discover a hole, a  slit, a glimmer of light, but only sparks of fire flitted through  that night, with rays that broadened and then faded away.  I was in  a somber abyss again.  With returning lucidity I struggled against  these fatal visions.  Indeed, I should need all my reason if I meant  to try to save myself."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The most immediate peril lay in an increasing sense of suffocation.   If I had been able to live so long without air it was owing to  suspended animation, which had changed all the normal conditions of  my existence, but now that my heart beat and my lungs breathed I  should die, asphyxiated, if I did not promptly liberate myself.  I  also suffered from cold and dreaded lest I should succumb to the  mortal numbness of those who fall asleep in the snow, never to wake  again.  Still, while unceasingly realizing the necessity of  remaining calm, I felt maddening blasts sweep through my brain, and  to quiet my senses I exhorted myself to patience, trying to remember  the circumstances of my burial.  Probably the ground had been bought  for five years, and this would be against my chances of self- deliverance, for I remembered having noticed at Nantes that in the  trenches of the common graves one end of the last lowered coffins  protruded into the next open cavity, in which case I should only  have had to break through one plank.  But if I were in a separate  hole, filled up above me with earth, the obstacles would prove too  great.  Had I not been told that the dead were buried six feet deep  in Paris?  How was I to get through the enormous mass of soil above  me?  Even if I succeeded in slitting the lid of my bier open the  mold would drift in like fine sand and fill my mouth and eyes.  That  would be death again, a ghastly death, like drowning in mud."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"However, I began to feel the planks carefully.  The coffin was  roomy, and I found that I was able to move my arms with tolerable  ease.  On both sides the roughly planed boards were stout and  resistive.  I slipped my arm onto my chest to raise it over my head.   There I discovered in the top plank a knot in the wood which yielded  slightly at my pressure.  Working laboriously, I finally succeeded  in driving out this knot, and on passing my finger through the hole  I found that the earth was wet and clayey.  But that availed me  little.  I even regretted having removed the knot, vaguely dreading  the irruption of the mold.  A second experiment occupied me for a  while.  I tapped all over the coffin to ascertain if perhaps there  were any vacuum outside.  But the sound was everywhere the same.  At  last, as I was slightly kicking the foot of the coffin, I fancied  that it gave out a clearer echoing noise, but that might merely be  produced by the sonority of the wood."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"At any rate, I began to press against the boards with my arms and my  closed fists.  In the same way, too, I used my knees, my back and my  feet without eliciting even a creak from the wood.  I strained with  all my strength, indeed, with so desperate an effort of my whole  frame, that my bruised bones seemed breaking.  But nothing moved,  and I became insane."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Until that moment I had held delirium at bay.  I had mastered the  intoxicating rage which was mounting to my head like the fumes of  alcohol; I had silenced my screams, for I feared that if I again  cried out aloud I should be undone.  But now I yelled; I shouted;  unearthly howls which I could not repress came from my relaxed  throat.  I called for help in a voice that I did not recognize,  growing wilder with each fresh appeal and crying out that I would  not die.  I also tore at the wood with my nails; I writhed with the  contortions of a caged wolf.  I do not know how long this fit of  madness lasted, but I can still feel the relentless hardness of the  box that imprisoned me; I can still hear the storm of shrieks and  sobs with which I filled it; a remaining glimmer of reason made me  try to stop, but I could not do so."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Great exhaustion followed.  I lay waiting for death in a state of  somnolent pain.  The coffin was like stone, which no effort could  break, and the conviction that I was powerless left me unnerved,  without courage to make any fresh attempts.  Another suffering-- hunger--was presently added to cold and want of air.  The torture  soon became intolerable.  With my finger I tried to pull small  pinches of earth through the hole of the dislodged knot, and I  swallowed them eagerly, only increasing my torment.  Tempted by my  flesh, I bit my arms and sucked my skin with a fiendish desire to  drive my teeth in, but I was afraid of drawing blood."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Then I ardently longed for death.  All my life long I had trembled  at the thought of dissolution, but I had come to yearn for it, to  crave for an everlasting night that could never be dark enough.  How  childish it had been of me to dread the long, dreamless sleep, the  eternity of silence and gloom!  Death was kind, for in suppressing  life it put an end to suffering.  Oh, to sleep like the stones, to  be no more!"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"With groping hands I still continued feeling the wood, and suddenly  I pricked my left thumb.  That slight pain roused me from my growing  numbness.  I felt again and found a nail--a nail which the  undertaker's men had driven in crookedly and which had not caught in  the lower wood.  It was long and very sharp; the head was secured to  the lid, but it moved.  Henceforth I had but one idea--to possess  myself of that nail--and I slipped my right hand across my body and  began to shake it.  I made but little progress, however; it was a  difficult job, for my hands soon tired, and I had to use them  alternately.  The left one, too, was of little use on account of the  nail's awkward position."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"While I was obstinately persevering a plan dawned on my mind.  That  nail meant salvation, and I must have it.  But should I get it in  time?  Hunger was torturing me; my brain was swimming; my limbs were  losing their strength; my mind was becoming confused.  I had sucked  the drops that trickled from my punctured finger, and suddenly I bit  my arm and drank my own blood!  Thereupon, spurred on by pain,  revived by the tepid, acrid liquor that moistened my lips, I tore  desperately at the nail and at last I wrenched it off!"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I then believed in success.  My plan was a simple one; I pushed the  point of the nail into the lid, dragging it along as far as I could  in a straight line and working it so as to make a slit in the wood.   My fingers stiffened, but I doggedly persevered, and when I fancied  that I had sufficiently cut into the board I turned on my stomach  and, lifting myself on my knees and elbows thrust the whole strength  of my back against the lid.  But although it creaked it did not  yield; the notched line was not deep enough.  I had to resume my old  position--which I only managed to do with infinite trouble--and work  afresh.  At last after another supreme effort the lid was cleft from  end to end."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I was not saved as yet, but my heart beat with renewed hope.  I had  ceased pushing and remained motionless, lest a sudden fall of earth  should bury me.  I intended to use the lid as a screen and, thus  protected, to open a sort of shaft in the clayey soil.   Unfortunately I was assailed by unexpected difficulties.  Some heavy  clods of earth weighed upon the boards and made them unmanageable; I  foresaw that I should never reach the surface in that way, for the  mass of soil was already bending my spine and crushing my face."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Once more I stopped, affrighted; then suddenly, while I was  stretching my legs, trying to find something firm against which I  might rest my feet, I felt the end board of the coffin yielding.  I  at once gave a desperate kick with my heels in the faint hope that  there might be a freshly dug grave in that direction."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"It was so.  My feet abruptly forced their way into space.  An open  grave was there; I had only a slight partition of earth to displace,  and soon I rolled into the cavity.  I was saved!"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I remained for a time lying on my back in the open grave, with my  eyes raised to heaven.  It was dark; the stars were shining in a sky  of velvety blueness.  Now and then the rising breeze wafted a  springlike freshness, a perfume of foliage, upon me.  I was saved!   I could breathe; I felt warm, and I wept and I stammered, with my  arms prayerfully extended toward the starry sky.  O God, how sweet  seemed life!"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"CHAPTER V"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MY RESURRECTION"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"My first impulse was to find the custodian of the cemetery and ask  him to have me conducted home, but various thoughts that came to me  restrained me from following that course.  My return would create  general alarm; why should I hurry now that I was master of the  situation?  I felt my limbs; I had only an insignificant wound on my  left arm, where I had bitten myself, and a slight feverishness lent  me unhoped-for strength.  I should no doubt be able to walk unaided."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Still I lingered; all sorts of dim visions confused my mind.  I had  felt beside me in the open grave some sextons' tools which had been  left there, and I conceived a sudden desire to repair the damage I  had done, to close up the hole through which I had crept, so as to  conceal all traces of my resurrection.  I do not believe that I had  any positive motive in doing so.  I only deemed it useless to  proclaim my adventure aloud, feeling ashamed to find myself alive  when the whole world thought me dead.  In half an hour every trace  of my escape was obliterated, and then I climbed out of the hole."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The night was splendid, and deep silence reigned in the cemetery;  the black trees threw motionless shadows over the white tombs.  When  I endeavored to ascertain my bearings I noticed that one half of the  sky was ruddy, as if lit by a huge conflagration; Paris lay in that  direction, and I moved toward it, following a long avenue amid the  darkness of the branches."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"However, after I had gone some fifty yards I was compelled to stop,  feeling faint and weary.  I then sat down on a stone bench and for  the first time looked at myself.  I was fully attired with the  exception that I had no hat.  I blessed my beloved Marguerite for  the pious thought which had prompted her to dress me in my best  clothes--those which I had worn at our wedding.  That remembrance of  my wife brought me to my feet again.  I longed to see her without  delay."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"At the farther end of the avenue I had taken a wall arrested my  progress.  However, I climbed to the top of a monument, reached the  summit of the wall and then dropped over the other side.  Although  roughly shaken by the fall, I managed to walk for a few minutes  along a broad deserted street skirting the cemetery.  I had no  notion as to where I might be, but with the reiteration of monomania  I kept saying to myself that I was going toward Paris and that I  should find the Rue Dauphine somehow or other.  Several people  passed me but, seized with sudden distrust, I would not stop them  and ask my way.  I have since realized that I was then in a burning  fever and already nearly delirious.  Finally, just as I reached a  large thoroughfare, I became giddy and fell heavily upon the  pavement."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Here there is a blank in my life.  For three whole weeks I remained  unconscious.  When I awoke at last I found myself in a strange room.   A man who was nursing me told me quietly that he had picked me up  one morning on the Boulevard Montparnasse and had brought me to his  house.  He was an old doctor who had given up practicing."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"When I attempted to thank him he sharply answered that my case had  seemed a curious one and that he had wished to study it.  Moreover,  during the first days of my convalescence he would not allow me to  ask a single question, and later on he never put one to me.  For  eight days longer I remained in bed, feeling very weak and not even  trying to remember, for memory was a weariness and a pain.  I felt  half ashamed and half afraid.  As soon as I could leave the house I  would go and find out whatever I wanted to know.  Possibly in the  delirium of fever a name had escaped me; however, the doctor never  alluded to anything I may have said.  His charity was not only  generous; it was discreet."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The summer had come at last, and one warm June morning I was  permitted to take a short walk.  The sun was shining with that  joyous brightness which imparts renewed youth to the streets of old  Paris.  I went along slowly, questioning the passers-by at every  crossing I came to and asking the way to Rue Dauphine.  When I  reached the street I had some difficulty in recognizing the  lodginghouse where we had alighted on our arrival in the capital.  A  childish terror made me hesitate.  If I appeared suddenly before  Marguerite the shock might kill her.  It might be wiser to begin by  revealing myself to our neighbor Mme Gabin; still I shrank from  taking a third party into confidence.  I seemed unable to arrive at  a resolution, and yet in my innermost heart I felt a great void,  like that left by some sacrifice long since consummated."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The building looked quite yellow in the sunshine.  I had just  recognized it by a shabby eating house on the ground floor, where we  had ordered our meals, having them sent up to us.  Then I raised my  eyes to the last window of the third floor on the left-hand side,  and as I looked at it a young woman with tumbled hair, wearing a  loose dressing gown, appeared and leaned her elbows on the sill.  A  young man followed and printed a kiss upon her neck.  It was not  Marguerite.  Still I felt no surprise.  It seemed to me that I had  dreamed all this with other things, too, which I was to learn  presently."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"For a moment I remained in the street, uncertain whether I had  better go upstairs and question the lovers, who were still laughing  in the sunshine.  However, I decided to enter the little restaurant  below.  When I started on my walk the old doctor had placed a five- franc piece in my hand.  No doubt I was changed beyond recognition,  for my beard had grown during the brain fever, and my face was  wrinkled and haggard.  As I took a seat at a small table I saw Mme  Gabin come in carrying a cup; she wished to buy a penny-worth of  coffee.  Standing in front of the counter, she began to gossip with  the landlady of the establishment."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Well," asked the latter, "so the poor little woman of the third  floor has made up her mind at last, eh?"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"How could she help herself?" answered Mme Gabin.  "It was the very  best thing for her to do.  Monsieur Simoneau showed her so much  kindness.  You see, he had finished his business in Paris to his  satisfaction, for he has inherited a pot of money.  Well, he offered  to take her away with him to his own part of the country and place  her with an aunt of his, who wants a housekeeper and companion.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The landlady laughed archly.  I buried my face in a newspaper which  I picked off the table.  My lips were white and my hands shook."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"It will end in a marriage, of course," resumed Mme Gabin.  "The  little widow mourned for her husband very properly, and the young  man was extremely well behaved.  Well, they left last night--and,  after all, they were free to please themselves."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Just then the side door of the restaurant, communicating with the  passage of the house, opened, and Dede appeared."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Mother, ain\'t you coming?" she cried.  "I\'m waiting, you know; do  be quick."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Presently," said the mother testily.  "Don\'t bother."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The girl stood listening to the two women with the precocious  shrewdness of a child born and reared amid the streets of Paris."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"When all is said and done," explained Mme Gabin, "the dear departed  did not come up to Monsieur Simoneau.  I didn\'t fancy him overmuch;  he was a puny sort of a man, a poor, fretful fellow, and he hadn\'t a  penny to bless himself with.  No, candidly, he wasn\'t the kind of  husband for a young and healthy wife, whereas Monsieur Simoneau is  rich, you know, and as strong as a Turk."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Oh yes!" interrupted Dede.  "I saw him once when he was washing-- his door was open.  His arms are so hairy!"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Get along with you," screamed the old woman, shoving the girl out  of the restaurant.  "You are always poking your nose where it has no  business to be."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Then she concluded with these words: "Look here, to my mind the  other one did quite right to take himself off.  It was fine luck for  the little woman!"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"When I found myself in the street again I walked along slowly with  trembling limbs.  And yet I was not suffering much; I think I smiled  once at my shadow in the sun.  It was quite true.  I WAS very puny.   It had been a queer notion of mine to marry Marguerite.  I recalled  her weariness at Guerande, her impatience, her dull, monotonous  life.  The dear creature had been very good to me, but I had never  been a real lover; she had mourned for me as a sister for her  brother, not otherwise.  Why should I again disturb her life?  A  dead man is not jealous."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"When I lifted my eyelids I saw the garden of the Luxembourg before  me.  I entered it and took a seat in the sun, dreaming with a sense  of infinite restfulness.  The thought of Marguerite stirred me  softly.  I pictured her in the provinces, beloved, petted and very  happy.  She had grown handsomer, and she was the mother of three  boys and two girls.  It was all right.  I had behaved like an honest  man in dying, and I would not commit the cruel folly of coming to  life again."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Since then I have traveled a good deal.  I have been a little  everywhere.  I am an ordinary man who has toiled and eaten like  anybody else.  Death no longer frightens me, but it does not seem to  care for me now that I have no motive in living, and I sometimes  fear that I have been forgotten upon earth."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"End"})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,o.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>i,x:()=>s});var a=t(96540);const o={},r=a.createContext(o);function i(e){const n=a.useContext(r);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:i(e.components),a.createElement(r.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
