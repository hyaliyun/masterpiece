So\r\nhis tutor had a sinecure.  Giglio would not learn classics or\r\nmathematics, and the Lord Chancellor of Paflagonia, SQUARETOSO,\r\npulled a very long face because the Prince could not be got to\r\nstudy the Paflagonian laws and constitution; but, on the other\r\nhand, the King's gamekeepers and huntsmen found the Prince an apt\r\npupil; the dancing-master pronounced that he was a most elegant\r\nand assiduous scholar; the First Lord of the Billiard Table gave\r\nthe most flattering reports of the Prince's skill; so did the\r\nGroom of the Tennis Court; and as for the Captain of the Guard\r\nand Fencing Master, the VALIANT and VETERAN Count KUTASOFF\r\nHEDZOFF, he avowed that since he ran the General of Crim Tartary,\r\nthe dreadful Grumbuskin, through the body, he never had\r\nencountered so expert a swordsman as Prince Giglio."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I hope you do not imagine that there was any impropriety in the\r\nPrince and Princess walking together in the palace garden, and\r\nbecause Giglio kissed Angelica's hand in a polite manner.

When they looked\r\nat the stars, what did Giglio know of the heavenly bodies?  Once,\r\nwhen on a sweet night in a balcony where they were standing,\r\nAngelica said, 'There is the Bear.'

'Oh, you silly creature!'\r\nsays she; 'you are very good, but you are not very wise.'

So you see, Angelica, though she\r\nliked Giglio pretty well, despised him on account of his\r\nignorance.
