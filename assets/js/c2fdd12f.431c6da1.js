As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her.  She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses.  She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse.  How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry.  Of course her kennel was in the nursery.  She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat.  She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on.  It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed.  On John's footer [in England soccer was called football, \"footer  for short] days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain.  There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait.  They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.  They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk.  She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"He had his position in the city to consider."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Nana also troubled him in another way.

Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join.  Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid\'s cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never see ten again.  The gaiety of those romps!  And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it.  There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds.  It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.  If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her.  It is quite like tidying up drawers.  You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.  When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind.  Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time.  There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.  It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal.  John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.  John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together.  John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth.

Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have [desired] a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances.  But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell.  It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious [particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing.  No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room] and bed-chamber combined.  The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit- blossom was in season.  Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin.  There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the residence herself.  Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do.  Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground.  The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it,  even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it  came aboil just the same.  You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim:  he could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it.  Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder.  Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed.

This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland.  But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind.  What did disturb her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.  These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.  The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another slate and passed round.  They were the most ordinary questions --  "What was the colour of Mother\'s eyes?  Which was taller, Father or Mother?  Was Mother blonde or brunette?  Answer all three questions if possible."  "(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother compared.  Only one of these to be attempted."

Wendy, you see, had been forgetting, too."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games.  It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly.  To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do.  He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health.  For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would have treated them severely."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not.  He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.  Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale.  But she was never quite sure, you know.  There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true.  To describe them all would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin- English Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island.  The difficulty is which one to choose.  Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch?  It was a sanguinary [cheerful] affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter\'s peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides.  At the Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out, "I\'m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?"  And Tootles answered, "Redskin; what are you, Nibs?" and Nibs said, "Redskin; what are you Twin?" and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter\'s methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was -- but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate.  Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks.  Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends, particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed.  That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one.  A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland.  Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back.  Or again, we might choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Which of these adventures shall we choose?

You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them:  on the contrary, it was among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them.  When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky.

She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles.  The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.  The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands.  Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared.  Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it.
