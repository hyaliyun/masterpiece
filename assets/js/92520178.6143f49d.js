The water in the fjord here is sick."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. Sick?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. Yes, sick. And I believe it makes one sick, too."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Wangel (smiling). You're giving our bathing resort a good name!"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. I should rather believe, Mrs. Wangel, that you have a peculiar relation to the sea, and to all that belongs to it."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. Perhaps; I almost think so myself.

You may be sure we don't decorate like this every day. Ugh! How suffocatingly hot it is under this roof. (Goes down into the garden.) Come over here. Here at least there is a little air.

Hm, dear Ellida, you must just entertain our friend alone for a little while."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. Are you busy?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Wangel. Yes, I must go down to the office. And then I must change. But I won't be long."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm (sitting down in arbour). Now, don't hurry, dear doctor.

It's quite ten years since you were there with us."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. Yes, about that. But when I think of you out there in the lighthouse!

Well, but how did it happen? How did it come about?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. Ah! dear Arnholm, you mustn't ask me about that. I couldn't explain it to you, and even if I could, you would never be able to understand, in the least."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. Hm! (In lower tone.) Have you ever confided anything about me to your husband? Of course, I meant about the useless step--I allowed myself to be moved to."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. No. You may be sure of that. I've not said a word to him about--about what you speak of."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. I am glad. I felt rather awkward at the thought that--"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. There was no need.

But tell me--why did you never write to me after I had gone away?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida.

Yes, yes, perhaps you were right."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. But why didn't you write?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm (looks at her and smiles, half reproachfully).

You'd better think of becoming a happy husband, I should say."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. I should have to be quick about it, then, Mrs. Wangel.

Yes."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. But it is impossible. You are mistaken about the time. I hardly think you knew Wangel then."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. It is not Wangel of whom I speak."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. Not Wangel?

No, no, I quite believe that; for it was all such bewildering madness--all of it."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. But tell me more of this."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. Oh! it's enough if you know I was bound then; and you know it now."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. And if you had not been bound?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. Well?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Arnholm. Would your answer to my letter have been different?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. How can I tell?

Yes, yes, it is! Oh, good heavens! Dear Arnholm, it is not what you think. It is something so absolutely incomprehensible, I don't know how I could tell it you.

Well?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Lyngstrand. And so Miss Hilde said, "Why, today is mother\'s birthday."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida.

Did you? So you wanted to go to sea?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand. No, not at all.

But just as he was sitting there quietly reading, I heard him utter a sort of yell. And when I looked at him, I saw his face was as white as chalk.

About the sea--"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. About storms and calm. Of dark nights at sea. And of the sea in the glittering sunshiny days we spoke also.

Tell me more about that."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Ellida. It was just daybreak when I had a note from him. He said in it I was to go out to him at the Bratthammer.

That would be wonderful."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand (after a pause).

About--no!"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand. I have."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Bolette. Really? Have you?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand. Oh yes!

Then, perhaps, you also believe that everything a man has read for himself, and thought out for himself, that this, too, can grow upon his wife?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand. Yes, I think it can. Little by little; as by a sort of miracle.

No, I never thought of that."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Bolette. But why not one as well as the other?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand.

Who?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Bolette. She whom he marries. What is she to live for?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand. She, too, is to live for his art.

Yes, Miss Wangel, you may be sure of that. It is not merely all the honour and respect she enjoys through him; for that seems almost the least important to me.

You do believe that?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand. Yes, I believe it thoroughly.

Of course, we will hope so."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand. You may be perfectly certain about it. Only think faithfully and kindly of me when I am down there in the south; and now I have your word that you will."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Bolette. You have (shaking her head). But, all the same, nothing will surely come of it."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lyngstrand. Oh! yes, Miss Bolette. At least this will come of it.

No doubt that is the result of her morbid state of mind."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Wangel. Not altogether. When you go down to the bedrock, it was born in her. Ellida belongs to the sea-folk.

Yes, more and more. But I ought to have told myself this beforehand. Oh! I knew it well enough at bottom! But I put it from me. For, you see, I loved her so!

Why, I am so much, much older than she is. I ought to have been at once as a father to her and a guide. I ought to have done my best to develop and enlighten her mind. Unfortunately nothing ever came of that. You see, I hadn't stamina enough, for I preferred her just as she was. So things went worse and worse with her, and then I didn't know what to do.

That--oh! that's something she must have persuaded and dreamed herself into since it happened. She was not seized with this so suddenly--all at once--as she now maintains.
