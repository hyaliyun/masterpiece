His father was a man of\r\nmeans and position, and he personally supervised the early education of his\r\nson. The young Goethe studied at the universities of Leipsig and Strasburg,\r\nand in 1772 entered upon the practise of law at Wetzlar. At the invitation of\r\nKarl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, he went in 1775 to live in Weimar,\r\nwhere he held a succession of political offices, becoming the Duke\'s chief\r\nadviser. From 1786 to 1788 he traveled in Italy, and from 1791 to 1817\r\ndirected the ducal theater at Weimar. He took part in the wars against\r\nFrance, 1792-3, and in the following year began his friendship with Schiller,\r\nwhich lasted till the latter\'s death in 1805. In 1806 he married Christiane\r\nVulpius. From about 1794 he devoted himself chiefly to literature, and after a\r\nlife of extraordinary productiveness died at Weimar, March 22, 1832. The\r\nmost important of Goethe\'s works produced before he went to Weimar were\r\nhis tragedy "Gotz von Berlichingen" (1773), which first brought him fame, and\r\n"The Sorrows of Young Werther," a novel which obtained enormous\r\npopularity during the so called "Sturm und Drang" period. During the years at\r\nWeimar before he knew Schiller he began "Wilhelm Meister," wrote the\r\ndramas, "Iphigenie," "Egmont," and "Torquato Tasso," and his "Reinecke\r\nFuchs." To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the continuation of\r\n"Wilhelm Meister," the beautiful idyl of "Hermann and Dorothea," and the\r\n"Roman Elegies." In the last period, between Schiller\'s death in 1805 and his\r\nown, appeared "Faust," "Elective Affinities," his autobiographical "Dichtung\r\nund Wahrheit" ("Poetry and Truth"), his "Italian Journey," much scientific\r\nwork, and a series of treatises on German Art.\r\nThough the foregoing enumeration contains but a selection from the titles of\r\nGoethe\'s best known writings, it suffices to show the extraordinary fertility and\r\nversatility of his genius. Rarely has a man of letters had so full and varied a life,\r\nor been capable of so many-sided a development. His political and scientific\r\nactivities, though dwarfed in the eyes of our generation by his artistic\r\nproduction, yet showed the adaptability of his talent in the most diverse\r\ndirections, and helped to give him that balance of temper and breadth of\r\nvision in which he has been surpassed by no genius of the ancient or modern\r\nworld.\r\nThe greatest and most representative expression of Goethe\'s powers is\r\nwithout doubt to be found in his drama of "Faust"; but before dealing with\r\nGoethe\'s masterpiece, it is worth while to say something of the history of the\r\nstory on which it is founded - the most famous instance of the old and\r\nwidespread legend of the man who sold his soul to the devil. The historical\r\nDr. Faust seems to have been a self-called philosopher who traveled about\r\nGermany in the first half of the sixteenth century, making money by the\r\npractise of magic, fortune-telling, and pretended cures. He died mysteriously\r\nabout 1540, and a legend soon sprang up that the devil, by whose aid he\r\nwrought his wonders, had finally carried him off. In 1587 a life of him\r\nappeared, in which are attributed to him many marvelous exploits and in\r\nwhich he is held up as an awful warning against the excessive desire for\r\nsecular learning and admiration for antique beauty which characterized the\r\nhumanist movement of the time. In this aspect the Faust legend is an\r\nexpression of early popular Protestantism, and of its antagonism to the\r\nscientific and classical tendencies of the Renaissance.\r\nWhile a succession of Faust books were appearing in Germany, the original\r\nlife was translated into English and dramatized by Marlowe. English players\r\nbrought Marlowe\'s work back to Germany, where it was copied by German\r\nactors, degenerated into spectacular farce, and finally into a puppet show.\r\nThrough this puppet show Goethe made acquaintance with the legend.\r\nBy the time that Goethe was twenty, the Faust legend had fascinated his\r\nimagination; for three years before he went to Weimar he had been working\r\non scattered scenes and bits of dialogue; and though he suspended actual\r\ncomposition on it during three distinct periods, it was always to resume, and\r\nhe closed his labors upon it only with his life. Thus the period of time between\r\nhis first experiments and the final touches is more than sixty years. During this\r\nperiod the plans for the structure and the signification of the work inevitably\r\nunderwent profound modifications, and these have naturally affected the unity\r\nof the result; but, on the other hand, this long companionship and persistent\r\nrecurrence to the task from youth to old age have made it in a unique way the\r\nrecord of Goethe\'s personality in all its richness and diversity.\r\nThe drama was given to the public first as a fragment in 1790; then the\r\ncompleted First Part appeared in 1808; and finally the Second Part was\r\npublished in 1833, the year after the author\'s death. Writing in "Dichtung und\r\nWahrheit" of the period about 1770, when he was in Strasburg with Herder,\r\nGoethe says, "The significant puppet - play legend . . . echoed and buzzed in\r\nmany tones within me. I too had drifted about in all knowledge, and early\r\nenough had been brought to feel the vanity of it. I too had made all sorts of\r\nexperiments in life, and had always come back more unsatisfied and more\r\ntormented. I was now carrying these things, like many others, about with me\r\nand delighting myself with them in lonely hours, but without writing anything\r\ndown." Without going into the details of the experience which underlies these\r\nwords, we can see the beginning of that sympathy with the hero of the old\r\nstory that was the basis of its fascination and that accounted for Goethe\'s\r\ndeparture from the traditional catastrophe of Faust\'s damnation.\r\nHungarian March from the "Damnation of Faust"Op.24 by Hector\r\nBerlioz(1803 - 1869).\r\nOf the elements in the finished Faust that are derived from the legend a rough\r\nidea may be obtained from the "Doctor Faustus" of Marlowe, printed in the\r\npresent volume. As early as 1674 a life of Faust had contained the incident of\r\nthe philosopher\'s falling in love with a servant - girl; but the developed story of\r\nGretchen is Goethe\'s own. The other elements added to the plot can be noted\r\nby a comparison with Marlowe.\r\nIt need hardly be said that Goethe\'s "Faust" does not derive its greatness from\r\nits conformity to the traditional standards of what a tragedy should be. He\r\nhimself was accustomed to refer to it cynically as a monstrosity, and yet he\r\nput himself into it as intensely as Dante put himself into "The Divine Comedy."\r\nA partial explanation of this apparent contradiction in the author\'s attitude is to\r\nbe found in what has been said of its manner of composition. Goethe began it\r\nin his romantic youth, and availed himself recklessly of the supernatural\r\nelements in the legend, with the disregard of reason and plausibility\r\ncharacteristic of the romantic mood. When he returned to it in the beginning of\r\nthe new century his artistic standards has changed, and the supernaturalism\r\ncould now be tolerated only by being made symbolic. Thus he makes the\r\ncareer of Faust as a whole emblematic of the triumph of the persistent striving\r\nfor the ideal over the temptation to find complete satisfaction in the sense, and\r\nprepares the reader for this interpretation by prefixing the "Prologue in\r\nHeaven." The elaboration of this symbolic element is responsible for such\r\nscenes as the Walpurgis - Night and the Intermezzo scenes full of power and\r\ninfinitely suggestive, but destructive of the unity of the play as a tragedy of\r\nhuman life. Yet there remains in this First Part even in its final form much that\r\nis realistic in the best sense, the carousal in Auerbach\'s cellar, the portrait of\r\nMartha, the Easter - morning walk, the character and fate of Margaret. It is\r\nsuch elements as these that have appealed to the larger reading public and that\r\nhave naturally been emphasized by performance on the stage, and by virtue of\r\nthese alone "Faust" may rank as a great drama; but it is the result of Goethe\'s\r\nbroodings on the mystery of human life, shadowed forth in the symbolic parts\r\nand elaborated with still greater complexity and still more far - reaching\r\nsuggestiveness - and, it must be added, with deepening obscurity - in the\r\nSecond Part, that have given the work its place with "Job," with the\r\n"Prometheus Bound," with "The Divine Comedy," and with "Hamlet."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(r.p,{children:"The Tragedy Of Faust - Dedication\r\nYe wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me, As erst upon my troubled sight\r\nye stole; Shall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye? Still for the fond illusion\r\nyearns my soul? Ye press around! Come then, your captive hold me, As\r\nupward from the vapoury mist ye roll; Within my breast youth's throbbing\r\npulse is bounding, Fann'd by the magic breath your march surrounding.\r\nShades fondly loved appear, your train attending, And visions fair of many a\r\nblissful day; First - love and friendship their fond accents blending, Like to\r\nsome ancient, half - expiring lay; Sorrow revives, her wail of anguish sending\r\nBack o'er life's devious labyrinthine way, And names the dear ones, they\r\nwhom Fate bereaving Of life's fair hours, left me behind them grieving.\r\nThey hear me not my later cadence singing, The souls to whom my earlier lays\r\nI sang; Dispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging; Mute are the\r\nvoices that responsive rang. For stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now\r\nstringing, E'en their applause is to my heart a pang; Of old who listened to my\r\nsong, glad hearted, If yet they live, now wander widely parted.\r\nA yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying, To yon calm spirit - realm\r\nuplifts my soul; In faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing, Fans the\r\nAeolian harp, my numbers roll; Tear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeying\r\nThe tender impulse, loses its control; What I possess as from afar I see;\r\nThose I have lost become realities to me.\r\nPrologue For The Theatre\r\nManager. Dramatic Poet. Merryman.\r\nManager\r\nYe twain, in trouble and distress True friends whom I so oft have found, Say,\r\nfor our scheme on German ground, What prospect have we of success? Fain\r\nwould I please the public, win their thanks; They live and let live, hence it is\r\nbut meet. The posts are now erected, and the planks, And all look forward to\r\na festal treat. Their places taken, they, with eyebrows rais'd, Sit patiently, and\r\nfain would be amaz'd. I know the art to hit the public taste, Yet ne'er of failure\r\nfelt so keen a dread; True, they are not accustomed to the best, But then\r\nappalling the amount they've read. How make our entertainment striking, new,\r\nAnd yet significant and pleasing too? For to be plain, I love to see the throng,\r\nAs to our booth the living tide progresses; As wave on wave successive rolls\r\nalong, And through heaven's narrow portal forceful presses; Still in broad\r\ndaylight, ere the clock strikes four, With blows their way towards the box\r\nthey take; And, as for bread in famine, at the baker's door, For tickets are\r\ncontent their necks to break. Such various minds the bard alone can sway,\r\nMy friend, oh work this miracle to - day!\r\nPoet\r\nOh of the motley throng speak not before me, At whose aspect the Spirit\r\nwings its flight! Conceal the surging concourse, I implore thee, Whose vortex\r\ndraws us with resistless might. No, to some peaceful heavenly nook restore\r\nme, Where only for the bard blooms pure delight, Where love and friendship\r\nyield their choicest blessing, Our heart's true bliss, with god - like hand\r\ncaressing.\r\nWhat in the spirit's depths was there created, What shyly there the lip shaped\r\nforth in sound; A failure now, with words now fitly mated, In the wild tumult\r\nof the hour is drown'd; Full oft the poet's thought for years hath waited Until\r\nat length with perfect form 'tis crowned; What dazzles, for the moment born,\r\nmust perish; What genuine is posterity will cherish.\r\nMerryman\r\nThis cant about posterity I hate; About posterity were I to prate, Who then\r\nthe living would amuse? For they Will have diversion, ay, and 'tis their due. A\r\nsprightly fellow's presence at your play, Methinks should also count for\r\nsomething too; Whose genial wit the audience still inspires, Knows from their\r\nchangeful mood no angry feeling; A wider circle he desires, To their heart's\r\ndepths more surely thus appealing. To work, then! Give a master - piece, my\r\nfriend; Bring Fancy with her choral trains before us, Sense, reason, feeling,\r\npassion, but attend! Let folly also swell the tragic chorus.\r\nManager\r\nIn chief, of incident enough prepare! A show they want, they come to gape\r\nand stare. Spin for their eyes abundant occupation, So that the multitude may\r\nwondering gaze, You by sheer bulk have won your reputation, The man you\r\nare all love to praise. By mass alone can you subdue the masses, Each then\r\nselects in time what suits his bent. Bring much, you something bring for various\r\nclasses, And from the house goes every one content. You give a piece,\r\nabroad in pieces send it! 'Tis a ragout - success must needs attend it; 'Tis easy\r\nto serve up, as easy to invent. A finish'd whole what boots it to present! Full\r\nsoon the public will in pieces rend it.\r\nPoet\r\nHow mean such handicraft as this you cannot feel! How it revolts the genuine\r\nartist's mind! The sorry trash in which these coxcombs deal, Is here approved\r\non principle, I find.\r\nManager\r\nSuch a reproof disturbs me not a whit! Who on efficient work is bent, Must\r\nchoose the fittest instrument. Consider! 'tis soft wood you have to split; Think\r\ntoo for whom you write, I pray! One comes to while an hour away; One from\r\nthe festive board, a sated guest; Others, more dreaded than the rest, From\r\njournal - reading hurry to the play. As to a masquerade, with absent minds,\r\nthey press, Sheer curiosity their footsteps winging; Ladies display their\r\npersons and their dress, Actors unpaid their service bringing. What dreams\r\nbeguile you on your poet's height? What puts a full house in a merry mood?\r\nMore closely view your patrons of the night! The half are cold, the half are\r\nrude. One, the play over, craves a game of cards; Another a wild night in\r\nwanton joy would spend. Poor fools the muses' fair regards. Why court for\r\nsuch a paltry end? I tell you, give them more, still more 'tis all I ask, Thus you\r\nwill ne'er stray widely from the goal; Your audience seek to mystify cajole; To\r\nsatisfy them - that's a harder task. What ails thee? art enraptured or\r\ndistressed?\r\nPoet\r\nDepart! elsewhere another servant choose What! shall the bard his godlike\r\npower abuse? Man's loftiest right, kind nature's high bequest, For your mean\r\npurpose basely sport away? Whence comes his mastery o'er the human\r\nbreast, Whence o'er the elements his sway, But from the harmony that,\r\ngushing from his soul, Draws back into his heart the wondrous whole? With\r\ncareless hand when round her spindle, Nature Winds the interminable thread\r\nof life; When 'mid the clash of Being every creature Mingles in harsh\r\ninextricable strife; Who deals their course unvaried till it falleth, In rhythmic\r\nflow to music's measur'd tone? Each solitary note whose genius calleth, To\r\nswell the mighty choir in unison? Who in the raging storm sees passion\r\nlow'ring? Or flush of earnest thought in evening's glow? Who every blossom in\r\nsweet spring - time flowering Along the loved one's path would strow? Who,\r\nNature's green familiar leaves entwining, Wreathe's glory's garland, won on\r\nevery field? Makes sure Olympus, heavenly powers combining? Man's mighty\r\nspirit, in the bard reveal'd!\r\nMerryman\r\nCome then, employ your lofty inspiration, And carry on the poet's avocation,\r\nJust as we carry on a love affair. Two meet by chance, are pleased, they\r\nlinger there, Insensibly are link'd, they scarce know how; Fortune seems now\r\npropitious, adverse now, Then come alternate rapture and despair; And 'tis a\r\ntrue romance ere one's aware. Just such a drama let us now compose. Plunge\r\nboldly into life - its depths disclose! Each lives it, not to many is it known,\r\n'Twill interest wheresoever seiz'd and shown; Bright pictures, but obscure\r\ntheir meaning: A ray of truth through error gleaming, Thus you the best elixir\r\nbrew, To charm mankind, and edify them too. Then youth's fair blossoms\r\ncrowd to view your play, And wait as on an oracle; while they, The tender\r\nsouls, who love the melting mood, Suck from your work their melancholy\r\nfood; Now this one, and now that, you deeply stir, Each sees the working of\r\nhis heart laid bare. Their tears, their laughter, you command with ease, The\r\nlofty still they honour, the illusive love. Your finish'd gentlemen you ne'er can\r\nplease; A growing mind alone will grateful prove.\r\nPoet\r\nThen give me back youth's golden prime, When my own spirit too was\r\ngrowing, When from my heart th' unbidden rhyme Gush'd forth, a fount for\r\never flowing; Then shadowy mist the world conceal'd, And every bud sweet\r\npromise made, Of wonders yet to be reveal'd, As through the vales, with\r\nblooms inlaid, Culling a thousand flowers I stray'd. Naught had I, yet a rich\r\nprofusion! The thirst for truth, joy in each fond illusion. Give me unquell'd\r\nthose impulses to prove; Rapture so deep, its ecstasy was pain, The power of\r\nhate, the energy of love, Give me, oh give me back my youth again!\r\nMerryman\r\nYouth, my good friend, you certainly require When foes in battle round are\r\npressing, When a fair maid, her heart on fire, Hangs on your neck with fond\r\ncaressing, When from afar, the victor's crown, To reach the hard - won goal\r\ninciteth; When from the whirling dance, to drown Your sense, the night's\r\ncarouse inviteth.

Therefore myself to magic I give, In\r\nhope, through spirit - voice and might, Secrets now veiled to bring to light,\r\nThat I no more, with aching brow, Need speak of what I nothing know; That\r\nI the force may recognise That binds creation's inmost energies; Her vital\r\npowers, her embryo seeds survey, And fling the trade in empty words away.\r\nO full - orb'd moon, did but thy rays Their last upon mine anguish gaze!\r\nBeside this desk, at dead of night, Oft have I watched to hail thy light: Then,\r\npensive friend! o'er book and scroll, With soothing power, thy radiance stole!\r\nIn thy dear light, ah, might I climb, Freely, some mountain height sublime,\r\nRound mountain caves with spirits ride, In thy mild haze o'er meadows glide,\r\nAnd, purged from knowledge - fumes, renew My spirit, in thy healing dew!\r\nWoe's me! still prison'd in the gloom Of this abhorr'd and musty room! Where\r\nheaven's dear light itself doth pass, But dimly through the painted glass!\r\nHemmed in by volumes thick with dust, Worm - eaten, hid 'neath rust and\r\nmould, And to the high vault's topmost bound, A smoke - stained paper\r\ncompassed round; With boxes round thee piled, and glass, And many a\r\nuseless instrument, With old ancestral lumber blent This is thy world! a world!\r\nalas! And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart, With tighten'd pressure in thy\r\nbreast? Why the dull ache will not depart, By which thy life - pulse is\r\noppress'd? Instead of nature's living sphere, Created for mankind of old,\r\nBrute skeletons surround thee here, And dead men's bones in smoke and\r\nmould.\r\nUp! Forth into the distant land! Is not this book of mystery By Nostradamus'\r\nproper hand, An all - sufficient guide? Thou'lt see The courses of the stars\r\nunroll'd; When nature doth her thoughts unfold To thee, thy soul shall rise, and\r\nseek Communion high with her to hold, As spirit doth with spirit speak! Vain\r\nby dull poring to divine The meaning of each hallow'd sign. Spirits! I feel you\r\nhov'ring near; Make answer, if my voice ye hear!\r\n(He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosmos.)\r\nAh! at this spectacle through every sense, What sudden ecstasy of joy is\r\nflowing! I feel new rapture, hallow'd and intense, Through every nerve and\r\nvein with ardour glowing. Was it a god who character'd this scroll, The tumult\r\nin my spirit healing, O'er my sad heart with rapture stealing, And by a mystic\r\nimpulse, to my soul, The powers of nature all around revealing. Am I a God?\r\nWhat light intense! In these pure symbols do I see, Nature exert her vital\r\nenergy. Now of the wise man's words I learn the sense;\r\n\"Unlock'd the spirit - world doth lie, Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead! Up\r\nscholar, lave, with courage high, Thine earthly breast in the morning - red!\"\r\n(He contemplates the sign.)\r\nHow all things live and work, and ever blending, Weave one vast whole from\r\nBeing's ample range! How powers celestial, rising and descending, Their\r\ngolden buckets ceaseless interchange! Their flight on rapture - breathing\r\npinions winging, From heaven to earth their genial influence bringing, Through\r\nthe wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing!\r\nA wondrous show! but ah! a show alone! Where shall I grasp thee, infinite\r\nnature, where? Ye breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon Hang heaven and\r\nearth, from which the withered heart For solace yearns, ye still impart Your\r\nsweet and fostering tides - where are ye - where? Ye gush, and must I\r\nlanguish in despair?\r\n(He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, and perceives the sigh of\r\nthe Earth - spirit.)\r\nHow all unlike the influence of this sign! Earth - spirit, thou to me art nigher,\r\nE'en now my strength is rising higher, E'en now I glow as with new wine;\r\nCourage I feel, abroad the world to dare, The woe of earth, the bliss of earth\r\nto bear, With storms to wrestle, brave the lightning's glare, And mid the\r\ncrashing shipwreck not despair.\r\nClouds gather over me The moon conceals her light The lamp is quench'd\r\nVapours are rising - Quiv'ring round my head Flash the red beams - Down\r\nfrom the vaulted roof A shuddering horror floats, And seizes me! I feel it,\r\nspirit, prayer - compell'd, 'tis thou Art hovering near! Unveil thyself! Ha! How\r\nmy heart is riven now! Each sense, with eager palpitation, Is strain'd to catch\r\nsome new sensation! I feel my heart surrender'd unto thee! Thou must! Thou\r\nmust! Though life should be the fee!\r\n(He seizes the book, and pronounces mysteriously the sign of the spirit. A\r\nruddy flame flashes up; the spirit appears in the flame.)\r\nSpirit\r\nWho calls me?\r\nFaust (turning aside) Dreadful shape! Spirit\r\nWith might,\r\nThou hast compelled me to appear, Long hast been sucking at my sphere,\r\nAnd now\r\nDr. Johann Faust: Dr. Johann Faust watching a magic disc in his study.\r\nEngraving by Rembrant.]\r\nFaust\r\nWoe's me! I cannot bear thy sight!\r\nSpirit\r\nTo see me thou dost breathe thine invocation, My voice to hear, to gaze upon\r\nmy brow; Me doth thy strong entreaty bow Lo! I am here! - What cowering\r\nagitation Grasps thee, the demigod! Where's now the soul's deep cry? Where\r\nis the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv'd And bore and cherished?\r\nwhich, with ecstacy, To rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved? Where art\r\nthou, Faust? whose voice I heard resound, Who towards me press'd with\r\nenergy profound? Art thou he? Thou, - who by my breath art blighted, Who,\r\nin his spirit's depths affrighted, Trembles, a crush'd and writhing worm!\r\nFaust\r\nShall I yield, thing of flame, to thee? Faust, and thine equal, I am he!\r\nSpirit\r\nIn the currents of life, in action's storm, I float and I wave With billowy\r\nmotion! Birth and the grave A limitless ocean, A constant weaving With\r\nchange still rife, A restless heaving, A glowing life Thus time's whirring loom\r\nunceasing I ply, And weave the life - garment of deity.\r\nFaust\r\nThou, restless spirit, dost from end to end O'ersweep the world; how near I\r\nfeel to thee!\r\nSpirit\r\nThou'rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend, Not me!\r\n(Vanishes.)\r\nFaust (deeply moved)\r\nNot thee? Whom then? I, Gods own image! And not rank with thee!\r\n(A knock)\r\nOh death! I know it - 'tis my famulus My fairest fortune now escapes! That all\r\nthese visionary shapes A soulless groveller should banish thus!\r\n(Wagner in his dressing gown and night - cap, a lamp in his hand. Faust turns\r\nround reluctantly.)\r\nWagner\r\nPardon! I heard you here declaim; A Grecian tragedy you doubtless read?\r\nImprovement in this art is now my aim, For now - a - days it much avails.\r\nIndeed An actor, oft I've heard it said, as teacher, May give instruction to a\r\npreacher.\r\nFaust\r\nAy, if your priest should be an actor too, As not improbably may come to\r\npass.\r\nWagner\r\nWhen in his study pent the whole year through, Man views the world, as\r\nthrough an optic glass, On a chance holiday, and scarcely then, How by\r\npersuasion can he govern men?\r\nFaust\r\nIf feeling prompt not, if it doth not flow Fresh from the spirit's depths, with\r\nstrong control Swaying to rapture every listener's soul, Idle your toil; the\r\nchase you may forego! Brood o'er your task! Together glue, Cook from\r\nanother's feast your own ragout, Still prosecute your paltry game, And fan\r\nyour ash - heaps into flame! Thus children's wonder you'll excite, And apes', if\r\nsuch your appetite; But that which issues from the heart alone, Will bend the\r\nhearts of others to your own.\r\nWagner\r\nThe speaker in delivery will find Success alone; I still am far behind.\r\nFaust\r\nA worthy object still pursue! Be not a hollow tinkling fool! Sound\r\nunderstanding, judgment true, Find utterance without art or rule; And when in\r\nearnest you are moved to speak, Then is it needful cunning words to seek?\r\nYour fine harangues, so polish'd in their kind, Wherein the shreds of human\r\nthought ye twist, Are unrefreshing as the empty wind, Whistling through\r\nwither'd leaves and autumn mist!\r\nWagner\r\nOh God! How long is art, Our life how short! With earnest zeal Still as I ply\r\nthe critic's task, I feel A strange oppression both of head and heart. The very\r\nmeans how hardly are they won, By which we to the fountains rise! And\r\nhaply, ere one half the course is run, Check'd in his progress, the poor devil\r\ndies.\r\nFaust\r\nParchment, is that the sacred fount whence roll Waters, he thirsteth not who\r\nonce hath quaffed? Oh, if it gush not from thine inmost soul, Thou has not won\r\nthe life - restoring draught.\r\nWagner\r\nYour pardon! 'tis delightful to transport Oneself into the spirit of the past, To\r\nsee in times before us how a wise man thought, And what a glorious height we\r\nhave achieved at last.\r\nFaust\r\nAy truly! even to the loftiest star! To us, my friend, the ages that are pass'd A\r\nbook with seven seals, close - fasten'd, are; And what the spirit of the times\r\nmen call, Is merely their own spirit after all, Wherein, distorted oft, the times\r\nare glass'd. Then truly, 'tis a sight to grieve the soul! At the first glance we fly it\r\nin dismay; A very lumber - room, a rubbish - hole; At best a sort of mock -\r\nheroic play, With saws pragmatical, and maxims sage, To suit the puppets\r\nand their mimic stage.\r\nWagner\r\nBut then the world and man, his heart and brain! Touching these things all men\r\nwould something know.\r\nFaust\r\nAy! what 'mong men as knowledge doth obtain! Who on the child its true\r\nname dares bestow? The few who somewhat of these things have known,\r\nWho their full hearts unguardedly reveal'd, Nor thoughts, nor feelings, from\r\nthe mob conceal'd, Have died on crosses, or in flames been thrown. Excuse\r\nme, friend, far now the night is spent, For this time we must say adieu.\r\nWagner\r\nStill to watch on I had been well content, Thus to converse so learnedly with\r\nyou. But as to - morrow will be Easter - day, Some further questions grant, I\r\npray; With diligence to study still I fondly cling; Already I know much, but\r\nwould know everything.\r\n(Exit.)\r\nFaust Soliloquy - Chorus Of Angels\r\nFaust (alone)\r\nHow him alone all hope abandons never, To empty trash who clings, with zeal\r\nuntired, With greed for treasure gropes, and, joy - inspir'd, Exults if earth -\r\nworms second his endeavour.\r\nAnd dare a voice of merely human birth, E'en here, where shapes immortal\r\nthrong'd intrude? Yet ah! thou poorest of the sons of earth, For once, I e'en\r\nto thee feel gratitude. Despair the power of sense did well - nigh blast, And\r\nthou didst save me ere I sank dismay'd, So giant - like the vision seem'd, so\r\nvast, I felt myself shrink dwarf'd as I survey'd!\r\nI, God's own image, from this toil of clay Already freed, with eager joy who\r\nhail'd The mirror of eternal truth unveil'd, Mid light effulgent and celestial day:\r\nI, more than cherub, whose unfetter'd soul With penetrative glance aspir'd to\r\nflow Through nature's veins, and, still creating, know The life of gods, - how\r\nam I punish'd now! One thunder - word hath hurl'd me from the goal!\r\nSpirit! I dare not lift me to thy sphere. What though my power compell'd thee\r\nto appear, My art was powerless to detain thee here. In that great moment,\r\nrapture - fraught, I felt myself so small, so great; Fiercely didst thrust me from\r\nthe realm of thought Back on humanity's uncertain fate! Who'll teach me now?\r\nWhat ought I to forego? Ought I that impulse to obey? Alas! our every deed,\r\nas well as every woe, Impedes the tenor of life's onward way!\r\nE'en to the noblest by the soul conceiv'd, Some feelings cling of baser quality;\r\nAnd when the goods of this world are achiev'd, Each nobler aim is termed a\r\ncheat, a lie. Our aspirations, our soul's genuine life, Grow torpid in the din of\r\nearthly strife. Though youthful phantasy, while hope inspires, Stretch o'er the\r\ninfinite her wing sublime, A narrow compass limits her desires, When wreck'd\r\nour fortunes in the gulf of time. In the deep heart of man care builds her nest,\r\nO'er secret woes she broodeth there, Sleepless she rocks herself and scareth\r\njoy and rest; Still is she wont some new disguise to wear, She may as house\r\nand court, as wife and child appear, As dagger, poison, fire and flood;\r\nImagined evils chill thy blood,\r\nAnd what thou ne'er shall lose, o'er that dost shed the tear. I am not like the\r\ngods! Feel it I must; I'm like the earth - worm, writhing in the dust, Which, as\r\non dust it feeds, its native fare, Crushed 'neath the passer's tread, lies buried\r\nthere.\r\nIs it not dust, wherewith this lofty wall, With hundred shelves, confines me\r\nround; Rubbish, in thousand shapes, may I not call What in this moth - world\r\ndoth my being bound? Here, what doth fail me, shall I find? Read in a\r\nthousand tomes that, everywhere, Self - torture is the lot of human - kind,\r\nWith but one mortal happy, here and there? Thou hollow skull, that grin, what\r\nshould it say, But that thy brain, like mine, of old perplexed, Still yearning for\r\nthe truth, hath sought the light of day. And in the twilight wandered, sorely\r\nvexed? Ye instruments, forsooth, ye mock at me, With wheel, and cog, and\r\nring, and cylinder; To nature's portals ye should be the key; Cunning your\r\nwards, and yet the bolts ye fail to stir. Inscrutable in broadest light, To be\r\nunveil'd by force she doth refuse, What she reveals not to thy mental sight,\r\nThou wilt not wrest me from her with levers and with screws. Old useless\r\nfurnitures, yet stand ye here, Because my sire ye served, now dead and gone.\r\nOld scroll, the smoke of years dost wear, So long as o'er this desk the sorry\r\nlamp hath shone. Better my little means hath squandered quite away, Than\r\nburden'd by that little here to sweat and groan! Wouldst thou possess thy\r\nheritage, essay, By use to render it thine own! What we employ not, but\r\nimpedes our way, That which the hour creates, that can it use alone! But\r\nwherefore to yon spot is riveted my gaze? Is yonder flasket there a magnet to\r\nmy sight? Whence this mild radiance that around me plays, As when, 'mid\r\nforest gloom, reigneth the moon's soft light?\r\nHail precious phial! Thee, with reverent awe, Down from thine old receptacle\r\nI draw! Science in thee I hail and human art. Essence of deadliest powers,\r\nrefin'd and sure, Of soothing anodynes abstraction pure, Now in thy master's\r\nneed thy grace impart! I gaze on thee, my pain is lull'd to rest; I grasp thee,\r\ncalm'd the tumult in my breast; The flood - tide of my spirit ebbs away;\r\nOnward I'm summon'd o'er a boundless main, Calm at my feet expands the\r\nglassy plain, To shores unknown allures a brighter day.\r\nLo, where a car of fire, on airy pinion, Comes floating towards me! I'm\r\nprepar'd to fly By a new track through ether's wide dominion, To distant\r\nspheres of pure activity. This life intense, this godlike ecstasy Worm that thou\r\nart such rapture canst thou earn? Only resolve with courage stern and high,\r\nThy visage from the radiant sun to turn! Dare with determin'd will to burst the\r\nportals Past which in terror others fain would steal! Now is the time, through\r\ndeeds, to show that mortals The calm sublimity of gods can feel; To shudder\r\nnot at yonder dark abyss, Where phantasy creates her own self - torturing\r\nbrood, Right onward to the yawning gulf to press, Around whose narrow\r\njaws rolleth hell's fiery flood; With glad resolve to take the fatal leap, Though\r\ndanger threaten thee, to sink in endless sleep! Pure crystal goblet! forth I\r\ndraw thee now, From out thine antiquated case, where thou Forgotten hast\r\nreposed for many a year! Oft at my father's revels thou didst shine, To glad\r\nthe earnest guests was thine, As each to other passed the generous cheer. The\r\ngorgeous brede of figures, quaintly wrought, Which he who quaff'd must first\r\nin rhyme expound, Then drain the goblet at one draught profound, Hath nights\r\nof boyhood to fond memory brought. I to my neighbour shall not reach thee\r\nnow, Nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show. Here is a juice, makes\r\ndrunk without delay; Its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill; Let this\r\nlast draught, the product of my skill, My own free choice, be quaff'd with\r\nresolute will, A solemn festive greeting, to the coming day!\r\n(He places the goblet to his mouth.)\r\n(The ringing of bells, and choral voices.)\r\nChorus of Angels\r\nChrist is arisen! Mortal, all hail to thee, Thou whom mortality, Earth's sad\r\nreality, Held as in prison.\r\nFaust\r\nWhat hum melodious, what clear silvery chime Thus draws the goblet from\r\nmy lips away? Ye deep - ton'd bells, do ye with voice sublime, Announce the\r\nsolemn dawn of Easter - day? Sweet choir! are ye the hymn of comfort\r\nsinging, Which one around the darkness of the grave, From seraph - voices,\r\nin glad triumph ringing, Of a new covenant assurance gave?\r\nChorus of Women\r\nWe, his true - hearted, With spices and myrrh, Embalmed the departed, And\r\nswathed him with care; Here we conveyed Him, Our Master, so dear; Alas!\r\nWhere we laid Him, The Christ is not here,\r\nChorus of Angels\r\nChrist is arisen! Blessed the loving one, Who from earth's trial throes, Healing\r\nand strengthening woes, Soars as from prison.\r\nFaust\r\nWherefore, ye tones celestial, sweet and strong, Come ye a dweller in the\r\ndust to seek? Ring out your chimes believing crowds among, The message\r\nwell I hear, my faith alone is weak; From faith her darling, miracle, hath\r\nsprung. Aloft to yonder spheres I dare not soar, Whence sound the tidings of\r\ngreat joy; And yet, with this sweet strain familiar when a boy, Back it recalleth\r\nme to life once more. Then would celestial love, with holy kiss, Come o'er me\r\nin the Sabbath's stilly hour, While, fraught with solemn meaning and\r\nmysterious power, Chim'd the deep - sounding bell, and prayer was bliss; A\r\nyearning impulse, undefin'd yet dear, Drove me to wander on through wood\r\nand field; With heaving breast and many a burning tear, I felt with holy joy a\r\nworld reveal'd. Gay sports and festive hours proclaim'd with joyous pealing,\r\nThis Easter hymn in days of old; And fond remembrance now doth me, with\r\nchildlike feeling, Back from the last, the solemn step, withhold. O still sound\r\non, thou sweet celestial strain! The tear - drop flows, - Earth, I am thine\r\nagain!\r\nChorus of Disciples\r\nHe whom we mourned as dead, Living and glorious, From the dark grave\r\nhath fled, O'er death victorious; Almost creative bliss Waits on his growing\r\npowers; Ah! Him on earth we miss; Sorrow and grief are ours. Yearning he\r\nleft his own, Mid sore annoy; Ah! we must needs bemoan. Master, thy joy!\r\nChorus of Angels\r\nChrist is arisen, Redeem'd from decay. The bonds which imprison Your souls,\r\nrend away! Praising the Lord with zeal, By deeds that love reveal, Like\r\nbrethren true and leal Sharing the daily meal, To all that sorrow feel\r\nWhisp'ring of heaven's weal, Still is the master near, Still is he here!\r\nBefore The Gate\r\nPromenaders of all sorts pass out.\r\nArtisans\r\nWhy choose ye that direction, pray?\r\nOthers\r\nTo the hunting - lodge we're on our way.\r\nThe First\r\nWe towards the mill are strolling on.\r\nA Mechanic\r\nA walk to Wasserhof were best.\r\nA Second\r\nThe road is not a pleasant one.\r\nThe Others\r\nWhat will you do?\r\nA Third\r\nI'll join the rest.\r\nA Fourth\r\nLet's up to Burghof, there you'll find good cheer, The prettiest maidens and\r\nthe best of beer, And brawls of a prime sort.\r\nA Fifth\r\nYou scapegrace! How; Your skin still itching for a row? Thither I will not go,\r\nI loathe the place.\r\nServant Girl\r\nNo, no! I to the town my steps retrace.\r\nAnother\r\nNear yonder poplars he is sure to be.\r\nThe First\r\nAnd if he is, what matters it to me! With you he'll walk, he'll dance with none\r\nbut you, And with your pleasures what have I to do?\r\nThe Second\r\nTo - day he will not be alone, he said His friend would be with him, the curly -\r\nhead.\r\nStudent\r\nWhy how those buxom girls step on! Come, brother, we will follow them\r\nanon. Strong beer, a damsel smartly dress'd, Stinging tobacco, - these I love\r\nthe best.\r\nBurgher's Daughter\r\nLook at those handsome fellows there! 'Tis really shameful, I declare, The\r\nvery best society they shun, After those servant girls forsooth, to run.\r\nSecond Student (to the first)\r\nNot quite so fast! for in our rear, Two girls, well - dress'd, are drawing near;\r\nNot far from us the one doth dwell, And sooth to say, I like her well. They\r\nwalk demurely, yet you'll see, That they will let us join them presently.\r\nThe First\r\nNot I! restraints of all kinds I detest. Quick! let us catch the wild - game ere it\r\nflies, The hand on Saturday the mop that plies, Will on the Sunday fondle you\r\nthe best.\r\nBurgher\r\nNo, this new Burgomaster, I like him not, God knows, Now, he's in office,\r\ndaily more arrogant he grows; And for the town, what doth he do for it? Are\r\nnot things worse from day to day? To more restraints we must submit; And\r\ntaxes more than ever pay.\r\nBeggar (sings)\r\nKind gentleman and ladies fair, So rosy - cheek'd and trimly dress'd, Be\r\npleas'd to listen to my prayer, Relieve and pity the distress'd. Let me not\r\nvainly sing my lay! His heart's most glad whose hand is free. Now when all\r\nmen keep holiday, Should be a harvest - day to me.\r\nAnother Burgher\r\nOn holidays and Sundays naught know I more inviting Than chatting about\r\nwar and war's alarms, When folk in Turkey, up in arms, Far off, are 'gainst\r\neach other fighting. We at the window stand, our glasses drain, And watch\r\nadown the stream the painted vessels gliding Then joyful we at eve come\r\nhome again, And peaceful times we bless, peace long - abiding.\r\nThird Burgher\r\nAy, neighbour! So let matters stand for me! There they may scatter one\r\nanother's brains, And wild confusion round them see So here at home in quiet\r\nall remains! Old Woman (to the Burghers' Daughters) Heyday! How smart!\r\nThe fresh young blood! Who would not fall in love with you? Not quite so\r\nproud! 'Tis well and good! And what you wish, that I could help you to.\r\nBurgher's Daughter\r\nCome, Agatha! I care not to be seen Walking in public with these witches.\r\nTrue, My future lover, last St. Andrew's E'en, In flesh and blood she brought\r\nbefore my view.\r\nAnother\r\nAnd mine she show'd me also in the glass, A soldier's figure, with companions\r\nbold; I look around, I seek him as I pass, In vain, his form I nowhere can\r\nbehold.\r\nSoldiers\r\nFortress with turrets And walls high in air, Damsel disdainful, Haughty and\r\nfair, There be my prey! Bold is the venture, Costly the pay!\r\nHark how the trumpet Thither doth call us, Where either pleasure Or death\r\nmay befall us. Hail to the tumult! Life's in the field! Damsel and fortress To us\r\nmust yield.\r\nBold is the venture, Costly the pay! Gaily the soldier Marches away.\r\nFaust and Wagner - Peasant Dances\r\nFaust\r\nLoosed from their fetters are streams and rills Through the gracious spring -\r\ntide's all - quickening glow; Hope's budding joy in the vale doth blow; Old\r\nWinter back to the savage hills Withdraweth his force, decrepid now. Thence\r\nonly impotent icy grains Scatters he as he wings his flight, Striping with sleet\r\nthe verdant plains; But the sun endureth no trace of white; Everywhere growth\r\nand movement are rife, All things investing with hues of life: Though flowers\r\nare lacking, varied of dye, Their colours the motley throng supply. Turn thee\r\naround, and from this height, Back to the town direct thy sight. Forth from the\r\nhollow, gloomy gate, Stream forth the masses, in bright array. Gladly seek\r\nthey the sun to - day; The Lord's Resurrection they celebrate: For they\r\nthemselves have risen, with joy, From tenement sordid, from cheerless room,\r\nFrom bonds of toil, from care and annoy, From gable and roof's o'er -\r\nhanging gloom, From crowded alley and narrow street, And from the\r\nchurches' awe - breathing night, All now have come forth into the light. Look,\r\nonly look, on nimble feet, Through garden and field how spread the throng,\r\nHow o'er the river's ample sheet,\r\nMany a gay wherry glides along; And see, deep sinking in the tide, Pushes the\r\nlast boat now away. E'en from yon far hill's path - worn side, Flash the bright\r\nhues of garments gay. Hark! Sounds of village mirth arise; This is the people's\r\nparadise. Both great and small send up a cheer; Here am I man, I feel it here.\r\nWagner\r\nSir Doctor, in a walk with you There's honour and instruction too; Yet here\r\nalone I care not to resort, Because I coarseness hate of every sort. This\r\nfiddling, shouting, skittling, I detest; I hate the tumult of the vulgar throng; They\r\nroar as by the evil one possess'd, And call it pleasure, call it song.\r\nPeasants (under the linden - tree)\r\nDance and song\r\nThe shepherd for the dance was dress'd, With ribbon, wreath, and coloured\r\nvest, A gallant show displaying. And round about the linden - tree, They\r\nfooted it right merrily. Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! So fiddle - bow\r\nwas braying\r\nOur swain amidst the circle press'd, He push'd a maiden trimly dress'd, And\r\njogg'd her with his elbow; The buxom damsel turn'd her head, \"Now that's a\r\nstupid trick!\" she said Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Don't be so\r\nrude, good fellow!\r\nSwift in the circle they advanced, They danced to right, to left they danced,\r\nAnd all the skirts were swinging. And they grew red, and they grew warm,\r\nPanting, they rested arm in arm, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! To\r\nhip their elbow bringing.\r\nDon't make so free! How many a maid Has been betroth'd and then betray'd;\r\nAnd has repented after! Yet still he flatter'd her aside, And from the linden, far\r\nand wide, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Rang fiddle - bow and\r\nlaughter.\r\nOld Peasant\r\nDoctor, 'tis really kind of you, To condescend to come this way, A highly\r\nlearned man like you, To join our mirthful throng to - day. Our fairest cup I\r\noffer you, which we with sparkling drink have crown'd, And pledging you, I\r\npray aloud, That every drop within its round, While it your present thirst\r\nallays, May swell the number of your days.\r\nFaust\r\nI take the cup you kindly reach, Thanks and prosperity to each! (The crowd\r\ngather round in a circle.)\r\nOld Peasant\r\nAy, truly! 'tis well done, that you Our festive meeting thus attend; You, who in\r\nevil days of yore, So often show'd yourself our friend! Full many a one stands\r\nliving here, Who from the fever's deadly blast, Your father rescu'd, when his\r\nskill The fatal sickness stay'd at last. A young man then, each house you\r\nsought, Where reign'd the mortal pestilence. Corpse after corpse was carried\r\nforth, But still unscath'd you issued thence. Sore then your trials and severe;\r\nThe Helper yonder aids the helper here.\r\nAll\r\nHeaven bless the trusty friend, and long To help the poor his life prolong!\r\nFaust\r\nTo Him above in homage bend, Who prompts the helper and Who help doth\r\nsend. (He proceeds with Wagner.)\r\nWagner\r\nWhat feelings, great man, must thy breast inspire, At homage paid thee by this\r\ncrowd! Thrice blest Who from the gifts by him possessed Such benefit can\r\ndraw! The sire Thee to his boy with reverence shows; They press around,\r\ninquire, advance, Hush'd is the fiddle, check'd the dance. Where thou dost\r\npass they stand in rows, And each aloft his bonnet throws, But little fails and\r\nthey to thee, As though the Host came by, would bend the knee.\r\nFaust\r\nA few steps further, up to yonder stone! Here rest we from our walk. In times\r\nlong past, Absorb'd in thought, here oft I sat alone, And disciplin'd myself\r\nwith prayer and fast. Then rich in hope, with faith sincere, With sighs, and\r\nhands in anguish press'd, The end of that sore plague, with many a tear, From\r\nheaven's dread Lord, I sought to wrest. The crowd's applause assumes a\r\nscornful tone. Oh, could'st thou in my inner being read, How little either sire\r\nor son, Of such renown deserves the meed! My sire, of good repute, and\r\nsombre mood, O'er nature's powers and every mystic zone, With honest zeal,\r\nbut methods of his own, With toil fantastic loved to brood; His time in dark\r\nalchemic cell, With brother adepts he would spend, And there antagonists\r\ncompel, Through numberless receipts to blend. A ruddy lion there, a suitor\r\nbold, In tepid bath was with the lily wed. Thence both, while open flames\r\naround them roll'd, Were tortur'd to another bridal bed. Was then the youthful\r\nqueen descried With varied colours in the flask; This was our medicine; the\r\npatients died, \"Who were restored?\" none cared to ask. With our infernal\r\nmixture thus, ere long, These hills and peaceful vales among, We rag'd more\r\nfiercely than the pest; Myself the deadly poison did to thousands give; They\r\npined away, I yet must live, To hear the reckless murderers blest.\r\nWagner\r\nWhy let this thought your soul o'ercast? Can man do more than with nice skill,\r\nWith firm and conscientious will, Practise the art transmitted from the past? If\r\nthou thy sire dost honour in thy youth, His lore thou gladly wilt receive; In\r\nmanhood, dost thou spread the bounds of truth, Then may thy son a higher\r\ngoal achieve.\r\nFaust\r\nHow blest, in whom the fond desire From error's sea to rise, hope still\r\nrenews! What a man knows not, that he doth require, And what he knoweth,\r\nthat he cannot use. But let not moody thoughts their shadow throw O'er the\r\ncalm beauty of this hour serene! In the rich sunset see how brightly glow Yon\r\ncottage homes, girt round with verdant green! Slow sinks the orb, the day in\r\nnow no more; Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life. Oh for a pinion from the\r\nearth to soar, And after, ever after him to strive! Then should I see the world\r\nbelow, Bathed in the deathless evening - beams, The vales reposing, every\r\nheight a - glow, The silver brooklets meeting golden streams. The savage\r\nmountain, with its cavern'd side, Bars not my godlike progress. Lo, the ocean,\r\nIts warm bays heaving with a tranquil motion, To my rapt vision opes its\r\nample tide! But now at length the god appears to sink; A new - born impulse\r\nwings my flight, Onward I press, his quenchless light to drink, The day before\r\nme, and behind the night, The pathless waves beneath, and over me the skies.\r\nFair dream, it vanish'd with the parting day! Alas! that when on spirit - wing\r\nwe rise, No wing material lifts our mortal clay. But 'tis our inborn impulse,\r\ndeep and strong, Upwards and onwards still to urge our flight, When far\r\nabove us pours its thrilling song The sky - lark, lost in azure light, When on\r\nextended wing amain O'er pine - crown'd height the eagle soars, And over\r\nmoor and lake, the crane Still striveth towards its native shores.\r\nWagner\r\nTo strange conceits oft I myself must own, But impulse such as this I ne'er\r\nhave known: Nor woods, nor fields, can long our thoughts engage, Their\r\nwings I envy not the feather'd kind; Far otherwise the pleasures of the mind,\r\nBear us from book to book, from page to page! Then winter nights grow\r\ncheerful; keen delight Warms every limb; and ah! when we unroll Some old\r\nand precious parchment, at the sight All heaven itself descends upon the soul.\r\nFaust\r\nThy heart by one sole impulse is possess'd; Unconscious of the other still\r\nremain! Two souls, alas! are lodg'd within my breast, Which struggle there for\r\nundivided reign: One to the world, with obstinate desire, And closely -\r\ncleaving organs, still adheres; Above the mist, the other doth aspire, With\r\nsacred vehemence, to purer spheres. Oh, are there spirits in the air, Who float\r\n'twixt heaven and earth dominion wielding, Stoop hither from your golden\r\natmosphere, Lead me to scenes, new life and fuller yielding! A magic mantle\r\ndid I but possess, Abroad to waft me as on viewless wings, I'd prize it far\r\nbeyond the costliest dress, Nor would I change it for the robe of kings.\r\nAlas, two souls are living in my breast, And one wants to separate itself from\r\nthe other. One holds fast to the world with earthy passion And clings with\r\ntwining tendrils: The other lifts itself with forceful craving To the very roof of\r\nheaven.\r\nWagner\r\nCall not the spirits who on mischief wait! Their troop familiar, streaming\r\nthrough the air, From every quarter threaten man's estate, And danger in a\r\nthousand forms prepare! They drive impetuous from the frozen north, With\r\nfangs sharp - piercing, and keen arrowy tongues; From the ungenial east they\r\nissue forth, And prey, with parching breath, upon thy lungs; If, waft'd on the\r\ndesert's flaming wing, They from the south heap fire upon the brain,\r\nRefreshment from the west at first they bring, Anon to drown thyself and field\r\nand plain. In wait for mischief, they are prompt to hear; With guileful purpose\r\nour behests obey; Like ministers of grace they oft appear, And lisp like\r\nangels, to betray. But let us hence! Grey eve doth all things blend, The air\r\ngrows chill, the mists descend! 'Tis in the evening first our home we prize Why\r\nstand you thus, and gaze with wondering eyes? What in the gloom thus moves\r\nyou?\r\nFaust\r\nYon black hound See'st thou, through corn and stubble scampering round?\r\nWagner\r\nI've mark'd him long, naught strange in him I see!\r\nFaust\r\nNote him! What takest thou the brute to be?\r\nWagner\r\nBut for a poodle, whom his instinct serves His master's track to find once\r\nmore.\r\nFaust\r\nDost mark how round us, with wide spiral curves, He wheels, each circle\r\ncloser than before? And, if I err not, he appears to me A line of fire upon his\r\ntrack to leave.\r\nWagner\r\nNaught but a poodle black of hue I see; 'Tis some illusion doth your sight\r\ndeceive.\r\nFaust\r\nMethinks a magic coil our feet around, He for a future snare doth lightly\r\nspread.\r\nWagner\r\nAround us as in doubt I see him shyly bound, Since he two strangers seeth in\r\nhis master's stead.\r\nFaust\r\nThe circle narrows, he's already near!\r\nWagner\r\nA dog dost see, no spectre have we here; He growls, doubts, lays him on his\r\nbelly, too, And wags his tail - as dogs are wont to do.\r\nFaust\r\nCome hither, Sirrah! join our company!\r\nWagner\r\nA very poodle, he appears to be! Thou standest still, for thee he'll wait; Thou\r\nspeak'st to him, he fawns upon thee straight; Aught thou mayst lose, again he'll\r\nbring, And for thy stick will into water spring.\r\nFaust\r\nThou'rt right indeed; no traces now I see Whatever of a spirit's agency. 'Tis\r\ntraining - nothing more.\r\nWagner\r\nA dog well taught E'en by the wisest of us may be sought. Ay, to your favour\r\nhe's entitled too, Apt scholar of the students, 'tis his due! (They enter the gate\r\nof the town.)\r\nFaust Meets With Mephistopheles\r\nStudy\r\nFaust (entering with the poodle)\r\nNow field and meadow I've forsaken; O'er them deep night her veil doth\r\ndraw; In us the better soul doth waken, With feelings of foreboding awe, All\r\nlawless promptings, deeds unholy, Now slumber, and all wild desires; The\r\nlove of man doth sway us wholly, And love to God the soul inspires.\r\nPeace, poodle, peace! Scamper not thus; obey me! Why at the threshold\r\nsnuffest thou so? Behind the stove now quietly lay thee, My softest cushion to\r\nthee I'll throw. As thou, without, didst please and amuse me Running and\r\nfrisking about on the hill, So tendance now I will not refuse thee; A welcome\r\nguest, if thou'lt be still.\r\nAh! when the friendly taper gloweth, Once more within our narrow cell, Then\r\nin the heart itself that knoweth, A light the darkness doth dispel. Reason her\r\nvoice resumes; returneth Hope's gracious bloom, with promise rife; For\r\nstreams of life the spirit yearneth, Ah! for the very fount of life.\r\nPoodle, snarl not! with the tone that arises, Hallow'd and peaceful, my soul\r\nwithin, Accords not thy growl, thy bestial din. We find it not strange, that man\r\ndespises What he conceives not; That he the good and fair misprizes Finding\r\nthem often beyond his ken; Will the dog snarl at them like men?\r\nBut ah! Despite my will, it stands confessed, Contentment welleth up no\r\nlonger in my breast. Yet wherefore must the stream, alas, so soon be dry,\r\nThat we once more athirst should lie? Full oft this sad experience hath been\r\nmine; Nathless the want admits of compensation; For things above the earth\r\nwe learn to pine, Our spirits yearn for revelation, Which nowhere burns with\r\npurer beauty blent, Than here in the New Testament. To ope the ancient text\r\nan impulse strong Impels me, and its sacred lore, With honest purpose to\r\nexplore, And render into my love German tongue.\r\n(He opens a volume, and applies himself to it.)\r\n'Tis writ, \"In the beginning was the Word!\" I pause, perplex'd! Who now will\r\nhelp afford? I cannot the mere Word so highly prize; I must translate it\r\notherwise, If by the spirit guided as I read. \"In the beginning was the Sense!\"\r\nTake heed, The import of this primal sentence weigh, Lest thy too hasty pen\r\nbe led astray! Is force creative then of Sense the dower? \"In the beginning\r\nwas the Power!\" Thus should it stand: yet, while the line I trace, A something\r\nwarns me, once more to efface. The spirit aids! from anxious scruples freed, I\r\nwrite, \"In the beginning was the Deed!\"\r\nAm I with thee my room to share, Poodle, thy barking now forbear, Forbear\r\nthy howling! Comrade so noisy, ever growling, I cannot suffer here to dwell.\r\nOne or the other, mark me well, Forthwith must leave the cell. I'm loath the\r\nguest - right to withhold; The door's ajar, the passage clear; But what must\r\nnow mine eyes behold! Are nature's laws suspended here? Real is it, or a\r\nphantom show? In length and breadth how doth my poodle grow! He lifts\r\nhimself with threat'ning mien, In likeness of a dog no longer seen! What\r\nspectre have I harbour'd thus! Huge as a hippopotamus, With fiery eye,\r\nterrific tooth! Ah! now I know thee, sure enough! For such a base, half -\r\nhellish brood, The key of Solomon is good.\r\nSpirits (without)\r\nCaptur'd there within is one! Stay without and follow none! Like a fox in iron\r\nsnare, Hell's old lynx is quaking there,\r\nBut take heed! Hover round, above, below,\r\nTo and fro, Then from durance is he freed! Can ye aid him, spirits all, Leave\r\nhim not in mortal thrall! Many a time and oft hath he Served us, when at\r\nliberty.\r\nFaust\r\nThe monster to confront, at first, The spell of Four must be rehears'd;\r\nSalamander shall kindle, Writhe nymph of the wave, In air sylph shall dwindle,\r\nAnd Kobold shall slave.\r\nWho doth ignore The primal Four, Nor knows aright Their use and might,\r\nO'er spirits will he Ne'er master be!\r\nVanish in the fiery glow, Salamander! Rushingly together flow. Undine!\r\nShimmer in the meteor's gleam, Sylphide! Hither bring thine homely aid,\r\nIncubus! Incubus! Step forth! I do adjure thee thus! None of the Four Lurks\r\nin the beast: He grins at me, untroubled as before; I have not hurt him in the\r\nleast. A spell of fear Thou now shalt hear. Art thou, comrade fell, Fugitive\r\nfrom Hell? See then this sign, Before which incline The murky troops of Hell!\r\nWith bristling hair now doth the creature swell.\r\nCanst thou, reprobate, Read the uncreate, Unspeakable, diffused Throughout\r\nthe heavenly sphere, Shamefully abused, Transpierced with nail and spear!\r\nBehind the stove, tam'd by my spells, Like an elephant he swells; Wholly now\r\nhe fills the room, He into mist will melt away. Ascend not to the ceiling!\r\nCome, Thyself at the master's feet now lay! Thou seest that mine is no idle\r\nthreat. With holy fire I will scorch thee yet! Wait not the might That lies in the\r\ntriple - glowing light! Wait not the might Of all my arts in fullest measure!\r\nMephistopheles\r\n(As the mist sinks, comes forward from behind the stove, in the dress of a\r\ntravelling scholar) Why all this uproar? What's the master's pleasure?\r\nFaust\r\nThis then the kernel of the brute! A traveling scholar? Why I needs must\r\nsmile.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nYour learned reverence humbly I salute! You've made me swelter in a pretty\r\nstyle.\r\nFaust\r\nThy name?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThe question trifling seems from one, Who it appears the Word doth rate so\r\nlow; Who, undeluded by mere outward show, To Being's depths would\r\npenetrate alone.\r\nFaust\r\nWith gentlemen like you indeed The inward essence from the name we read,\r\nAs all too plainly it doth appear, When Beelzebub, Destroyer, Liar, meets the\r\near. Who then art thou?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nPart of that power which still Produceth good, whilst ever scheming ill.\r\nFaust\r\nWhat hidden mystery in this riddle lies?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThe spirit I, which evermore denies! And justly; for whate'er to light is brought\r\nDeserves again to be reduced to naught; Then better 'twere that naught should\r\nbe. Thus all the elements which ye Destruction, Sin, or briefly, Evil, name, As\r\nmy peculiar element I claim.\r\nFaust\r\nThou nam'st thyself a part, and yet a whole I see.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThe modest truth I speak to thee. Though folly's microcosm, man, it seems,\r\nHimself to be a perfect whole esteems: Part of the part am I, which at the first\r\nwas all, A part of darkness, which gave birth to light, Proud light, who now\r\nhis mother would enthrall, Contesting space and ancient rank with night. Yet\r\nhe succeedeth not, for struggle as he will, To forms material he adhereth still;\r\nFrom them he streameth, them he maketh fair, And still the progress of his\r\nbeams they check; And so, I trust, when comes the final wreck, Light will, ere\r\nlong, the doom of matter share.\r\nFaust\r\nThy worthy avocation now I guess! Wholesale annihilation won't prevail, So\r\nthou'rt beginning on a smaller scale.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAnd, to say truth, as yet with small success. Oppos'd to naught, this clumsy\r\nworld, The something - it subsisteth still; Not yet is it to ruin hurl'd, Despite\r\nthe efforts of my will. Tempests and earthquakes, fire and flood, I've tried;\r\nYet land and ocean still unchang'd abide! And then of humankind and beasts,\r\nthe accursed brood, Neither o'er them can I extend my sway. What countless\r\nmyriads have I swept away! Yet ever circulates the fresh young blood. It is\r\nenough to drive me to despair! As in the earth, in water, and in air, A\r\nthousand germs burst forth spontaneously; In moisture, drought, heat, cold,\r\nthey still appear! Had I not flame selected as my sphere Nothing apart had\r\nbeen reversed for me.\r\nFaust\r\nSo thou with thy cold devil's fist Still clench'd in malice impotent Dost the\r\ncreative power resist, The active, the beneficent! Henceforth some other task\r\nessay, Of Chaos thou the wondrous son!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWe will consider what you say, And talk about it more anon! For this time\r\nhave I leave to go?\r\nFaust\r\nWhy thou shouldst ask, I cannot see. Since thee I now have learned to know,\r\nAt thy good pleasure, visit me. Here is the window, here the door, The\r\nchimney, too, may serve thy need.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nI must confess, my stepping o'er Thy threshold a slight hindrance doth\r\nimpede; The wizard - foot doth me retain.\r\nFaust\r\nThe pentagram thy peace doth mar? To me, thou son of hell, explain, How\r\ncamest thou in, if this thine exit bar? Could such a spirit aught ensnare?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nObserve it well, it is not drawn with care, One of the angles, that which points\r\nwithout, Is, as thou seest, not quite closed.\r\nFaust\r\nChance hath the matter happily dispos'd! So thou my captive art? No doubt!\r\nBy accident thou thus art caught!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nIn sprang the dog, indeed, observing naught; Things now assume another\r\nshape, The devil's in the house and can't escape.\r\nFaust\r\nWhy through the window not withdraw?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nFor ghosts and for the devil 'tis a law. Where they stole in, there they must\r\nforth. We're free The first to choose; as to the second, slaves are we.\r\nFaust\r\nE'en hell hath its peculiar laws, I see! I'm glad of that! a pact may then be\r\nmade, The which you gentlemen will surely keep?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWhat e'er therein is promised thou shalt reap, No tittle shall remain unpaid.\r\nBut such arrangements time require; We'll speak of them when next we meet;\r\nMost earnestly I now entreat, This once permission to retire.\r\nFaust\r\nAnother moment prithee here remain, Me with some happy word to pleasure.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nNow let me go! ere long I'll come again, Then thou may'st question at thy\r\nleisure.\r\nFaust\r\n'Twas not my purpose thee to lime; The snare hast entered of thine own free\r\nwill: Let him who holds the devil, hold him still! So soon he'll catch him not a\r\nsecond time.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nIf it so please thee, I'm at thy command; Only on this condition, understand;\r\nThat worthily thy leisure to beguile, I here may exercise my arts awhile.\r\nFaust\r\nThou'rt free to do so! Gladly I'll attend; But be thine art a pleasant one!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nMy friend,\r\nThis hour enjoyment more intense, Shall captivate each ravish'd sense, Than\r\nthou could'st compass in the bound Of the whole year's unvarying round; And\r\nwhat the dainty spirits sing, The lovely images they bring. Are no fantastic\r\nsorcery. Rich odours shall regale your smell, On choicest sweets your palate\r\ndwell, Your feelings thrill with ecstasy. No preparation do we need, Here we\r\ntogether are. Proceed.\r\nSpirits\r\nHence overshadowing gloom, Vanish from sight! O'er us thine azure dome,\r\nBend, beauteous light! Dark clouds that o'er us spread, Melt in thin air! Stars,\r\nyour soft radiance shed, Tender and fair. Girt with celestial might, Winging\r\ntheir airy flight, Spirits are thronging. Follows their forms of light Infinite\r\nlonging! Flutter their vestures bright O'er field and grove! Where in their leafy\r\nbower Lovers the livelong hour Vow deathless love. Soft bloometh bud and\r\nbower! Bloometh the grove! Grapes from the spreading vine Crown the full\r\nmeasure; Fountains of foaming wine Gush from the pressure. Still where the\r\ncurrents wind, Gems brightly gleam. Leaving the hills behind On rolls the\r\nstream; Now into ample seas, Spreadeth the flood; Laving the sunny leas,\r\nMantled with wood. Rapture the feather'd throng, Gaily careering, Sip as they\r\nfloat along; Sunward they're steering; On towards the isles of light Winging\r\ntheir way, That on the waters bright Dancingly play. Hark to the choral strain,\r\nJoyfully ringing! While on the grassy plain Dancers are springing; Climbing the\r\nsteep hill's side, Skimming the glassy tide, Wander they there; Others on\r\npinions wide Wing the blue air; All lifeward tending, upward still wending,\r\nTowards yonder stars that gleam, Far, far above; Stars from whose tender\r\nbeam Rains blissful love.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWell done, my dainty spirits! now he slumbers! Ye have entranc'd him fairly\r\nwith your numbers! This minstrelsy of yours I must repay, Thou art not yet the\r\nman to hold the devil fast! With fairest shapes your spells around him cast,\r\nAnd plunge him in a sea of dreams! But that this charm be rent, the threshold\r\npassed, Tooth of rat the way must clear. I need not conjure long it seems,\r\nOne rustles hitherward, and soon my voice will hear. The master of the rats\r\nand mice, Of flies and frogs, of bugs and lice, Commands thy presence;\r\nwithout fear Come forth and gnaw the threshold here, Where he with oil has\r\nsmear'd it. - Thou Com'st hopping forth already! Now To work! The point\r\nthat holds me bound Is in the outer angle found. Another bite - so - now 'tis\r\ndoneNow, Faustus, till we meet again, dream on.\r\nFaust (awaking)\r\nAm I once more deluded! must I deem That thus the throng of spirits\r\ndisappear? The devil's presence, was it but a dream? Hath but a poodle\r\nscap'd and left me here?\r\nFaust And Mephistopheles - A Student\r\nStudy\r\nFaust\r\nA knock? Come in! Who now would break my rest?\r\nMephistopheles\r\n'Tis I!\r\nFaust\r\nCome in!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThrice be the words express'd.\r\nFaust\r\nThen I repeat, Come in! Mephistopheles\r\n'Tis well, I hope that we shall soon agree! For now your fancies to expel,\r\nHere, as a youth of high degree, I come in gold - lac'd scarlet vest, And stiff -\r\nsilk mantle richly dress'd, A cock's gay feather for a plume, A long and\r\npointed rapier, too; And briefly I would counsel you To don at once the same\r\ncostume, And, free from trammels, speed away, That what life is you may\r\nessay.\r\nFaust\r\nIn every garb I needs must feel oppress'd, My heart to earth's low cares a\r\nprey. Too old the trifler's part to play, Too young to live by no desire\r\npossess'd. What can the world to me afford? Renounce! renouce! is still the\r\nword; This is the everlasting song In every ear that ceaseless rings, And\r\nwhich, alas, our whole life long, Hoarsely each passing moment sings. But to\r\nnew horror I awake each morn, And I could weep hot tears, to see the sun\r\nDawn on another day, whose round forlorn Accomplishes no wish of mine -\r\nnot one. Which still, with froward captiousness, impains E'en the presentiment\r\nof every joy, While low realities and paltry cares The spirit's fond imaginings\r\ndestroy. Then must I too, when falls the veil of night, Stretch'd on my pallet\r\nlanguish in despair, Appalling dreams my soul affright; No rest vouchsafed me\r\neven there. The god, who throned within my breast resides, Deep in my soul\r\ncan stir the springs; With sovereign sway my energies he guides, He cannot\r\nmove external things; And so existence is to me a weight. Death fondly I\r\ndesire, and life I hate.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAnd yet, methinks, by most 'twill be confess'd That Death is never quite a\r\nwelcome guest.\r\nFaust\r\nHappy the man around whose brow he binds The bloodstain'd wreath in\r\nconquest's dazzling hour; Or whom, excited by the dance, he finds Dissolv'd\r\nin bliss, in love's delicious bower! O that before the lofty spirit's might,\r\nEnraptured, I had rendered up my soul!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nYet did a certain man refrain one night, Of its brown juice to drain the crystal\r\nbowl.\r\nFaust\r\nTo play the spy diverts you then?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nI own, Though not omniscient, much to me is known.\r\nFaust\r\nIf o'er my soul the tone familiar, stealing, Drew me from harrowing thought's\r\nbewild'ring maze, Touching the ling'ring chords of childlike feeling, With sweet\r\nharmonies of happier days: So curse I all, around the soul that windeth Its\r\nmagic and alluring spell, And with delusive flattery bindeth Its victim to this\r\ndreary cell! Curs'd before all things be the high opinion, Wherewith the spirit\r\ngirds itself around! Of shows delusive curs'd be the dominion, Within whose\r\nmocking sphere our sense is bound! Accurs'd of dreams the treacherous\r\nwiles, The cheat of glory, deathless fame! Accurs'd what each as property\r\nbeguiles, Wife, child, slave, plough, whate'er its name! Accurs'd be mammon,\r\nwhen with treasure He doth to daring deeds incite: Or when to steep the soul\r\nin pleasure, He spreads the couch of soft delight! Curs'd be the grape's\r\nbalsamic juice! Accurs'd love's dream, of joys the first! Accurs'd be hope!\r\naccurs'd be faith! And more than all, be patience curs'd!\r\nChorus of Spirits (invisible)\r\nWoe! Woe! Thou hast destroy'd The beautiful world With violent blow; 'Tis\r\nshiver'd! 'tis shatter'd! The fragments abroad by a demigod scatter'd! Now\r\nwe sweep The wrecks into nothingness! Fondly we weep The beauty that's\r\ngone! Thou, 'mongst the sons of earth, Lofty and mighty one, Build it once\r\nmore! In thine own bosom the lost world restore! Now with unclouded sense\r\nEnter a new career; Songs shall salute thine ear, Ne'er heard before!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nMy little ones these spirits be. Hark! with shrewd intelligence, How they\r\nrecommend to thee Action, and the joys of sense! In the busy world to dwell,\r\nFain they would allure thee hence: For within this lonely cell, Stagnate sap of\r\nlife and sense.\r\nForbear to trifle longer with thy grief, Which, vulture - like, consumes thee in\r\nthis den. The worst society is some relief, Making thee feel thyself a man with\r\nmen. Nathless, it is not meant, I trow, To thrust thee 'mid the vulgar throng. I\r\nto the upper ranks do not belong; Yet if, by me companion'd, thou Thy steps\r\nthrough life forthwith wilt take, Upon the spot myself I'll make Thy comrade;\r\nShould it suit thy need, I am thy servant, am thy slave indeed!\r\nFaust\r\nAnd how must I thy services repay?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThereto thou lengthen'd repite hast!\r\nFaust\r\nNo! No! The devil is an egoist I know: And, for Heaven's sake, 'tis not his\r\nway Kindness to any one to show. Let the condition plainly be exprest! Such\r\na domestic is a dangerous guest.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nI'll pledge myself to be thy servant here, Still at thy back alert and prompt to\r\nbe; But when together yonder we appear, Then shalt thou do the same for\r\nme.\r\nFaust\r\nBut small concern I feel for yonder world; Hast thou this system into ruin\r\nhurl'd, Another may arise the void to fill. This earth the fountain whence my\r\npleasures flow, This sun doth daily shine upon my woe, And if this world I\r\nmust forego, Let happen then, - what can and will. I to this theme will close\r\nmine ears, If men hereafter hate and love, And if there be in yonder spheres A\r\ndepth below or height above.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nIn this mood thou mayst venture it. But make The compact! I at once will\r\nundertake To charm thee with mine arts. I'll give thee more Than mortal eye\r\nhath e'er beheld before.\r\nFaust\r\nWhat, sorry Devil, hast thou to bestow? Was ever mortal spirit, in its high\r\nendeavour, Fathom'd by Being such as thou? Yet food thou hast which\r\nsatisfieth never, Hast ruddy gold, that still doth flow Like restless quicksilver\r\naway, A game thou hast, at which none win who play, A girl who would, with\r\namorous eyen, E'en from my breast, a neighbour snare, Lofty ambition's joy\r\ndivine, That, meteor - like, dissolves in air. Show me the fruit that, ere 'tis\r\npluck'd, doth rot, And trees, whose verdure daily buds anew!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nSuch a commission scares me not, I can provide such treasures, it is true; But,\r\nmy good friend, a season will come round, When on what's good we may\r\nregale in peace.\r\nFaust\r\nIf e'er upon my couch, stretched at my ease, I'm found, Then may my life that\r\ninstant cease! Me canst thou cheat with glozing wile Till self - reproach away I\r\ncast, Me with joy's lure canst thou beguile; Let that day be for me the last! Be\r\nthis our wager!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nSettled!\r\nFaust\r\nSure and fast! When to the moment I shall say, \"Linger awhile! so fair thou\r\nart!\" Then mayst thou fetter me straightway, Then to the abyss will I depart!\r\nThen may the solemn death - bell sound, Then from thy service thou art free,\r\nThe index then may cease its round. And time be never more for me!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nI shall remember: pause, ere 'tis too late.\r\nFaust\r\nThereto a perfect right hast thou. My strength I do not rashly overrate. Slave\r\nam I here, at any rate, If thine, or whose, it matters not, I trow.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAt thine inaugural feast I will this day Attend, my duties to commence. But\r\none thing! - Accidents may happen, hence A line or two in writing grant, I\r\npray.\r\nFaust\r\nA writing, Pedant! dost demand from me? Man, and man's plighted word, are\r\nthese unknown to thee? Is't not enough, that by the word I gave, My doom\r\nfor evermore is cast? Doth not the world in all its currents rave, And must a\r\npromise hold me fast? Yet fixed is this delusion in our heart; Who, of his own\r\nfree will, therefrom would part? How blest within whose breast truth reigneth\r\npure! No sacrifice will he repent when made! A formal deed, with seal and\r\nsignature, A spectre this from which all shrink afraid. The word its life\r\nresigneth in the pen, Leather and wax usurp the mastery then. Spirits of evil!\r\nwhat dost thou require? Brass, marble, parchment, paper, dost desire? Shall I\r\nwith chisel, pen, or graver write? Thy choice is free; to me 'tis all the same.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWherefore thy passion so excite And thus thine eloquence inflame? A scrap is\r\nfor our compact good. Thou under - signest merely with a drop of blood.\r\nFaust\r\nIf this will satisfy thy mind, Thy whim I'll gratify, howe'er absurd.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nBlood is a juice of very special kind.\r\nFaust\r\nBe not afraid that I shall break my word! The scope of all my energy Is in\r\nexact accordance with my vow. Vainly I have aspired too high; I'm on a level\r\nbut with such as thou; Me the great spirit scorn'd, defied; Nature from me\r\nherself doth hide; Rent is the web of thought; my mind Doth knowledge loathe\r\nof every kind. In depths of sensual pleasure drown'd, Let us our fiery passions\r\nstill! Enwrapp'd in magic's veil profound, Let wondrous charms our senses\r\nthrill! Plunge we in time's tempestuous flow, Stem we the rolling surge of\r\nchance! There may alternate weal and woe, Success and failure, as they can,\r\nMingle and shift in changeful dance! Excitement is the sphere for man.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nNor goal, nor measure is prescrib'd to you, If you desire to taste of every\r\nthing, To snatch at joy while on the wing, May your career amuse and profit\r\ntoo! Only fall to and don't be over coy!\r\nFaust\r\nHearken! The end I aim at is not joy; I crave excitement, agonizing bliss,\r\nEnamour'd hatred, quickening vexation. Purg'd from the love of knowledge,\r\nmy vocation, The scope of all my powers henceforth be this, To bare my\r\nbreast to every pang, - to know In my heart's core all human weal and woe,\r\nTo grasp in thought the lofty and the deep, Men's various fortunes on my\r\nbreast to heap, And thus to theirs dilate my individual mind, And share at\r\nlength with them the shipwreck of mankind.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nOh, credit me, who still as ages roll, Have chew'd this bitter fare from year to\r\nyear, No mortal, from the cradle to the bier, Digests the ancient leaven!\r\nKnow, this Whole Doth for the Deity alone subsist! He in eternal brightness\r\ndoth exist, Us unto darkness he hath brought, and here Where day and night\r\nalternate, is your sphere.\r\nFaust\r\nBut 'tis my will!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWell spoken, I admit! But one thing puzzles me, my friend; Time's short, art\r\nlong; methinks 'twere fit That you to friendly counsel should attend. A poet\r\nchoose as your ally! Let him thought's wide dominion sweep, Each good and\r\nnoble quality, Upon your honoured brow to heap; The lion's magnanimity,\r\nThe fleetness of the hind, The fiery blood of Italy, The Northern's steadfast\r\nmind. Let him to you the mystery show To blend high aims and cunning low;\r\nAnd while youth's passions are aflame To fall in love by rule and plan! I fain\r\nwould meet with such a man; Would him Sir Microcosmus name.\r\nFaust\r\nWhat then am I, if I aspire in vain The crown of our humanity to gain,\r\nTowards which my every sense doth strain?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThou'rt after all - just what thou art. Put on thy head a wig with countless\r\nlocks, And to a cubit's height upraise thy socks, Still thou remainest ever,\r\nwhat thou art.\r\nFaust\r\nI fell it, I have heap'd upon my brain The gather'd treasure of man's thought in\r\nvain; And when at length from studious toil I rest, No power, new - born,\r\nsprings up within my breast; A hair's breadth is not added to my height, I am\r\nno nearer to the infinite.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nGood sir, these things you view indeed, Just as by other men they're view'd;\r\nWe must more cleverly proceed, Before life's joys our grasp elude. The devil!\r\nthou hast hands and feet, And head and heart are also thine; What I enjoy\r\nwith relish sweet, Is it on that account less mine? If for six stallions I can pay,\r\nDo I not own their strength and speed? A proper man I dash away, As their\r\ntwo dozen legs were mine indeed. Up then, from idle pondering free, And\r\nforth into the world with me! I tell you what; - your speculative churl Is like a\r\nbeast which some ill spirit leads, On barren wilderness, in ceaseless whirl,\r\nWhile all around lie fair and verdant meads.\r\nFaust\r\nBut how shall we begin?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWe will go hence with speed, A place of torment this indeed! A precious life,\r\nthyself to bore, And some few youngster evermore! Leave that to neighbour\r\nPaunch! - withdraw, Why wilt thou plague thyself with thrashing straw? The\r\nvery best that thou dost know Thou dar'st not to the striplings show. One in\r\nthe passage now doth wait!\r\nFaust\r\nI'm in no mood to see him now.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nPoor lad! He must be tired, I trow; He must not go disconsolate. Hand me\r\nthy cap and gown; the mask Is for my purpose quite first rate. (He changes\r\nhis dress.) Now leave it to my wit! I ask But quarter of an hour; meanwhile\r\nequip, And make all ready for our pleasant trip!\r\n(Exit Faust.)\r\nMephistopheles And A Student\r\nMephistopheles (in Faust's long gown)\r\nMortal! the loftiest attributes of men, Reason and Knowledge, only thus\r\ncontemn, Still let the Prince of lies, without control, With shows, and mocking\r\ncharms delude thy soul, I have thee unconditionally then! Fate hath endow'd\r\nhim with an ardent mind, Which unrestrain'd still presses on for ever, And\r\nwhose precipitate endeavour Earth's joys o'erleaping, leaveth them behind.\r\nHim will I drag through life's wild waste, Through scenes of vapid dulness,\r\nwhere at last Bewilder'd, he shall falter, and stick fast; And, still to mock his\r\ngreedy haste, Viands and drink shall float his craving lips beyond Vainly he'll\r\nseek refreshment, anguish - tost, And were he not the devil's by his bond, Yet\r\nmust his soul infallibly be lost!\r\nA Student enters\r\nStudent\r\nBut recently I've quitted home, Full of devotion am I come A man to know\r\nand hear, whose name With reverence is known to fame.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nYour courtesy much flatters me! A man like other men you see; Pray have\r\nyou yet applied elsewhere?\r\nStudent\r\nI would entreat your friendly care! I've youthful blood and courage high; Of\r\ngold I bring a fair supply; To let me go my mother was not fain; But here I\r\nlonged true knowledge to attain.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nYou've hit upon the very place.\r\nStudent\r\nAnd yet my steps I would retrace. These walls, this melancholy room,\r\nO'erpower me with a sense of gloom; The space is narrow, nothing green, No\r\nfriendly tree is to be seen: And in these halls, with benches filled, distraught,\r\nSight, hearing fail me, and the power of thought.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nIt all depends on habit. Thus at first The infant takes not kindly to the breast,\r\nBut before long, its eager thirst Is fain to slake with hearty zest: Thus at the\r\nbreasts of wisdom day by day With keener relish you'll your thirst allay.\r\nStudent\r\nUpon her neck I fain would hang with joy; To reach it, say, what means must\r\nI employ?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nExplain, ere further time we lose, What special faculty you choose?\r\nStudent\r\nProfoundly learned I would grow, What heaven contains would comprehend,\r\nO'er earth's wide realm my gaze extend, Nature and science I desire to know.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nYour are upon the proper track, I find; Take heed, let nothing dissipate your\r\nmind.\r\nStudent\r\nMy heart and soul are in the chase! Though to be sure I fain would seize, On\r\npleasant summer holidays, A little liberty and careless ease.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nUse well your time, so rapidly it flies; Method will teach you time to win;\r\nHence, my young friend, I would advise, With college logic to begin! Then\r\nwill your mind be so well braced, In Spanish boots so tightly laced, That on\r\n'twill circumspectly creep, Thought's beaten track securely keep, Nor will it,\r\nignis - fatuus like, Into the path of error strike. Then many a day they'll teach\r\nyou how The mind's spontaneous acts, till now As eating and as drinking free,\r\nRequire a process; - one! two! three! In truth the subtle web of thought Is like\r\nthe weaver's fabric wrought: One treadle moves a thousand lines, Swift dart\r\nthe shuttles to and fro, Unseen the threads together flow, A thousand knots\r\none stroke combines. Then forward steps your sage to show, And prove to\r\nyou, it must be so; The first being so, and so the second, The third and fourth\r\ndeduc'd we see; And if there were no first and second, Nor third nor fourth\r\nwould ever be. This, scholars of all countries prize, Yet 'mong themselves no\r\nweavers rise. He who would know and treat of aught alive, Seeks first the\r\nliving spirit thence to drive: Then are the lifeless fragments in his hand, There\r\nonly fails, alas! the spirit - band. This process, chemists name, in learned\r\nthesis, Mocking themselves, Naturae encheiresis.\r\nStudent\r\nYour words I cannot full comprehend.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nIn a short time you will improve, my friend, When of scholastic forms you\r\nlearn the use; And how by method all things to reduce.\r\nStudent\r\nSo doth all this my brain confound, As if a mill - wheel there were turning\r\nround.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAnd next, before aught else you learn, You must with zeal to metaphysics\r\nturn! There see that you profoundly comprehend, What doth the limit of man's\r\nbrain transcend; For that which is or is not in the head A sounding phrase will\r\nserve you in good stead. But before all strive this half year From one fix'd\r\norder ne'er to swerve! Five lectures daily you must hear; The hour still\r\npunctually observe! Yourself with studious zeal prepare, And closely in your\r\nmanual look, Hereby may you be quite aware That all he utters standeth in the\r\nbook; Yet write away without cessation, As at the Holy Ghost's dictation!\r\nStudent\r\nThis, Sir, a second time you need not say! Your counsel I appreciate quite;\r\nWhat we possess in black and white, We can in peace and comfort bear\r\naway.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nA faculty I pray you name.\r\nStudent\r\nFor jurisprudence, some distaste I own.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nTo me this branch of science is well known, And hence I cannot your\r\nrepugnance blame. Customs and laws in every place, Like a disease, an heir -\r\nloom dread, Still trail their curse from race to race, And furtively abroad they\r\nspread. To nonsense, reason's self they turn; Beneficence becomes a pest;\r\nWoe unto thee, that thou'rt a grandson born! As for the law born with us,\r\nunexpressed; That law, alas, none careth to discern.\r\nStudent\r\nYou deepen my dislike. The youth Whom you instruct, is blest in sooth! To\r\ntry theology I feel inclined.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nI would not lead you willingly astray, But as regards this science, you will find\r\nSo hard it is to shun the erring way, And so much hidden poison lies therein,\r\nWhich scarce can you discern from medicine. Here too it is the best, to listen\r\nbut to one, And by the master's words to swear alone. To sum up all - To\r\nwords hold fast! Then the safe gate securely pass'd, You'll reach the fane of\r\ncertainty at last.\r\nStudent\r\nBut then some meaning must the words convey.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nRight! But o'er - anxious thought, you'll find of no avail, For there precisely\r\nwhere ideas fail, A word comes opportunely into play Most admirable\r\nweapons words are found, On words a system we securely ground, In words\r\nwe can conveniently believe, Nor of a single jot can we a word bereave.\r\nStudent\r\nYour pardon for my importunity; Yet once more must I trouble you: On\r\nmedicine, I'll thank you to supply A pregnant utterance or two! Three years!\r\nhow brief the appointed tide! The field, heaven knows, is all too wide! If but a\r\nfriendly hint be thrown, 'Tis easier then to feel one's way.\r\nMephistopheles (aside)\r\nI'm weary of the dry pedantic tone, And must again the genuine devil play.\r\n(Aloud)\r\nOf medicine the spirit's caught with ease, The great and little world you study\r\nthrough, That things may then their course pursue, As heaven may please. In\r\nvain abroad you range through science' ample space, Each man learns only\r\nthat which learn he can; Who knows the moment to embrace, He is your\r\nproper man. In person you are tolerably made, Nor in assurance will you be\r\ndeficient: Self - confidence acquire, be not afraid, Others will then esteem you\r\na proficient. Learn chiefly with the sex to deal! Their thousands ahs and ohs,\r\nThese the sage doctor knows, He only from one point can heal. Assume a\r\ndecent tone of courteous ease, You have them then to humour as you please.\r\nFirst a diploma must belief infuse, That you in your profession take the lead:\r\nYou then at once those easy freedoms use For which another many a year\r\nmust plead; Learn how to feel with nice address The dainty wrist; - and how\r\nto press, With ardent furtive glance, the slender waist, To feel how tightly it is\r\nlaced.\r\nStudent\r\nThere is some sense in that! one sees the how and why.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nGrey is, young friend, all theory: And green of life the golden tree.\r\nStudent\r\nI swear it seemeth like a dream to me. May I some future time repeat my visit,\r\nTo hear on what your wisdom grounds your views?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nCommand my humble service when you choose.\r\nStudent\r\nEre I retire, one boon I must solicit: Here is my album, do not, Sir, deny This\r\ntoken of your favour!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWillingly!\r\n(He writes and returns the book.)\r\nStudent (reads)\r\nEritis Sicut Deus, Scientes Bonum Et Malum (He reverently closes the book\r\nand retires.)\r\nMephistopheles\r\nLet but this ancient proverb be your rule, My cousin follow still, the wily\r\nsnake, And with your likeness to the gods, poor fool, Ere long be sure your\r\npoor sick heart will quake!\r\nFaust (enters)\r\nWhither away?\r\nMephistopheles\r\n\"Tis thine our course to steer. The little world, and then the great we'll view.\r\nWith what delight, what profit too, Thou'lt revel through thy gay career!\r\nFaust\r\nDespite my length of beard I need The easy manners that insure success; Th'\r\nattempt I fear can ne'er succeed; To mingle in the world I want address; I still\r\nhave an embarrass'd air, and then I feel myself so small with other men.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nTime, my good friend, will all that's needful give; Be only self - possessed, and\r\nthou hast learn'd to live.\r\nFaust\r\nBut how are we to start, I pray? Steeds, servants, carriage, where are they?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWe've but to spread this mantle wide, 'Twill serve whereon through air to\r\nride, No heavy baggage need you take, When we our bold excursion make,\r\nA little gas, which I will soon prepare, Lifts us from earth; aloft through air,\r\nLight laden we shall swiftly steer; I wish you joy of your new life - career.\r\nAuerbach's Cellar In Leipzig\r\nA Drinking Party\r\nFrosch\r\nNo drinking? Naught a laugh to raise? None of your gloomy looks, I pray!\r\nYou, who so bright were wont to blaze, Are dull as wetted straw to - day.\r\nBrander\r\n'Tis all your fault; your part you do not bear, No beastliness, no folly.\r\nFrosch\r\n(pours a glass of wine over his head)\r\nThere, You have them both!\r\nBrander\r\nYou double beast!\r\nFrosch\r\n'Tis what you ask'd me for, at least!\r\nSiebel\r\nWhoever quarrels, turn him out! With open throat drink, roar, and shout.\r\nHollo! Hollo! Ho!\r\nAltmayer\r\nZounds, fellow, cease your deaf'ning cheers! Bring cotton - wool! He splits\r\nmy ears.\r\nSiebel\r\n'Tis when the roof rings back the tone, Then first the full power of the bass is\r\nknown.\r\nFrosch\r\nRight! out with him who takes offence!

Yet 'mong ourselves should\r\none still lord it o'er the rest; That we elect a pope I now suggest.

With little\r\nwit and much content, Each on his own small round intent, Like sportive kitten\r\nwith its tail; While no sick - headache they bewail, And while their host will\r\ncredit give, Joyous and free from care they live.\r\nBrander\r\nThey're off a journey, that is clear, From their strange manners; they have\r\nscarce been here An hour.\r\nFrosch\r\nYou're right!

Only let not your\r\nsamples be too small; For if my judgment you desire, Certes, an ample\r\nmouthful I require.\r\nAltmayer (aside)\r\nI guess they're from the Rhenish land.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nFetch me a gimlet here!\r\nBrander\r\nSay, what therewith to bore? You cannot have the wine - casks at the door?\r\nAltmayer\r\nOur landlord's tool - basket behind doth yonder stand.\r\nMephistopheles (takes the gimlet)\r\n(To Frosch)\r\nNow only say! what liquor will you take?\r\nFrosch\r\nHow mean you that? have you of every sort?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nEach may his own selection make.\r\nAltmayer (to Frosch)\r\nHa! Ha! You lick your lips already at the thought.\r\nFrosch\r\nGood, If I have my choice, the Rhenish I propose; For still the fairest gifts the\r\nfatherland bestows.\r\nMephistopheles\r\n(boring a hole in the edge of the table opposite to where Frosch is sitting)\r\nGive me a little wax - and make some stoppers - quick!\r\nAltmayer\r\nWhy, this is nothing but a juggler's trick!\r\nMephistopheles (to Brander)\r\nAnd you?\r\nBrander\r\nChampagne's the wine for me; Right brisk, and sparkling let it be!\r\n(Mephistopheles bores; one of the party has in the meantime prepared the\r\nwax - stoppers and stopped the holes.)\r\nBrander\r\nWhat foreign is one always can't decline, What's good is often scatter'd far\r\napart. The French your genuine German hates with all his heart, Yet has a\r\nrelish for their wine.\r\nSiebel\r\n(as Mephistopheles approaches him)\r\nI like not acid wine, I must allow, Give ma a glass of genuine sweet!\r\nMephistopheles (bores)\r\nTokay\r\nShall, if you wish it, flow without delay.\r\nAltmayer\r\nCome! look me in the face! no fooling now! You are but making fun of us, I\r\ntrow.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAh! ah! that would indeed be making free With such distinguished guests.\r\nCome, no delay; What liquor can I serve you with, I pray?\r\nAltmayer\r\nOnly be quick, it matters not to me. (After the holes are bored and stopped.)\r\nMephistopheles (with strange gestures)\r\nGrapes the vine - stock bears, Horns the buck - goat wears! Wine is sap, the\r\nvine is wood, The wooden board yields wine as good. With a deeper glance\r\nand true The mysteries of nature view! Have faith and here's a miracle! Your\r\nstoppers draw and drink your fill!\r\nFlowing Wines - Visionary Scenes\r\nAll\r\n(as they draw the stoppers and the wine chosen by each runs into his glass)\r\nOh beauteous spring, which flows so far!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nSpill not a single drop, of this beware!\r\n(They drink repeatedly.)\r\nAll (sing)\r\nHappy as cannibals are we, Or as five hundred swine.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThey're in their glory, mark their elevation!\r\nFaust\r\nLet's hence, nor here our stay prolong.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAttend, of brutishness ere long You'll see a glorious revelation.\r\nSiebel\r\n(drinks carelessly; the wine is spilt upon the ground, and turns to flame)\r\nHelp! fire! help! Hell is burning!\r\nMephistopheles\r\n(addressing the flames)\r\nStop, Kind element, be still, I say!\r\n(To the Company.)\r\nOf purgatorial fire as yet 'tis but a drop.\r\nSiebel\r\nWhat means the knave! For this you'll dearly pay! Us, it appears, you do not\r\nknow.\r\nFrosch\r\nSuch tricks a second time he'd better show!\r\nAltmayer\r\nMethinks'twere well we pack'd him quietly away.\r\nSiebel\r\nWhat, sir! with us your hocus - pocus play!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nSilence, old wine - cask!\r\nSiebel\r\nHow! add insult, too! Vile broomstick!\r\nBrander\r\nHold, or blows shall rain on you!\r\nAltmayer\r\n(draws a stopper out of the table; fire springs out against him)\r\nI burn! I burn!\r\nSiebel\r\n'Tis sorcery, I vow! Strike home! The fellow is fair game, I trow!\r\n(They draw their knives and attack Mephistopheles.)\r\nMephistopheles (with solemn gestures)\r\nVisionary scenes appear! Words delusive cheat the ear! Be ye there, and be\r\nye here!\r\n(They stand amazed and gaze at each other.)\r\nAltmayer\r\nWhere am I? What a beauteous land!\r\nFrosch\r\nVineyards! unless my sight deceives?\r\nSiebel\r\nAnd clust'ring grapes too, close at hand!\r\nBrander\r\nAnd underneath the spreading leaves, What stems there be! What grapes I\r\nsee!\r\n(He seizes Siebel by the nose. The others reciprocally do the same, and raise\r\ntheir knives.)\r\nMephistopheles (as above)\r\nDelusion, from their eyes the bandage take! Note how the devil loves a jest to\r\nbreak!\r\n(He disappears with Faust; the fellows draw back from one another.)\r\nSiebel\r\nWhat was it?\r\nAltmayer\r\nHow?\r\nFrosch\r\nWas that your nose?\r\nBrander (to Siebel)\r\nAnd look, my hand doth thine enclose!\r\nAltmayer\r\nI felt a shock, it went through every limb! A chair! I'm fainting! All things\r\nswim!\r\nFrosch\r\nSay what has happened, what's it all about?\r\nSiebel\r\nWhere is the fellow? Could I scent him out, His body from his soul I'd soon\r\ndivide!\r\nAltmayer\r\nWith my own eyes, upon a cask astride, Forth through the cellar - door I saw\r\nhim ride Heavy as lead my feet are growing.\r\n(Turning to the table.)\r\nI wonder is the wine still flowing!\r\nSiebel\r\n'Twas all delusion, cheat and lie.\r\nFrosch\r\n'Twas wine I drank, most certainly.\r\nBrander\r\nBut with the grapes how was it, pray?\r\nAltmayer\r\nThat none may miracles believe, who now will say?\r\nThe Witch's Kitchen - Faust, Mephistopheles And The Monkies\r\nA large caldron hangs over the fire on a low hearth; various figures appear in\r\nthe vapour rising from it. A Female Monkey sits beside the caldron to skim it,\r\nand watch that it does not boil over. The Male Monkey with the young ones\r\nis seated near, warming himself. The walls and ceiling are adorned with the\r\nstrangest articles of witch - furniture.\r\nFaust, Mephistopheles\r\nFaust\r\nThis senseless, juggling witchcraft I detest! Dost promise that in this foul nest\r\nOf madness, I shall be restored? Must I seek counsel from an ancient dame?\r\nAnd can she, by these rites abhorred, Take thirty winters from my frame?\r\nWoe's me, if thou naught better canst suggest! Hope has already fled my\r\nbreast. Has neither nature nor a noble mind A balsam yet devis'd of any kind?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nMy friend, you now speak sensibly. In truth, Nature a method giveth to renew\r\nthy youth: But in another book the lesson's writ; It forms a curious chapter, I\r\nadmit.\r\nFaust\r\nI fain would know it.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nGood! A remedy Without physician, gold, or sorcery: Away forthwith, and to\r\nthe fields repair, Begin to delve, to cultivate the ground, Thy senses and\r\nthyself confine Within the very narrowest round, Support thyself upon the\r\nsimplest fare, Live like a very brute the brutes among, Neither esteem it\r\nrobbery The acre thou dost reap, thyself to dung; This is the best method,\r\ncredit me, Again at eighty to grow hale and young.\r\nFaust\r\nI am not used to it, nor can myself degrade So far, as in my hand to take the\r\nspade. This narrow life would suit me not at all.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThen we the witch must summon after all.\r\nFaust\r\nWill none but this old beldame do? Canst not thyself the potion brew?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nA pretty play our leisure to beguile! A thousand bridges I could build\r\nmeanwhile. Not science only and consummate art, Patience must also bear\r\nher part. A quiet spirit worketh whole years long; Time only makes the subtle\r\nferment strong. And all things that belong thereto, Are wondrous and\r\nexceeding rare! The devil taught her, it is true; But yet the draught the devil\r\ncan't prepare.\r\n(Perceiving the beasts.)\r\nLook yonder, what a dainty pair! Here is the maid! the knave is there!\r\n(To the beasts)\r\nIt seems your dame is not a home?\r\nThe Monkeys\r\nGone to carouse, Out of the house, Thro' the chimney and away!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nHow long is it her wont to roam?\r\nThe Monkeys\r\nWhile we can warm our paws she'll stay.\r\nMephistopheles (to Faust)\r\nWhat think you of the charming creatures?\r\nFaust\r\nI loathe alike their form and features!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nNay, such discourse, be it confessed, Is just the thing that pleases me the\r\nbest.\r\n(To the Monkeys)\r\nTell me, ye whelps, accursed crew! What stir ye in the broth about?\r\nMonkeys\r\nCoarse beggar's gruel here we stew.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nOf customers you'll have a rout.\r\nThe He - Monkey (approaching and fawning on Mephistopheles)\r\nQuick! quick! throw the dice, Make me rich in a trice, Oh give me the prize!\r\nAlas, for myself! Had I plenty of pelf, I then should be wise.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nHow blest the ape would think himself, if he Could only put into the lottery!\r\n(In the meantime the young Monkeys have been playing with a large globe,\r\nwhich they roll forwards)\r\nThe He - Monkey\r\nThe world behold; Unceasingly roll'd, It riseth and falleth ever; It ringeth like\r\nglass! How brittle, alas! 'Tis hollow, and resteth never. How bright the sphere,\r\nStill brighter here! Now living am I! Dear son, beware! Nor venture there!\r\nThou too must die! It is of clay; 'Twill crumble away; There fragments lie.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nOf what use is the sieve?\r\nThe He - Monkey (taking it down)\r\n(He runs to the She - Monkey, and makes her look through it.)\r\nLook through the sieve! Dost know him the thief, And dar'st thou not call him\r\nso?\r\nMephistopheles (approaching the fire)\r\nAnd then this pot?\r\nThe Monkeys\r\nThe half - witted sot! He knows not the pot! He know not the kettle!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nUnmannerly beast! Be civil at least!\r\nThe He - Monkey\r\nTake the whisk and sit down in the settle!\r\n(He makes Mephistopheles sit down.)\r\nFaust\r\n(who all this time has been standing before a looking - glass, now\r\napproaching, and now retiring from it)\r\nWhat do I see? what form, whose charms transcend The loveliness of earth,\r\nis mirror'd here! O Love, to waft me to her sphere, To me the swiftest of thy\r\npinions lend! Alas! If I remain not rooted to this place, If to approach more\r\nnear I'm fondly lur'd, Her image fades, in veiling mist obscur'd! Model of\r\nbeauty both in form and face! Is't possible? Hath woman charms so rare? In\r\nthis recumbent form, supremely fair, The essence must I see of heavenly\r\ngrace? Can aught so exquisite on earth be found?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThe six days' labour of a god, my friend, Who doth himself cry bravo, at the\r\nend, By something clever doubtless should be crown'd. For this time gaze\r\nyour fill, and when you please Just such a prize for you I can provide; How\r\nblest is he to whom kind fate decrees, To take her to his home, a lovely bride!\r\n(Faust continues to gaze into the mirror. Mephistopheles stretching himself on\r\nthe settle and playing with the whisk, continues to speak.)\r\nHere sit I, like a king upon his throne; My sceptre this; - the crown I want\r\nalone.\r\nThe Monkeys\r\n(who have hitherto been making all sorts of strange gestures, bring\r\nMephistopheles a crown, with loud cries)\r\nOh, be so good, With sweat and with blood The crown to lime!\r\n(They handle the crown awkwardly and break it in two pieces, with which\r\nthey skip about.)\r\n'Twas fate's decree! We speak and see! We hear and rhyme.\r\nFaust (before the mirror)\r\nWoe's me! well - nigh distraught I feel!\r\nMephistopheles\r\n(pointing to the beasts)\r\nAnd even my own head almost begins to reel.\r\nThe Monkeys\r\nIf good luck attend, If fitly things blend, Our jargon with thought And with\r\nreason is fraught!\r\nFaust (as above)\r\nA flame is kindled in my breast! Let us begone! nor linger here!\r\nMephistopheles\r\n(in the same position)\r\nIt now at least must be confessed, That poets sometimes are sincere.\r\n(The caldron which the She - Monkey has neglected begins to boil over; a\r\ngreat flame arises, which streams up the chimney. The Witch comes down the\r\nchimney with horrible cries.)\r\nThe Witch Returns\r\nThe Witch\r\nOugh! ough! ough! ough! Accursed brute! accursed sow! The caldron dost\r\nneglect, for shame! Accursed brute to scorch the dame!\r\n(Perceiving Faust and Mephistopheles)\r\nWhom have we here? Who's sneaking here? Whence are ye come? With\r\nwhat desire? The plague of fire Your bones consume!\r\n(She dips the skimming - ladle into the caldron and throws flames at Faust,\r\nMephistopheles, and the Monkeys. The Monkeys whimper.)\r\nMephistopheles\r\n(twirling the whisk which he holds in his hand, and striking among the glasses\r\nand pots)\r\nDash! Smash! There lies the glass! There lies the slime! 'Tis but a jest; I but\r\nkeep time, Thou hellish pest, To thine own chime!\r\n(While the Witch steps back in rage and astonishment.)\r\nDost know me! Skeleton! Vile scarecrow, thou! Thy lord and master dost\r\nthou know? What holds me, that I deal not now Thee and thine apes a\r\nstunning blow? No more respect to my red vest dost pay? Does my cock's\r\nfeather no allegiance claim? Have I my visage masked to - day? Must I be\r\nforced myself to name?\r\nThe Witch\r\nMaster, forgive this rude salute! But I perceive no cloven foot. And your two\r\nravens, where are they?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThis once I must admit your plea; For truly I must own that we Each other\r\nhave not seen for many a day. The culture, too, that shapes the world, at last\r\nHath e'en the devil in its sphere embraced; The northern phantom from the\r\nscene hath pass'd, Tail, talons, horns, are nowhere to be traced! As for the\r\nfoot, with which I can't dispense, 'Twould injure me in company, and hence,\r\nLike many a youthful cavalier, False calves I now have worn for many a year.\r\nThe Witch (dancing)\r\nI am beside myself with joy, To see once more the gallant Satan here!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWoman, no more that name employ!\r\nThe Witch\r\nBut why! what mischief hath it done?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nTo fable - books it now doth appertain; But people from the change have\r\nnothing won. Rid of the evil one, the evil ones remain. Lord Baron call thou\r\nme, so is the matter good; Of other cavaliers the mien I wear. Dost make no\r\nquestion of my gentle blood; See here, this is the scutcheon that I bear! (He\r\nmakes an unseemly gesture.)\r\nThe Witch\r\n(laughing immoderately)\r\nHa! Ha! Just like yourself! You are, I ween, The same mad wag that you\r\nhave ever been!\r\nMephistopheles (to Faust)\r\nMy friend, learn this to understand, I pray! To deal with witches this is still the\r\nway.\r\nThe Witch\r\nNow tell me, gentlemen, what you desire?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nOf your known juice a goblet we require. But for the very oldest let me ask;\r\nDouble its strength with years doth grow.\r\nThe Witch\r\nMost willingly! And here I have a flask, From which I've sipp'd myself ere\r\nnow; What's more, it doth no longer stink; To you a glass I joyfully will give.\r\n(Aside.)\r\nIf unprepar'd, however, this man drink, He hath not, as you know, an hour to\r\nlive.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nHe's my good friend, with whom 'twill prosper well; I grudge him not the\r\nchoicest of thy store. Now draw thy circle, speak thy spell, And straight a\r\nbumper for him pour!\r\nHa! Ha! Just like yourself! You are, I ween, The same mad wag that you\r\nhave ever been!\r\nMephistopheles (to Faust)\r\nMy friend, learn this to understand, I pray! To deal with witches this is still the\r\nway.\r\nThe Witch\r\nNow tell me, gentlemen, what you desire?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nOf your known juice a goblet we require. But for the very oldest let me ask;\r\nDouble its strength with years doth grow.\r\nThe Witch\r\nMost willingly! And here I have a flask, From which I've sipp'd myself ere\r\nnow; What's more, it doth no longer stink; To you a glass I joyfully will give.\r\n(Aside.)\r\nIf unprepar'd, however, this man drink, He hath not, as you know, an hour to\r\nlive.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nHe's my good friend, with whom 'twill prosper well; I grudge him not the\r\nchoicest of thy store. Now draw thy circle, speak thy spell, And straight a\r\nbumper for him pour!\r\nThe lofty power Of wisdom's dower, From all the world conceal'd! Who\r\nthinketh not, To him I wot, Unsought it is reveal'd.\r\nFaust\r\nWhat nonsense doth the hag propound? My brain it doth well - nigh\r\nconfound. A hundred thousand fools or more, Methinks I hear in chorus roar.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nIncomparable Sibyl cease, I pray! Hand us the liquor without more delay.\r\nAnd to the very brim the goblet crown! My friend he is, and need not be\r\nafraid; Besides, he is a man of many a grade, Who hath drunk deep already.\r\n(The Witch, with many ceremonies, pours the liquor into a cup; as Faust lifts it\r\nto his mouth, a light flame arises.)\r\nMephistopheles\r\nGulp it down! No hesitation! It will prove A cordial, and your heart inspire!\r\nWhat! with the devil hand and glove, And yet shrink back afraid of fire? (The\r\nWitch dissolves the circle. Faust steps out.)\r\nMephistopheles\r\nNow forth at once! thou dar'st not rest.\r\nWitch\r\nAnd much, sir, may the liquor profit you!\r\nMephistopheles (to the Witch)\r\nAnd if to pleasure thee I aught can do, Pray on Walpurgis mention thy\r\nrequest.\r\nWitch\r\nHere is a song, sung o'er, sometimes you'll see, That 'twill a singular effect\r\nproduce.\r\nMephistopheles (to Faust)\r\nCome, quick, and let thyself be led by me; Thou must perspire, in order that\r\nthe juice Thy frame may penetrate through every part. Then noble idleness I\r\nthee will teach to prize, And soon with ecstasy thou'lt recognise How Cupid\r\nstirs and gambols in thy heart.\r\nFaust\r\nLet me but gaze one moment in the glass! Too lovely was that female form!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nNay! nay! A model which all women shall surpass, In flesh and blood ere long\r\nthou shalt survey.\r\n(Aside.)\r\nAs works that draught, thou presently shalt greet A Helen in each woman\r\nthou dost meet.\r\nA Street - Faust Meets Margaret\r\nFaust (Margaret passing by)\r\nFaust And Margaret: The meeting of Faust and Margaret.]\r\nFaust\r\nFair lady, may I thus make free To offer you my arm and company?\r\nMargaret\r\nI am no lady, am not fair, Can without escort home repair.\r\n(She disengages herself and exit.)\r\nFaust\r\nBy heaven! This girl is fair indeed! No form like hers can I recall. Virtue she\r\nhath, and modest heed, Is piquant too, and sharp withal. Her cheek's soft\r\nlight, her rosy lips, No length of time will e'er eclipse! Her downward glance\r\nin passing by, Deep in my heart is stamp'd for aye; How curt and sharp her\r\nanswer too, To ecstasy the feeling grew!\r\n(Mephistopheles enters.)\r\nFaust\r\nThis girl must win for me! Dost hear?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWhich?\r\nFaust\r\nShe who but now passed.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWhat! She? She from confession cometh here, From every sin absolved and\r\nfree; I crept near the confessor's chair. All innocence her virgin soul, For next\r\nto nothing went she there; O'er such as she I've no control!\r\nFaust\r\nShe's past fourteen.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nYou really talk\r\nLike any gay Lothario, Who every floweret from its stalk Would pluck, and\r\ndeems nor grace, nor truth, Secure against his arts, forsooth! This ne'er the\r\nless won't always do.\r\nFaust\r\nSir Moralizer, prithee, pause; Nor plague me with your tiresome laws!\r\nGoethe\r\nTo cut the matter short, my friend, She must this very night be mine, And if to\r\nhelp me you decline, Midnight shall see our compact end.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWhat may occur just bear in mind! A fortnight's space, at least, I need, A fit\r\noccasion but to find.\r\nFaust\r\nWith but seven hours I could succeed; Nor should I want the devil's wile, So\r\nyoung a creature to beguile.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nLike any Frenchman now you speak, But do not fret, I pray; why seek To\r\nhurry to enjoyment straight? The pleasure is not half so great, As when at first\r\naround, above, With all the fooleries of love, The puppet you can knead and\r\nmould As in Italian story oft is told.\r\nFaust\r\nNo such incentives do I need.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nBut now, without offense or jest! You cannot quickly, I protest, In winning\r\nthis sweet child succeed. By storm we cannot take the fort, To stratagem we\r\nmust resort.\r\nFaust\r\nConduct me to her place of rest! Some token of the angel bring! A kerchief\r\nfrom her snowy breast, A garter bring me, - any thing!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThat I my anxious zeal may prove, Your pangs to sooth and aid your love, A\r\nsingle moment will we not delay, Will lead you to her room this very day.\r\nFaust\r\nAnd shall I see her? - Have her?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nNo! She to a neighbour's house will go; But in her atmosphere alone, The\r\ntedious hours meanwhile you may employ, In blissful dreams of future joy.\r\nFaust\r\nCan we go now?\r\nMephistopheles\r\n'Tis yet too soon.\r\nFaust\r\nSome present for my love procure!\r\n(Exit.)\r\nMephistopheles\r\nPresents so soon! 'tis well! success is sure! Full many a goodly place I know,\r\nAnd treasures buried long ago; I must a bit o'erlook them now.\r\n(Exit.)\r\nEvening - A Small And Neat Room\r\nMargaret\r\n(braiding and binding up her hair)\r\nI would give something now to know, Who yonder gentleman could be! He\r\nhad a gallant air, I trow, And doubtless was of high degree: That written on\r\nhis brow was seen Nor else would he so bold have been.\r\n(Exit.)\r\nMephistopheles\r\nCome in! tread softly! be discreet!\r\nFaust (after a pause)\r\nBegone and leave me, I entreat!\r\nMephistopheles (looking round)\r\nNot every maiden is so neat\r\n(Exit.)\r\nFaust (gazing round)\r\nWelcome sweet twilight, calm and blest, That in this hallow'd precinct reigns!\r\nFond yearning love, inspire my breast, Feeding on hope's sweet dew thy\r\nblissful pains! What stillness here environs me! Content and order brood\r\naround. What fulness in this poverty! In this small cell what bliss profound!\r\n(He throws himself on the leather arm - chair beside the bed)\r\nReceive me thou, who hast in thine embrace, Welcom'd in joy and grief the\r\nages flown! How oft the children of a by - gone race Have cluster'd round this\r\npatriarchal throne! Haply she, also, whom I hold so dear, For Christmas gift,\r\nwith grateful joy possess'd, Hath with the full round cheek of childhood, here,\r\nHer grandsire's wither'd hand devoutly press'd. Maiden! I feel thy spirit haunt\r\nthe place, Breathing of order and abounding grace. As with a mother's voice it\r\nprompteth thee, The pure white cover o'er the board to spread, To strew the\r\ncrisping sand beneath thy tread. Dear hand! so godlike in its ministry! The hut\r\nbecomes a paradise through thee! And here - (He raises the bed - curtain.)\r\nHow thrills my pulse with strange delight! Here could I linger hours untold;\r\nThou, Nature, didst in vision bright, The embryo angel here unfold. Here lay\r\nthe child, her bosom warm With life; while steeped in slumber's dew, To\r\nperfect grace, her godlike form, With pure and hallow'd weavings grew!\r\nAnd thou! ah here what seekest thou? How quails mine inmost being now!\r\nWhat wouldst thou here? what makes thy heart so sore? Unhappy Faust! I\r\nknow thee now no more.\r\nDo I a magic atmosphere inhale? Erewhile, my passion would not brook\r\ndelay! Now in a pure love - dream I melt away. Are we the sport of every\r\npassing gale?\r\nShould she return and enter now, How wouldst thou rue thy guilty flame!\r\nProud vaunter - thou wouldst hide thy brow, And at her feet sink down with\r\nshame.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nQuick! quick! below I see her there.\r\nFaust\r\nAway! I will return no more!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nHere is a casket, with a store Of jewels, which I got elsewhere Just lay it in\r\nthe press; make haste! I swear to you, 'twill turn her brain; Therein some\r\ntrifles I have placed, Wherewith another to obtain. But child is child, and play\r\nis play.\r\nFaust\r\nI know not - shall I?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nDo you ask? Perchance you would retain the treasure? If such your wish, why\r\nthen, I say, Henceforth absolve me from my task, Nor longer waste your\r\nhours of leisure. I trust you're not by avarice led! I rub my hands, I scratch my\r\nhead,\r\n(He places the casket in the press and closes the lock.)\r\nNow quick! Away!

Through me there runs a shuddering I'm but a\r\nfoolish timid thing!\r\n(While undressing herself she begins to sing.)\r\nThere was a king in Thule, True even to the grave; To whom his dying\r\nmistress A golden beaker gave.\r\nAt every feast he drained it, Naught was to him so dear, And often as he\r\ndrained it, Gush'd from his eyes the tear.\r\nWhen death came, unrepining His cities o'er he told; All to his heir resigning,\r\nExcept his cup of gold.\r\nWith many a knightly vassal At a royal feast sat he, In yon proud hall\r\nancestral, In his castle o'er the sea.\r\nUp stood the jovial monarch, And quaff'd his last life's glow, Then hurled the\r\nhallow'd goblet Into the flood below.\r\nHe saw it splashing, drinking, And plunging in the sea; His eyes meanwhile\r\nwere sinking, And never again drank he.\r\n(She opens the press to put away her clothes, and perceives the casket.)\r\nHow comes this lovely casket here? The press I locked, of that I'm confident.\r\n'Tis very wonderful!

A glimpse of them the mother caught, And 'gan with secret\r\nfear to groan. The woman's scent is keen enough; Doth ever in the prayer -\r\nbook snuff; Smells every article to ascertain Whether the thing is holy or\r\nprofane, And scented in the jewels rare, That there was not much blessing\r\nthere. \"My child,\" she cries, \"ill - gotten good Ensnares the soul, consumes the\r\nblood; With them we'll deck our Lady's shrine, She'll cheer our souls with\r\nbread divine!\" At this poor Gretchen 'gan to pout; 'Tis a gift - horse, at least,\r\nshe thought, And sure, he godless cannot be, Who brought them here so\r\ncleverly. Straight for a priest the mother sent, Who, when he understood the\r\njest, With what he saw was well content. \"This shows a pious mind!\" Quoth\r\nhe: \"Self - conquest is true victory.

After my father's death it saw the day;\r\nWe gave my mother up for lost, she lay In such a wretched plight, and then at\r\nlength So very slowly she regain'd her strength. Weak as she was, 'twas vain\r\nfor her to try Herself to suckle the poor babe, so I Reared it on milk and\r\nwater all alone; And thus the child became as 'twere my own; Within my arms\r\nit stretched itself and grew, And smiling, nestled in my bosom too.\r\nFaust\r\nDoubtless the purest happiness was thine.\r\nMargaret\r\nBut many weary hours, in sooth, were also mine. At night its little cradle stood\r\nClose to my bed; so was I wide awake If it but stirred; One while I was\r\nobliged to give it food, Or to my arms the darling take; From bed full oft must\r\nrise, whene'er its cry I heard, And, dancing it, must pace the chamber to and\r\nfro; Stand at the wash - tub early; forthwith go To market, and then mind the\r\ncooking too To - morrow like to - day, the whole year through. Ah, sir, thus\r\nliving, it must be confess'd One's spirits are not always of the best; Yet it a\r\nrelish gives to food and rest.

Hark the singing! Hearken to love's plaintive lays; Voices of\r\nthose heavenly days What we hope, and what we love! Like a tale of olden\r\ntime, Echo's voice prolongs the chime.\r\nTo - whit! To - whoo! It sounds more near; Plover, owl and jay appear, All\r\nawake, around, above? Paunchy salamanders too Peer, long - limbed, the\r\nbushes through! And, like snakes, the roots of trees\r\nCoil themselves from rock and sand, Stretching many a wondrous band, Us\r\nto frighten, us to seize; From rude knots with life embued, Polyp - fangs\r\nabroad they spread, To snare the wanderer! 'Neath our tread, Mice, in\r\nmyriads, thousand - hued, Through the heath and through the moss! And the\r\nfire - flies' glittering throng, Wildering escort, whirls along, Here and there, our\r\npath across. Tell me, stand we motionless, Or still forward do we press? All\r\nthings round us whirl and fly; Rocks and trees make strange grimaces,\r\nDazzling meteors change their places, How they puff and multiply!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nNow grasp my doublet - we at last A central peak have reached, which\r\nshows, If round a wondering glance we cast, How in the mountain Mammon\r\nglows,\r\nFaust\r\nHow through the chasms strangely gleams, A lurid light, like dawn's red glow,\r\nPervading with its quivering beams, The gorges of the gulf below! Here\r\nvapours rise, there clouds float by, Here through the mist the light doth shine;\r\nNow, like a fount, it bursts on high, Meanders now, a slender line; Far\r\nreaching, with a hundred veins, Here through the valley see it glide; Here,\r\nwhere its force the gorge restrains, At once it scatters, far and wide; Anear,\r\nlike showers of golden sand Strewn broadcast, sputter sparks of light: And\r\nmark yon rocky walls that stand Ablaze, in all their towering height!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nDoth not Sir Mammon for this fete Grandly illume his palace! Thou Art lucky\r\nto have seen it; now, The boisterous guests, I feel, are coming straight.\r\nFaust\r\nHow through the air the storm doth whirl! Upon my neck it strikes with\r\nsudden shock.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nCling to these ancient ribs of granite rock, Else to yon depths profound it you\r\nwill hurl. A murky vapour thickens night. Hark! Through the woods the\r\ntempests roar! The owlets flit in wild affright. Hark! Splinter'd are the columns\r\nthat upbore The leafy palace, green for aye: The shivered branches whirr and\r\nsigh, Yawn the huge trunks with mighty groan. The roots upriven, creak and\r\nmoan! In fearful and entangled fall, One crashing ruin whelms them all, While\r\nthrough the desolate abyss, Sweeping the wreck - strewn precipice, The\r\nraging storm - blasts howl and hiss! Aloft strange voices dost thou hear?\r\nDistant now and now more near? Hark! the mountain ridge along, Streameth\r\na raving magic - song!\r\nWitches And Wizards Chorus - Visions And Dances\r\nWitches (in chorus)\r\nNow to the Brocken the witches hie, The stubble is yellow, the corn is green;\r\nThither the gathering legions fly, And sitting aloft is Sir Urian seen: O'er stick\r\nand o'er stone they go whirling along, Witches and he - goats, a motley\r\nthrong,\r\nVoices\r\nAlone old Baubo's coming now; She rides upon a farrow sow.\r\nChorus\r\nHonour to her, to whom honour is due! Forward, Dame Baubo! Honour to\r\nyou! A goodly sow and mother thereon, The whole witch chorus follows\r\nanon.\r\nVoice\r\nWhich way didst come?\r\nVoice\r\nO'er Ilsenstein! There I peep'd in an owlet's nest. With her broad eye she\r\ngazed in mine!\r\nVoice\r\nDrive to the devil, thou hellish pest! Why ride so hard?\r\nVoice\r\nShe has graz'd my side, Look at the wounds, how deep and how wide!\r\nWitches (in chorus)\r\nThe way is broad, the way is long; What mad pursuit! What tumult wild!\r\nScratches the besom and sticks the prong; Crush'd is the mother, and stifled\r\nthe child.\r\nWizards (half chorus)\r\nLike house - encumber'd snail we creep; While far ahead the women keep,\r\nFor when to the devil's house we speed, By a thousand steps they take the\r\nlead.\r\nThe Other Half\r\nNot so, precisely do we view it; They with a thousand steps may do it; But let\r\nthem hasten as they can, With one long bound 'tis clear'd by man.\r\nVoices (above)\r\nCome with us, come with us from Felsensee.\r\nVoices (from below)\r\nAloft to you we would mount with glee! We wash, and free from all stain are\r\nwe, Yet barren evermore must be!\r\nBoth Choruses\r\nThe wind is hushed, the stars grow pale, The pensive moon her light doth veil;\r\nAnd whirling on, the magic choir Sputters forth sparks of drizzling fire.\r\nVoice (from below)\r\nStay! stay!\r\nVoice (from above)\r\nWhat voice of woe Calls from the cavern'd depths below?\r\nVoice (from below)\r\nTake me with you! Oh take me too! Three centuries I climb in vain, And yet\r\ncan ne'er the summit gain! To be with my kindred I am fain.\r\nBoth Choruses\r\nBroom and pitch - fork, goat and prong, Mounted on these we whirl along;\r\nWho vainly strives to climb to - night, Is evermore a luckless wight!\r\nDemi - Witch (below)\r\nI hobble after, many a day; Already the others are far away! No rest at home\r\ncan I obtain Here too my efforts are in vain!\r\nChorus of Witches\r\nSalve gives the witches strength to rise; A rag for a sail does well enough; A\r\ngoodly ship is every trough; To - night who flies not, never flies.\r\nBoth Choruses\r\nAnd when the topmost peak we round, Then alight ye on the ground; The\r\nheath's wide regions cover ye With your mad swarms of witchery!\r\n(They let themselves down.)\r\nMephistopleles\r\nThey crowd and jostle, whirl and flutter! They whisper, babble, twirl, and\r\nsplutter! They glimmer, sparkle, stink and flare A true witch - element!\r\nBeware! Stick close! else we shall severed be. Where art thou?\r\nFaust (in the distance)\r\nHere!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAlready, whirl'd so far away! The master then indeed I needs must play. Give\r\nground! Squire Voland comes! Sweet folk, give ground! Here, doctor, grasp\r\nme! With a single bound Let us escape this ceaseless jar; Even for me too\r\nmad these people are. Hard by there shineth something with peculiar glare,\r\nYon brake allureth me; it is not far; Come, come along with me! we'll slip in\r\nthere.\r\nFaust\r\nSpirit of contradiction! Lead! I'll follow straight! 'Twas wisely done, however,\r\nto repair On May - night to the Brocken, and when there By our own choice\r\nourselves to isolate!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nMark, of those flames the motley glare! A merry club assembles there. In a\r\nsmall circle one is not alone.\r\nFaust\r\nI'd rather be above, though, I must own! Already fire and eddying smoke I\r\nview; The impetuous millions to the devil ride; Full many a riddle will be there\r\nuntied.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAy! and full many a riddle tied anew. But let the great world rave and riot!\r\nHere will we house ourselves in quiet. A custom 'tis of ancient date, Our\r\nlesser worlds within the great world to create! Young witches there I see,\r\nnaked and bare, And old ones, veil'd more prudently. For my sake only\r\ncourteous be! The trouble's small, the sport is rare. Of instruments I hear the\r\ncursed din One must get used to it. Come in! come in! There's now no help\r\nfor it. I'll step before And introducing you as my good friend, Confer on you\r\none obligation more. How say you now? 'Tis no such paltry room; Why only\r\nlook, you scarce can see the end. A hundred fires in rows disperse the gloom;\r\nThey dance, they talk, they cook, make love, and drink: Where could we find\r\naught better, do you think?\r\nFaust\r\nTo introduce us, do you purpose here As devil or as wizard to appear?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nThough I am wont indeed to strict incognito, Yet upon gala - days one must\r\none's orders show. No garter have I to distinguish me, Nathless the cloven\r\nfoot doth here give dignity. Seest thou yonder snail? Crawling this way she\r\nhies: With searching feelers, she, no doubt, Hath me already scented out;\r\nHere, even if I would, for me there's no disguise. From fire to fire, we'll\r\nsaunter at our leisure, The gallant you, I'll cater for your pleasure.\r\n(To a party seated round some expiring embers.)\r\nOld gentleman, apart, why sit ye moping here? Ye in the midst should be of all\r\nthis jovial cheer, Girt round with noise and youthful riot; At home one surely\r\nhas enough of quiet.\r\nGeneral\r\nIn nations put his trust, who may, Whate'er for them one may have done; For\r\nwith the people, as with women, they Honour your rising stars alone!\r\nMinister\r\nNow all too far they wander from the right; I praise the good old ways, to\r\nthem I hold, Then was the genuine age of gold, When we ourselves were\r\nforemost in men's sight.\r\nParvenu\r\nNe'er were we 'mong your dullards found, And what we ought not, that to do\r\nwere fair; Yet now are all things turning round and round, When on firm basis\r\nwe would them maintain.\r\nAuthor\r\nWho, as a rule, a treatise now would care To read, of even moderate sense?\r\nAs for the rising generation, ne'er Has youth displayed such arrogant\r\npretence.\r\nMephistopheles\r\n(suddenly appearing very old)\r\nSince for the last time I the Brocken scale, That folk are ripe for doomsday,\r\nnow one sees; And just because my cask begins to fail, So the whole world is\r\nalso on the lees.\r\nHuckster - Witch\r\nStop, gentlemen, nor pass me by, Of wares I have a choice collection: Pray\r\nhonour them with your inspection. Lose not his opportunity! Yet nothing in my\r\nbooth you'll find Without its counterpart on earth; there's naught, Which to the\r\nworld, and to mankind, Hath not some direful mischief wrought. No dagger\r\nhere, which hath not flow'd with blood, No chalice, whence, into some\r\nhealthy frame Hath not been poured hot poison's wasting flood. No trinket,\r\nbut hath wrought some woman's shame, No weapon but hath cut some\r\nsacred tie, Or from behind hath stabb'd an enemy.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nGossip! For wares like these the time's gone by, What's done is past! what's\r\npast is done! With novelties your booth supply; Us novelties attract alone.\r\nFaust\r\nMay this wild scene my senses spare! This, may in truth be called a fair!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nUpward the eddying concourse throng; Thinking to push, thyself art push'd\r\nalong.\r\nFaust\r\nWho's that, pray?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nMark her well! That's Lilith.\r\nFaust\r\nWho?\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAdam's first wife. Of her rich locks beware! That charm in which she's\r\nparallel'd by few; When in its toils a youth she doth ensnare, He will not soon\r\nescape, I promise you.\r\nFaust\r\nThere sit a pair, the old one with the young; Already they have bravely\r\ndanced and sprung!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nHere there is no repose to - day. Another dance begins; we'll join it, come\r\naway!\r\nFaust\r\n(dancing with the young one)\r\nOnce a fair vision came to me; There in I saw an apple - tree, Two beauteous\r\napples charmed mine eyes; I climb'd forthwith to reach the prize.\r\nThe Fair One\r\nApples still fondly ye desire, From paradise it hath been so. Feelings of joy\r\nmy breast inspire That such too in my garden grow.\r\nMephistopheles (with the old one)\r\nOnce a weird vision came to me; Therein I saw a rifted tree. It had a . . . . . . ;\r\nBut as it was it pleased me too.\r\nThe Old One\r\nI beg most humbly to salute The gallant with the cloven foot! Let him a . . .\r\nhave ready here, If he a . . . does not fear.\r\nProctophantasmist\r\nAccursed mob! How dare ye thus to meet? Have I not shown and\r\ndemonstrated too, That ghosts stand not on ordinary feet? Yet here ye dance,\r\nas other mortals do!\r\nThe Fair One (dancing)\r\nThen at our ball, what doth he here?\r\nFaust (dancing)\r\nOh! He must everywhere appear. He must adjudge, when others dance; If on\r\neach step his say's not said, So is that step as good as never made. He's most\r\nannoyed, so soon as we advance; If ye would circle in one narrow round, As\r\nhe in his old mill, then doubtless he Your dancing would approve, - especially\r\nIf ye forthwith salute him with respect profound!\r\nProctophantasmist\r\nStill here! what arrogance! unheard of quite! Vanish; we now have fill'd the\r\nworld with light! Laws are unheeded by the devil's host; Wise as we are, yet\r\nTegel hath its ghost! How long at this conceit I've swept with all my might,\r\nLost is the labour: 'tis unheard of quite!\r\nThe Fair One\r\nCease here to teaze us any more, I pray.\r\nProctophantasmist\r\nSpirits, I plainly to your face declare: No spiritual control myself will bear,\r\nSince my own spirit can exert no sway.\r\n(The dancing continues.)\r\nTo - night, I see, I shall in naught succeed; But I'm prepar'd my travels to\r\npursue, And hope, before my final step indeed, To triumph over bards and\r\ndevils too.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nNow in some puddle will he take his station, Such is his mode of seeking\r\nconsolation; Where leeches, feasting on his rump, will drain Spirits alike and\r\nspirit from his brain.\r\n(To Faust, who has left the dance.)\r\nBut why the charming damsel leave, I pray, Who to you in the dance so\r\nsweetly sang?\r\nFaust\r\nAh, in the very middle of her lay, Out of her mouth a small red mouse there\r\nsprang.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nSuppose there did! One must not be too nice. 'Twas well it was not grey, let\r\nthat suffice. Who 'mid his pleasures for a trifle cares?\r\nFaust\r\nThen saw I\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWhat?\r\nFaust\r\nMephisto, seest thou there Standing far off, a lone child, pale and fair? Slow\r\nfrom the spot her drooping form she tears, And seems with shackled feet to\r\nmove along; I own, within me the delusion' strong, That she the likeness of my\r\nGretchen wears.\r\nMephistopheles\r\nGaze not upon her! 'Tis not good! Forbear! 'Tis lifeless, magical, a shape of\r\nair, An idol. Such to meet with, bodes no good; That rigid look of hers doth\r\nfreeze man's blood, And well - nigh petrifies his heart to stone: The story of\r\nMedusa thou hast known.\r\nFaust\r\nAy, verily! a corpse's eyes are those, Which there was no fond loving hand to\r\nclose. That is the bosom I so fondly press'd, That my sweet Gretchen's form,\r\nso oft caress'd!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nDeluded fool! 'Tis magic, I declare! To each she doth his lov'd one's image\r\nwear.\r\nFaust\r\nWhat bliss! what torture! vainly I essay To turn me from that piteous look\r\naway. How strangely doth a single crimson line Around that lovely neck its\r\ncoil entwine, It shows no broader than a knife's blunt edge!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nQuite right. I see it also, and allege That she beneath her arm her head can\r\nbear, Since Perseus cut it off. - But you I swear Are craving for illusion still!\r\nCome then, ascend yon little hill! As on the Prater all is gay, And if my senses\r\nare not gone, I see a theatre, - what's going on?\r\nServibilis\r\nThey are about to recommence; - the play Will be the last of seven, and spick"}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(r.li,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsx)(r.p,{children:"span new 'Tis usual here that number to present.

Stand and brave me\r\nwith thine insupportable presence! Imprisoned! In hopeless misery! Delivered\r\nover to the power of evil spirits and the judgment of unpitying humanity! And\r\nme, the while, thou wert lulling with tasteless dissipations, concealing from me\r\nher growing anguish, and leaving her to perish without help!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nShe is not the first.\r\nFaust\r\nHound! Execrable monster! - Back with him, oh thou infinite spirit! back with\r\nthe reptile into his dog's shape, in which it was his wont to scamper before me\r\nat eventide, to roll before the feet of the harmless wanderer, and to fasten on\r\nhis shoulders when he fell! Change him again into his favourite shape, that he\r\nmay crouch on his belly before me in the dust, whilst I spurn him with my foot,\r\nthe reprobate! - Not the first! - Woe! Woe!

I or thou?\r\n(Faust looks wildly around.)\r\nMephistopheles\r\nWould'st grasp the thunder? Well for you, poor mortals, that 'tis not yours to\r\nwield! To smite to atoms the being however innocent, who obstructs his path,\r\nsuch is the tyrant's fashion of relieving himself in difficulties!\r\nFaust\r\nConvey me thither! She shall be free!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nAnd the danger to which thou dost expose thyself? Know, the guilt of blood,\r\nshed by thy hand, lies yet upon the town. Over the place where fell the\r\nmurdered one, avenging spirits hover and watch for the returning murderer.\r\nFaust\r\nThis too from thee? The death and downfall of a world be on thee, monster!\r\nConduct me thither, I say, and set her free!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nI will conduct thee. And what I can do, - hear! Have I all power in heaven\r\nand upon earth! I'll cloud the senses of the warder, - do thou possess thyself\r\nof the keys and lead her forth with human hand! I will keep watch! The magic\r\nsteeds are waiting, I bear thee off. Thus much is in my power.\r\nFaust\r\nUp and away!\r\nNight. Open Country\r\nFaust.

On!\r\nDungeon\r\nFaust\r\n(with a bunch of keys and a lamp before a small iron door)\r\nA fear unwonted o'er my spirit falls; Man's concentrated woe o'erwhelms me\r\nhere! She dwells immur'd within these dripping walls; Her only trespass a\r\ndelusion dear! Thou lingerest at the fatal door, Thou dread'st to see her face\r\nonce more? On! While thou dalliest, draws her death - hour near.\r\n(He seizes the lock. Singing within.)\r\nMy mother, the harlot, She took me and slew! My father, the scoundrel, Hath\r\neaten me too! My sweet little sister Hath all my bones laid, Where soft\r\nbreezes whisper All in the cool shade!\r\nThen became I a wood - bird, and sang on the spray, Fly away! little bird, fly\r\naway! fly away!\r\nFaust (opening the lock)\r\nAh! she forebodes not that her lover's near, The clanking chains, the rustling\r\nstraw, to hear.\r\n(He enters.)\r\nDungeon Scene: Dungeon scene with Mephistopheles, Faust, and Margaret.\r\nLithograph by Eugene Delacroix.]\r\nMargaret\r\n(hiding her face in the bed of straw)\r\nWoe! woe! they come! on bitter 'tis to die!\r\nFaust (softly)\r\nHush! hush! be still! I come to set thee free!\r\nMargaret\r\n(throwing herself at his feet)\r\nIf thou art human, feel my misery!\r\nFaust\r\nThou wilt awake the jailor with thy cry!\r\n(He grasps the chains to unlock them.)\r\nMargaret (on her knees)\r\nWho, headsman, unto thee this power O'er me could give? Thou com'st for\r\nme at midnight - hour. Be merciful, and let me live! Is morrow's dawn not time\r\nenough? (She stands up.)\r\nI'm still so young, so young And must so early die! Fair was I too, and that\r\nwas my undoing. My love is now afar, he then was nigh; Torn lies the garland,\r\nthe fair blossoms strew'd. Nay, seize me not with hand so rude! Spare me!\r\nWhat harm have I e'er done to thee? Oh let me not in vain implore! I ne'er\r\nhave seen thee in my life before!\r\nFaust\r\nCan I endure this bitter agony?\r\nMargaret\r\nI now am at thy mercy quite. Let me my babe but suckle once again! I\r\nfondled it the live - long night; They took it from me but to give me pain, And\r\nnow, they say that I my child have slain. Gladness I ne'er again shall know.\r\nThen they sing songs about me, - 'tis wicked of the throng An ancient ballad\r\nendeth so; Who bade them thus apply the song?\r\nFaust\r\n(throwing himself on the ground)\r\nA lover at thy feet bends low, To loose the bonds of wretchedness and woe.\r\nMargaret\r\n(throws herself beside him)\r\nOh, let us kneel and move the saints by prayer! Look! look! yon stairs below,\r\nUnder the threshold there, Hell's flames are all aglow! Beneath the floor, With\r\nhideous noise, The devils roar!\r\nFaust (aloud)\r\nGretchen! Gretchen!\r\nMargaret (listening)\r\nThat was my lov'd one's voice!\r\n(She springs up, the chains fall off.)\r\nWhere is he? I heard him calling me. Free am I! There's none shall hinder me.\r\nTo his neck will I fly, On his bosom will lie! Gretchen, he called! - On yon\r\nthreshold he stood; Amidst all the howling of hell's fiery flood, The scoff and\r\nthe scorn of its devilish crew, The tones of his voice, sweet and loving, I\r\nknew.\r\nFaust\r\n'Tis I!\r\nMargaret\r\n'Tis thou! O say so once again!\r\n(embracing him.)\r\n'Tis he! 'Tis he! where's now the torturing pain? Where are the fetters? where\r\nthe dungeon's gloom? 'Tis thou! To save me thou art come! And I am sav'd!\r\nAlready now the street I see Where the first time I caught a glimpse of thee.\r\nThere too the pleasant garden shade, Where I and Martha for thy coming\r\nstay'd.\r\nFaust\r\n(endeavouring to lead her away)\r\nCome! come away!\r\nMargaret\r\nOh do not haste!\r\nI love to linger where thou stayest. (caressing him.)\r\nFaust\r\nAh haste! For if thou still delayest, Our lingering we shall both deplore.\r\nMargaret\r\nHow, dearest? canst thou kiss no more! So short a time away from me, and\r\nyet, To kiss thou couldst so soon forget! Why on thy neck so anxious do I\r\nfeel When formerly a perfect heaven of bliss From thy dear looks and words\r\nwould o'er me steal? As thou wouldst stifle me thou then didst kiss! Kiss me!\r\nOr I'll kiss thee! (She embraces him.) Woe! woe! Thy lips are cold, Are\r\ndumb! Thy love where hast thou left? Who hath me of thy love bereft?\r\n(She turns away from him.)\r\nFaust\r\nCome! Follow me, my dearest love, be bold! I'll cherish thee with ardour\r\nthousand - fold; I but entreat thee now to follow me!\r\nMargaret\r\n(turning towards him)\r\nAnd art thou he? and art thou really he?\r\nFaust\r\n'Tis I! O come!\r\nMargaret\r\nThou wilt strike off my chain, And thou wilt take me to thine arms again. How\r\ncomes it that thou dost not shrink from me? And dost thou know, love, whom\r\nthou wouldst set free?\r\nFaust\r\nCome! come! already night begins to wane.\r\nMargaret\r\nI sent my mother to her grave, I drown'd my child beneath the wave. Was it\r\nnot given to thee and me - thee too? 'Tis thou thyself! I scarce believe it yet.\r\nGive me thy hand! It is no dream! 'Tis true! Thine own dear hand! - But how\r\nis this? 'Tis wet? Quick, wipe it off! Meseems that yet There's blood thereon.\r\nAh God! what hast thou done? Put up thy sword, I beg of thee!\r\nFaust\r\nOh, dearest, let the past forgotten be! Death is in every word.\r\nMargaret\r\nNo, thou must linger here in sorrow! The graves I will describe to thee, And\r\nthou to them must see To - morrow: The best place give to my mother, Close\r\nat her side my brother, Me at some distance lay But not too far away! And\r\nthe little one place on my right breast, Nobody else will near me lie! To nestle\r\nbeside thee so lovingly, That was a rapture, gracious and sweet! A rapture I\r\nnever again shall prove; Methinks I would force myself on thee, love, And\r\nthou dost spurn me, and back retreat Yet 'tis thyself, thy fond kind looks I\r\nsee.\r\nFaust\r\nIf thou dost feel 'tis I, then come with me!\r\nMargaret\r\nWhat, there? without?\r\nFaust\r\nYes, forth in the free air.\r\nMargaret\r\nAy, if the grave's without, - If death lurk there! Hence to the everlasting\r\nresting - place, And not one step beyond! - Thou'rt leaving me? Oh Henry!\r\nwould that I could go with thee!\r\nFaust\r\nThou canst! But will it! Open stands the door.\r\nMargaret\r\nI dare not go! I've naught to hope for more. What boots it to escape? They\r\nlurk for me! 'Tis wretched to beg, as I must do, And with an evil conscience\r\nthereto! 'Tis wretched, in foreign lands to stray; And me they will catch, do\r\nwhat I may!\r\nFaust\r\nWith thee will I abide.\r\nMargaret\r\nQuick! Quick! Save thy poor child! Keep to the path The brook along, Over\r\nthe bridge To the wood beyond, To the left, where the plank is, In the pond.\r\nSeize it at once! It fain would rise, It struggles still! Save it. Oh save!\r\nFaust\r\nDear Gretchen, more collected be! One little step, and thou art free!\r\nMargaret\r\nWere we but only past the hill! There sits my mother upon a stone My brain,\r\nalas, is cold with dread! There sits my mother upon a stone, And to and fro\r\nshe shakes her head; She winks not, she nods not, her head it droops sore;\r\nShe slept so long, she waked no more; She slept, that we might taste of bliss:\r\nAh! those were happy times, I wis!\r\nFaust\r\nSince here avails nor argument nor prayer, Thee hence by force I needs must\r\nbear.\r\nMargaret\r\nLoose me! I will not suffer violence! With murderous hand hold not so fast! I\r\nhave done all to please thee in the past!\r\nFaust\r\nDay dawns! My love! My love!\r\nMargaret\r\nYes! day draws near. The day of judgment too will soon appear! It should\r\nhave been my bridal! No one tell, That thy poor Gretchen thou hast known\r\ntoo well. Woe to my garland! Its bloom is o'er! Though not at the dance We\r\nshall meet once more. The crowd doth gather, in silence it rolls; The squares,\r\nthe streets, Scarce hold the throng. The staff is broken, - the death - bell tolls,\r\nThey bind and seize me! I'm hurried along, To the seat of blood already I'm\r\nbound! Quivers each neck as the naked steel Quivers on mine the blow to\r\ndeal The silence of the grave now broods around!\r\nFaust\r\nWould I had ne'er been born!\r\nMephistopheles (appears without)\r\nUp! or you're lost. Vain hesitation! Babbling, quaking! My steeds are\r\nshivering, Morn is breaking.\r\nMargaret\r\nWhat from the floor ascendeth like a ghost? 'Tis he! 'Tis he! Him from my\r\npresence chase! What would he in this holy place? It is for me he cometh!\r\nFaust\r\nThou shalt live!\r\nMargaret\r\nJudgment of God! To thee my soul I give!\r\nMephistopheles (to Faust)\r\nCome, come! With her I'll else abandon thee!\r\nMargaret\r\nFather, I'm thine! Do thou deliver me! Ye angels! Ye angelic hosts! descend,\r\nEncamp around to guard me and defend! Henry! I shudder now to look on\r\nthee!\r\nMephistopheles\r\nShe now is judged!\r\nVoices (from above)\r\nIs saved!\r\nMephistopheles (to Faust)\r\nCome thou with me!\r\n(Vanishes with Faust.)\r\nVoice (from within, dying away)\r\nHenry!
