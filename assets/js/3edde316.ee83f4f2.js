While, as regards\\r any historical accuracy in dress, Lord Lytton, in an article in the\\r NINETEENTH CENTURY, has laid it down as a dogma of art that\\r archaeology is entirely out of place in the presentation of any of\\r Shakespeare's plays, and the attempt to introduce it one of the\\r stupidest pedantries of an age of prigs.\\r \\r Lord Lytton's position I shall examine later on; but, as regards\\r the theory that Shakespeare did not busy himself much about the\\r costume-wardrobe of his theatre, anybody who cares to study\\r Shakespeare's method will see that there is absolutely no dramatist\\r of the French, English, or Athenian stage who relies so much for\\r his illusionist effects on the dress of his actors as Shakespeare\\r does himself.\\r \\r Knowing how the artistic temperament is always fascinated by beauty\\r of costume, he constantly introduces into his plays masques and\\r dances, purely for the sake of the pleasure which they give the\\r eye; and we have still his stage-directions for the three great\\r processions in HENRY THE EIGHTH, directions which are characterised\\r by the most extraordinary elaborateness of detail down to the\\r collars of S.S. and the pearls in Anne Boleyn's hair.  Indeed it\\r would be quite easy for a modern manager to reproduce these\\r pageants absolutely as Shakespeare had them designed; and so\\r accurate were they that one of the court officials of the time,\\r writing an account of the last performance of the play at the Globe\\r Theatre to a friend, actually complains of their realistic\\r character, notably of the production on the stage of the Knights of\\r the Garter in the robes and insignia of the order as being\\r calculated to bring ridicule on the real ceremonies; much in the\\r same spirit in which the French Government, some time ago,\\r prohibited that delightful actor, M. Christian, from appearing in\\r uniform, on the plea that it was prejudicial to the glory of the\\r army that a colonel should be caricatured.  And elsewhere the\\r gorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the English stage under\\r Shakespeare's influence was attacked by the contemporary critics,\\r not as a rule, however, on the grounds of the democratic tendencies\\r of realism, but usually on those moral grounds which are always the\\r last refuge of people who have no sense of beauty.\\r \\r The point, however, which I wish to emphasise is, not that\\r Shakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in adding\\r picturesqueness to poetry, but that he saw how important costume is\\r as a means of producing certain dramatic effects.  Many of his\\r plays, such as MEASURE FOR MEASURE, TWELFTH NIGHT, THE TWO\\r GENTLEMAN OF VERONA, ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, CYMBELINE, and\\r others, depend for their illusion on the character of the various\\r dresses worn by the hero or the heroine; the delightful scene in\\r HENRY THE SIXTH, on the modern miracles of healing by faith, loses\\r all its point unless Gloster is in black and scarlet; and the\\r DENOUMENT of the MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR hinges on the colour of\\r Anne Page's gown.  As for the uses Shakespeare makes of disguises\\r the instances are almost numberless.  Posthumus hides his passion\\r under a peasant's garb, and Edgar his pride beneath an idiot's\\r rags; Portia wears the apparel of a lawyer, and Rosalind is attired\\r in 'all points as a man'; the cloak-bag of Pisanio changes Imogen\\r to the Youth Fidele; Jessica flees from her father's house in boy's\\r dress, and Julia ties up her yellow hair in fantastic love-knots,\\r and dons hose and doublet; Henry the Eighth woos his lady as a\\r shepherd, and Romeo his as a pilgrim; Prince Hal and Poins appear\\r first as footpads in buckram suits, and then in white aprons and\\r leather jerkins as the waiters in a tavern-\\r \\r \\r I remember\\r The first time ever Caesar put it on.\\r 'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,\\r The day he overcame the Nervii\\r See what a rent the envious Casca made-\\r \\r \\r Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,\\r Which in the day of battle tire thee more\\r Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st.\\r \\r \\r As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, it\\r is to be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the\\r smallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historical\\r plays, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many\\r effective open-air incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who\\r had at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who\\r could rely on the actors taking pains about their make-up.  Even\\r now it is difficult to produce such a play as the COMEDY OF ERRORS;\\r and to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry's brother\\r resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing TWELFTH NIGHT\\r adequately performed.  Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare's on\\r the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires\\r the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a\\r costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a\\r master of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-\\r master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production.\\r For he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each\\r character.  'Racine abhorre la realite,' says Auguste Vacquerie\\r somewhere; 'il ne daigne pas s'occuper de son costume.  Si l'on\\r s'en rapportait aux indications du poete, Agamemnon serait vetu\\r d'un sceptre et Achille d'une epee.'  But with Shakespeare it is\\r very different.  He gives us directions about the costumes of\\r Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in MACBETH, and the\\r apothecary in ROMEO AND JULIET, several elaborate descriptions of\\r his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in\\r which Petruchio is to be married.  Rosalind, he tells us, is tall,\\r and is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and\\r is to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt.  The children\\r who play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white\\r and green - a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose\\r favourite colours they were - and in white, with green garlands and\\r gilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton.\\r Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by his\\r wearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his boots.  The\\r Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in\\r mourning beside her.  The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of the\\r Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are\\r all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue.  We know the\\r patterns on the Dauphin's armour and the Pucelle's sword, the crest\\r on Warwick's helmet and the colour of Bardolph's nose.  Portia has\\r golden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls,\\r and Sir Andrew Aguecheek's hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and\\r won't curl at all.  Some of the characters are stout, some lean,\\r some straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are\\r to blacken their faces.  Lear has a white beard, Hamlet's father a\\r grizzled, and Benedick is to shave his in the course of the play.\\r Indeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quite\\r elaborate; tells us of the many different colours in use, and gives\\r a hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on.\\r There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics in\\r hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians,\\r and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in an\\r ass's head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the\\r Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated\\r husband and his wife's milliner about the slashing of a sleeve.\\r \\r As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the\\r aphorisms he makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age,\\r particularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies' bonnets, and the\\r many descriptions of the MUNDUS MULIEBRIS, from the long of\\r Autolycus in the WINTER'S TALE down to the account of the Duchess\\r of Milan's gown in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, they are far too\\r numerous to quote; though it may be worth while to remind people\\r that the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to be found in\\r Lear's scene with Edgar - a passage which has the advantage of\\r brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing\\r metaphysics of SARTOR RESARTUS.  But I think that from what I have\\r already said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much\\r interested in costume.  I do not mean in that shallow sense by\\r which it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds and\\r daffodils that he was the Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan\\r age; but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressive\\r of a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain types\\r of character, and is one of the essential factors of the means\\r which a true illusionist has at his disposal.  Indeed to him the\\r deformed figure of Richard was of as much value as Juliet's\\r loveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks of\\r the lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each  and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one of\\r his plays, expresses his regret at being unable to produce helmets\\r of the period, he is speaking as an Elizabethan manager and not\\r merely as an Elizabethan poet.  At Cambridge, for instance, during\\r his day, a play of RICHARD THE THIRD was performed, in which the\\r actors were attired in real dresses of the time, procured from the\\r great collection of historical costume in the Tower, which was\\r always open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes placed at\\r their disposal.  And I cannot help thinking that this performance\\r must have been far more artistic, as regards costume, than\\r Garrick's mounting of Shakespeare's own play on the subject, in\\r which he himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, and\\r everybody else in the costume of the time of George the Third,\\r Richmond especially being much admired in the uniform of a young\\r guardsman.\\r \\r For what is the use to the stage of that archaeology which has so\\r strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can\\r give us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which\\r the action of the play passes?  It enables us to see a Greek\\r dressed like a Greek, and an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the\\r arcades of Venice and the balconies of Verona; and, if the play\\r deals with any of the great eras in our country's history, to\\r contemplate the age in its proper attire, and the king in his habit\\r as he lived.  And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would have\\r said some time ago, at the Princess's Theatre, had the curtain\\r risen on his father's Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair,\\r attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume\\r which in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to\\r an antique Roman!  For in those halcyon days of the drama no\\r archaeology troubled the stage, or distressed the critics, and our\\r inartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of\\r anachronisms, and beheld with the calm complacency of the age of\\r prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a Lear in lace ruffles, and\\r a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline.  I can understand archaeology\\r being attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but to\\r attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark.\\r However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as\\r well speak disrespectfully of the equator.  For archaeology, being\\r a science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply.  Its value\\r depends entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it.\\r We look to the archaeologist for the materials, to the artist for\\r the method.\\r \\r In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare's\\r plays, the first thing the artist has to settle is the best date\\r for the drama.  This should be determined by the general spirit of\\r the play, more than by any actual historical references which may\\r occur in it.  Most HAMLETS I have seen were placed far too early.\\r HAMLET is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and if\\r the allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts it\\r back to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down much\\r later.  Once, however, that the date has been fixed, then the\\r archaeologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is to\\r convert into effects.\\r \\r It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show\\r us that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a\\r great deal of capital has been made out of Hector's indiscreet\\r quotation from Aristotle.  Upon the other hand, the anachronisms\\r are really few in number, and not very important, and, had\\r Shakespeare's attention been drawn to them by a brother artist, he\\r would probably have corrected them.  For, though they can hardly be\\r called blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of his\\r work; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannot\\r be emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to\\r its proper date.  In looking at Shakespeare's plays as a whole,\\r however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelity\\r as regards his personages and his plots.  Many of his DRAMATIS\\r PERSONAE are people who had actually existed, and some of them\\r might have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience.\\r Indeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his\\r time was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.  As for his\\r plots, Shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentic\\r history, or from the old ballads and traditions which served as\\r history to the Elizabethan public, and which even now no scientific\\r historian would dismiss as absolutely untrue.  And not merely did\\r he select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of his\\r imaginative work, but he always gives to each play the general\\r character, the social atmosphere in a word, of the age in question.\\r Stupidity he recognises as being one of the permanent\\r characteristics of all European civilisations; so he sees no\\r difference between a London mob of his own day and a Roman mob of\\r pagan days, between a silly watchman in Messina and a silly Justice\\r of the Peace in Windsor.  But when he deals with higher characters,\\r with those exceptions of each age which are so fine that they\\r become its types, he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal of\\r their time.  Virgilia is one of those Roman wives on whose tomb was\\r written 'Domi mansit, lanam fecit,' as surely as Juliet is the\\r romantic girl of the Renaissance.  He is even true to the\\r characteristics of race.  Hamlet has all the imagination and\\r irresolution of the Northern nations, and the Princess Katharine is\\r as entirely French as the heroine of DIVORCONS.  Harry the Fifth is\\r a pure Englishman, and Othello a true Moor.\\r \\r Again when Shakespeare treats of the history of England from the\\r fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it is wonderful how careful\\r he is to have his facts perfectly right - indeed he follows\\r Holinshed with curious fidelity.  The incessant wars between France\\r and England are described with extraordinary accuracy down to the\\r names of the besieged towns, the ports of landing and embarkation,\\r the sites and dates of the battles, the titles of the commanders on\\r each side, and the lists of the killed and wounded.  And as regards\\r the Civil Wars of the Roses we have many elaborate genealogies of\\r the seven sons of Edward the Third; the claims of the rival Houses\\r of York and Lancaster to the throne are discussed at length; and if\\r the English aristocracy will not read Shakespeare as a poet, they\\r should certainly read him as a sort of early Peerage.  There is\\r hardly a single title in the Upper House, with the exception of\\r course of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords, which\\r does not appear in Shakespeare along with many details of family\\r history, creditable and discreditable.  Indeed if it be really\\r necessary that the School Board children should know all about the\\r Wars of the Roses, they could learn their lessons just as well out\\r of Shakespeare as out of shilling primers, and learn them, I need\\r not say, far more pleasurably.  Even in Shakespeare's own day this\\r use of his plays was recognised.  'The historical plays teach\\r history to those who cannot read it in the chronicles,' says\\r Heywood in a tract about the stage, and yet I am sure that\\r sixteenth-century chronicles were much more delightful reading than\\r nineteenth-century primers are.\\r \\r Of course the aesthetic value of Shakespeare's plays does not, in\\r the slightest degree, depend on their facts, but on their Truth,\\r and Truth is independent of facts always, inventing or selecting\\r them at pleasure.  But still Shakespeare's use of facts is a most\\r interesting part of his method of work, and shows us his attitude\\r towards the stage, and his relations to the great art of illusion.\\r Indeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classing\\r his plays with 'fairy tales,' as Lord Lytton does; for one of his\\r aims was to create for England a national historical drama, which\\r should deal with incidents with which the public was well\\r acquainted, and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people.\\r Patriotism, I need hardly say, is not a necessary quality of art;\\r but it means, for the artist, the substitution of a universal for\\r an individual feeling, and for the public the presentation of a\\r work of art in a most attractive and popular form.  It is worth\\r noticing that Shakespeare's first and last successes were both\\r historical plays.\\r \\r It may be asked, what has this to do with Shakespeare's attitude\\r towards costume?  I answer that a dramatist who laid such stress on\\r historical accuracy of fact would have welcomed historical accuracy\\r of costume as a most important adjunct to his illusionist method.\\r And I have no hesitation in saying that he did so.  The reference\\r to helmets of the period in the prologue to HENRY THE FIFTH may be\\r considered fanciful, though Shakespeare must have often seen\\r \\r \\r The very casque\\r That did affright the air at Agincourt,\\r \\r \\r where it still hangs in the dusky gloom of Westminster Abbey, along\\r with the saddle of that 'imp of fame,' and the dinted shield with\\r its torn blue velvet lining and its tarnished lilies of gold; but\\r the use of military tabards in HENRY THE SIXTH is a bit of pure\\r archaeology, as they were not worn in the sixteenth century; and\\r the King's own tabard, I may mention, was still suspended over his\\r tomb in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, in Shakespeare's day.  For,\\r up to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the Philistines in\\r 1645, the chapels and cathedrals of England were the great national\\r museums of archaeology, and in them were kept the armour and attire\\r of the heroes of English history.  A good deal was of course\\r preserved in the Tower, and even in Elizabeth's day tourists were\\r brought there to see such curious relics of the past as Charles\\r Brandon's huge lance, which is still, I believe, the admiration of\\r our country visitors; but the cathedrals and churches were, as a\\r rule, selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception of\\r the historic antiquities.  Canterbury can still show us the helm of\\r the Black Prince, Westminster the robes of our kings, and in old\\r St. Paul's the very banner that had waved on Bosworth field was\\r hung up by Richmond himself.\\r \\r In fact, everywhere that Shakespeare turned in London, he saw the\\r apparel and appurtenances of past ages, and it is impossible to\\r doubt that he made use of his opportunities.  The employment of\\r lance and shield, for instance, in actual warfare, which is so\\r frequent in his plays, is drawn from archaeology, and not from the\\r military accoutrements of his day; and his general use of armour in\\r battle was not a characteristic of his age, a time when it was\\r rapidly disappearing before firearms.  Again, the crest on\\r Warwick's helmet, of which such a point is made in HENRY THE SIXTH,\\r is absolutely correct in a fifteenth-century play when crests were\\r generally worn, but would not have been so in a play of\\r Shakespeare's own time, when feathers and plumes had taken their\\r place - a fashion which, as he tells us in HENRY THE EIGHTH, was\\r borrowed from France.  For the historical plays, then, we may be\\r sure that archaeology was employed, and as for the others I feel\\r certain that it was the case also.  The appearance of Jupiter on\\r his eagle, thunderbolt in hand, of Juno with her peacocks, and of\\r Iris with her many-coloured bow; the Amazon masque and the masque\\r of the Five Worthies, may all be regarded as archaeological; and\\r the vision which Posthumus sees in prison of Sicilius Leonatus -\\r 'an old man, attired like a warrior, leading an ancient matron' -\\r is clearly so.  Of the 'Athenian dress' by which Lysander is\\r distinguished from Oberon I have already spoken; but one of the\\r most marked instances is in the case of the dress of Coriolanus,\\r for which Shakespeare goes directly to Plutarch.  That historian,\\r in his Life of the great Roman, tells us of the oak-wreath with\\r which Caius Marcius was crowned, and of the curious kind of dress\\r in which, according to ancient fashion, he had to canvass his\\r electors; and on both of these points he enters into long\\r disquisitions, investigating the origin and meaning of the old\\r customs.  Shakespeare, in the spirit of the true artist, accepts\\r the facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic and\\r picturesque effects  and, as far as dramatic value goes, to confuse\\r the costumes is to confuse the play.  Costume is a growth, an\\r evolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, sign\\r of the manners, customs and mode of life of each century.  The\\r Puritan dislike of colour, adornment and grace in apparel was part\\r of the great revolt of the middle classes against Beauty in the\\r seventeenth century.  A historian who disregarded it would give us\\r a most inaccurate picture of the time, and a dramatist who did not\\r avail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing an\\r illusionist effect.  The effeminacy of dress that characterised the\\r reign of Richard the Second was a constant theme of contemporary\\r authors.  Shakespeare, writing two hundred years after, makes the\\r king's fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in the\\r play, from John of Gaunt's reproaches down to Richard's own speech\\r in the third act on his deposition from the throne.  And that\\r Shakespeare examined Richard's tomb in Westminster Abbey seems to\\r me certain from York's speech  it is not merely a dangerous\\r colour to wear by gaslight, but it is really difficult in England\\r to get a thoroughly good blue.  The fine Chinese blue, which we all\\r so much admire, takes two years to dye, and the English public will\\r not wait so long for a colour.  Peacock blue, of course, has been\\r employed on the stage, notably at the Lyceum, with great advantage;\\r but all attempts at a good light blue, or good dark blue, which I\\r have seen have been failures.  The value of black is hardly\\r appreciated; it was used effectively by Mr. Irving in HAMLET as the\\r central note of a composition, but as a tone-giving neutral its\\r importance is not recognised.  And this is curious, considering the\\r general colour of the dress of a century in which, as Baudelaire\\r says, 'Nous celebrons tous quelque enterrement.'  The archaeologist\\r of the future will probably point to this age as the time when the\\r beauty of black was understood; but I hardly think that, as regards\\r stage-mounting or house decoration, it really is.  Its decorative\\r value is, of course, the same as that of white or gold; it can\\r separate and harmonise colours.  In modern plays the black frock-\\r coat of the hero becomes important in itself, and should be given a\\r suitable background.  But it rarely is.  Indeed the only good\\r background for a play in modern dress which I have ever seen was\\r the dark grey and cream-white scene of the first act of the\\r PRINCESSE GEORGES in Mrs. Langtry's production.  As a rule, the\\r hero is smothered in BRIC-E-BRAC and palm-trees, lost in the gilded\\r abyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge in\\r the midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always be\\r kept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.  This, of\\r course, can only be done when there is one single mind directing\\r the whole production.  The facts of art are diverse, but the\\r essence of artistic effect is unity.  Monarchy, Anarchy, and\\r Republicanism may contend for the government of nations; but a\\r theatre should be in the power of a cultured despot.  There may be\\r division of labour, but there must be no division of mind.  Whoever\\r understands the costume of an age understands of necessity its\\r architecture and its surroundings also, and it is easy to see from\\r the chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines or\\r not.  In fact, in art there is no specialism, and a really artistic\\r production should bear the impress of one master, and one master\\r only, who not merely should design and arrange everything, but\\r should have complete control over the way in which each dress is to\\r be worn.\\r \\r Mademoiselle Mars, in the first production of HERNANI, absolutely\\r refused to call her lover 'MON LION!' unless she was allowed to\\r wear a little fashionable TOQUE then much in vogue on the\\r Boulevards; and many young ladies on our own stage insist to the\\r present day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under Greek\\r dresses, to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold; but\\r these wicked things should not be allowed.  And there should be far\\r more dress rehearsals than there are now.  Actors such as Mr.\\r Forbes-Robertson, Mr. Conway, Mr. George Alexander, and others, not\\r to mention older artists, can move with ease and elegance in the\\r attire of any century; but there are not a few who seem dreadfully\\r embarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets, and who\\r always wear their dresses as if they were costumes.  Costumes, of\\r course, they are to the designer; but dresses they should be to\\r those that wear them.  And it is time that a stop should be put to\\r the idea, very prevalent on the stage, that the Greeks and Romans\\r always went about bareheaded in the open air - a mistake the\\r Elizabethan managers did not fall into, for they gave hoods as well\\r as gowns to their Roman senators.\\r \\r More dress rehearsals would also be of value in explaining to the\\r actors that there is a form of gesture and movement that is not\\r merely appropriate to each style of dress, but really conditioned\\r by it.  The extravagant use of the arms in the eighteenth century,\\r for instance, was the necessary result of the large hoop, and the\\r solemn dignity of Burleigh owed as much to his ruff as to his\\r reason.  Besides until an actor is at home in his dress, he is not\\r at home in his part.\\r \\r Of the value of beautiful costume in creating an artistic\\r temperament in the audience, and producing that joy in beauty for\\r beauty's sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never\\r be understood, I will not here speak; though it is worth while to\\r notice how Shakespeare appreciated that side of the question in the\\r production of his tragedies, acting them always by artificial\\r light, and in a theatre hung with black; but what I have tried to\\r point out is that archaeology is not a pedantic method, but a\\r method of artistic illusion, and that costume is a means of\\r displaying character without description, and of producing dramatic\\r situations and dramatic effects.  And I think it is a pity that so\\r many critics should have set themselves to attack one of the most\\r important movements on the modern stage before that movement has at\\r all reached its proper perfection.  That it will do so, however, I\\r feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics\\r in the future higher qualification than that they can remember\\r Macready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them,\\r indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty.  POUR ETRE PLUS\\r DIFFICILE, LA TACHE N'EN EST QUE PLUS GLORIEUSE.  And if they will\\r not encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of which\\r Shakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it has\\r the illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beauty\\r for its result.  Not that I agree with everything that I have said\\r in this essay.  There is much with which I entirely disagree.  The\\r essay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in aesthetic\\r criticism attitude is everything.  For in art there is no such\\r thing as a universal truth.  A Truth in art is that whose\\r contradictory is also true.

And elsewhere the\rgorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the English stage under\rShakespeare's influence was attacked by the contemporary critics,\rnot as a rule, however, on the grounds of the democratic tendencies\rof realism, but usually on those moral grounds which are always the\rlast refuge of people who have no sense of beauty."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The point, however, which I wish to emphasise is, not that\rShakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in adding\rpicturesqueness to poetry, but that he saw how important costume is\ras a means of producing certain dramatic effects.

Even\rnow it is difficult to produce such a play as the COMEDY OF ERRORS;\rand to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry's brother\rresembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing TWELFTH NIGHT\radequately performed.  Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare's on\rthe stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires\rthe services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a\rcostumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a\rmaster of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-\rmaster, and an artist to direct personally the whole production.\rFor he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each\rcharacter.  'Racine abhorre la realite,' says Auguste Vacquerie\rsomewhere; 'il ne daigne pas s'occuper de son costume.  Si l'on\rs'en rapportait aux indications du poete, Agamemnon serait vetu\rd'un sceptre et Achille d'une epee.'  But with Shakespeare it is\rvery different.  He gives us directions about the costumes of\rPerdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in MACBETH, and the\rapothecary in ROMEO AND JULIET, several elaborate descriptions of\rhis fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in\rwhich Petruchio is to be married.  Rosalind, he tells us, is tall,\rand is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and\ris to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt.  The children\rwho play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white\rand green - a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose\rfavourite colours they were - and in white, with green garlands and\rgilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton.\rBottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by his\rwearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his boots.  The\rDuchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in\rmourning beside her.  The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of the\rCardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are\rall made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue.  We know the\rpatterns on the Dauphin's armour and the Pucelle's sword, the crest\ron Warwick's helmet and the colour of Bardolph's nose.  Portia has\rgolden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls,\rand Sir Andrew Aguecheek's hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and\rwon't curl at all.  Some of the characters are stout, some lean,\rsome straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are\rto blacken their faces.  Lear has a white beard, Hamlet's father a\rgrizzled, and Benedick is to shave his in the course of the play.\rIndeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quite\relaborate; tells us of the many different colours in use, and gives\ra hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on.\rThere is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics in\rhairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians,\rand a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in an\rass's head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the\rLord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated\rhusband and his wife's milliner about the slashing of a sleeve."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the\raphorisms he makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age,\rparticularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies' bonnets, and the\rmany descriptions of the MUNDUS MULIEBRIS, from the long of\rAutolycus in the WINTER'S TALE down to the account of the Duchess\rof Milan's gown in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, they are far too\rnumerous to quote; though it may be worth while to remind people\rthat the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to be found in\rLear's scene with Edgar - a passage which has the advantage of\rbrevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing\rmetaphysics of SARTOR RESARTUS.  But I think that from what I have\ralready said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much\rinterested in costume.  I do not mean in that shallow sense by\rwhich it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds and\rdaffodils that he was the Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan\rage; but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressive\rof a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain types\rof character, and is one of the essential factors of the means\rwhich a true illusionist has at his disposal.  Indeed to him the\rdeformed figure of Richard was of as much value as Juliet's\rloveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks of\rthe lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each:  he has\ras much delight in Caliban as he has in Ariel, in rags as he has in\rcloth of gold, and recognises the artistic beauty of ugliness."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The difficulty Ducis felt about translating OTHELLO in consequence\rof the importance given to such a vulgar thing as a handkerchief,\rand his attempt to soften its grossness by making the Moor\rreiterate 'Le bandeau! le bandeau!' may be taken as an example of\rthe difference between LA TRAGEDIE PHILOSOPHIQUE and the drama of\rreal life; and the introduction for the first time of the word\rMOUCHOIR at the Theatre Francais was an era in that romantic-\rrealistic movement of which Hugo is the father and M.

After\rthat revival of the classical forms of architecture which was one\rof the notes of the Renaissance, and the printing at Venice and\relsewhere of the masterpieces of Greek and Latin literature, had\rcome naturally an interest in the ornamentation and costume of the\rantique world.  Nor was it for the learning that they could\racquire, but rather for the loveliness that they might create, that\rthe artists studied these things.  The curious objects that were\rbeing constantly brought to light by excavations were not left to\rmoulder in a museum, for the contemplation of a callous curator,\rand the ENNUI of a policeman bored by the absence of crime.  They\rwere used as motives for the production of a new art, which was to\rbe not beautiful merely, but also strange."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Infessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the Appian\rWay came across an old Roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name\r'Julia, daughter of Claudius.'  On opening the coffer they found\rwithin its marble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about\rfifteen years of age, preserved by the embalmer's skill from\rcorruption and the decay of time.  Her eyes were half open, her\rhair rippled round her in crisp curling gold, and from her lips and\rcheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet departed.  Borne back to\rthe Capitol, she became at once the centre of a new cult, and from\rall parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at the wonderful\rshrine, till the Pope, fearing lest those who had found the secret\rof beauty in a Pagan tomb might forget what secrets Judaea's rough\rand rock-hewn sepulchre contained, had the body conveyed away by\rnight, and in secret buried.  Legend though it may be, yet the\rstory is none the less valuable as showing us the attitude of the\rRenaissance towards the antique world.  Archaeology to them was not\ra mere science for the antiquarian; it was a means by which they\rcould touch the dry dust of antiquity into the very breath and\rbeauty of life, and fill with the new wine of romanticism forms\rthat else had been old and outworn.  From the pulpit of Niccola\rPisano down to Mantegna's 'Triumph of Caesar,' and the service\rCellini designed for King Francis, the influence of this spirit can\rbe traced; nor was it confined merely to the immobile arts - the\rarts of arrested movement - but its influence was to be seen also\rin the great Graeco-Roman masques which were the constant amusement\rof the gay courts of the time, and in the public pomps and\rprocessions with which the citizens of big commercial towns were\rwont to greet the princes that chanced to visit them; pageants, by\rthe way, which were considered so important that large prints were\rmade of them and published - a fact which is a proof of the general\rinterest at the time in matters of such kind."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And this use of archaeology in shows, so far from being a bit of\rpriggish pedantry, is in every way legitimate and beautiful.  For\rthe stage is not merely the meeting-place of all the arts, but is\ralso the return of art to life.  Sometimes in an archaeological\rnovel the use of strange and obsolete terms seems to hide the\rreality beneath the learning, and I dare say that many of the\rreaders of NOTRE DAME DE PARIS have been much puzzled over the\rmeaning of such expressions as LA CASAQUE E MAHOITRES, LES\rVOULGIERS, LE GALLIMARD TACHE D'ENCRE, LES CRAAQUINIERS, and the\rlike; but with the stage how different it is!  The ancient world\rwakes from its sleep, and history moves as a pageant before our\reyes, without obliging us to have recourse to a dictionary or an\rencyclopaedia for the perfection of our enjoyment.  Indeed, there\ris not the slightest necessity that the public should know the\rauthorities for the mounting of any piece.  From such materials,\rfor instance, as the disk of Theodosius, materials with which the\rmajority of people are probably not very familiar, Mr. E. W.\rGodwin, one of the most artistic spirits of this century in\rEngland, created the marvellous loveliness of the first act of\rCLAUDIAN, and showed us the life of Byzantium in the fourth\rcentury, not by a dreary lecture and a set of grimy casts, not by a\rnovel which requires a glossary to explain it, but by the visible\rpresentation before us of all the glory of that great town.  And\rwhile the costumes were true to the smallest points of colour and\rdesign, yet the details were not assigned that abnormal importance\rwhich they must necessarily be given in a piecemeal lecture, but\rwere subordinated to the rules of lofty composition and the unity\rof artistic effect.  Mr. Symonds, speaking of that great picture of\rMantegna's, now in Hampton Court, says that the artist has\rconverted an antiquarian motive into a theme for melodies of line.\rThe same could have been said with equal justice of Mr. Godwin's\rscene.  Only the foolish called it pedantry, only those who would\rneither look nor listen spoke of the passion of the play being\rkilled by its paint.  It was in reality a scene not merely perfect\rin its picturesqueness, but absolutely dramatic also, getting rid\rof any necessity for tedious descriptions, and showing us, by the\rcolour and character of Claudian's dress, and the dress of his\rattendants, the whole nature and life of the man, from what school\rof philosophy he affected, down to what horses he backed on the\rturf."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And indeed archaeology is only really delightful when transfused\rinto some form of art.

Europe began to\rinvestigate its own clothes, and the amount of books published on\rnational costumes is quite extraordinary.  At the beginning of the\rcentury the NUREMBERG CHRONICLE, with its two thousand\rillustrations, reached its fifth edition, and before the century\rwas over seventeen editions were published of Munster's\rCOSMOGRAPHY.

And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would have\rsaid some time ago, at the Princess's Theatre, had the curtain\rrisen on his father's Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair,\rattired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume\rwhich in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to\ran antique Roman!

I can understand archaeology\rbeing attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but to\rattack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark.\rHowever, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as\rwell speak disrespectfully of the equator.

Most HAMLETS I have seen were placed far too early.\rHAMLET is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and if\rthe allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts it\rback to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down much\rlater.  Once, however, that the date has been fixed, then the\rarchaeologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is to\rconvert into effects."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show\rus that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a\rgreat deal of capital has been made out of Hector's indiscreet\rquotation from Aristotle.  Upon the other hand, the anachronisms\rare really few in number, and not very important, and, had\rShakespeare's attention been drawn to them by a brother artist, he\rwould probably have corrected them.  For, though they can hardly be\rcalled blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of his\rwork; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannot\rbe emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to\rits proper date.  In looking at Shakespeare's plays as a whole,\rhowever, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelity\ras regards his personages and his plots.  Many of his DRAMATIS\rPERSONAE are people who had actually existed, and some of them\rmight have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience.\rIndeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his\rtime was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.  As for his\rplots, Shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentic\rhistory, or from the old ballads and traditions which served as\rhistory to the Elizabethan public, and which even now no scientific\rhistorian would dismiss as absolutely untrue.  And not merely did\rhe select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of his\rimaginative work, but he always gives to each play the general\rcharacter, the social atmosphere in a word, of the age in question.\rStupidity he recognises as being one of the permanent\rcharacteristics of all European civilisations; so he sees no\rdifference between a London mob of his own day and a Roman mob of\rpagan days, between a silly watchman in Messina and a silly Justice\rof the Peace in Windsor.  But when he deals with higher characters,\rwith those exceptions of each age which are so fine that they\rbecome its types, he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal of\rtheir time.  Virgilia is one of those Roman wives on whose tomb was\rwritten 'Domi mansit, lanam fecit,' as surely as Juliet is the\rromantic girl of the Renaissance.  He is even true to the\rcharacteristics of race.  Hamlet has all the imagination and\rirresolution of the Northern nations, and the Princess Katharine is\ras entirely French as the heroine of DIVORCONS.  Harry the Fifth is\ra pure Englishman, and Othello a true Moor."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Again when Shakespeare treats of the history of England from the\rfourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it is wonderful how careful\rhe is to have his facts perfectly right - indeed he follows\rHolinshed with curious fidelity.  The incessant wars between France\rand England are described with extraordinary accuracy down to the\rnames of the besieged towns, the ports of landing and embarkation,\rthe sites and dates of the battles, the titles of the commanders on\reach side, and the lists of the killed and wounded.  And as regards\rthe Civil Wars of the Roses we have many elaborate genealogies of\rthe seven sons of Edward the Third; the claims of the rival Houses\rof York and Lancaster to the throne are discussed at length; and if\rthe English aristocracy will not read Shakespeare as a poet, they\rshould certainly read him as a sort of early Peerage.  There is\rhardly a single title in the Upper House, with the exception of\rcourse of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords, which\rdoes not appear in Shakespeare along with many details of family\rhistory, creditable and discreditable.  Indeed if it be really\rnecessary that the School Board children should know all about the\rWars of the Roses, they could learn their lessons just as well out\rof Shakespeare as out of shilling primers, and learn them, I need\rnot say, far more pleasurably.  Even in Shakespeare's own day this\ruse of his plays was recognised.  'The historical plays teach\rhistory to those who cannot read it in the chronicles,' says\rHeywood in a tract about the stage, and yet I am sure that\rsixteenth-century chronicles were much more delightful reading than\rnineteenth-century primers are."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Of course the aesthetic value of Shakespeare's plays does not, in\rthe slightest degree, depend on their facts, but on their Truth,\rand Truth is independent of facts always, inventing or selecting\rthem at pleasure.  But still Shakespeare's use of facts is a most\rinteresting part of his method of work, and shows us his attitude\rtowards the stage, and his relations to the great art of illusion.\rIndeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classing\rhis plays with 'fairy tales,' as Lord Lytton does; for one of his\raims was to create for England a national historical drama, which\rshould deal with incidents with which the public was well\racquainted, and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people.\rPatriotism, I need hardly say, is not a necessary quality of art;\rbut it means, for the artist, the substitution of a universal for\ran individual feeling, and for the public the presentation of a\rwork of art in a most attractive and popular form.

For,\rup to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the Philistines in\r1645, the chapels and cathedrals of England were the great national\rmuseums of archaeology, and in them were kept the armour and attire\rof the heroes of English history.  A good deal was of course\rpreserved in the Tower, and even in Elizabeth's day tourists were\rbrought there to see such curious relics of the past as Charles\rBrandon's huge lance, which is still, I believe, the admiration of\rour country visitors; but the cathedrals and churches were, as a\rrule, selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception of\rthe historic antiquities.  Canterbury can still show us the helm of\rthe Black Prince, Westminster the robes of our kings, and in old\rSt. Paul's the very banner that had waved on Bosworth field was\rhung up by Richmond himself."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In fact, everywhere that Shakespeare turned in London, he saw the\rapparel and appurtenances of past ages, and it is impossible to\rdoubt that he made use of his opportunities.  The employment of\rlance and shield, for instance, in actual warfare, which is so\rfrequent in his plays, is drawn from archaeology, and not from the\rmilitary accoutrements of his day; and his general use of armour in\rbattle was not a characteristic of his age, a time when it was\rrapidly disappearing before firearms.  Again, the crest on\rWarwick's helmet, of which such a point is made in HENRY THE SIXTH,\ris absolutely correct in a fifteenth-century play when crests were\rgenerally worn, but would not have been so in a play of\rShakespeare's own time, when feathers and plumes had taken their\rplace - a fashion which, as he tells us in HENRY THE EIGHTH, was\rborrowed from France.  For the historical plays, then, we may be\rsure that archaeology was employed, and as for the others I feel\rcertain that it was the case also.  The appearance of Jupiter on\rhis eagle, thunderbolt in hand, of Juno with her peacocks, and of\rIris with her many-coloured bow; the Amazon masque and the masque\rof the Five Worthies, may all be regarded as archaeological; and\rthe vision which Posthumus sees in prison of Sicilius Leonatus -\r'an old man, attired like a warrior, leading an ancient matron' -\ris clearly so.  Of the 'Athenian dress' by which Lysander is\rdistinguished from Oberon I have already spoken; but one of the\rmost marked instances is in the case of the dress of Coriolanus,\rfor which Shakespeare goes directly to Plutarch.  That historian,\rin his Life of the great Roman, tells us of the oak-wreath with\rwhich Caius Marcius was crowned, and of the curious kind of dress\rin which, according to ancient fashion, he had to canvass his\relectors; and on both of these points he enters into long\rdisquisitions, investigating the origin and meaning of the old\rcustoms.  Shakespeare, in the spirit of the true artist, accepts\rthe facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic and\rpicturesque effects:  indeed the gown of humility, the 'woolvish\rgown,' as Shakespeare calls it, is the central note of the play.\rThere are other cases I might quote, but this one is quite\rsufficient for my purpose; and it is evident from it at any rate\rthat, in mounting a play in the accurate costume of the time,\raccording to the best authorities, we are carrying out\rShakespeare's own wishes and method."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Even if it were not so, there is no more reason that we should\rcontinue any imperfections which may be supposed to have\rcharacterised Shakespeare's stage mounting than that we should have\rJuliet played by a young man, or give up the advantage of\rchangeable scenery.  A great work of dramatic art should not merely\rbe made expressive of modern passion by means of the actor, but\rshould be presented to us in the form most suitable to the modern\rspirit.  Racine produced his Roman plays in Louis Quatorze dress on\ra stage crowded with spectators; but we require different\rconditions for the enjoyment of his art.  Perfect accuracy of\rdetail, for the sake of perfect illusion, is necessary for us.\rWhat we have to see is that the details are not allowed to usurp\rthe principal place.  They must be subordinate always to the\rgeneral motive of the play.

It is true that he has made certain concessions in the\rcase of the employment of curious or strange expressions.  Ruy Blas\rtalks of M, de Priego as 'sujet du roi' instead of 'noble du roi,'\rand Angelo Malipieri speaks of 'la croix rouge' instead of 'la\rcroix de gueules.'  But they are concessions made to the public, or\rrather to a section of it.  'J'en offre ici toute mes excuses aux\rspectateurs intelligents,' he says in a note to one of the plays;\r'esperons qu'un jour un seigneur venitien pourra dire tout\rbonnement sans peril son blason sur le theatre.  C'est un progres\rqui viendra.'  And, though the description of the crest is not\rcouched in accurate language, still the crest itself was accurately\rright.  It may, of course, be said that the public do not notice\rthese things; upon the other hand, it should be remembered that Art\rhas no other aim but her own perfection, and proceeds simply by her\rown laws, and that the play which Hamlet describes as being caviare\rto the general is a play he highly praises.  Besides, in England,\rat any rate, the public have undergone a transformation; there is\rfar more appreciation of beauty now than there was a few years ago;\rand though they may not be familiar with the authorities and\rarchaeological data for what is shown to them, still they enjoy\rwhatever loveliness they look at.  And this is the important thing.\rBetter to take pleasure in a rose than to put its root under a\rmicroscope.  Archaeological accuracy is merely a condition of\rillusionist stage effect; it is not its quality.  And Lord Lytton's\rproposal that the dresses should merely be beautiful without being\raccurate is founded on a misapprehension of the nature of costume,\rand of its value on the stage.  This value is twofold, picturesque\rand dramatic; the former depends on the colour of the dress, the\rlatter on its design and character.  But so interwoven are the two\rthat, whenever in our own day historical accuracy has been\rdisregarded, and the various dresses in a play taken from different\rages, the result has been that the stage has been turned into that\rchaos of costume, that caricature of the centuries, the Fancy Dress\rBall, to the entire ruin of all dramatic and picturesque effect.\rFor the dresses of one age do not artistically harmonise with the\rdresses of another:  and, as far as dramatic value goes, to confuse\rthe costumes is to confuse the play.  Costume is a growth, an\revolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, sign\rof the manners, customs and mode of life of each century.  The\rPuritan dislike of colour, adornment and grace in apparel was part\rof the great revolt of the middle classes against Beauty in the\rseventeenth century.  A historian who disregarded it would give us\ra most inaccurate picture of the time, and a dramatist who did not\ravail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing an\rillusionist effect.  The effeminacy of dress that characterised the\rreign of Richard the Second was a constant theme of contemporary\rauthors.  Shakespeare, writing two hundred years after, makes the\rking's fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in the\rplay, from John of Gaunt's reproaches down to Richard's own speech\rin the third act on his deposition from the throne.  And that\rShakespeare examined Richard's tomb in Westminster Abbey seems to\rme certain from York's speech:-"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"See, see, King Richard doth himself appear\rAs doth the blushing discontented sun\rFrom out the fiery portal of the east,\rWhen he perceives the envious clouds are bent\rTo dim his glory."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"For we can still discern on the King's robe his favourite badge -\rthe sun issuing from a cloud.  In fact, in every age the social\rconditions are so exemplified in costume, that to produce a\rsixteenth-century play in fourteenth-century attire, or VICE VERSA,\rwould make the performance seem unreal because untrue.  And,\rvaluable as beauty of effect on the stage is, the highest beauty is\rnot merely comparable with absolute accuracy of detail, but really\rdependent on it.  To invent, an entirely new costume is almost\rimpossible except in burlesque or extravaganza, and as for\rcombining the dress of different centuries into one, the experiment\rwould be dangerous, and Shakespeare's opinion of the artistic value\rof such a medley may be gathered from his incessant satire of the\rElizabethan dandies for imagining that they were well dressed\rbecause they got their doublets in Italy, their hats in Germany,\rand their hose in France.  And it should be noted that the most\rlovely scenes that have been produced on our stage have been those\rthat have been characterised by perfect accuracy, such as Mr. and\rMrs. Bancroft's eighteenth-century revivals at the Haymarket, Mr.\rIrying's superb production of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and Mr,\rBarrett's CLAUDIAN.  Besides, and this is perhaps the most complete\ranswer to Lord Lytton's theory, it must be remembered that neither\rin costume nor in dialogue is beauty the dramatist's primary aim at\rall.  The true dramatist aims first at what is characteristic, and\rno more desires that all his personages should be beautifully\rattired than he desires that they should all have beautiful natures\ror speak beautiful English.  The true dramatist, in fact, shows us\rlife under the conditions of art, not art in the form of life.  The\rGreek dress was the loveliest dress the world has ever seen, and\rthe English dress of the last century one of the most monstrous;\ryet we cannot costume a play by Sheridan as we would costume a play\rby Sophokles.  For, as Polonius says in his excellent lecture, a\rlecture to which I am glad to have the opportunity of expressing my\robligations, one of the first qualities of apparel is its\rexpressiveness.  And the affected style of dress in the last\rcentury was the natural characteristic of a society of affected\rmanners and affected conversation - a characteristic which the\rrealistic dramatist will highly value down to the smallest detail\rof accuracy, and the materials for which he can get only from\rarchaeology."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But it is not enough that a dress should be accurate; it must be\ralso appropriate to the stature and appearance of the actor, and to\rhis supposed condition, as well as to his necessary action in the\rplay.  In Mr. Hare's production OF AS YOU LIKE IT at the St.\rJames's Theatre, for instance, the whole point of Orlando's\rcomplaint that he is brought up like a peasant, and not like a\rgentleman, was spoiled by the gorgeousness of his dress, and the\rsplendid apparel worn by the banished Duke and his friends was\rquite out of place.  Mr. Lewis Wingfield's explanation that the\rsumptuary laws of the period necessitated their doing so, is, I am\rafraid, hardly sufficient.  Outlaws, lurking in a forest and living\rby the chase, are not very likely to care much about ordinances of\rdress.  They were probably attired like Robin Hood's men, to whom,\rindeed, they are compared in the course of the play.  And that\rtheir dress was not that of wealthy noblemen may be seen by\rOrlando's words when he breaks in upon them.  He mistakes them for\rrobbers, and is amazed to find that they answer him in courteous\rand gentle terms.  Lady Archibald Campbell's production, under Mr.\rE. W. Godwin's direction, of the same play in Coombe Wood was, as\rregards mounting, far more artistic.  At least it seemed so to me.\rThe Duke and his companions were dressed in serge tunics, leathern\rjerkins, high boots and gauntlets, and wore bycocket hats and\rhoods.  And as they were playing in a real forest, they found, I am\rsure, their dresses extremely convenient.  To every character in\rthe play was given a perfectly appropriate attire, and the brown\rand green of their costumes harmonised exquisitely with the ferns\rthrough which they wandered, the trees beneath which they lay, and\rthe lovely English landscape that surrounded the Pastoral Players.\rThe perfect naturalness of the scene was due to the absolute\raccuracy and appropriateness of everything that was worn.  Nor\rcould archaeology have been put to a severer test, or come out of\rit more triumphantly.  The whole production showed once for all\rthat, unless a dress is archaeologically correct, and artistically\rappropriate, it always looks unreal, unnatural, and theatrical in\rthe sense of artificial."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Nor, again, is it enough that there should be accurate and\rappropriate costumes of beautiful colours; there must be also\rbeauty of colour on the stage as a whole, and as long as the\rbackground is painted by one artist, and the foreground figures\rindependently designed by another, there is the danger of a want of\rharmony in the scene as a picture.  For each scene the colour-\rscheme should be settled as absolutely as for the decoration of a\rroom, and the textures which it is proposed to use should be mixed\rand re-mixed in every possible combination, and what is discordant\rremoved.  Then, as regards the particular kinds of colours, the\rstage is often too glaring, partly through the excessive use of\rhot, violent reds, and partly through the costumes looking too new.\rShabbiness, which in modern life is merely the tendency of the\rlower orders towards tone, is not without its artistic value, and\rmodern colours are often much improved by being a little faded.\rBlue also is too frequently used:  it is not merely a dangerous\rcolour to wear by gaslight, but it is really difficult in England\rto get a thoroughly good blue.  The fine Chinese blue, which we all\rso much admire, takes two years to dye, and the English public will\rnot wait so long for a colour.  Peacock blue, of course, has been\remployed on the stage, notably at the Lyceum, with great advantage;\rbut all attempts at a good light blue, or good dark blue, which I\rhave seen have been failures.  The value of black is hardly\rappreciated; it was used effectively by Mr. Irving in HAMLET as the\rcentral note of a composition, but as a tone-giving neutral its\rimportance is not recognised.  And this is curious, considering the\rgeneral colour of the dress of a century in which, as Baudelaire\rsays, 'Nous celebrons tous quelque enterrement.'  The archaeologist\rof the future will probably point to this age as the time when the\rbeauty of black was understood; but I hardly think that, as regards\rstage-mounting or house decoration, it really is.  Its decorative\rvalue is, of course, the same as that of white or gold; it can\rseparate and harmonise colours.  In modern plays the black frock-\rcoat of the hero becomes important in itself, and should be given a\rsuitable background.  But it rarely is.  Indeed the only good\rbackground for a play in modern dress which I have ever seen was\rthe dark grey and cream-white scene of the first act of the\rPRINCESSE GEORGES in Mrs. Langtry's production.  As a rule, the\rhero is smothered in BRIC-E-BRAC and palm-trees, lost in the gilded\rabyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge in\rthe midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always be\rkept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.  This, of\rcourse, can only be done when there is one single mind directing\rthe whole production.  The facts of art are diverse, but the\ressence of artistic effect is unity.  Monarchy, Anarchy, and\rRepublicanism may contend for the government of nations; but a\rtheatre should be in the power of a cultured despot.  There may be\rdivision of labour, but there must be no division of mind.  Whoever\runderstands the costume of an age understands of necessity its\rarchitecture and its surroundings also, and it is easy to see from\rthe chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines or\rnot.  In fact, in art there is no specialism, and a really artistic\rproduction should bear the impress of one master, and one master\ronly, who not merely should design and arrange everything, but\rshould have complete control over the way in which each dress is to\rbe worn."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Mademoiselle Mars, in the first production of HERNANI, absolutely\rrefused to call her lover 'MON LION!' unless she was allowed to\rwear a little fashionable TOQUE then much in vogue on the\rBoulevards; and many young ladies on our own stage insist to the\rpresent day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under Greek\rdresses, to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold; but\rthese wicked things should not be allowed.  And there should be far\rmore dress rehearsals than there are now.  Actors such as Mr.\rForbes-Robertson, Mr. Conway, Mr. George Alexander, and others, not\rto mention older artists, can move with ease and elegance in the\rattire of any century; but there are not a few who seem dreadfully\rembarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets, and who\ralways wear their dresses as if they were costumes.  Costumes, of\rcourse, they are to the designer; but dresses they should be to\rthose that wear them.

And I think it is a pity that so\rmany critics should have set themselves to attack one of the most\rimportant movements on the modern stage before that movement has at\rall reached its proper perfection.

And if they will\rnot encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of which\rShakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it has\rthe illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beauty\rfor its result.  Not that I agree with everything that I have said\rin this essay.  There is much with which I entirely disagree.  The\ressay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in aesthetic\rcriticism attitude is everything.  For in art there is no such\rthing as a universal truth.
