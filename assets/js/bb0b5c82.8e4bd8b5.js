But Oedipus, instructed by  an\r\noracle  that he had reached his final resting-place, refuses to  stir,\r\nand the stranger consents to go and consult the Elders of Colonus (the\r\nChorus  of  the Play).  Conducted to the spot they pity at  first  the\r\nblind  beggar  and  his daughter, but on learning his  name  they  are\r\nhorror-striken  and  order him to quit the land.  He  appeals  to  the\r\nworld-famed hospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that  his\r\ncoming will confer on the State.  They agree to await the decision  of\r\nKing  Theseus.

But Oedipus spurns the  hypocrite,\r\nand invokes a dire curse on both his unnatural sons.
