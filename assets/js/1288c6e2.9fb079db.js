Put to nurse in the country and forgotten by my family for\r\nover three years, I was treated with such indifference on my return to\r\nthe parental roof that even the servants pitied me. I do not know to\r\nwhat feeling or happy accident I owed my rescue from this first\r\nneglect; as a child I was ignorant of it, as a man I have not\r\ndiscovered it.

The compact in virtue of which\r\nchildren hide each other's peccadilloes, and which early teaches them\r\nthe principles of honor, was null and void in my case; more than that,\r\nI was often punished for my brother's faults, without being allowed to\r\nprove the injustice.

I blessed the neglect in which I lived, and rejoiced\r\nthat I could stay alone in the garden and play with the pebbles and\r\nwatch the insects and gaze into the blueness of the sky. Though my\r\nloneliness naturally led me to reverie, my liking for contemplation\r\nwas first aroused by an incident which will give you an idea of my\r\nearly troubles. So little notice was taken of me that the governess\r\noccasionally forgot to send me to bed. One evening I was peacefully\r\ncrouching under a fig-tree, watching a star with that passion of\r\ncuriosity which takes possession of a child\'s mind, and to which my\r\nprecocious melancholy gave a sort of sentimental intuition. My sisters\r\nwere playing about and laughing; I heard their distant chatter like an\r\naccompaniment to my thoughts. After a while the noise ceased and\r\ndarkness fell. My mother happened to notice my absence. To escape\r\nblame, our governess, a terrible Mademoiselle Caroline, worked upon my\r\nmother\'s fears,--told her I had a horror of my home and would long ago\r\nhave run away if she had not watched me; that I was not stupid but\r\nsullen; and that in all her experience of children she had never known\r\none of so bad a disposition as mine. She pretended to search for me. I\r\nanswered as soon as I was called, and she came to the fig-tree, where\r\nshe very well knew I was. "What are you doing there?" she asked.\r\n"Watching a star." "You were not watching a star," said my mother, who\r\nwas listening on her balcony; "children of your age know nothing of\r\nastronomy." "Ah, madame," cried Mademoiselle Caroline, "he has opened\r\nthe faucet of the reservoir; the garden is inundated!" Then there was\r\na general excitement. The fact was that my sisters had amused\r\nthemselves by turning the cock to see the water flow, but a sudden\r\nspurt wet them all over and frightened them so much that they ran away\r\nwithout closing it. Accused and convicted of this piece of mischief\r\nand told that I lied when I denied it, I was severely punished.

At\r\ntwelve years of age, long after I was at school, I still watched that\r\nstar with indescribable delight,--so deep and lasting are the\r\nimpressions we receive in the dawn of life."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'My brother Charles, five years older than I and as handsome a boy as\r\nhe now is a man, was the favorite of my father, the idol of my mother,\r\nand consequently the sovereign of the house. He was robust and well-\r\nmade, and had a tutor. I, puny and even sickly, was sent at five years\r\nof age as day pupil to a school in the town; taken in the morning and\r\nbrought back at night by my father\'s valet. I was sent with a scanty\r\nlunch, while my school-fellows brought plenty of good food. This\r\ntrifling contrast between my privations and their prosperity made me\r\nsuffer deeply. The famous potted pork prepared at Tours and called\r\n"rillettes" and "rillons" was the chief feature of their mid-day meal,\r\nbetween the early breakfast and the parent\'s dinner, which was ready\r\nwhen we returned from school. This preparation of meat, much prized by\r\ncertain gourmands, is seldom seen at Tours on aristocratic tables; if\r\nI had ever heard of it before I went to school, I certainly had never\r\nhad the happiness of seeing that brown mess spread on slices of bread\r\nand butter. Nevertheless, my desire for those "rillons" was so great\r\nthat it grew to be a fixed idea, like the longing of an elegant\r\nParisian duchess for the stews cooked by a porter\'s wife,--longings\r\nwhich, being a woman, she found means to satisfy. Children guess each\r\nother\'s covetousness, just as you are able to read a man\'s love, by\r\nthe look in the eyes; consequently I became an admirable butt for\r\nridicule. My comrades, nearly all belonging to the lower bourgeoisie,\r\nwould show me their "rillons" and ask if I knew how they were made and\r\nwhere they were sold, and why it was that I never had any. They licked\r\ntheir lips as they talked of them--scraps of pork pressed in their own\r\nfat and looking like cooked truffles; they inspected my lunch-basket,\r\nand finding nothing better than Olivet cheese or dried fruits, they\r\nplagued me with questions: "Is that all you have? have you really\r\nnothing else?"--speeches which made me realize the difference between\r\nmy brother and myself.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'This contrast between my own abandonment and the happiness of others\r\nnipped the roses of my childhood and blighted my budding youth. The\r\nfirst time that I, mistaking my comrades\' actions for generosity, put\r\nforth my hand to take the dainty I had so long coveted and which was\r\nnow hypocritically held out to me, my tormentor pulled back his slice\r\nto the great delight of his comrades who were expecting that result.\r\nIf noble and distinguished minds are, as we often find them, capable\r\nof vanity, can we blame the child who weeps when despised and jeered\r\nat? Under such a trial many boys would have turned into gluttons and\r\ncringing beggars. I fought to escape my persecutors. The courage of\r\ndespair made me formidable; but I was hated, and thus had no\r\nprotection against treachery. One evening as I left school I was\r\nstruck in the back by a handful of small stones tied in a\r\nhandkerchief.

Again I was shut up within myself\r\nand had no vent for the feelings with which my heart was full. The\r\nmaster of the school, observing that I was gloomy, disliked by my\r\ncomrades, and always alone, confirmed the family verdict as to my\r\nsulky temper. As soon as I could read and write, my mother transferred\r\nme to Pont-le-Voy, a school in charge of Oratorians who took boys of\r\nmy age into a form called the "class of the Latin steps" where dull\r\nlads with torpid brains were apt to linger.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'There I remained eight years without seeing my family; living the life\r\nof a pariah,--partly for the following reason.

Unable to buy stilts or skipping-ropes, or any of the\r\nthings that were used in the playground, I was driven out of the\r\ngames; to gain admission on suffrage I should have had to toady the\r\nrich and flatter the strong of my division. My heart rose against\r\neither of these meannesses, which, however, most children readily\r\nemploy. I lived under a tree, lost in dejected thought, or reading the\r\nbooks distributed to us monthly by the librarian. How many griefs were\r\nin the shadow of that solitude; what genuine anguish filled my\r\nneglected life! Imagine what my sore heart felt when, at the first\r\ndistribution of prizes,--of which I obtained the two most valued,\r\nnamely, for theme and for translation,--neither my father nor my\r\nmother was present in the theatre when I came forward to receive the\r\nawards amid general acclamations, although the building was filled\r\nwith the relatives of all my comrades. Instead of kissing the\r\ndistributor, according to custom, I burst into tears and threw myself\r\non his breast. That night I burned my crowns in the stove. The parents\r\nof the other boys were in town for a whole week preceding the\r\ndistribution of the prizes, and my comrades departed joyfully the next\r\nday; while I, whose father and mother were only a few miles distant,\r\nremained at the school with the "outremers,"--a name given to scholars\r\nwhose families were in the colonies or in foreign countries.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"You will notice throughout how my unhappiness increased in proportion\r\nas the social spheres on which I entered widened.

To persuade my parents to come and see me, I wrote\r\nthem letters full of feeling, too emphatically worded, it may be; but\r\nsurely such letters ought not to have drawn upon me my mother's\r\nreprimand, coupled with ironical reproaches for my style. Not\r\ndiscouraged even then, I implored the help of my sisters, to whom I\r\nalways wrote on their birthdays and fete-days with the persistence of\r\na neglected child; but it was all in vain.

Burning with ardent faith, I prayed to God to renew in my\r\nbehalf the miracles I had read of in martyrology. At five years of age\r\nI fled to my star; at twelve I took refuge in the sanctuary. My\r\necstasy brought dreams unspeakable, which fed my imagination, fostered\r\nmy susceptibilities, and strengthened my thinking powers. I have often\r\nattributed those sublime visions to the guardian angel charged with\r\nmoulding my spirit to its divine destiny; they endowed my soul with\r\nthe faculty of seeing the inner soul of things; they prepared my heart\r\nfor the magic craft which makes a man a poet when the fatal power is\r\nhis to compare what he feels within him with reality,--the great\r\nthings aimed for with the small things gained.

Breakfast on a cup of\r\n\"cafe-au-lait\" is an aristocratic habit, explained by the high prices\r\nto which colonial products rose under Napoleon. If the use of sugar\r\nand coffee was a luxury to our parents, with us it was the sign of\r\nself-conscious superiority.

I stood in the period between puberty and\r\nmanhood,--the one prolonged by my excessive study, the other tardily\r\ndeveloping its living shoots. No young man was ever more thoroughly\r\nprepared to feel and to love. To understand my history, let your mind\r\ndwell on that pure time of youth when the mouth is innocent of\r\nfalsehood; when the glance of the eye is honest, though veiled by lids\r\nwhich droop from timidity contradicting desire; when the soul bends\r\nnot to worldly Jesuitism, and the heart throbs as violently from\r\ntrepidation as from the generous impulses of young emotion."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I need say nothing of the journey I made with my mother from Paris to\r\nTours. The coldness of her behavior repressed me. At each relay I\r\ntried to speak; but a look, a word from her frightened away the\r\nspeeches I had been meditating. At Orleans, where we had passed the\r\nnight, my mother complained of my silence. I threw myself at her feet\r\nand clasped her knees; with tears I opened my heart. I tried to touch\r\nhers by the eloquence of my hungry love in accents that might have\r\nmoved a stepmother. She replied that I was playing comedy. I\r\ncomplained that she had abandoned me. She called me an unnatural\r\nchild. My whole nature was so wrung that at Blois I went upon the\r\nbridge to drown myself in the Loire. The height of the parapet\r\nprevented my suicide."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"When I reached home, my two sisters, who did not know me, showed more\r\nsurprise than tenderness. Afterwards, however, they seemed, by\r\ncomparison, to be full of kindness towards me. I was given a room on\r\nthe third story. You will understand the extent of my hardships when I\r\ntell you that my mother left me, a young man of twenty, without other\r\nlinen than my miserable school outfit, or any other outside clothes\r\nthan those I had long worn in Paris. If I ran from one end of the room\r\nto the other to pick up her handkerchief, she took it with the cold\r\nthanks a lady gives to her footman. Driven to watch her to find if\r\nthere were any soft spot where I could fasten the rootlets of\r\naffection, I came to see her as she was,--a tall, spare woman, given\r\nto cards, egotistical and insolent, like all the Listomeres, who count\r\ninsolence as part of their dowry. She saw nothing in life except\r\nduties to be fulfilled. All cold women whom I have known made, as she\r\ndid, a religion of duty; she received our homage as a priest receives\r\nthe incense of the mass. My elder brother appeared to absorb the\r\ntrifling sentiment of maternity which was in her nature. She stabbed\r\nus constantly with her sharp irony,--the weapon of those who have no\r\nheart,--and which she used against us, who could make her no reply."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Notwithstanding these thorny hindrances, the instinctive sentiments\r\nhave so many roots, the religious fear inspired by a mother whom it is\r\ndangerous to displease holds by so many threads, that the sublime\r\nmistake--if I may so call it--of our love for our mother lasted until\r\nthe day, much later in our lives, when we judged her finally. This\r\nterrible despotism drove from my mind all thoughts of the voluptuous\r\nenjoyments I had dreamed of finding at Tours. In despair I took refuge\r\nin my father's library, where I set myself to read every book I did\r\nnot know. These long periods of hard study saved me from contact with\r\nmy mother; but they aggravated the dangers of my moral condition.\r\nSometimes my eldest sister--she who afterwards married our cousin, the\r\nMarquis de Listomere--tried to comfort me, without, however, being\r\nable to calm the irritation to which I was a victim.

The\r\nDuc d\'Angouleme, who had left Bordeaux to join Louis XVIII. in Paris,\r\nwas received in every town through which he passed with ovations\r\ninspired by the enthusiasm felt throughout old France at the return of\r\nthe Bourbons. Touraine was aroused for its legitimate princes; the\r\ntown itself was in a flutter, every window decorated, the inhabitants\r\nin their Sunday clothes, a festival in preparation, and that nameless\r\nexcitement in the air which intoxicates, and which gave me a strong\r\ndesire to be present at the ball given by the duke. When I summoned\r\ncourage to make this request of my mother, who was too ill to go\r\nherself, she became extremely angry. "Had I come from Congo?" she\r\ninquired. "How could I suppose that our family would not be\r\nrepresented at the ball? In the absence of my father and brother, of\r\ncourse it was my duty to be present. Had I no mother? Was she not\r\nalways thinking of the welfare of her children?"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In a moment the semi-disinherited son had become a personage! I was\r\nmore dumfounded by my importance than by the deluge of ironical\r\nreasoning with which my mother received my request. I questioned my\r\nsisters, and then discovered that my mother, who liked such theatrical\r\nplots, was already attending to my clothes. The tailors in Tours were\r\nfully occupied by the sudden demands of their regular customers, and\r\nmy mother was forced to employ her usual seamstress, who--according to\r\nprovincial custom--could do all kinds of sewing. A bottle-blue coat\r\nhad been secretly made for me, after a fashion, and silk stockings and\r\npumps provided; waistcoats were then worn short, so that I could wear\r\none of my father's; and for the first time in my life I had a shirt\r\nwith a frill, the pleatings of which puffed out my chest and were\r\ngathered in to the knot of my cravat. When dressed in this apparel I\r\nlooked so little like myself that my sister's compliments nerved me to\r\nface all Touraine at the ball. But it was a bold enterprise. Thanks to\r\nmy slimness I slipped into a tent set up in the gardens of the Papion\r\nhouse, and found a place close to the armchair in which the duke was\r\nseated. Instantly I was suffocated by the heat, and dazzled by the\r\nlights, the scarlet draperies, the gilded ornaments, the dresses, and\r\nthe diamonds of the first public ball I had ever witnessed. I was\r\npushed hither and thither by a mass of men and women, who hustled each\r\nother in a cloud of dust. The brazen clash of military music was\r\ndrowned in the hurrahs and acclamations of \"Long live the Duc\r\nd'Angouleme! Long live the King! Long live the Bourbons!\" The ball was\r\nan outburst of pent-up enthusiasm, where each man endeavored to outdo\r\nthe rest in his fierce haste to worship the rising sun,--an exhibition\r\nof partisan greed which left me unmoved, or rather, it disgusted me\r\nand drove me back within myself."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Swept onward like a straw in the whirlwind, I was seized with a\r\nchildish desire to be the Duc d'Angouleme himself, to be one of these\r\nprinces parading before an awed assemblage.

Who would not envy such\r\nworship?--a magnificent repetition of which I saw a few months later,\r\nwhen all Paris rushed to the feet of the Emperor on his return from\r\nElba. The sense of this dominion exercised over the masses, whose\r\nfeelings and whose very life are thus merged into one soul, dedicated\r\nme then and thenceforth to glory, that priestess who slaughters the\r\nFrenchmen of to-day as the Druidess once sacrificed the Gauls."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Suddenly I met the woman who was destined to spur these ambitious\r\ndesires and to crown them by sending me into the heart of royalty.

Just as I was suffering severely from the\r\npressure of the crowd an officer stepped on my feet, swollen by the\r\nnew leather of my shoes as well as by the heat. This disgusted me with\r\nthe whole affair. It was impossible to get away; but I took refuge in\r\na corner of a room at the end of an empty bench, where I sat with\r\nfixed eyes, motionless and sullen. Misled by my puny appearance, a\r\nwoman--taking me for a sleepy child--slid softly into the place beside\r\nme, with the motion of a bird as she drops upon her nest. Instantly I\r\nbreathed the woman-atmosphere, which irradiated my soul as, in after\r\ndays, oriental poesy has shone there.

These\r\nshoulders were parted by a line along which my eyes wandered. I raised\r\nmyself to see the bust and was spell-bound by the beauty of the bosom,\r\nchastely covered with gauze, where blue-veined globes of perfect\r\noutline were softly hidden in waves of lace. The slightest details of\r\nthe head were each and all enchantments which awakened infinite\r\ndelights within me; the brilliancy of the hair laid smoothly above a\r\nneck as soft and velvety as a child\'s, the white lines drawn by the\r\ncomb where my imagination ran as along a dewy path,--all these things\r\nput me, as it were, beside myself. Glancing round to be sure that no\r\none saw me, I threw myself upon those shoulders as a child upon the\r\nbreast of its mother, kissing them as I laid my head there. The woman\r\nuttered a piercing cry, which the noise of the music drowned; she\r\nturned, saw me, and exclaimed, "Monsieur!" Ah! had she said, "My\r\nlittle lad, what possesses you?" I might have killed her; but at the\r\nword "Monsieur!" hot tears fell from my eyes. I was petrified by a\r\nglance of saintly anger, by a noble face crowned with a diadem of\r\ngolden hair in harmony with the shoulders I adored. The crimson of\r\noffended modesty glowed on her cheeks, though already it was appeased\r\nby the pardoning instinct of a woman who comprehends a frenzy which\r\nshe inspires, and divines the infinite adoration of those repentant\r\ntears.

A few days after this memorable ball my mother\r\nattributed my neglect of study, my indifference to her tyrannical\r\nlooks and sarcasms, and my gloomy behavior to the condition of my\r\nhealth. The country, that perpetual remedy for ills that doctors\r\ncannot cure, seemed to her the best means of bringing me out of my\r\napathy. She decided that I should spend a few weeks at Frapesle, a\r\nchateau on the Indre midway between Montbazon and Azay-le-Rideau,\r\nwhich belonged to a friend of hers, to whom, no doubt, she gave\r\nprivate instructions."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'By the day when I thus for the first time gained my liberty I had swum\r\nso vigorously in Love\'s ocean that I had well-nigh crossed it.

During\r\nmy school years I had never been taken to walk more than two or three\r\nmiles from a city; yet there remained in my mind among the earliest\r\nrecollections of my childhood that feeling for the beautiful which the\r\nscenery about Tours inspires.

These moors are flat\r\nand sandy, and for more than three miles are dreary enough until you\r\nreach, through a clump of woods, the road to Sache, the name of the\r\ntownship in which Frapesle stands.

Imagine\r\nthree mills placed among islands of graceful outline crowned with\r\ngroves of trees and rising from a field of water,--for what other name\r\ncan I give to that aquatic vegetation, so verdant, so finely colored,\r\nwhich carpeted the river, rose above its surface and undulated upon\r\nit, yielding to its caprices and swaying to the turmoil of the water\r\nwhen the mill-wheels lashed it. Here and there were mounds of gravel,\r\nagainst which the wavelets broke in fringes that shimmered in the\r\nsunlight.

Such\r\nis the village of Pont-de-Ruan, a picturesque little hamlet leading up\r\nto an old church full of character, a church of the days of the\r\nCrusades, such a one as painters desire for their pictures. Surround\r\nthis scene with ancient walnut-trees and slim young poplars with their\r\npale-gold leaves; dot graceful buildings here and there along the\r\ngrassy slopes where sight is lost beneath the vaporous, warm sky, and\r\nyou will have some idea of one of the points of view of this most\r\nlovely region.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I followed the road to Sache along the left bank of the river,\r\nnoticing carefully the details of the hills on the opposite shore.

After the meal, my host, who little suspected that I\r\nhad walked from Tours, carried me over his estate, from the borders of\r\nwhich I saw the valley on all sides under its many aspects,--here\r\nthrough a vista, there to its broad extent; often my eyes were drawn\r\nto the horizon along the golden blade of the Loire, where the sails\r\nmade fantastic figures among the currents as they flew before the\r\nwind. As we mounted a crest I came in sight of the chateau d'Azay,\r\nlike a diamond of many facets in a setting of the Indre, standing on\r\nwooden piles concealed by flowers. Farther on, in a hollow, I saw the\r\nromantic masses of the chateau of Sache, a sad retreat though full of\r\nharmony; too sad for the superficial, but dear to a poet with a soul\r\nin pain.

About four\r\no\'clock we reached the little chateau on which my eyes had fastened\r\nfrom the first. The building, which is finely effective in the\r\nlandscape, is in reality very modest. It has five windows on the\r\nfront; those at each end of the facade, looking south, project about\r\ntwelve feet,--an architectural device which gives the idea of two\r\ntowers and adds grace to the structure. The middle window serves as a\r\ndoor from which you descend through a double portico into a terraced\r\ngarden which joins the narrow strip of grass-land that skirts the\r\nIndre along its whole course. Though this meadow is separated from the\r\nlower terrace, which is shaded by a double line of acacias and\r\nJapanese ailanthus, by the country road, it nevertheless appears from\r\nthe house to be a part of the garden, for the road is sunken and\r\nhemmed in on one side by the terrace, on the other side by a Norman\r\nhedge. The terraces being very well managed put enough distance\r\nbetween the house and the river to avoid the inconvenience of too\r\ngreat proximity to water, without losing the charms of it.

The roof is charmingly\r\nrounded at the angles, and bears mansarde windows with carved mullions\r\nand leaden finials on their gables. This roof, no doubt much neglected\r\nduring the Revolution, is stained by a sort of mildew produced by\r\nlichens and the reddish moss which grows on houses exposed to the sun.\r\nThe glass door of the portico is surmounted by a little tower which\r\nholds the bell, and on which is carved the escutcheon of the Blamont-\r\nChauvry family, to which Madame de Mortsauf belonged, as follows:\r\nGules, a pale vair, flanked quarterly by two hands clasped or, and two\r\nlances in chevron sable. The motto, "Voyez tous, nul ne touche!"\r\nstruck me greatly. The supporters, a griffin and dragon gules,\r\nenchained or, made a pretty effect in the carving. The Revolution has\r\ndamaged the ducal crown and the crest, which was a palm-tree vert with\r\nfruit or.

She gave me a\r\ncold, severe glance, under which my own eyelids fell, as much from a\r\nsense of humiliation as to hide the tears that rose beneath them. She\r\nsaw the moisture on my forehead, and perhaps she guessed the tears;\r\nfor she offered me the restoratives I needed, with a few kind and\r\nconsoling words, which gave me back the power of speech.

And yet I was a prey to terror, as all who, once in their\r\nlives, have experienced the illimitable joys of a true passion will\r\nunderstand. I feared she would detect me if I let my eyes rest upon\r\nthe shoulder I had kissed, and the fear sharpened the temptation.

Her face was of those that require the\r\nunattainable artist, whose hand can paint the reflection of inward\r\nfires and render that luminous vapor which defies science and is not\r\nrevealable by language--but which a lover sees. Her soft, fair hair\r\noften caused her much suffering, no doubt through sudden rushes of\r\nblood to the head. Her brow, round and prominent like that of Joconda,\r\nteemed with unuttered thoughts, restrained feelings--flowers drowning\r\nin bitter waters. The eyes, of a green tinge flecked with brown, were\r\nalways wan; but if her children were in question, or if some keen\r\ncondition of joy or suffering (rare in the lives of all resigned\r\nwomen) seized her, those eyes sent forth a subtile gleam as if from\r\nfires that were consuming her,--the gleam that wrung the tears from\r\nmine when she covered me with her contempt, and which sufficed to\r\nlower the boldest eyelid. A Grecian nose, designed it might be by\r\nPhidias, and united by its double arch to lips that were gracefully\r\ncurved, spiritualized the face, which was oval with a skin of the\r\ntexture of a white camellia colored with soft rose-tints upon the\r\ncheeks. Her plumpness did not detract from the grace of her figure nor\r\nfrom the rounded outlines which made her shape beautiful though well\r\ndeveloped.

No hollow disfigured\r\nthe base of her head, like those which make the necks of some women\r\nresemble trunks of trees; her muscles were not harshly defined, and\r\neverywhere the lines were rounded into curves as fugitive to the eye\r\nas to the pencil. A soft down faintly showed upon her cheeks and on\r\nthe outline of her throat, catching the light which made it silken.\r\nHer little ears, perfect in shape, were, as she said herself, the ears\r\nof a mother and a slave.

The round waist is a sign of\r\nstrength; but women thus formed are imperious, self-willed, and more\r\nvoluptuous than tender. On the other hand, women with flat waists are\r\ndevoted in soul, delicately perceptive, inclined to sadness, more\r\ntruly woman than the other class.

Though she was the mother of two\r\nchildren, I have never met any woman so truly a young girl as she. Her\r\nwhole air was one of simplicity, joined to a certain bashful\r\ndreaminess which attracted others, just as a painter arrests our steps\r\nbefore a figure into which his genius has conveyed a world of\r\nsentiment. If you recall the pure, wild fragrance of the heath we\r\ngathered on our return from the Villa Diodati, the flower whose tints\r\nof black and rose you praised so warmly, you can fancy how this woman\r\ncould be elegant though remote from the social world, natural in\r\nexpression, fastidious in all things which became part of herself,--in\r\nshort, like the heath of mingled colors. Her body had the freshness we\r\nadmire in the unfolding leaf; her spirit the clear conciseness of the\r\naboriginal mind; she was a child by feeling, grave through suffering,\r\nthe mistress of a household, yet a maiden too. Therefore she charmed\r\nartlessly and unconsciously, by her way of sitting down or rising, of\r\nthrowing in a word or keeping silence. Though habitually collected,\r\nwatchful as the sentinel on whom the safety of others depends and who\r\nlooks for danger, there were moments when smiles would wreathe her\r\nlips and betray the happy nature buried beneath the saddened bearing\r\nthat was the outcome of her life. Her gift of attraction was\r\nmysterious. Instead of inspiring the gallant attentions which other\r\nwomen seek, she made men dream, letting them see her virginal nature\r\nof pure flame, her celestial visions, as we see the azure heavens\r\nthrough rifts in the clouds. This involuntary revelation of her being\r\nmade others thoughtful. The rarity of her gestures, above all, the\r\nrarity of her glances--for, excepting her children, she seldom looked\r\nat any one--gave a strange solemnity to all she said and did when her\r\nwords or actions seemed to her to compromise her dignity."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"On this particular morning Madame de Mortsauf wore a rose-colored gown\r\npatterned in tiny stripes, a collar with a wide hem, a black belt, and\r\nlittle boots of the same hue.

But the constant\r\nemanation of her soul upon her family, that nurturing essence shed in\r\nfloods around her as the sun emits its light, her inward nature, her\r\ncheerfulness on days serene, her resignation on stormy ones,--all\r\nthose variations of expression by which character is displayed depend,\r\nlike the effects in the sky, on unexpected and fugitive circumstances,\r\nwhich have no connection with each other except the background against\r\nwhich they rest, though all are necessarily mingled with the events of\r\nthis history,--truly a household epic, as great to the eyes of a wise\r\nman as a tragedy to the eyes of the crowd, an epic in which you will\r\nfeel an interest, not only for the part I took in it, but for the\r\nlikeness that it bears to the destinies of so vast a number of women."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Everything at Clochegourde bore signs of a truly English cleanliness.\r\nThe room in which the countess received us was panelled throughout and\r\npainted in two shades of gray.

A lamp was on a pier-table, and a backgammon board on\r\nlegs before the fireplace. Two wide bands of cotton held back the\r\nwhite cambric curtains, which had no fringe. The furniture was covered\r\nwith gray cotton bound with a green braid, and the tapestry on the\r\ncountess's frame told why the upholstery was thus covered. Such\r\nsimplicity rose to grandeur. No apartment, among all that I have seen\r\nsince, has given me such fertile, such teeming impressions as those\r\nthat filled my mind in that salon of Clochegourde, calm and composed\r\nas the life of its mistress, where the conventual regularity of her\r\noccupations made itself felt. The greater part of my ideas in science\r\nor politics, even the boldest of them, were born in that room, as\r\nperfumes emanate from flowers; there grew the mysterious plant that\r\ncast upon my soul its fructifying pollen; there glowed the solar\r\nwarmth which developed my good and shrivelled my evil qualities.\r\nThrough the windows the eye took in the valley from the heights of\r\nPont-de-Ruan to the chateau d'Azay, following the windings of the\r\nfurther shore, picturesquely varied by the towers of Frapesle, the\r\nchurch, the village, and the old manor-house of Sache, whose venerable\r\npile looked down upon the meadows."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In harmony with this reposeful life, and without other excitements to\r\nemotion than those arising in the family, this scene conveyed to the\r\nsoul its own serenity.

My father had formerly done devoted service\r\nto the Bourbons, and had played an important and perilous, though\r\nsecret part.

The\r\ncrescent of hair which monastically fringed the back of his head,\r\notherwise completely bald, ended at the ears in little tufts of gray\r\nmingled with black. His face bore a vague resemblance to that of a\r\nwhite wolf with blood about its muzzle, for his nose was inflamed and\r\ngave signs of a life poisoned at its springs and vitiated by diseases\r\nof long standing. His flat forehead, too broad for the face beneath\r\nit, which ended in a point, and transversely wrinkled in crooked\r\nlines, gave signs of a life in the open air, but not of any mental\r\nactivity; it also showed the burden of constant misfortunes, but not\r\nof any efforts made to surmount them. His cheekbones, which were brown\r\nand prominent amid the general pallor of his skin, showed a physical\r\nstructure which was likely to ensure him a long life. His hard, light-\r\nyellow eye fell upon mine like a ray of wintry sun, bright without\r\nwarmth, anxious without thought, distrustful without conscious cause.\r\nHis mouth was violent and domineering, his chin flat and long. Thin\r\nand very tall, he had the bearing of a gentleman who relies upon the\r\nconventional value of his caste, who knows himself above others by\r\nright, and beneath them in fact. The carelessness of country life had\r\nmade him neglect his external appearance. His dress was that of a\r\ncountry-man whom peasants and neighbors no longer considered except\r\nfor his territorial worth.

The dinner, plentifully supplied,\r\nwas not luxurious; family silver without uniformity, Dresden china\r\nwhich was not then in fashion, octagonal decanters, knives with agate\r\nhandles, and lacquered trays beneath the wine-bottles, were the chief\r\nfeatures of the table, but flowers adorned the porcelain vases and\r\noverhung the gilding of their fluted edges. I delighted in these\r\nquaint old things. I thought the Reveillon paper with its flowery\r\ngarlands beautiful. The sweet content that filled my sails hindered me\r\nfrom perceiving the obstacles which a life so uniform, so unvarying in\r\nsolitude of the country placed between her and me. I was near her,\r\nsitting at her right hand, serving her with wine. Yes, unhoped-for\r\njoy! I touched her dress, I ate her bread. At the end of three hours\r\nmy life had mingled with her life! That terrible kiss had bound us to\r\neach other in a secret which inspired us with mutual shame. A glorious\r\nself-abasement took possession of me. I studied to please the count, I\r\nfondled the dogs, I would gladly have gratified every desire of the\r\nchildren, I would have brought them hoops and marbles and played horse\r\nwith them; I was even provoked that they did not already fasten upon\r\nme as a thing of their own.

I made\r\nseveral stupid replies induced by the tumults of passion, but no one\r\nperceived their cause, not even SHE, who knew nothing of love. The\r\nrest of my visit was a dream, a dream which did not cease until by\r\nmoonlight on that warm and balmy night I recrossed the Indre, watching\r\nthe white visions that embellished meadows, shores, and hills, and\r\nlistening to the clear song, the matchless note, full of deep\r\nmelancholy and uttered only in still weather, of a tree-frog whose\r\nscientific name is unknown to me. Since that solemn evening I have\r\nnever heard it without infinite delight. A sense came to me then of\r\nthe marble wall against which my feelings had hitherto dashed\r\nthemselves. Would it be always so? I fancied myself under some fatal\r\nspell; the unhappy events of my past life rose up and struggled with\r\nthe purely personal pleasure I had just enjoyed. Before reaching\r\nFrapesle I turned to look at Clochegourde and saw beneath its windows\r\na little boat, called in Touraine a punt, fastened to an ash-tree and\r\nswaying on the water.

His real\r\nname was Durand, but he had had the weakness to discard the name of a\r\nworthy father, a merchant who had made a large fortune under the\r\nRevolution. His wife was sole heiress of the Chessels, an old\r\nparliamentary family under Henry IV., belonging to the middle classes,\r\nas did most of the Parisian magistrates. Ambitious of higher flights\r\nMonsieur de Chessel endeavored to smother the original Durand. He\r\nfirst called himself Durand de Chessel, then D. de Chessel, and that\r\nmade him Monsieur de Chessel. Under the Restoration he entailed an\r\nestate with the title of count in virtue of letters-patent from Louis\r\nXVIII. His children reaped the fruits of his audacity without knowing\r\nwhat it cost him in sarcastic comments. Parvenus are like monkeys,\r\nwhose cleverness they possess; we watch them climbing, we admire their\r\nagility, but once at the summit we see only their absurd and\r\ncontemptible parts. The reverse side of my host's character was made\r\nup of pettiness with the addition of envy. The peerage and he were on\r\ndiverging lines. To have an ambition and gratify it shows merely the\r\ninsolence of strength, but to live below one's avowed ambition is a\r\nconstant source of ridicule to petty minds. Monsieur de Chessel did\r\nnot advance with the straightforward step of a strong man. Twice\r\nelected deputy, twice defeated; yesterday director-general, to-day\r\nnothing at all, not even prefect, his successes and his defeats had\r\ninjured his nature, and given him the sourness of invalided ambition.\r\nThough a brave man and a witty one and capable of great things, envy,\r\nwhich is the root of existence in Touraine, the inhabitants of which\r\nemploy their native genius in jealousy of all things, injured him in\r\nupper social circles, where a dissatisfied man, frowning at the\r\nsuccess of others, slow at compliments and ready at epigram, seldom\r\nsucceeds.

Still he was, I must say, most kind to me, and he pleased me\r\nfor the very simple reason that with him I had found peace and rest\r\nfor the first time. The interest, possibly very slight, which he\r\nshowed in my affairs, seemed to me, lonely and rejected as I was, an\r\nimage of paternal love. His hospitable care contrasted so strongly\r\nwith the neglect to which I was accustomed, that I felt a childlike\r\ngratitude to the home where no fetters bound me and where I was\r\nwelcomed and even courted."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The owners of Frapesle are so associated with the dawn of my life's\r\nhappiness that I mingle them in all those memories I love to revive.\r\nLater, and more especially in connection with his letters-patent, I\r\nhad the pleasure of doing my host some service. Monsieur de Chessel\r\nenjoyed his wealth with an ostentation that gave umbrage to certain of\r\nhis neighbors. He was able to vary and renew his fine horses and\r\nelegant equipages; his wife dressed exquisitely; he received on a\r\ngrand scale; his servants were more numerous than his neighbors\r\napproved; for all of which he was said to be aping princes. The\r\nFrapesle estate is immense. Before such luxury as this the Comte de\r\nMortsauf, with one family cariole,--which in Touraine is something\r\nbetween a coach without springs and a post-chaise,--forced by limited\r\nmeans to let or farm Clochegourde, was Tourangean up to the time when\r\nroyal favor restored the family to a distinction possibly unlooked\r\nfor. His greeting to me, the younger son of a ruined family whose\r\nescutcheon dated back to the Crusades, was intended to show contempt\r\nfor the large fortune and to belittle the possessions, the woods, the\r\narable lands, the meadows, of a neighbor who was not of noble birth.\r\nMonsieur de Chessel fully understood this. They always met politely;\r\nbut there was none of that daily intercourse or that agreeable\r\nintimacy which ought to have existed between Clochegourde and\r\nFrapesle, two estates separated only by the Indre, and whose\r\nmistresses could have beckoned to each other from their windows."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Jealousy, however, was not the sole reason for the solitude in which\r\nthe Count de Mortsauf lived.

Monsieur de Mortsauf had emigrated at the\r\nvery moment when the second stage of his education was about to begin,\r\nand accordingly that training was lacking to him. He was one of those\r\nwho believed in the immediate restoration of the monarchy; with that\r\nconviction in his mind, his exile was a long and miserable period of\r\nidleness. When the army of Conde, which his courage led him to join\r\nwith the utmost devotion, was disbanded, he expected to find some\r\nother post under the white flag, and never sought, like other\r\nemigrants, to take up an industry. Perhaps he had not the sort of\r\ncourage that could lay aside his name and earn his living in the sweat\r\nof a toil he despised. His hopes, daily postponed to the morrow, and\r\npossibly a scruple of honor, kept him from offering his services to\r\nforeign powers. Trials undermined his courage. Long tramps afoot on\r\ninsufficient nourishment, and above all, on hopes betrayed, injured\r\nhis health and discouraged his mind. By degrees he became utterly\r\ndestitute.

The natural gaiety of\r\na Frenchman and a Tourangean soon deserted him; he became morose, fell\r\nill, and was charitably cared for in some German hospital. His disease\r\nwas an inflammation of the mesenteric membrane, which is often fatal,\r\nand is liable, even if cured, to change the constitution and produce\r\nhypochondria.

Besides this, he would have\r\ngood reason for objecting. Nothing would go right here if I were\r\nabsent. You may have seen in me the mother of a family watchful to\r\nprotect her young from the hawk that is hovering over them; a weighty\r\ntask, indeed, but harder still are the cares imposed upon me by\r\nMonsieur de Mortsauf, whose constant cry, as he follows me about is,\r\n'Where is Madame?' I am Jacques' tutor and Madeleine's governess; but\r\nthat is not all, I am bailiff and steward too. You will understand\r\nwhat that means when you come to see, as you will, that the working of\r\nan estate in these parts is the most fatiguing of all employments. We\r\nget small returns in money; the farms are cultivated on shares, a\r\nsystem which needs the closest supervision. We are obliged ourselves\r\nto sell our own produce, our cattle and harvests of all kinds. Our\r\ncompetitors in the markets are our own farmers, who meet consumers in\r\nthe wine-shops and determine prices by selling first. I should weary\r\nyou if I explained the many difficulties of agriculture in this\r\nregion. No matter what care I give to it, I cannot always prevent our\r\ntenants from putting our manure upon their ground, I cannot be ever on\r\nthe watch lest they take advantage of us in the division of the crops;\r\nneither can I always know the exact moment when sales should be made.\r\nSo, if you think of Monsieur de Mortsauf's defective memory, and the\r\ndifficulty you have seen me have in persuading him to attend to\r\nbusiness, you can understand the burden that is on my shoulders, and\r\nthe impossibility of my laying it down for a single day. If I were\r\nabsent we should be ruined. No one would obey Monsieur de Mortsauf. In\r\nthe first place his orders are conflicting; then no one likes him; he\r\nfinds incessant fault, and he is very domineering.

If I had\r\nmarried a spendthrift he would have ruined me. If I had given myself\r\nto an ardent and pleasure-loving young man, perhaps I could not have\r\nretained him; he might have left me, and I should have died of\r\njealousy. For I am jealous!" she said, in a tone of excitement, which\r\nwas like the thunderclap of a passing storm. "But Monsieur de Mortsauf\r\nloves me as much as he is capable of loving; all that his heart\r\ncontains of affection he pours at my feet, like the Magdalen\'s cup of\r\nointment. Believe me, a life of love is an exception to the laws of\r\nthis earth; all flowers fade; great joys and emotions have a morrow of\r\nevil--if a morrow at all. Real life is a life of anguish; its image is\r\nin that nettle growing there at the foot of the wall,--no sun can\r\nreach it and it keeps green. Yet, here, as in parts of the North,\r\nthere are smiles in the sky, few to be sure, but they compensate for\r\nmany a grief. Moreover, women who are naturally mothers live and love\r\nfar more through sacrifices than through pleasures. Here I draw upon\r\nmyself the storms I fear may break upon my children or my people; and\r\nin doing so I feel a something I cannot explain, which gives me secret\r\ncourage. The resignation of the night carries me through the day that\r\nfollows. God does not leave me comfortless.

And then, after all,\r\nour home is improved and beautified, our means are improving also. Who\r\nknows but Monsieur de Mortsauf\'s old age may be a blessing to me? Ah,\r\nbelieve me! those who stand before the Great Judge with palms in their\r\nhands, leading comforted to Him the beings who cursed their lives,\r\nthey, they have turned their sorrows into joy.

Youth is noble, truthful, capable of sacrifice,\r\ndisinterested; seeing your persistency in coming to us, I believed,\r\nyes, I will admit that I believed in some divine purpose; I thought I\r\nshould find a soul that would be mine, as the priest is the soul of\r\nall; a heart in which to pour my troubles when they deluged mine, a\r\nfriend to hear my cries when if I continued to smother them they would\r\nstrangle me.

In all such matters of\r\nexternal life the conduct of this man was proudly disinterested.\r\nAdding to this sum his own few savings he was able to buy two\r\nneighboring estates, which would yield him some nine thousand francs a\r\nyear. His son would of course succeed to the grandfather's peerage,\r\nand the count now saw his way to entail the estate upon him without\r\ninjury to Madeleine, for whom the Duc de Lenoncourt would no doubt\r\nassist in promoting a good marriage."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"These arrangements and this new happiness shed some balm upon the\r\ncount's sore mind.

Who was I--poor,\r\ninsignificant, and with no future but my courage and my faculties? I\r\ndid not then think of the consequences of the Restoration either for\r\nme or for others. On Sunday morning, from the private chapel where I\r\nsat with Monsieur and Madame de Chessel and the Abbe de Quelus, I cast\r\nan eager glance at another lateral chapel occupied by the duchess and\r\nher daughter, the count and his children. The large straw hat which\r\nhid my idol from me did not tremble, and this unconsciousness of my\r\npresence seemed to bind me to her more than all the past. This noble\r\nHenriette de Lenoncourt, my Henriette, whose life I longed to garland,\r\nwas praying earnestly; faith gave to her figure an abandonment, a\r\nprosternation, the attitude of some religious statue, which moved me\r\nto the soul."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"According to village custom, vespers were said soon after mass.

In her desire to\r\njustify all her husband's actions Henriette had foreseen the\r\ncriticisms that would rise in my mind as soon as I saw the servile\r\neffects of a courtier's life upon him.

In those ten days Henriette passed through all the\r\ncontentions a young woman must endure to establish her independence.\r\nYou, who for your happiness have the best of mothers, can scarcely\r\ncomprehend such trials.

Every hour, every minute, our fraternal\r\nmarriage, founded on trust, became a surer thing; each of us settled\r\nfirmly into our own position; the countess enfolded me with her\r\nnurturing care, with the white draperies of a love that was wholly\r\nmaternal; while my love for her, seraphic in her presence, seared me\r\nas with hot irons when away from her.

Besides, I was young,--young enough\r\nto concentrate my whole being on the kiss she allowed me too seldom to\r\nlay upon her hand, of which she gave me only the back, and never the\r\npalm, as though she drew the line of sensual emotions there. No two\r\nsouls ever clasped each other with so much ardor, no bodies were ever\r\nmore victoriously annihilated. Later I understood the cause of this\r\nsufficing joy. At my age no worldly interests distracted my heart; no\r\nambitions blocked the stream of a love which flowed like a torrent,\r\nbearing all things on its bosom. Later, we love the woman in a woman;\r\nbut the first woman we love is the whole of womanhood; her children\r\nare ours, her interests are our interests, her sorrows our greatest\r\nsorrow; we love her gown, the familiar things about her; we are more\r\ngrieved by a trifling loss of hers than if we knew we had lost\r\neverything.

When we went to walk in the\r\nevenings he selected the way; but whichever direction we took he was\r\nalways bored; when we reached home he blamed others; his wife had\r\ninsisted on going where she wanted; why was he governed by her in all\r\nthe trifling things of life? was he to have no will, no thought of his\r\nown? must he consent to be a cipher in his own house?

Jacques\r\nmight get at least forty sous for the product of each tree, and as he\r\nhad two hundred the amount was considerable; he intended to spend it\r\non the equipment of a pony. This wish led to a discussion with his\r\nfather, who bade him think of the uncertainty of such returns, and the\r\nwisdom of creating a reserve fund for the years when the trees might\r\nnot bear, and so equalizing his resources. I felt what was passing\r\nthrough the mother\'s mind as she sat by in silence; she rejoiced in\r\nthe way Jacques listened to his father, the father seeming to recover\r\nthe paternal dignity that was lacking to him, thanks to the ideas\r\nwhich she herself had prompted in him.

I soon saw the truth of what she had told me\r\nas to her secret share in the management of the family affairs, into\r\nwhich I became slowly initiated. After ten years' steady effort Madame\r\nde Mortsauf had changed the method of cultivating the estate. She had\r\n\"put it in fours,\" as the saying is in those parts, meaning the new\r\nsystem under which wheat is sown every four years only, so as to make\r\nthe soil produce a different crop yearly. To evade the obstinate\r\nunwillingness of the peasantry it was found necessary to cancel the\r\nold leases and give new ones, to divide the estate into four great\r\nfarms and let them on equal shares, the sort of lease that prevails in\r\nTouraine and its neighborhood. The owner of the estate gives the\r\nhouse, farm-buildings, and seed-grain to tenants-at-will, with whom he\r\ndivides the costs of cultivation and the crops. This division is\r\nsuperintended by an agent or bailiff, whose business it is to take the\r\nshare belonging to the owner; a costly system, complicated by the\r\nmarket changes of values, which alter the character of the shares\r\nconstantly. The countess had induced Monsieur de Mortsauf to cultivate\r\na fifth farm, made up of the reserved lands about Clochegourde, as\r\nmuch to occupy his mind as to show other farmers the excellence of the\r\nnew method by the evidence of facts. Being thus, in a hidden way, the\r\nmistress of the estate, she had slowly and with a woman's persistency\r\nrebuilt two of the farm-houses on the principle of those in Artois and\r\nFlanders. It is easy to see her motive. She wished, after the\r\nexpiration of the leases on shares, to relet to intelligent and\r\ncapable persons for rental in money, and thus simplify the revenues of\r\nClochegourde. Fearing to die before her husband, she was anxious to\r\nsecure for him a regular income, and to her children a property which\r\nno incapacity could jeopardize. At the present time the fruit-trees\r\nplanted during the last ten years were in full bearing; the hedges,\r\nwhich secured the boundaries from dispute, were in good order; the\r\nelms and poplars were growing well. With the new purchases and the new\r\nfarming system well under way, the estate of Clochegourde, divided\r\ninto four great farms, two of which still needed new houses, was\r\ncapable of bringing in forty thousand francs a year, ten thousand for\r\neach farm, not counting the yield of the vineyards, and the two\r\nhundred acres of woodland which adjoined them, nor the profits of the\r\nmodel home-farm. The roads to the great farms all opened on an avenue\r\nwhich followed a straight line from Clochegourde to the main road\r\nleading to Chinon. The distance from the entrance of this avenue to\r\nTours was only fifteen miles; tenants would never be wanting,\r\nespecially now that everybody was talking of the count's improvements\r\nand the excellent condition of his land."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'The countess wished to put some fifteen thousand francs into each of\r\nthe estates lately purchased, and to turn the present dwellings into\r\ntwo large farm-houses and buildings, in order that the property might\r\nbring in a better rent after the ground had been cultivated for a year\r\nor two. These ideas, so simple in themselves, but complicated with the\r\nthirty odd thousand francs it was necessary to expend upon them, were\r\njust now the topic of many discussions between herself and the count,\r\nsometimes amounting to bitter quarrels, in which she was sustained by\r\nthe thought of her children\'s interests. The fear, "If I die to-morrow\r\nwhat will become of them?" made her heart beat. The gentle, peaceful\r\nhearts to whom anger is an impossibility, and whose sole desire is to\r\nshed on those about them their own inward peace, alone know what\r\nstrength is needed for such struggles, what demands upon the spirit\r\nmust be made before beginning the contest, what weariness ensues when\r\nthe fight is over and nothing has been won. At this moment, just as\r\nher children seemed less anemic, less frail, more active (for the\r\nfruit season had had its effect on them), and her moist eyes followed\r\nthem as they played about her with a sense of contentment which\r\nrenewed her strength and refreshed her heart, the poor woman was\r\ncalled upon to bear the sharp sarcasms and attacks of an angry\r\nopposition. The count, alarmed at the plans she proposed, denied with\r\nstolid obstinacy the advantages of all she had done and the\r\npossibility of doing more. He replied to conclusive reasoning with the\r\nfolly of a child who denies the influence of the sun in summer. The\r\ncountess, however, carried the day. The victory of commonsense over\r\ninsanity so healed her wounds that she forgot the battle. That day we\r\nall went to the Cassine and the Rhetoriere, to decide upon the\r\nbuildings. The count walked alone in front, the children went next,\r\nand we ourselves followed slowly, for she was speaking in a low,\r\ngentle tone, which made her words like the murmur of the sea as it\r\nripples on a smooth beach.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"She was, she said, certain of success. A new line of communication\r\nbetween Tours and Chinon was to be opened by an active man, a carrier,\r\na cousin of Manette's, who wanted a large farm on the route. His\r\nfamily was numerous; the eldest son would drive the carts, the second\r\ncould attend to the business, the father living half-way along the\r\nroad, at Rabelaye, one of the farms then to let, would look after the\r\nrelays and enrich his land with the manure of the stables. As to the\r\nother farm, la Baude, the nearest to Clochegourde, one of their own\r\npeople, a worthy, intelligent, and industrious man, who saw the\r\nadvantages of the new system of agriculture, was ready to take a lease\r\non it. The Cassine and the Rhetoriere need give no anxiety; their soil\r\nwas the very best in the neighborhood; the farm-houses once built, and\r\nthe ground brought into cultivation, it would be quite enough to\r\nadvertise them at Tours; tenants would soon apply for them. In two\r\nyears' time Clochegourde would be worth at least twenty-four thousand\r\nfrancs a year. Gravelotte, the farm in Maine, which Monsieur de\r\nMortsauf had recovered after the emigration, was rented for seven\r\nthousand francs a year for nine years; his pension was four thousand.\r\nThis income might not be a fortune, but it was certainly a competence.\r\nLater, other additions to it might enable her to go to Paris and\r\nattend to Jacques' education; in two years, she thought, his health\r\nwould be established."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'With what feeling she uttered the word "Paris!"

The morning when he took his first lesson\r\naccompanied by his father and by Madeleine, who jumped and shouted\r\nabout the lawn round which Jacques was riding, was a great maternal\r\nfestival for the countess.

A woman's protecting\r\ninstincts may be roused by the pleasure she feels in supporting\r\nthe weak against the strong, and in leading the intelligence of\r\nthe heart to victory over the brutality of matter; but society,\r\nless a mother than a stepmother, adores only the children who\r\nflatter her vanity."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'As to ardent enthusiasm, that first sublime mistake of youth,\r\nwhich finds true happiness in using its powers, and begins by\r\nbeing its own dupe before it is the dupe of others, keep it within\r\nthe region of the heart\'s communion, keep it for woman and for\r\nGod.

Do not be afraid of making enemies; woe to him\r\nwho has none in the world you are about to enter; but try to give\r\nno handle for ridicule or disparagement. I say TRY, for in Paris a\r\nman cannot always belong solely to himself; he is sometimes at the\r\nmercy of circumstances; you will not always be able to avoid the\r\nmud in the gutter nor the tile that falls from the roof. The moral\r\nworld has gutters where persons of no reputation endeavor to\r\nsplash the mud in which they live upon men of honor.

If you\r\ncomplain, the silliest of them will make you think that her glove\r\nis more precious than fortune, and that nothing is so glorious as\r\nto be her slave.

My room was the one above hers, her aunt's room;\r\nshe requested the count to take me there, after setting her foot on\r\nthe first step of the staircase, deliberating no doubt whether to\r\naccompany me; I turned my head, she blushed, bade me sleep well, and\r\nwent away. When I came down to dinner I heard for the first time of\r\nthe disasters at Waterloo, the flight of Napoleon, the march of the\r\nAllies to Paris, and the probable return of the Bourbons. These events\r\nwere all in all to the count; to us they were nothing. What think you\r\nwas the great event I was to learn, after kissing the children?--for I\r\nwill not dwell on the alarm I felt at seeing the countess pale and\r\nshrunken; I knew the injury I might do by showing it and was careful\r\nto express only joy at seeing her. But the great event for us was told\r\nin the words, \"You shall have ice to-day!\" She had often fretted the\r\nyear before that the water was not cold enough for me, who, never\r\ndrinking anything else, liked it iced. God knows how many entreaties\r\nit had cost her to get an ice-house built. You know better than any\r\none that a word, a look, an inflection of the voice, a trifling\r\nattention, suffices for love; love's noblest privilege is to prove\r\nitself by love. Well, her words, her look, her pleasure, showed me her\r\nfeelings, as I had formerly shown her mine by that first game of\r\nbackgammon. These ingenuous proofs of her affection were many; on the\r\nseventh day after my arrival she recovered her freshness, she sparkled\r\nwith health and youth and happiness; my lily expanded in beauty just\r\nas the treasures of my heart increased. Only in petty minds or in\r\ncommon hearts can absence lessen love or efface the features or\r\ndiminish the beauty of our dear one. To ardent imaginations, to all\r\nbeings through whose veins enthusiasm passes like a crimson tide, and\r\nin whom passion takes the form of constancy, absence has the same\r\neffect as the sufferings of the early Christians, which strengthened\r\ntheir faith and made God visible to them. In hearts that abound in\r\nlove are there not incessant longings for a desired object, to which\r\nthe glowing fire of our dreams gives higher value and a deeper tint?\r\nAre we not conscious of instigations which give to the beloved\r\nfeatures the beauty of the ideal by inspiring them with thought? The\r\npast, dwelt on in all its details becomes magnified; the future teems\r\nwith hope. When two hearts filled with these electric clouds meet each\r\nother, their interview is like the welcome storm which revives the\r\nearth and stimulates it with the swift lightnings of the thunderbolt.\r\nHow many tender pleasures came to me when I found these thoughts and\r\nthese sensations reciprocal! With what glad eyes I followed the\r\ndevelopment of happiness in Henriette! A woman who renews her life\r\nfrom that of her beloved gives, perhaps, a greater proof of feeling\r\nthan she who dies killed by a doubt, withered on her stock for want of\r\nsap; I know not which of the two is the more touching."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The revival of Madame de Mortsauf was wholly natural, like the effects\r\nof the month of May upon the meadows, or those of the sun and of the\r\nbrook upon the drooping flowers. Henriette, like our dear valley of\r\nlove, had had her winter; she revived like the valley in the\r\nspringtime. Before dinner we went down to the beloved terrace. There,\r\nwith one hand stroking the head of her son, who walked feebly beside\r\nher, silent, as though he were breeding an illness, she told me of her\r\nnights beside his pillow."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"For three months, she said, she had lived wholly within herself,\r\ninhabiting, as it were, a dark palace; afraid to enter sumptuous rooms\r\nwhere the light shone, where festivals were given, to her denied, at\r\nthe door of which she stood, one glance turned upon her child, another\r\nto a dim and distant figure; one ear listening for moans, another for\r\na voice. She told me poems, born of solitude, such as no poet ever\r\nsang; but all ingenuously, without one vestige of love, one trace of\r\nvoluptuous thought, one echo of a poesy orientally soothing as the\r\nrose of Frangistan. When the count joined us she continued in the same\r\ntone, like a woman secure within herself, able to look proudly at her\r\nhusband and kiss the forehead of her son without a blush.

The blue veins of her temples\r\nthrobbed; she shed no tears, but the color of her eyes faded. Then she\r\nlooked down, that she might not see her pain reflected on my face, her\r\nfeelings guessed, her soul wooed by my soul; above all, not see the\r\nsympathy of young love, ready like a faithful dog to spring at the\r\nthroat of whoever threatened his mistress, without regard to the\r\nassailant's strength or quality. At such cruel moments the count's air\r\nof superiority was supreme. He thought he had triumphed over his wife,\r\nand he pursued her with a hail of phrases which repeated the one idea,\r\nand were like the blows of an axe which fell with unvarying sound."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Always the same?"

"As soon as the buildings were\r\nfinished we found two excellent farmers ready to hire them; one at\r\nfour thousand five hundred francs, taxes paid; the other at five\r\nthousand; both leases for fifteen years. We have already planted three\r\nthousand young trees on the new farms. Manette\'s cousin is delighted\r\nto get the Rabelaye; Martineau has taken the Baude. All OUR efforts\r\nhave been crowned with success. Clochegourde, without the reserved\r\nland which we call the home-farm, and without the timber and\r\nvineyards, brings in nineteen thousand francs a year, and the\r\nplantations are becoming valuable. I am battling to let the home-farm\r\nto Martineau, the keeper, whose eldest son can now take his place. He\r\noffers three thousand francs if Monsieur de Mortsauf will build him a\r\nfarm-house at the Commanderie. We might then clear the approach to\r\nClochegourde, finish the proposed avenue to the main road, and have\r\nonly the woodland and the vineyards to take care of ourselves. If the\r\nking returns, OUR pension will be restored; WE shall consent after\r\nclashing a little with OUR wife\'s common-sense. Jacques\' fortune will\r\nthen be permanently secured. That result obtained, I shall leave\r\nmonsieur to lay by as much as he likes for Madeleine, though the king\r\nwill of course dower her, according to custom.

Often, after deep meditation induced by fears about the\r\nhealth of my children, my eyes close to the things of earth and see\r\ninto another region; if Jacques and Madeleine there appear to me as\r\ntwo luminous figures they are sure to have good health for a certain\r\nperiod of time; if wrapped in mist they are equally sure to fall ill\r\nsoon after. As for you, I not only see you brilliantly illuminated,\r\nbut I hear a voice which explains to me without words, by some mental\r\ncommunication, what you ought to do. Does any law forbid me to use\r\nthis wonderful gift for my children and for you?" she asked, falling\r\ninto a reverie.

The soft landscape, the warm atmosphere,\r\nthe cloudless skies, the soothing poetry of this valley, which for\r\nfifteen years had calmed the stinging fancies of that diseased mind,\r\nwere now impotent. At a period of life when the asperities of other\r\nmen are softened and their angles smoothed, the disposition of this\r\nman became more and more aggressive. For the last few months he had\r\ntaken a habit of contradicting for the sake of contradiction, without\r\nreason, without even trying to justify his opinions; he insisted on\r\nknowing the why and the wherefore of everything; grew restless under a\r\ndelay or an omission; meddled with every item of the household\r\naffairs, and compelled his wife and the servants to render him the\r\nmost minute and fatiguing account of all that was done; never allowing\r\nthem the slightest freedom of action. Formerly he did not lose his\r\ntemper except for some special reason; now his irritation was\r\nconstant. Perhaps the care of his farms, the interests of agriculture,\r\nan active out-door life had formerly soothed his atrabilious temper by\r\ngiving it a field for its uneasiness, and by furnishing employment for\r\nhis activity. Possibly the loss of such occupation had allowed his\r\nmalady to prey upon itself; no longer exercised on matters without, it\r\nwas showing itself in more fixed ideas; the moral being was laying\r\nhold of the physical being. He had lately become his own doctor; he\r\nstudied medical books, fancied he had the diseases he read of, and\r\ntook the most extraordinary and unheard of precautions about his\r\nhealth,--precautions never the same, impossible to foresee, and\r\nconsequently impossible to satisfy. Sometimes he wanted no noise;\r\nthen, when the countess had succeeded in establishing absolute\r\nsilence, he would declare he was in a tomb, and blame her for not\r\nfinding some medium between incessant noise and the stillness of La\r\nTrappe. Sometimes he affected a perfect indifference for all earthly\r\nthings. Then the whole household breathed freely; the children played;\r\nfamily affairs went on without criticism. Suddenly he would cry out\r\nlamentably, "They want to kill me!--My dear," he would say to his\r\nwife, increasing the injustice of his words by the aggravating tones\r\nof his sharp voice, "if it concerned your children you would know very\r\nwell what was the matter with them."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"He dressed and re-dressed himself incessantly, watching every change\r\nof temperature, and doing nothing without consulting the barometer.\r\nNotwithstanding his wife's attentions, he found no food to suit him,\r\nhis stomach being, he said, impaired, and digestion so painful as to\r\nkeep him awake all night. In spite of this he ate, drank, digested,\r\nand slept, in a manner to satisfy any doctor. His capricious will\r\nexhausted the patience of the servants, accustomed to the beaten track\r\nof domestic service and unable to conform to the requirements of his\r\nconflicting orders. Sometimes he bade them keep all the windows open,\r\ndeclaring that his health required a current of fresh air; a few days\r\nlater the fresh air, being too hot or too damp, as the case might be,\r\nbecame intolerable; then he scolded, quarrelled with the servants, and\r\nin order to justify himself, denied his former orders. This defect of\r\nmemory, or this bad faith, call it which you will, always carried the\r\nday against his wife in the arguments by which she tried to pit him\r\nagainst himself. Life at Clochegourde had become so intolerable that\r\nthe Abbe Dominis, a man of great learning, took refuge in the study of\r\nscientific problems, and withdrew into the shelter of pretended\r\nabstraction. The countess had no longer any hope of hiding the secret\r\nof these insane furies within the circle of her own home; the servants\r\nhad witnessed scenes of exasperation without exciting cause, in which\r\nthe premature old man passed the bounds of reason.

When she went to walk with them the\r\ncount would predict a storm in the face of a clear sky; if by chance\r\nthe prediction proved true, the satisfaction he felt made him quite\r\nindifferent to any harm to the children. If one of them was ailing,\r\nthe count gave his whole mind to fastening the cause of the illness\r\nupon the system of nursing adopted by his wife, whom he carped at for\r\nevery trifling detail, always ending with the cruel words, "If your\r\nchildren fall ill again you have only yourself to thank for it."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"He behaved in the same way in the management of the household, seeing\r\nthe worst side of everything, and making himself, as his old coachman\r\nsaid, \"the devil's own advocate.\" The countess arranged that Jacques\r\nand Madeleine should take their meals alone at different hours from\r\nthe family, so as to save them from the count's outbursts and draw all\r\nthe storms upon herself. In this way the children now saw but little\r\nof their father. By one of the hallucinations peculiar to selfish\r\npersons, the count had not the slightest idea of the misery he caused.\r\nIn the confidential communication he made to me on my arrival he\r\nparticularly dwelt on his goodness to his family. He wielded the\r\nflail, beat, bruised, and broke everything about him as a monkey might\r\nhave done. Then, having half-destroyed his prey, he denied having\r\ntouched it. I now understood the lines on Henriette's forehead,--fine\r\nlines, traced as it were with the edge of a razor, which I had noticed\r\nthe moment I saw her. There is a pudicity in noble minds which\r\nwithholds them from speaking of their personal sufferings; proudly\r\nthey hide the extent of their woes from hearts that love them, feeling\r\na merciful joy in doing so. Therefore in spite of my urgency, I did\r\nnot immediately obtain the truth from Henriette. She feared to grieve\r\nme; she made brief admissions, and then blushed for them; but I soon\r\nperceived myself the increase of trouble which the count's present\r\nwant of regular occupation had brought upon the household."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Henriette," I said, after I had been there some days, "don\'t you\r\nthink you have made a mistake in so arranging the estate that the\r\ncount has no longer anything to do?"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Dear," she said, smiling, "my situation is critical enough to take\r\nall my attention; believe me, I have considered all my resources, and\r\nthey are now exhausted. It is true that the bickerings are getting\r\nworse and worse. As Monsieur de Mortsauf and I are always together, I\r\ncannot lessen them by diverting his attention in other directions; in\r\nfact the pain would be the same to me in any case. I did think of\r\nadvising him to start a nursery for silk-worms at Clochegourde, where\r\nwe have many mulberry-trees, remains of the old industry of Touraine.\r\nBut I reflected that he would still be the same tyrant at home, and I\r\nshould have many more annoyances through the enterprise. You will\r\nlearn, my dear observer, that in youth a man\'s ill qualities are\r\nrestrained by society, checked in their swing by the play of passions,\r\nsubdued under the fear of public opinion; later, a middle-aged man,\r\nliving in solitude, shows his native defects, which are all the more\r\nterrible because so long repressed. Human weaknesses are essentially\r\nbase; they allow of neither peace nor truce; what you yield to them\r\nto-day they exact to-morrow, and always; they fasten on concessions\r\nand compel more of them. Power, on the other hand, is merciful; it\r\nconforms to evidence, it is just and it is peaceable. But the passions\r\nborn of weakness are implacable. Monsieur de Mortsauf takes an\r\nabsolute pleasure in getting the better of me; and he who would\r\ndeceive no one else, deceives me with delight."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"One morning as we left the breakfast table, about a month after my\r\narrival, the countess took me by the arm, darted through an iron gate\r\nwhich led into the vineyard, and dragged me hastily among the vines."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"He will kill me!" she cried.

Ah! my friend--" she cried, leaning her head upon my\r\nshoulder, and not continuing her confidence. "What will become of me?\r\nOh, what shall I do?" she said presently, struggling with thoughts she\r\ndid not express. "How can I resist? He will kill me! No, I will kill\r\nmyself--but that would be a crime! Escape? yes, but my children!\r\nSeparate from him? how, after fifteen years of marriage, how could I\r\never tell my parents that I will not live with him? for if my father\r\nand mother came here he would be calm, polite, intelligent, judicious.\r\nBesides, can married women look to fathers or mothers? Do they not\r\nbelong body and soul to their husbands? I could live tranquil if not\r\nhappy--I have found strength in my chaste solitude, I admit it; but if\r\nI am deprived of this negative happiness I too shall become insane. My\r\nresistance is based on powerful reasons which are not personal to\r\nmyself. It is a crime to give birth to poor creatures condemned to\r\nendless suffering.

We paid no attention to him.\r\nWhen we reached the house, he said he felt worse and should go to bed;\r\nwhich he did, quite naturally and with much less complaint than usual.\r\nWe took advantage of the respite and went down to our dear terrace\r\naccompanied by Madeleine."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Let us get that boat and go upon the river," said the countess after\r\nwe had made a few turns.

The tumults of a love full of restrained desires\r\nharmonize with the wash of the water; the flowers that the hand of man\r\nhas never wilted are the voice of his secret dreams; the voluptuous\r\nswaying of the boat vaguely responds to the thoughts that are floating\r\nin his soul. We felt the languid influence of this double poesy.\r\nWords, tuned to the diapason of nature, disclosed mysterious graces;\r\nlooks were impassioned rays sharing the light shed broadcast by the\r\nsun on the glowing meadows. The river was a path along which we flew.\r\nOur spirit, no longer kept down by the measured tread of our\r\nfootsteps, took possession of the universe. The abounding joy of a\r\nchild at liberty, graceful in its motions, enticing in its play, is\r\nthe living expression of two freed souls, delighting themselves by\r\nbecoming ideally the wondrous being dreamed of by Plato and known to\r\nall whose youth has been filled with a blessed love. To describe to\r\nyou that hour, not in its indescribable details but in its essence, I\r\nmust say to you that we loved each other in all the creations animate\r\nand inanimate which surrounded us; we felt without us the happiness\r\nour own hearts craved; it so penetrated our being that the countess\r\ntook off her gloves and let her hands float in the water as if to cool\r\nan inward ardor. Her eyes spoke; but her mouth, opening like a rose to\r\nthe breeze, gave voice to no desire. You know the harmony of deep\r\ntones mingling perfectly with high ones?

But to love, with our heads up, in defiance of\r\nlaw; to die for the idol we have chosen, with the sheets of our bed\r\nfor a shroud; to lay earth and heaven at his feet, robbing the\r\nAlmighty of his right to make a god, and never to betray that man,\r\nnever, never, even for virtue\'s sake,--for, to refuse him anything in\r\nthe name of duty is to devote ourselves to something that is not HE,\r\nand let that something be a man or an idea, it is betrayal all the\r\nsame,--these are heights to which common women cannot attain; they\r\nknow but two matter-of-fact ways; the great high-road of virtue, or\r\nthe muddy path of the courtesan."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Pride, you see, was her instrument; she flattered all vanities by\r\ndeifying them.

In what words\r\nshall I describe those first six months when I was lost in enervating\r\nenjoyments, in the meshes of a love fertile in pleasures and knowing\r\nhow to vary them with a cleverness learned by long experience, yet\r\nhiding that knowledge beneath the transports of passion. These\r\npleasures, the sudden revelation of the poetry of the senses,\r\nconstitute the powerful tie which binds young men to women older than\r\nthey. It is the chain of the galley-slave; it leaves an ineffaceable\r\nbrand upon the soul, filling it with disgust for pure and innocent\r\nlove decked with flowers only, which serves no alcohol in curiously\r\nchased cups inlaid with jewels and sparkling with unquenchable fires."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Recalling my early dreams of pleasures I knew nothing of, expressed at\r\nClochegourde in my "selams," the voice of my flowers, pleasures which\r\nthe union of souls renders all the more ardent, I found many\r\nsophistries by which I excused to myself the delight with which I\r\ndrained that jewelled cup. Often, when, lost in infinite lassitude, my\r\nsoul disengaged itself from the body and floated far from earth, I\r\nthought that these pleasures might be the means of abolishing matter\r\nand of rendering to the spirit its power to soar. Sometimes Lady\r\nDudley, like other women, profited by the exaltation in which I was to\r\nbind me by promises; under the lash of a desire she wrung blasphemies\r\nfrom my lips against the angel at Clochegourde. Once a traitor I\r\nbecame a scoundrel. I continued to write to Madame de Mortsauf, in the\r\ntone of the lad she had first known in his strange blue coat; but, I\r\nadmit it, her gift of second-sight terrified me when I thought what\r\nruin the indiscretion of a word might bring to the dear castle of my\r\nhopes.

Lady Dudley herself proposed the\r\nhumblest concessions. She would stay near Tours, at a little country-\r\nplace, alone, disguised; she would refrain from going out in the day-\r\ntime, and only meet me in the evening when people were not likely to\r\nbe about. I left Tours on horseback. I had my reasons for this; my\r\nevening excursions to meet her would require a horse, and mine was an\r\nArab which Lady Hester Stanhope had sent to the marchioness, and which\r\nshe had lately exchanged with me for that famous picture of Rembrandt\r\nwhich I obtained in so singular a way, and which now hangs in her\r\ndrawing-room in London. I took the road I had traversed on foot six\r\nyears earlier and stopped beneath my walnut-tree. From there I saw\r\nMadame de Mortsauf in a white dress standing at the edge of the\r\nterrace. Instantly I rode towards her with the speed of lightning, in\r\na straight line and across country.

Following a sign by which Henriette, after\r\nshowing me Madeleine, made me look at Jacques drawing geometrical\r\nfigures and algebraic calculations on a board before the Abbe Dominis,\r\nI shivered at the sight of death hidden beneath the roses, and was\r\nthankful for the self-deception of his mother."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"When I see my children thus, happiness stills my griefs--just as\r\nthose griefs are dumb, and even disappear, when I see them failing.

Lift up the soul and you\r\nrend it; the higher we go the less sympathy we meet; instead of\r\nsuffering in the valley, we suffer in the skies, as the soaring eagle\r\nbears in his heart the arrow of some common herdsman.

I came to the shores of the sea\r\nwhere such tempests rage; I have seen them too near; they have wrapped\r\nme in their clouds; the billows did not break at my feet, they caught\r\nme in a rough embrace which chilled my heart. No! I must escape to\r\nhigher regions; I should perish on the shores of this vast sea. I see\r\nin you, as in all others who have grieved me, the guardian of my\r\nvirtue.

What may I say to you? This. My life has been, and is,\r\nconsistent with itself in all its circumstances, great and small. The\r\nheart to which the rootlets of my first affection should have clung,\r\nmy mother's heart, was closed to me, in spite of my persistence in\r\nseeking a cleft through which they might have slipped. I was a girl; I\r\ncame after the death of three boys; and I vainly strove to take their\r\nplace in the hearts of my parents; the wound I gave to the family\r\npride was never healed. When my gloomy childhood was over and I knew\r\nmy aunt, death took her from me all too soon. Monsieur de Mortsauf, to\r\nwhom I vowed myself, has repeatedly, nay without respite, smitten me,\r\nnot being himself aware of it, poor man! His love has the simple-\r\nminded egotism our children show to us. He has no conception of the\r\nharm he does me, and he is heartily forgiven for it. My children,\r\nthose dear children who are bound to my flesh through their\r\nsufferings, to my soul by their characters, to my nature by their\r\ninnocent happiness,--those children were surely given to show me how\r\nmuch strength and patience a mother's breast contains. Yes, my\r\nchildren are my virtues. You know how my heart has been harrowed for\r\nthem, by them, in spite of them. To be a mother was, for me, to buy\r\nthe right to suffer. When Hagar cried in the desert an angel came and\r\nopened a spring of living water for that poor slave; but I, when the\r\nlimpid stream to which (do you remember?) you tried to guide me flowed\r\npast Clochegourde, its waters changed to bitterness for me. Yes, the\r\nsufferings you have inflicted on my soul are terrible. God, no doubt,\r\nwill pardon those who know affection only through its pains. But if\r\nthe keenest of these pains has come to me through you, perhaps I\r\ndeserved them. God is not unjust. Ah, yes, Felix, a kiss furtively\r\ntaken may be a crime. Perhaps it is just that a woman should harshly\r\nexpiate the few steps taken apart from husband and children that she\r\nmight walk alone with thoughts and memories that were not of them, and\r\nso walking, marry her soul to another. Perhaps it is the worst of\r\ncrimes when the inward being lowers itself to the region of human\r\nkisses. When a woman bends to receive her husband's kiss with a mask\r\nupon her face, that is a crime! It is a crime to think of a future\r\nspringing from a death, a crime to imagine a motherhood without\r\nterrors, handsome children playing in the evening with a beloved\r\nfather before the eyes of a happy mother. Yes, I sinned, sinned\r\ngreatly. I have loved the penances inflicted by the Church,--which did\r\nnot redeem the faults, for the priest was too indulgent. God has\r\nplaced the punishment in the faults themselves, committing the\r\nexecution of his vengeance to the one for whom the faults were\r\ncommitted. When I gave my hair, did I not give myself? Why did I so\r\noften dress in white? because I seemed the more your lily; did you not\r\nsee me here, for the first time, all in white? Alas! I have loved my\r\nchildren less, for all intense affection is stolen from the natural\r\naffections. Felix, do you not see that all suffering has its meaning.\r\nStrike me, wound me even more than Monsieur de Mortsauf and my\r\nchildren's state have wounded me. That woman is the instrument of\r\nGod's anger; I will meet her without hatred; I will smile upon her;\r\nunder pain of being neither Christian, wife, nor mother, I ought to\r\nlove her. If, as you tell me, I contributed to keep your heart\r\nunsoiled by the world, that Englishwoman ought not to hate me. A woman\r\nshould love the mother of the man she loves, and I am your mother.\r\nWhat place have I sought in your heart? that left empty by Madame de\r\nVandenesse. Yes, yes, you have always complained of my coldness; yes,\r\nI am indeed your mother only.

Society, which delights in looking behind appearances,\r\nsanctions much as soon as it knows the secrets they conceal. Lovers\r\nwho live in the great world make a mistake in flinging down these\r\nbarriers exacted by the law of salons; they do wrong not to obey\r\nscrupulously all conventions which the manners and customs of a\r\ncommunity impose,--less for the sake of others than for their own.\r\nOutward respect to be maintained, comedies to play, concealments to be\r\nmanaged; all such strategy of love occupies the life, renews desire,\r\nand protects the heart against the palsy of habit. But all young\r\npassions, being, like youth itself, essentially spendthrift, raze\r\ntheir forests to the ground instead of merely cutting the timber.\r\nArabella adopted none of these bourgeois ideas, and yielded to them\r\nonly to please me; she wished to exhibit me to the eyes of all Paris\r\nas her "sposo." She employed her powers of seduction to keep me under\r\nher roof, for she was not content with a rumored scandal which, for\r\nwant of proof, was only whispered behind the fans.

When a Frenchwoman loves she is metamorphosed; her noted\r\ncoquetry is used to deck her love; she abandons her dangerous vanity\r\nand lays no claim to any merit but that of loving well. She espouses\r\nthe interests, the hatreds, the friendships, of the man she loves; she\r\nacquires in a day the experience of a man of business; she studies the\r\ncode, she comprehends the mechanism of credit, and could manage a\r\nbanker's office; naturally heedless and prodigal, she will make no\r\nmistakes and waste not a single louis. She becomes, in turn, mother,\r\nadviser, doctor, giving to all her transformations a grace of\r\nhappiness which reveals, in its every detail, her infinite love. She\r\ncombines the special qualities of the women of other countries and\r\ngives unity to the mixture by her wit, that truly French product,\r\nwhich enlivens, sanctions, justifies, and varies all, thus relieving\r\nthe monotony of a sentiment which rests on a single tense of a single\r\nverb. The Frenchwoman loves always, without abatement and without\r\nfatigue, in public or in solitude. In public she uses a tone which has\r\nmeaning for one only; she speaks by silence; she looks at you with\r\nlowered eyelids. If the occasion prevents both speech and look she\r\nwill use the sand and write a word with the point of her little foot;\r\nher love will find expression even in sleep; in short, she bends the\r\nworld to her love. The Englishwoman, on the contrary, makes her love\r\nbend to the world. Educated to maintain the icy manners, the Britannic\r\nand egotistic deportment which I described to you, she opens and shuts\r\nher heart with the ease of a British mechanism. She possesses an\r\nimpenetrable mask, which she puts on or takes off phlegmatically.\r\nPassionate as an Italian when no eye sees her, she becomes coldly\r\ndignified before the world. A lover may well doubt his empire when he\r\nsees the immobility of face, the aloofness of countenance, and hears\r\nthe calm voice, with which an Englishwoman leaves her boudoir.\r\nHypocrisy then becomes indifference; she has forgotten all."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Certainly the woman who can lay aside her love like a garment may be\r\nthought to be capable of changing it.

Where a Frenchwoman comforts by a look, or\r\nbetrays her impatience with visitors by witty jests, an Englishwoman's\r\nsilence is absolute; it irritates the soul and frets the mind. These\r\nwomen are so constantly, and, under all circumstances, on their\r\ndignity, that to most of them fashion reigns omnipotent even over\r\ntheir pleasures. An Englishwoman forces everything into form; though\r\nin her case the love of form does not produce the sentiment of art. No\r\nmatter what may be said against it, Protestantism and Catholicism\r\nexplain the differences which make the love of Frenchwomen so far\r\nsuperior to the calculating, reasoning love of Englishwomen.\r\nProtestantism doubts, searches, and kills belief; it is the death of\r\nart and love.

In short, Madame de\r\nMortsauf reserved her mind and the flower of her thought to express\r\nher feelings; she was coquettish in ideas with her children and with\r\nme. But Arabella's mind was never used to make life pleasant; it was\r\nnever used at all for my benefit; it existed only for the world and by\r\nthe world, and it was spent in sarcasm. She loved to rend, to bite, as\r\nit were,--not for amusement but to satisfy a craving. Madame de\r\nMortsauf would have hidden her happiness from every eye, Lady Dudley\r\nchose to exhibit hers to all Paris; and yet with her impenetrable\r\nEnglish mask she kept within conventions even while parading in the\r\nBois with me. This mixture of ostentation and dignity, love and\r\ncoldness, wounded me constantly; for my soul was both virgin and\r\npassionate, and as I could not pass from one temperature to the other,\r\nmy temper suffered. When I complained (never without precaution), she\r\nturned her tongue with its triple sting against me; mingling boasts of\r\nher love with those cutting English sarcasms. As soon as she found\r\nherself in opposition to me, she made it an amusement to hurt my\r\nfeelings and humiliate my mind; she kneaded me like dough. To any\r\nremark of mine as to keeping a medium in all things, she replied by\r\ncaricaturing my ideas and exaggerating them. When I reproached her for\r\nher manner to me, she asked if I wished her to kiss me at the opera\r\nbefore all Paris; and she said it so seriously that I, knowing her\r\ndesire to make people talk, trembled lest she should execute her\r\nthreat. In spite of her real passion she was never meditative, self-\r\ncontained, or reverent, like Henriette; on the contrary she was\r\ninsatiable as a sandy soil. Madame de Mortsauf was always composed,\r\nable to feel my soul in an accent or a glance. Lady Dudley was never\r\naffected by a look, or a pressure of the hand, nor yet by a tender\r\nword. No proof of love surprised her.

On such points as these Lady Dudley affected the reticence\r\nof a mere acquaintance. She never informed herself about my affairs,\r\nnor of my likings or dislikings as a man.

But English luxury, which at first allured me by its choiceness\r\nand delicacy, proved to be mechanical also. The thousand and one\r\nattentions shown me at Clochegourde Arabella would have considered the\r\nbusiness of servants; each one had his own duty and speciality. The\r\nchoice of the footman was the business of her butler, as if it were a\r\nmatter of horses.

He attributed\r\nHenriette's wording to the extreme sensitiveness of a conscience which\r\nhe knew to be pure. This selfish insensibility was natural to him. The\r\nsouls of these two beings were no more married than their bodies; they\r\nhad never had the intimate communion which keeps feeling alive; they\r\nhad shared neither pains nor pleasures, those strong links which tear\r\nus by a thousand edges when broken, because they touch on all our\r\nfibers, and are fastened to the inmost recesses of our hearts."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Another consideration forbade my return to Clochegourde,--Madeleine's\r\nhostility.

But after the first outbreak of\r\nhis grief was over he seemed more concerned about the future than the\r\npresent. He feared his daughter, who, he told me, had not her mother's\r\ngentleness. Madeleine's firm character, in which there was something\r\nheroic blending with her mother's gracious nature, alarmed the old\r\nman, used to Henriette's tenderness, and he now foresaw the power of a\r\nwill that never yielded. His only consolation for his irreparable\r\nloss, he said, was the certainty of soon rejoining his wife; the\r\nagitations, the griefs of these last few weeks had increased his\r\nillness and brought back all his former pains; the struggle which he\r\nforesaw between his authority as a father and that of his daughter,\r\nnow mistress of the house, would end his days in bitterness; for\r\nthough he should have struggled against his wife, he should, he knew,\r\nbe forced to give way before his child. Besides, his son was soon to\r\nleave him; his daughter would marry, and what sort of son-in-law was\r\nhe likely to have?

As soon as Arabella saw me she assumed a distant\r\nair, and glanced at my travelling cap as if to ask what brought me\r\nthere.

I decided at once upon my course. From any other woman I\r\nshould modestly have accepted my defeat; but, outraged at the glowing\r\nappearance of the heroine who had vowed to die for love, and who had\r\nscoffed at the woman who was really dead, I resolved to meet insolence\r\nwith insolence.
