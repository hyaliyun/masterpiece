Among us each labours to invent a purely individual point of view. Instead of\r\nwriting history, we are always beating our brains to discover how history ought to be written. This\r\nfirst kind of Reflective History is most nearly akin to the preceding, when it has no farther aim than\r\nto present the annals of a country complete.

The\r\ndifference between such a compiler and an original historian may be best seen by comparing\r\nPolybius himself with the style in which Livy uses, expands, and abridges his annals in those\r\nperiod; of which Polybius's account has been preserved. Johann von M\ufffd\ufffdller has given a stiff,\r\nformal, pedantic aspect of history, in the endeavour to remain faithful in his portraiture to the times\r\nhe describes.

This\r\ntakes the occurrence out of the category of the Past and makes it virtually Present.

But the destinies of peoples and states, their interests, relations, and\r\nthe complicated issue of their affairs, present quite another field. Rulers, Statesmen, Nations, are\r\nwont to be emphatically commended to the teaching which experience offers in history. But what\r\nexperience and history teach is this, - that peoples and governments never have learned anything\r\nfrom history, or acted on principles deduced from it. Each period is involved in such peculiar\r\ncircumstances, exhibits a condition of things so strictly idiosyncratic, that its conduct must be\r\nregulated by considerations connected with itself, and itself alone. Amid the pressure of great\r\nevents, a general principle gives no help. It is useless to revert to similar circumstances in the Past.\r\nThe pallid shades of memory struggle in vain with the life and freedom of the Present.

It is only a thorough, liberal, comprehensive view of historical relations (such e.g. as\r\nwe find in Montesquieu's Esprit des Loix), that can give truth and interest to reflections of this\r\norder. One Reflective History therefore supersedes another. The materials are patent to every\r\nwriter: each is likely enough to believe himself capable of arranging and manipulating them; and we\r\nmay expect that each will insist upon his own spirit as that of the age in question.

I stated above, that I would not make a demand on your faith, in regard to the principle\r\nannounced. Yet I might appeal to your belief in it, in this religious aspect, if, as a general rule, the\r\nnature of philosophical science allowed it to attach authority to presuppositions. To put it in\r\nanother shape, \ufffd\ufffd this appeal is forbidden, because the science of which we have to treat,\r\nproposes itself to furnish the proof (not indeed of the abstract Truth of the doctrine, but) of its\r\ncorrectness as compared with facts.

Reason is Thought conditioning itself with perfect freedom. But a difference \ufffd\ufffd rather a\r\ncontradiction \ufffd\ufffd will manifest itself, between this belief and our principle, just as was the case in\r\nreference to the demand made by Socrates in the case of Anaxagoras's dictum. For that belief is\r\nsimilarly indefinite; it is what is called a belief in a general Providence, and is not followed out into\r\ndefinite application, or displayed in its bearing on the grand total \ufffd\ufffd the entire course of human\r\nhistory. But to explain History is to depict the passions of mankind, the genius, the active powers,\r\nthat play their part on the great stage; and the providentially determined process which these\r\nexhibit, constitutes what is generally called the \ufffd\ufffdplan\ufffd\ufffd of Providence. Yet it is this very plan which\r\nis supposed to be concealed from our view: which it is deemed presumption, even to wish to\r\nrecognise. The ignorance of Anaxagoras, as to how intelligence reveals itself in actual existence,\r\nwas ingenuous. Neither in his consciousness, nor in that of Greece at large, had that thought been\r\nfurther expanded. He had not attained the power to apply his general principle to the concrete, so\r\nas to deduce the latter from the former. It was Socrates who took the first step in comprehending\r\nthe union of the Concrete with the Universal. Anaxagoras, then, did not take up a hostile position\r\ntowards such an application. The common belief in Providence does; at least it opposes the use of\r\nthe principle on the large scale, and denies the possibility of discerning the plan of Providence. In\r\nisolated cases this plan is supposed to be manifest. Pious persons are encouraged to recognise in\r\nparticular circumstances, something more than mere chance; to acknowledge the guiding hand of\r\nGod; e.g. when help has unexpectedly come to an individual in great perplexity and need. But\r\nthese instances. of providential design are of a limited kind, and concern the accomplishment of\r\nnothing more than the desires of the individual in question. But in the history of the World, the\r\nIndividuals we have to do with are Peoples; Totalities that are States. We cannot, therefore, be\r\nsatisfied with what we may call this \ufffd\ufffdpeddling\ufffd\ufffd view of Providence, to which the belief alluded to\r\nlimits itself. Equally unsatisfactory is the merely abstract, undefined belief in a Providence, when\r\nthat belief is not brought to bear upon the details of the process which it conducts. On the contrary\r\nour earnest endeavour must be directed to the recognition of the ways of Providence, the means it\r\nuses, and the historical phenomena in which it manifests itself; and we must show their connection\r\nwith the general principle above mentioned. But in noticing the recognition of the plan of Divine\r\nProvidence generally, I have implicitly touched upon a prominent question of the day; viz. that of\r\nthe possibility of knowing God: or rather \ufffd\ufffd since public opinion has ceased to allow it to be a\r\nmatter of question \ufffd\ufffd the doctrine that it is impossible to know God. In direct contravention of\r\nwhat is commanded in holy Scripture as the highest duty,  \ufffd\ufffd that we should not merely love, but\r\nknow God, \ufffd\ufffd the prevalent dogma involves the denial of what is there said; viz. that it is the Spirit\r\n(der Geist) that leads into Truth, knows all things, penetrates even into the deep things of the\r\nGodhead. While the Divine Being is thus placed beyond our knowledge, and outside the limit of all\r\nhuman things, we have the convenient licence of wandering as far as we list, in the direction of our\r\nown fancies. We are freed from the obligation to refer our knowledge to the Divine and True. On\r\nthe other hand, the vanity and egotism which characterise it find, in this false position, ample\r\njustification and the pious modesty which puts far from it the knowledge of God, can well estimate\r\nhow much furtherance thereby accrues to its own wayward and vain strivings. I have been\r\nunwilling to leave out of sight the connection between our thesis - that Reason governs and has\r\ngoverned the World \ufffd\ufffd and the question of the possibility of a Knowledge of God, chiefly that I\r\nmight not lose the opportunity of mentioning the imputation against Philosophy of being shy of\r\nnoticing religious truths, or of having occasion to be so in which is insinuated the suspicion that it\r\nhas anything but a clear conscience in the presence of these truths. So far from this being the case,\r\nthe fact is, that in recent times Philosophy has been obliged to defend the domain of religion\r\nagainst the attacks of several theological systems. In the Christian religion God has revealed\r\nHimself, \ufffd\ufffd that is, he has given us to understand what He is; so that He is no longer a concealed\r\nor secret existence. And this possibility of knowing Him, thus afforded us, renders such\r\nknowledge a duty. God wishes no narrow-hearted souls or empty heads for his children; but those\r\nwhose spirit is of itself indeed, poor, but rich in the knowledge of Him; and who regard this\r\nknowledge of God as the only valuable possession. That development of the thinking spirit, which\r\nhas resulted from the revelation of the Divine Being as its original basis, must ultimately advance to\r\nthe intellectual comprehension of what was presented in the first instance, to feeling and\r\nimagination. The time must eventually come for understanding that rich product of active Reason,\r\nwhich the History of the World offers to us. It was for a while the fashion to profess admiration for\r\nthe wisdom of God, as displayed in animals, plants, and isolated occurrences. But, if it be allowed\r\nthat Providence manifests itself in such objects and forms of existence, why not also in Universal\r\nHistory? This is deemed too great a matter to be thus regarded. But Divine Wisdom, i.e. Reason.,\r\nis one and the same in the great as in the little; and we must not imagine God to be too weak to\r\nexercise his wisdom on the grand scale. Our intellectual striving aims at realising the conviction that\r\nwhat was intended by eternal wisdom, is actually accomplished in the domain of existent, active\r\nSpirit, as well as in that of mere Nature. Our mode of treating the subject is, in this aspect, a\r\nTheodicaea, \ufffd\ufffd a justification of the ways of God, \ufffd\ufffd which Leibnitz attempted metaphysically in\r\nhis method, i.e. in indefinite abstract categories, \ufffd\ufffd so that the ill that is found in the World may be\r\ncomprehended, and the thinking Spirit reconciled with the fact of the existence of evil. Indeed,\r\nnowhere is such a harmonising view more pressingly demanded than in Universal History; and it\r\ncan be attained only by recognising the positive existence, in which that negative element is a\r\nsubordinate, and vanquished nullity. On the one hand. the ultimate design of the World must be\r\nperceived; and, on the other hand, the fact that this design has been actually, realised in it, and that\r\nevil has not been able permanently to assert a competing position. But this conviction involves\r\nmuch more than the mere belief in a superintending or in \ufffd\ufffdProvidence.\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffdReason,\ufffd\ufffd whose\r\nsovereignty over the World has been maintained, is as indefinite a term as \ufffd\ufffdProvidence,\ufffd\ufffd\r\nsupposing the term to be used by those who are unable to characterise it distinctly, \ufffd\ufffd to show\r\nwherein it consists, so as to enable us to decide whether a thing is rational or irrational. An\r\nadequate definition of Reason is the first desideratum; and whatever boast may be made of strict\r\nadherence to it in explaining phenomena, \ufffd\ufffd without such a definition we get no farther than mere\r\nwords.

It is a result of speculative Philosophy, that Freedom is the sole truth of Spirit. Matter\r\npossesses gravity in virtue of its tendency towards a central point. It is essentially composite;\r\nconsisting of parts that exclude each other. It seeks its Unity; and therefore exhibits itself as\r\nself-destructive, as verging towards its opposite [an indivisible point]. If it could attain this, it would\r\nbe Matter no longer, it would have perished. It strives after the realisation of its Idea; for in Unity it\r\nexists ideally. Spirit, on the contrary, may be defined as that which has its centre in itself. It has\r\nnot a unity outside itself, but has already found it; it exists in and with itself. Matter has its essence\r\nout of itself; Spirit is self-contained existence (Bei-sich-selbst-seyn). Now this is Freedom,\r\nexactly. For if I am dependent, my being is referred to something else which I am not; I cannot\r\nexist independently of something external. I am free on the contrary, when my existence depends\r\nupon myself. This self-contained existence of Spirit is none other than self-consciousness \ufffd\ufffd\r\nconsciousness of one's own being. Two things must be distinguished in consciousness; first, the\r\nfact that I know; secondly, what I know. In self consciousness these are merged in one; for\r\nSpirit knows itself. It involves an appreciation of its own nature, as also an energy enabling it to\r\nrealise itself; to make itself actually that which it is potentially. According to this abstract definition\r\nit may be said of Universal History, that it is the exhibition of Spirit in the process of working out\r\nthe knowledge of that which it is potentially. And as the germ bears in itself the whole nature of the\r\ntree, and the taste and form of its fruits, so do the first traces of Spirit virtually contain the whole of\r\nthat History. The Orientals have not attained the knowledge that Spirit \ufffd\ufffd Man as such \ufffd\ufffd is free;\r\nand because they do not know this they are not free. They only know that one is free. But on this\r\nvery account, the freedom of that one is only caprice; ferocity \ufffd\ufffd brutal recklessness or passion, or\r\na mildness and tameness of the desires, which is itself only an accident of Nature \ufffd\ufffd mere caprice\r\nlike the former. \ufffd\ufffd That one is therefore only a Despot; not a free man. The consciousness of\r\nFreedom first arose among the Greeks, and therefore they were free; but they, and the Romans\r\nlikewise, knew only that some are free, \ufffd\ufffd not man as such. Even Plato and Aristotle did not know\r\nthis. The Greeks, therefore, had slaves; and their whole life and the maintenance of their splendid\r\nliberty, was implicated with the institution of slavery: a fact moreover, which made that liberty on\r\nthe one hand only an accidental, transient and limited growth; on the other hand, constituted it a\r\nrigorous thraldom of our common nature \ufffd\ufffd of the Human. The German nations, under the\r\ninfluence of Christianity, were the first to attain the consciousness, that man, as man, is free: that it\r\nis the freedom of Spirit which constitutes its essence. This consciousness arose first in religion, the\r\ninmost region of Spirit; but to introduce the principle into the various relations of the actual world,\r\ninvolves a more extensive problem than its simple implantation; a problem whose solution and\r\napplication require a severe and lengthened process of culture. In proof of this, we may note that\r\nslavery did not cease immediately on the reception of Christianity. Still less did liberty predominate\r\nin States; or Governments and Constitutions adopt a rational organisation, or recognise freedom\r\nas their basis. That application of the principle to political relations; the thorough moulding and\r\ninterpenetration of the constitution of society by it, is a process identical with history itself. I have\r\nalready directed attention to the distinction here involved, between a principle as such, and\r\nits-application; i.e. its introduction and carrying out in the actual phenomena of Spirit and Life.\r\nThis is a point of fundamental importance in our science, and one which must be constantly\r\nrespected as essential. And in the same way as this distinction has attracted attention in view of the\r\nChristian principle of self-consciousness \ufffd\ufffd Freedom; it also shows itself as an essential one, in\r\nview of the principle of Freedom generally.

Passions, private aims, and the\r\nsatisfaction of selfish desires, are on the other hand, most effective springs of action. Their power\r\nlies in the fact that they respect none of the limitations which justice and morality would impose on\r\nthem; and that these natural impulses have a more direct influence over man than the artificial and\r\ntedious discipline that tends to order and self-restraint, law and morality.

That some conception of mine should be developed into\r\nact and existence, is my earnest desire: I wish to assert my personality in connection with it: I wish\r\nto be satisfied by its execution. If I am to exert myself for any object, it must in some way or other\r\nbe my object.

This is the absolute right of personal existence \ufffd\ufffd to find itself\r\nsatisfied in its activity and labour. If men are to interest themselves for anything, they must (so to\r\nspeak) have part of their existence involved in it; find their individuality gratified by its attainment.\r\nHere a mistake must be avoided.

The term prosperity is used in a variety of\r\nmeanings \ufffd\ufffd riches, outward honour, and the like. But in speaking of something which in and for\r\nitself constitutes an aim of existence, that so-called well or ill-faring of these or those isolated\r\nindividuals cannot be regarded as an essential element in the rational order of the universe.

What makes men morally discontented (a discontent, by the\r\nbye, on which they somewhat pride themselves), is that they do not find the present adapted to the\r\nrealisation of aims which they hold to be right and just (more especially in modern times, ideals of\r\npolitical constitutions); they contrast unfavourably things as they are, with their idea of things as\r\nthey ought to be. In this case it is not private interest nor passion that desires gratification, but\r\nReason, Justice, Liberty; and equipped with this title, the demand in question assumes a lofty\r\nbearing, and readily adopts a position not merely of discontent, but of open revolt against the\r\nactual condition of the world. To estimate such a feeling and such views aright, the demands\r\ninsisted upon, and the very dogmatic opinions asserted, must be examined. At no time so much as\r\nin our own, have such general principles and notions been advanced, or with greater assurance. If\r\nin days gone by, history seems to present itself as a struggle of passions; in our time \ufffd\ufffd though\r\ndisplays of passion are not wanting \ufffd\ufffd it exhibits partly a predominance of the struggle of notions\r\nassuming the authority of principles; partly that of passions and interests essentially subjective, but\r\nunder the mask of such higher sanctions. The pretensions thus contended for as legitimate in the\r\nname of that which has been stated as the ultimate aim of Reason, pass accordingly, for absolute\r\naims, \ufffd\ufffd to the same extent as Religion, Morals, Ethics. Nothing, as before remarked, is now more\r\ncommon than the complaint that the ideals which imagination sets up are not realised \ufffd\ufffd that these\r\nglorious dreams are destroyed by cold actuality. These Ideals \ufffd\ufffd which in the voyage of life\r\nfounder on the rocks of hard reality \ufffd\ufffd may be in the first instance only subjective, and belong to\r\nthe idiosyncrasy of the individual, imagining himself the highest and wisest. Such do not properly\r\nbelong to this category. For the fancies which the individual in his isolation indulges, cannot be the\r\nmodel for universal reality; just as universal law is not designed for the units of the mass. These as\r\nsuch may, in fact, find their interests decidedly thrust into the background. But by the term\r\n\ufffd\ufffdIdeal,\ufffd\ufffd we also understand the ideal of Reason, of the Good, of the True. Poets, as e.g.\r\nSchiller, have painted such ideals touchingly and with strong emotion, and with the deeply\r\nmelancholy conviction that they could not be realised. In affirming, on the contrary that the\r\nUniversal Reason does realise itself, we leave indeed nothing to do with the individual empirically\r\nregarded. That admits of degrees of better and worse, since here chance and speciality have\r\nreceived authority from the Idea to exercise their monstrous power. Much, therefore, in particular\r\naspects of the grand phenomenon might be found fault with. This subjective fault-finding, \ufffd\ufffd which,\r\nhowever, only keeps in view the individual and its deficiency, without taking notice of Reason\r\npervading the whole, \ufffd\ufffd is easy; and inasmuch as it asserts an excellent intention with regard to the\r\ngood of the whole, and seems to result from a kindly heart, it feels authorised to give itself airs and\r\nassume great consequence. It is easier to discover a deficiency in individuals, in states, and in\r\nProvidence, than to see their real import and value. For in this merely negative fault-finding a\r\nproud position is taken, \ufffd\ufffd one which overlooks the object, without having entered into it, \ufffd\ufffd\r\nwithout having comprehended its positive aspect. Age generally makes men more tolerant; youth is\r\nalways discontented. The tolerance of age is the result of the ripeness of a judgment which, - not\r\nmerely as the result of indifference, is satisfied even with what is inferior; but, more deeply taught\r\nby the grave experience of life, has been led to perceive the substantial, solid worth of the object\r\nin question. The insight then to which \ufffd\ufffd in contradistinction from those ideals \ufffd\ufffd philosophy is to\r\nlead us, is, that the real world is as it ought to be \ufffd\ufffd that the truly good \ufffd\ufffd the universal divine\r\nreason \ufffd\ufffd is not a mere abstraction, but a vital principle capable of realising itself. This Good, this\r\nReason, in its most concrete form, is God. God governs the world; the actual working of his\r\ngovernment \ufffd\ufffd the carrying out of his plan \ufffd\ufffd is the History of the World. This plan philosophy\r\nstrives to comprehend; for only that which has been developed as the result of it, possesses bona\r\nfide reality. That which does not accord with it, is negative, worthless existence. Before the pure\r\nlight of this divine Idea \ufffd\ufffd which is no mere Idea - the phantom of a world whose events are an\r\nincoherent concourse of fortuitous circumstances, utterly vanishes. Philosophy wishes to discover\r\nthe substantial purport, the real side of the divine idea and to justify the so much despised Reality\r\nof things; for Reason is the comprehension of the Divine work. But as to what concerns the\r\nperversion, corruption, and ruin of religious, ethical and moral purposes, and states of society\r\ngenerally, it must be affirmed, that in their essence these are infinite and eternal; but that the forms\r\nthey assume may be of a limited orders and consequently belong to the domain of mere nature,\r\nand be subject to the sway of chance. They are therefore perishable, and exposed to decay and\r\ncorruption. Religion and morality \ufffd\ufffd in the same way as inherently universal essences \ufffd\ufffd have the\r\npeculiarity of being present in the individual soul, in the full extent of their Idea, and therefore truly\r\nand really; although they may not manifest themselves in it in extenso, and are not applied to fully\r\ndeveloped relations. The religion, the morality of a limited sphere of life \ufffd\ufffd that of a shepherd or a\r\npeasant, e.g. \ufffd\ufffd in its intensive concentration and limitation to a few perfectly simple relations of\r\nlife, \ufffd\ufffd has infinite worth; the same worth as the religion and morality of extensive knowledge, and\r\nof an existence rich in the compass of its relations and actions.

Thus the question would arise: What is the\r\nmaterial in which the Ideal of Reason is wrought out? The primary answer would be, - Personality\r\nitself - human desires - Subjectivity generally. In human knowledge and volition, as its material\r\nelement, Reason attains positive existence. We have considered subjective volition where it has an\r\nobject which is the truth and essence of a reality, viz. where it constitutes a great world-historical\r\npassion.

For it is the Unity of the universal, essential Will, with that of the individual; and this is\r\n"Morality." The Individual living in this unity has a moral life; possesses a value that consists in this\r\nsubstantiality alone. Sophocles in his Antigone, says, "The divine commands are not of yesterday,\r\nnor of today; no, they have an infinite existence, and no one could say whence they came." The\r\nlaws of morality are not accidental, but are the essentially Rational. It is the very object of the\r\nState that what is essential in the practical activity of men, and in their dispositions, should be duly\r\nrecognised; that it should have a manifest existence, and maintain its position. It is the absolute\r\ninterest of Reason that this moral Whole should exist; and herein lies the justification and merit of\r\nheroes who have founded states, - however rude these may have been. In the history of the\r\nWorld., only those peoples can come under our notice which form a state. For it must be\r\nunderstood that this latter is the realisation of Freedom, i.e. of the absolute final aim, and that it\r\nexists for its own sake. It must further be understood that all the worth which the human being\r\npossesses - all spiritual reality, he possesses only through the State. For his spiritual reality consists\r\nin this, that his own essence - Reason - is objectively present to him, that it possesses objective\r\nimmediate existence for him. Thus only is he fully conscious; thus only is he a partaker of morality -\r\nof a just and moral social and political life. For Truth is the Unity of the universal and subjective\r\nWill; and the Universal is to be found in the State, in its laws, its universal and rational\r\narrangements. The State is the Divine Idea as it exists on Earth. We have in it, therefore, the\r\nobject of History in a more definite shape than before; that in which Freedom obtains objectivity,\r\nand lives in the enjoyment of this objectivity. For Law is the objectivity of Spirit; volition in its true\r\nform. Only that will which obeys law, is free; for it obeys itself - it is independent and so free.\r\nWhen the State or our country constitutes a community of existence; when the subjective will of\r\nman submits to laws, - the contradiction between Liberty and Necessity vanishes.

An Athenian citizen did what was\r\nrequired of him, as it were from instinct; but if I reflect on the object of nay activity, I must have\r\nthe consciousness that my will has been called into exercise.

The error which\r\nfirst meets us is the direct contradictory of our principle that the state presents the realisation of\r\nFreedom; the opinion, viz., that man is free by nature, but that in society, in the State - to which\r\nnevertheless he is irresistibly impelled - he must limit this natural freedom.

The patriarchal condition is regarded - either in reference to the entire race of\r\nman, or to some branches of it - as exclusively that condition of things, in which the legal element is\r\ncombined with a due recognition of the moral and emotional parts of our nature; and in which\r\njustice as united with these, truly and really influences the intercourse of the social units. The basis\r\nof the patriarchal condition is the family relation; which develops the primary form of conscious\r\nmorality, succeeded by that of the State as its second phase. The patriarchal condition is one of\r\ntransition, in which the family has already advanced to the position of a race or people; where the\r\nunion, therefore, has already ceased to be simply a bond of love and confidence, and has become\r\none of plighted service. We must first examine the ethical principle of the Family. The Family may\r\nbe reckoned as virtually a single person; since its members have either mutually surrendered their\r\nindividual personality, (and consequently their legal position towards each other, with the rest of\r\ntheir particular interests and desires) as in the case of the Parents; or have not yet attained such an\r\nindependent personality, - (the Children, - who are primarily in that merely natural condition\r\nalready mentioned.) They live, therefore, in a unity of feeling, love, confidence, and faith in each\r\nother. And in a relation of mutual love, the one individual has the consciousness of himself in the\r\nconsciousness of the other; he lives out of self; and in this mutual self-renunciation each regains the\r\nlife that had been virtually transferred to the other; gains, in fact, that other's existence and his own,\r\nas involved with that other. The farther interests connected with the necessities and external\r\nconcerns of life, as well as the development that has to take place within their circle, i.e. of the\r\nchildren constitute a common object for the members of the Family. The Spirit of the Family - the\r\nPenates - form one substantial being, as much as the Spirit of a People in the State; and morality in\r\nboth cases consists in a feeling, a consciousness, and a will, not limited to individual personality\r\nand interest, but embracing the common interests of the members generally. But this unity is in the\r\ncase of the Family essentially one of feeling; not advancing beyond the limits of the merely\r\nnatural. The piety of the Family relation should be respected in the highest degree by the State;\r\nby its means the State obtains as its members individuals who are already moral (for as mere\r\npersons they are not) and who in uniting to form a state bring with them that sound basis of a\r\npolitical edifice - the capacity of feeling one with a Whole. But the expansion of the Family to a\r\npatriarchal unity carries us beyond the ties of blood-relationship - the simply natural elements of\r\nthat basis; and outside of these limits the members of the community must enter upon the position\r\nof independent personality. A review of the patriarchal condition, in extenso, would lead us to\r\ngive special attention to the Theocratical Constitution. The head of the patriarchal clan is also its\r\npriest. If the Family in its general relations, is not yet separated from civic society and the state, the\r\nseparation of religion from it has also not yet taken place; and so much the less since the piety of\r\nthe hearth is itself a profoundly subjective state of feeling."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                               \ufffd\ufffd 45\n"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We have considered two aspects of Freedom, - the objective and the subjective; if, therefore,\r\nFreedom is asserted to consist in the individuals of a State all agreeing in its arrangements it is\r\nevident that only the subjective aspect is regarded.

The State is an abstraction, having even its generic\r\nexistence in its citizens; but it is an actuality, and its simply generic existence must embody itself in\r\nindividual will and activity. The want of government and political administration in general is felt;\r\nthis necessitates the selection and separation from the rest of those who have to take the helm in\r\npolitical affairs, to decide, concerning them, and to give orders to other citizens, with a view to the\r\nexecution of their plans. If, e.g., even the people in a Democracy resolve on a war, a general must\r\nhead the army. It is only by a Constitution that the abstraction - the State - attains life and reality;\r\nbut this involves the distinction between those who command and those who obey. - Yet\r\nobedience seems inconsistent with liberty, and those who command appear to do the very\r\nopposite of that which the fundamental idea of the State, viz. that of Freedom, requires. It is,\r\nhowever, urged that, - though the distinction between commanding and obeying is absolutely\r\nnecessary, because affairs could not go on without it - and indeed this seems only a compulsory\r\nlimitation, external to and even contravening freedom in the abstract - the constitution should be at\r\nleast so framed, that the citizens may obey as little as possible, and the smallest modicum of free\r\nvolition be left to the commands of the superiors; - that the substance of that for which\r\nsubordination is necessary, even in its most important bearings, should be decided and resolved on\r\nby the People - by the will of many or of all the citizens; though it is supposed to be thereby\r\nprovided that the State should be possessed of vigour and strength as a reality - an individual\r\nunity. - The primary consideration is, then, the distinction between the governing and the governed,\r\nand political constitutions in the abstract have been rightly divided into Monarchy, Aristocracy,\r\nand Democracy; which gives occasion, however, to the remark that Monarchy itself must be\r\nfurther divided into Despotism and Monarchy proper; that in all the divisions to which the leading\r\nIdea gives rise, only the generic character is to be made prominent, - it being not intended thereby\r\nthat the particular category under review should be exhausted as a Form, Order, or Kind in its\r\nconcrete development. But especially it must be observed, that the above-mentioned divisions\r\nadmit of a multitude of particular modifications, - not only such as lie within the limits of those\r\nclasses themselves, - but also such as are mixtures of several of these essentially distinct classes,\r\nand which are consequently misshapen, unstable, and inconsistent forms. In such a collision, the\r\nconcerning question is, what is the best constitution; that is, by what arrangement, organisation or\r\nmechanism of the power of the State its object can be most surely attained. This object may\r\nindeed be variously understood; for instance, as the calm enjoyment of life on the part of the\r\ncitizens, or as Universal Happiness. Such aims have suggested the so-called Ideals of Constitution,\r\nand, - as a particular branch of the subject, - Ideals of the Education of Princes (Fenelon), or of\r\nthe governing body - the aristocracy at large (Plato); for the chief point they treat of is the\r\ncondition of those subjects who stand at the head of affairs; and in these ideals the concrete details\r\nof political organisation are not at all considered. The inquiry into the best constitution is frequently\r\ntreated as if not only the theory were an affair of subjective independent conviction, but as if the\r\nintroduction of a constitution recognised as the best, - or as superior to others, - could be the\r\nresult of a resolve adopted in this theoretical manner; as if the form of a constitution were a matter\r\nof free choice, determined by nothing else but reflection. Of this artless fashion was that\r\ndeliberation, - not indeed of the Persian people, but of the Persian grandees, who had conspired\r\nto overthrow the pseudo-Smerdis and the Magi, after their undertaking had succeeded, and when\r\nthere was no scion of the royal family living, - as to what constitution they should introduce into\r\nPersia; and Herodotus gives an equally naive account of this deliberation."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                               \ufffd\ufffd 47\n"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In the present day, the Constitution of a country and people is not represented as so entirely\r\ndependent on free and deliberate choice.

In this view also,\r\nthe necessity of a particular constitution is made to depend on the condition of the people in such a\r\nway as if the latter were non-essential and accidental. This representation is founded on the\r\ndistinction which the reflective understanding makes between an idea and the corresponding\r\nreality; holding to an abstract and consequently untrue idea; not grasping it in its completeness, or -\r\nwhich is virtually, though not in point of form, the same - not taking a concrete view of a people\r\nand a state. We shall have to show further on that the constitution adopted by a people makes one\r\nsubstance - one spirit - with its religion, its art and philosophy, or, at least, with its conceptions and\r\nthoughts - its culture generally; not to expatiate upon the additional influences, ab extra, of\r\nclimate, of neighbours, of its place in the world. A State is an individual totality, of which you\r\ncannot select any particular side, although a supremely important one, such as its political\r\nconstitution; and deliberate and decide respecting it in that isolated form. Not only is that\r\nconstitution most intimately connected with and dependent on those other spiritual forces; but the\r\nform of the entire moral and intellectual individuality - comprising all the forces it embodies - is\r\nonly a step in the development of the grand Whole, - with its place pre-appointed in the process: a\r\nfact which gives the highest sanction to the constitution in question, and establishes its absolute\r\nnecessity. -The origin of a State involves imperious lordship on the one hand, instinctive\r\nsubmission on the other. But even obedience - lordly power, and the fear inspired by a ruler - in\r\nitself implies some degree of voluntary connection. Even in barbarous states this is the case; it is\r\nnot the isolated will of individuals that prevails; individual pretensions are relinquished, and the\r\ngeneral will is the essential bond of political union. This unity of the general and the particular is the\r\nIdea itself, manifesting itself as a State, and which subsequently undergoes further development\r\nwithin itself. The abstract yet necessitated process in the development of truly independent states is\r\nas follows: - They begin with regal power, whether of patriarchal or military origin. In the next\r\nphase, particularity and individuality assert themselves in the form of Aristocracy and Democracy.\r\nLastly, we have the subjection of these separate interests to a single power; but which can be\r\nabsolutely none other than one outside of which those spheres have an independent position, viz.,\r\nthe Monarchical. Two phases of royalty, therefore, must be distinguished, - a primary and a\r\nsecondary one.

In this case the relation is that of a continuous development of the same\r\nstructure, whose foundation-stone, walls, and roof have remained what they were. In Art, the\r\nGreek itself, in its original form, furnishes us the best models. But in regard to political constitution,\r\nit is quite otherwise: here the Ancient and the Modern have not their essential principle in common.\r\nAbstract definitions and dogmas respecting just government, - importing that intelligence and virtue\r\nought to bear sway - are, indeed, common to both. But nothing is so absurd as to look to Greeks,\r\nRomans, or Orientals, for models for the political arrangements of our time. From the East may be\r\nderived beautiful pictures of a patriarchal condition, of paternal government, and of devotion to it\r\non the part of peoples; from Greeks and Romans, descriptions of popular liberty. Among the latter\r\nwe find the idea of a Free Constitution admitting all the citizens to a share in deliberations and\r\nresolves respecting the affairs and laws of the Commonwealth. In our times, too, this is its general\r\nacceptation; only with this modification, that - since our States are so large, and there are so many\r\nof "the Many," the latter, - direct action being impossible, - should by the indirect method of\r\nelective substitution express their concurrence with resolves affecting the common weal; that is,\r\nthat for legislative purposes generally, the people should be represented by deputies.

Besides, the basis of this view is\r\nthe principle of isolated individuality - the absolute validity of the subjective will - a dogma which\r\nwe have already investigated. The great point is, that Freedom in its Ideal conception has not\r\nsubjective will and caprice for its principle, but the recognition of the universal will; and that the\r\nprocess by which Freedom is realised is the free development of its successive stages. The\r\nsubjective will is a merely formal determination - a carte blanche - not including what it is that is\r\nwilled.

We have, on the one hand, recognised the\r\nIdea in the definite form of Freedom conscious of and willing itself, - having itself alone as its\r\nobject: involving at the same time, the pure and simple Idea of Reason, and likewise, that which\r\nwe have called subject - self-consciousness - Spirit actually existing in the World. If, on the other\r\nhand, we consider Subjectivity, we find that subjective knowledge and will is Thought. But by the\r\nvery act of thoughtful cognition and volition, I will the universal object - the substance of absolute\r\nReason. We observe, therefore, an essential union between the objective side - the Idea, - and the\r\nsubjective side - the personality that conceives and wills it. - The objective existence of this union\r\nis the State, which is therefore the basis and centre of the other concrete elements of the life of a\r\npeople, - of Art, of Law, of Morals, of Religion, of Science. All the activity of Spirit has only this\r\nobject - the becoming conscious of this union, i.e., of its own Freedom. Among the forms of this\r\nconscious union Religion occupies the highest position. In it, Spirit - rising above the limitations of\r\ntemporal and secular existence - becomes conscious of the Absolute Spirit, and in this\r\nconsciousness of the self-existent Being, renounces its individual interest; it lays this aside in\r\nDevotion - a state of mind in which it refuses to occupy itself any longer with the limited and\r\nparticular. By Sacrifice man expresses his renunciation of his property, his will, his individual\r\nfeelings. The religious concentration of the soul appears in the form of feeling; it nevertheless\r\npasses also into reflection; a form of worship (cultus) is a result of reflection. The second form of\r\nthe union of the objective and subjective in the human spirit is Art. This advances farther into the\r\nrealm of the actual and sensuous than Religion. In its noblest walk it is occupied with representing,\r\nnot indeed, the Spirit of God, but certainly the Form of God; and in its secondary aims, that which\r\nis divine and spiritual generally. Its office is to render visible the Divine; presenting it to the\r\nimaginative and intuitive faculty. But the True is the object not only of conception and feeling, as in\r\nReligion, - and of Intuition, as in Art, - but also of the thinking faculty; and this gives us the third\r\nform of the union in question - Philosophy. This is consequently the highest, freest, and wisest\r\nphase. Of course we are not intending to investigate these three phases here; they have only\r\nsuggested themselves in virtue of their occupying the same general ground as the object here\r\nconsidered - the State."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                               \ufffd\ufffd 51\n"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The general principle which manifests itself and becomes an object of consciousness in the State, -\r\nthe form under which all that the State includes is brought, is the whole of that cycle of phenomena\r\nwhich constitutes the culture of a nation.

In this social relation,\r\nmorality consists in the members behaving towards each other not as individuals - possessing an\r\nindependent will; not as persons. The Family therefore is excluded from that process of\r\ndevelopment in which History takes its rise. But when this self-involved spiritual Unity steps\r\nbeyond this circle of feeling and natural love, and first attains the consciousness of personality, we\r\nhave that dark, dull centre of indifference, in which neither Nature nor Spirit is open and\r\ntransparent; and for which Nature and Spirit can become open and transparent only by means of a\r\nfurther process, \ufffd\ufffd a very lengthened culture of that Will at length become self-conscious.\r\nConsciousness alone is clearness; and is that alone for which God (or any other existence) can be\r\nrevealed.

Freedom is nothing but the recognition and adoption of such\r\nuniversal substantial objects as Right and Law, and the production of a reality that is accordant\r\nwith them \ufffd\ufffd the State. Nations may have passed a long life before arriving at this their destination,\r\nand during this period, they may have attained considerable culture in some directions. This\r\nante-historical period \ufffd\ufffd consistently with what has been said \ufffd\ufffd lies out of our plan; whether a real\r\nhistory followed it, or the peoples in question never attained a political constitution. \ufffd\ufffd It is a great\r\ndiscovery in history \ufffd\ufffd as of a new world \ufffd\ufffd which has been made within rather more than the last\r\ntwenty years, respecting the Sanskrit and the connection of the European languages with it. In\r\nparticular, the connection of the German and Indian peoples has been demonstrated, with as much\r\ncertainty as such subjects allow of. Even at the present time we know of peoples which scarcely\r\nform a society, much less a State, but that have been long known as existing; while with regard to\r\nothers, which in their advanced condition excite our especial interest, tradition reaches beyond the\r\nrecord of the founding of the State, and they experienced many changes prior to that epoch. In the\r\nconnection just referred to, between the languages of nations so widely separated, we have a\r\nresult before us, which proves the diffusion of those nations from Asia as a centre, and the so\r\ndissimilar development of what had been originally related, as an incontestable fact; not as an\r\ninference deduced by that favourite method of combining, and reasoning from, circumstances\r\ngrave and trivial, which has already enriched and will continue to enrich history with so many\r\nfictions given out as facts. But that apparently so extensive range of events lies beyond the pale of\r\nhistory; in fact preceded it. In our language the term History unites the objective with the\r\nsubjective side, and denotes quite as much the historia rerum gestarum, as the res gestae\r\nthemselves; on the other hand it comprehends not less what has happened, than the narration of\r\nwhat has happened. This union of the two meanings we must regard as of a higher order than mere\r\noutward accident; we must suppose historical narrations to have appeared contemporaneously\r\nwith historical deeds and events. It is an internal vital principle common to both that produces them\r\nsynchronously. Family memorials, patriarchal traditions, have an interest confined to the family and\r\nthe clan. The uniform course of events which such a condition implies, is no subject of serious\r\nremembrance; though distinct transactions or turns of fortune, may rouse Mnemosyne to form\r\nconceptions of them, \ufffd\ufffd in the same way as love and the religious emotions provoke imagination to\r\ngive shape to a previously formless impulse. But it is the State which first presents subject-matter\r\nthat is not only adapted to the prose of History, but involves the production of such history in the\r\nvery progress of its own being. Instead of merely subjective mandates on the part of government,\r\n\ufffd\ufffd sufficing for the needs of the moment, \ufffd\ufffd a community that is acquiring a stable existence, and\r\nexalting itself into a State, requires formal commands and laws \ufffd\ufffd comprehensive and universally\r\nbinding prescriptions; and thus produces a record as well as an interest concerned with intelligent,\r\ndefinite \ufffd\ufffd and, in their results \ufffd\ufffd lasting transactions and occurrences; on which Mnemosyne, for\r\nthe behoof of the perennial object of the formation and constitution of the State, is impelled to\r\nconfer perpetuity. Profound sentiments generally, such as that of love, as also religious intuition and\r\nits conceptions, are in themselves complete \ufffd\ufffd constantly present and satisfying; but that outward\r\nexistence of a political constitution which is enshrined in its rational laws and customs, is an\r\nimperfect Present; and cannot be thoroughly understood without a knowledge of the past."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                               \ufffd\ufffd 69\n"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The periods \ufffd\ufffd whether we suppose them to be centuries or millennia \ufffd\ufffd that were passed by\r\nnations before history was written among them, \ufffd\ufffd and which may have been filled with\r\nrevolutions, nomadic wanderings, and the strangest mutations, \ufffd\ufffd are on that very account destitute\r\nof objective history, because they present no subjective history, no annals.

Here we need adopt only one of its results, viz. that every\r\nstep in the process, as differing from any other, has its determinate peculiar principle. In history this\r\nprinciple is idiosyncrasy of Spirit \ufffd\ufffd peculiar National Genius. It is within the limitations of this\r\nidiosyncrasy that the spirit of the nation, concretely manifested, expresses every aspect of its\r\nconsciousness and will \ufffd\ufffd the whole cycle of its realisation.

That such or such a specific quality constitutes the\r\npeculiar genius of a people, is the element of our inquiry which must be derived from experience,\r\nand historically proved. To accomplish this, presupposes not only a disciplined faculty of\r\nabstraction, but an intimate acquaintance with the Idea.

From this want of acquaintance with the\r\nideas that relate to the development of Freedom, proceed a part of those objections which are\r\nbrought against the philosophical consideration of a science usually regarded as one of mere\r\nexperience; the so-called \ufffd\ufffd priori method, and the attempt to insinuate ideas into the empirical\r\ndata of history, being the chief points in the indictment. Where this deficiency exists, such\r\nconceptions appear alien \ufffd\ufffd not lying within the object of investigation.

It must be observed that in this very process of\r\nscientific Understanding, it is of importance that the essential should be distinguished and brought\r\ninto relief in contrast with the so-called non-essential. But in order to render this possible, we must\r\nknow what is essential; and that is \ufffd\ufffd in view of the History of the World in general \ufffd\ufffd the\r\nConsciousness of Freedom, and the phases which this consciousness assumes in developing itself.\r\nThe bearing of historical facts on this category, is their bearing on the truly Essential. Of the\r\ndifficulties stated, and the opposition exhibited to comprehensive conceptions in science, part must\r\nbe referred to the inability to grasp and understand Ideas. If in Natural History some monstrous\r\nhybrid growth is alleged as an objection to the recognition of clear and indubitable classes or\r\nspecies, a sufficient reply is furnished by a sentiment often vaguely urged, \ufffd\ufffd that \ufffd\ufffdthe exception\r\nconfirms the rule;\ufffd\ufffd i.e., that it is the part of a well-defined rule, to hew the conditions in which it\r\napplies, or the deficiency or hybridism of cases that are abnormal. Mere Nature is too weak to\r\nkeep its genera and species pure, when conflicting with alien elementary influences. If, e.g., on\r\nconsidering the human organisation in its concrete aspect, we assert that brain, heart, and so forth\r\nare essential to its organic life, some miserable abortion may be adduced, which has on the whole\r\nthe human form, or parts of it, \ufffd\ufffd which has been conceived in a human body and has breathed\r\nafter birth therefrom, \ufffd\ufffd in which nevertheless no brain and no heart is found.
