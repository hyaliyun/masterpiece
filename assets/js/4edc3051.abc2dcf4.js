But even if it angered me such words as those of Professor Phelps would take the sting all out.  Nobody attaches weight to the freaks of the Charlton Library, but when a man like Phelps speaks, the world gives attention.

DEAR MRS. GLYN, It reads pretty poorly--I get the sense of it, but it is a poor literary job; however, it would have to be that because nobody can be reported even approximately, except by a stenographer. Approximations, synopsized speeches, translated poems, artificial flowers and chromos all have a sort of value, but it is small.  If you had put upon paper what I really said it would have wrecked your type-machine. I said some fetid, over-vigorous things, but that was because it was a confidential conversation.  I said nothing for print.  My own report of the same conversation reads like Satan roasting a Sunday school.  It, and certain other readable chapters of my autobiography will not be published until all the Clemens family are dead--dead and correspondingly indifferent.  They were written to entertain me, not the rest of the world.  I am not here to do good--at least not to do it intentionally. You must pardon me for dictating this letter; I am sick a-bed and not feeling as well as I might.                               Sincerely Yours,                                              S. L. CLEMENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n Among the cultured men of England Mark Twain had no greater admirer,      or warmer friend, than Andrew Lang.  They were at one on most      literary subjects, and especially so in their admiration of the life      and character of Joan of Arc.  Both had written of her, and both      held her to be something almost more than mortal.  When, therefore,      Anatole France published his exhaustive biography of the maid of      Domremy, a book in which he followed, with exaggerated minuteness      and innumerable footnotes, every step of Joan's physical career at      the expense of her spiritual life, which he was inclined to cheapen,      Lang wrote feelingly, and with some contempt, of the performance,      inviting the author of the Personal Recollections to come to the      rescue of their heroine.  \"Compare every one of his statements with      the passages he cites from authorities, and make him the laughter of      the world\" he wrote.  \"If you are lazy about comparing I can make      you a complete set of what the authorities say, and of what this      amazing novelist says that they say.  When I tell you that he thinks      the Epiphany (January 6, Twelfth Night) is December 25th--Christmas      Day-you begin to see what an egregious ass he is.  Treat him like      Dowden, and oblige\"--a reference to Mark Twain's defense of Harriet      Shelley, in which he had heaped ridicule on Dowden's Life of the      Poet--a masterly performance; one of the best that ever came from      Mark Twain's pen.\r\n\r\n Lang's suggestion would seem to have been a welcome one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    To Andrew Lang, in London:\r\n\r\n                                    NEW YORK, April 25, 1908. DEAR MR. LANG,--I haven't seen the book nor any review of it, but only not very-understandable references to it--of a sort which discomforted me, but of course set my interest on fire.  I don't want to have to read it in French--I should lose the nice shades, and should do a lot of gross misinterpreting, too.  But there'll be a translation soon, nicht wahr? I will wait for it.

The      mind, he declared, adapted, consciously or unconsciously; it did not      create.  In a letter which follows he elucidates this doctrine.  The      reference in it to the "captain" and to the kerosene, as the reader      may remember, have to do with Captain "Hurricane" Jones and his      theory of the miracles of "Isaac and of the prophets of Baal," as      expounded in Some Rambling Notes of an Idle Excursion.\r\n\r\n By a trick of memory Clemens gives The Little Duke as his suggestion      for The Prince and the Pauper; he should have written The Prince and      the Page, by the same author.\r\n\r\n\r\n                To Rev.
