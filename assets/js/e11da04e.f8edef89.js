To stake all one's life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not - there is no weakness in that.

The police should interfere.  At luncheon I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to propose again, and I just managed to check him in time by assuring him that I was a bimetallist.  Fortunately I don't know what bimetallism means.  And I don't believe anybody else does either.  But the observation crushed Tommy for ten minutes.  He looked quite shocked.  And then Tommy is so annoying in the way he proposes.  If he proposed at the top of his voice, I should not mind so much.  That might produce some effect on the public.  But he does it in a horrid confidential way.  When Tommy wants to be romantic he talks to one just like a doctor.  I am very fond of Tommy, but his methods of proposing are quite out of date.

In my time, of course, we were taught not to understand anything.  That was the old system, and wonderfully interesting it was.

But since Sir John has taken to attending the debates regularly, which he never used to do in the good old days, his language has become quite impossible.  He always seems to think that he is addressing the House, and consequently whenever he discusses the state of the agricultural labourer, or the Welsh Church, or something quite improper of that kind, I am obliged to send all the servants out of the room.  It is not pleasant to see one's own butler, who has been with one for twenty-three years, actually blushing at the side-board, and the footmen making contortions in corners like persons in circuses.  I assure you my life will be quite ruined unless they send John at once to the Upper House.  He won't take any interest in politics then, will he?  The House of Lords is so sensible.  An assembly of gentlemen.  But in his present state, Sir John is really a great trial.  Why, this morning before breakfast was half over, he stood up on the hearthrug, put his hands in his pockets, and appealed to the country at the top of his voice.

Her daughter, quite a well-brought-up girl, too, has actually become engaged to be married to a curate in Shropshire.  It is very sad, very sad indeed.  I can't understand this modern mania for curates.  In my time we girls saw them, of course, running about the place like rabbits.  But we never took any notice of them, I need hardly say.  But I am told that nowadays country society is quite honeycombed with them.  I think it most irreligious.  And then the eldest son has quarrelled with his father, and it is said that when they meet at the club Lord Brancaster always hides himself behind the money article in THE TIMES.  However, I believe that is quite a common occurrence nowadays and that they have to take in extra copies of THE TIMES at all the clubs in St. James's Street; there are so many sons who won't have anything to do with their fathers, and so many fathers who won't speak to their sons.

She ultimately was so broken-hearted that she went into a convent, or on to the operatic stage, I forget which.  No; I think it was decorative art-needlework she took up.  I know she had lost all sense of pleasure in life.  [Rising.]  And now, Gertrude, if you will allow me, I shall leave Mrs. Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of an hour.

It is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us - else what use is love at all?  All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive.
