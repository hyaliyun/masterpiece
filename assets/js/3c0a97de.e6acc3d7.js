In many of the somewhat violent attacks that have recently been\\r made on that splendour of mounting which now characterises our\\r Shakespearian revivals in England, it seems to have been tacitly\\r assumed by the critics that Shakespeare himself was more or less\\r indifferent to the costumes of his actors, and that, could he see\\r Mrs. Langtry\'s production of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA, he would\\r probably say that the play, and the play only, is the thing, and\\r that everything else is leather and prunella.  While, as regards\\r any historical accuracy in dress, Lord Lytton, in an article in the\\r NINETEENTH CENTURY, has laid it down as a dogma of art that\\r archaeology is entirely out of place in the presentation of any of\\r Shakespeare\'s plays, and the attempt to introduce it one of the\\r stupidest pedantries of an age of prigs.\\r \\r Lord Lytton\'s position I shall examine later on; but, as regards\\r the theory that Shakespeare did not busy himself much about the\\r costume-wardrobe of his theatre, anybody who cares to study\\r Shakespeare\'s method will see that there is absolutely no dramatist\\r of the French, English, or Athenian stage who relies so much for\\r his illusionist effects on the dress of his actors as Shakespeare\\r does himself.\\r \\r Knowing how the artistic temperament is always fascinated by beauty\\r of costume, he constantly introduces into his plays masques and\\r dances, purely for the sake of the pleasure which they give the\\r eye; and we have still his stage-directions for the three great\\r processions in HENRY THE EIGHTH, directions which are characterised\\r by the most extraordinary elaborateness of detail down to the\\r collars of S.S. and the pearls in Anne Boleyn\'s hair.  Indeed it\\r would be quite easy for a modern manager to reproduce these\\r pageants absolutely as Shakespeare had them designed; and so\\r accurate were they that one of the court officials of the time,\\r writing an account of the last performance of the play at the Globe\\r Theatre to a friend, actually complains of their realistic\\r character, notably of the production on the stage of the Knights of\\r the Garter in the robes and insignia of the order as being\\r calculated to bring ridicule on the real ceremonies; much in the\\r same spirit in which the French Government, some time ago,\\r prohibited that delightful actor, M. Christian, from appearing in\\r uniform, on the plea that it was prejudicial to the glory of the\\r army that a colonel should be caricatured.  And elsewhere the\\r gorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the English stage under\\r Shakespeare\'s influence was attacked by the contemporary critics,\\r not as a rule, however, on the grounds of the democratic tendencies\\r of realism, but usually on those moral grounds which are always the\\r last refuge of people who have no sense of beauty.\\r \\r The point, however, which I wish to emphasise is, not that\\r Shakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in adding\\r picturesqueness to poetry, but that he saw how important costume is\\r as a means of producing certain dramatic effects.  Many of his\\r plays, such as MEASURE FOR MEASURE, TWELFTH NIGHT, THE TWO\\r GENTLEMAN OF VERONA, ALL\'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, CYMBELINE, and\\r others, depend for their illusion on the character of the various\\r dresses worn by the hero or the heroine; the delightful scene in\\r HENRY THE SIXTH, on the modern miracles of healing by faith, loses\\r all its point unless Gloster is in black and scarlet; and the\\r DENOUMENT of the MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR hinges on the colour of\\r Anne Page\'s gown.  As for the uses Shakespeare makes of disguises\\r the instances are almost numberless.  Posthumus hides his passion\\r under a peasant\'s garb, and Edgar his pride beneath an idiot\'s\\r rags; Portia wears the apparel of a lawyer, and Rosalind is attired\\r in \'all points as a man\'; the cloak-bag of Pisanio changes Imogen\\r to the Youth Fidele; Jessica flees from her father\'s house in boy\'s\\r dress, and Julia ties up her yellow hair in fantastic love-knots,\\r and dons hose and doublet; Henry the Eighth woos his lady as a\\r shepherd, and Romeo his as a pilgrim; Prince Hal and Poins appear\\r first as footpads in buckram suits, and then in white aprons and\\r leather jerkins as the waiters in a tavern-\\r \\r \\r I remember\\r The first time ever Caesar put it on.\\r \'Twas on a summer\'s evening, in his tent,\\r The day he overcame the Nervii\\r See what a rent the envious Casca made-\\r \\r \\r Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,\\r Which in the day of battle tire thee more\\r Than all the complete armour that thou wear\'st.\\r \\r \\r As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, it\\r is to be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the\\r smallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historical\\r plays, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many\\r effective open-air incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who\\r had at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who\\r could rely on the actors taking pains about their make-up.  Even\\r now it is difficult to produce such a play as the COMEDY OF ERRORS;\\r and to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry\'s brother\\r resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing TWELFTH NIGHT\\r adequately performed.  Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare\'s on\\r the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires\\r the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a\\r costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a\\r master of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-\\r master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production.\\r For he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each\\r character.  \'Racine abhorre la realite,\' says Auguste Vacquerie\\r somewhere; \'il ne daigne pas s\'occuper de son costume.  Si l\'on\\r s\'en rapportait aux indications du poete, Agamemnon serait vetu\\r d\'un sceptre et Achille d\'une epee.\'  But with Shakespeare it is\\r very different.  He gives us directions about the costumes of\\r Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in MACBETH, and the\\r apothecary in ROMEO AND JULIET, several elaborate descriptions of\\r his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in\\r which Petruchio is to be married.  Rosalind, he tells us, is tall,\\r and is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and\\r is to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt.  The children\\r who play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white\\r and green - a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose\\r favourite colours they were - and in white, with green garlands and\\r gilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton.\\r Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by his\\r wearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his boots.  The\\r Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in\\r mourning beside her.  The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of the\\r Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are\\r all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue.  We know the\\r patterns on the Dauphin\'s armour and the Pucelle\'s sword, the crest\\r on Warwick\'s helmet and the colour of Bardolph\'s nose.  Portia has\\r golden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls,\\r and Sir Andrew Aguecheek\'s hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and\\r won\'t curl at all.  Some of the characters are stout, some lean,\\r some straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are\\r to blacken their faces.  Lear has a white beard, Hamlet\'s father a\\r grizzled, and Benedick is to shave his in the course of the play.\\r Indeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quite\\r elaborate; tells us of the many different colours in use, and gives\\r a hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on.\\r There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics in\\r hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians,\\r and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in an\\r ass\'s head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the\\r Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated\\r husband and his wife\'s milliner about the slashing of a sleeve.\\r \\r As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the\\r aphorisms he makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age,\\r particularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies\' bonnets, and the\\r many descriptions of the MUNDUS MULIEBRIS, from the long of\\r Autolycus in the WINTER\'S TALE down to the account of the Duchess\\r of Milan\'s gown in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, they are far too\\r numerous to quote; though it may be worth while to remind people\\r that the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to be found in\\r Lear\'s scene with Edgar - a passage which has the advantage of\\r brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing\\r metaphysics of SARTOR RESARTUS.  But I think that from what I have\\r already said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much\\r interested in costume.  I do not mean in that shallow sense by\\r which it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds and\\r daffodils that he was the Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan\\r age; but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressive\\r of a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain types\\r of character, and is one of the essential factors of the means\\r which a true illusionist has at his disposal.  Indeed to him the\\r deformed figure of Richard was of as much value as Juliet\'s\\r loveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks of\\r the lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each  and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one of\\r his plays, expresses his regret at being unable to produce helmets\\r of the period, he is speaking as an Elizabethan manager and not\\r merely as an Elizabethan poet.  At Cambridge, for instance, during\\r his day, a play of RICHARD THE THIRD was performed, in which the\\r actors were attired in real dresses of the time, procured from the\\r great collection of historical costume in the Tower, which was\\r always open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes placed at\\r their disposal.  And I cannot help thinking that this performance\\r must have been far more artistic, as regards costume, than\\r Garrick\'s mounting of Shakespeare\'s own play on the subject, in\\r which he himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, and\\r everybody else in the costume of the time of George the Third,\\r Richmond especially being much admired in the uniform of a young\\r guardsman.\\r \\r For what is the use to the stage of that archaeology which has so\\r strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can\\r give us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which\\r the action of the play passes?  It enables us to see a Greek\\r dressed like a Greek, and an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the\\r arcades of Venice and the balconies of Verona; and, if the play\\r deals with any of the great eras in our country\'s history, to\\r contemplate the age in its proper attire, and the king in his habit\\r as he lived.  And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would have\\r said some time ago, at the Princess\'s Theatre, had the curtain\\r risen on his father\'s Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair,\\r attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume\\r which in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to\\r an antique Roman!  For in those halcyon days of the drama no\\r archaeology troubled the stage, or distressed the critics, and our\\r inartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of\\r anachronisms, and beheld with the calm complacency of the age of\\r prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a Lear in lace ruffles, and\\r a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline.  I can understand archaeology\\r being attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but to\\r attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark.\\r However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as\\r well speak disrespectfully of the equator.  For archaeology, being\\r a science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply.  Its value\\r depends entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it.\\r We look to the archaeologist for the materials, to the artist for\\r the method.\\r \\r In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare\'s\\r plays, the first thing the artist has to settle is the best date\\r for the drama.  This should be determined by the general spirit of\\r the play, more than by any actual historical references which may\\r occur in it.  Most HAMLETS I have seen were placed far too early.\\r HAMLET is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and if\\r the allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts it\\r back to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down much\\r later.  Once, however, that the date has been fixed, then the\\r archaeologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is to\\r convert into effects.\\r \\r It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show\\r us that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a\\r great deal of capital has been made out of Hector\'s indiscreet\\r quotation from Aristotle.  Upon the other hand, the anachronisms\\r are really few in number, and not very important, and, had\\r Shakespeare\'s attention been drawn to them by a brother artist, he\\r would probably have corrected them.  For, though they can hardly be\\r called blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of his\\r work; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannot\\r be emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to\\r its proper date.  In looking at Shakespeare\'s plays as a whole,\\r however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelity\\r as regards his personages and his plots.  Many of his DRAMATIS\\r PERSONAE are people who had actually existed, and some of them\\r might have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience.\\r Indeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his\\r time was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.  As for his\\r plots, Shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentic\\r history, or from the old ballads and traditions which served as\\r history to the Elizabethan public, and which even now no scientific\\r historian would dismiss as absolutely untrue.  And not merely did\\r he select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of his\\r imaginative work, but he always gives to each play the general\\r character, the social atmosphere in a word, of the age in question.\\r Stupidity he recognises as being one of the permanent\\r characteristics of all European civilisations; so he sees no\\r difference between a London mob of his own day and a Roman mob of\\r pagan days, between a silly watchman in Messina and a silly Justice\\r of the Peace in Windsor.  But when he deals with higher characters,\\r with those exceptions of each age which are so fine that they\\r become its types, he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal of\\r their time.  Virgilia is one of those Roman wives on whose tomb was\\r written \'Domi mansit, lanam fecit,\' as surely as Juliet is the\\r romantic girl of the Renaissance.  He is even true to the\\r characteristics of race.  Hamlet has all the imagination and\\r irresolution of the Northern nations, and the Princess Katharine is\\r as entirely French as the heroine of DIVORCONS.  Harry the Fifth is\\r a pure Englishman, and Othello a true Moor.\\r \\r Again when Shakespeare treats of the history of England from the\\r fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it is wonderful how careful\\r he is to have his facts perfectly right - indeed he follows\\r Holinshed with curious fidelity.  The incessant wars between France\\r and England are described with extraordinary accuracy down to the\\r names of the besieged towns, the ports of landing and embarkation,\\r the sites and dates of the battles, the titles of the commanders on\\r each side, and the lists of the killed and wounded.  And as regards\\r the Civil Wars of the Roses we have many elaborate genealogies of\\r the seven sons of Edward the Third; the claims of the rival Houses\\r of York and Lancaster to the throne are discussed at length; and if\\r the English aristocracy will not read Shakespeare as a poet, they\\r should certainly read him as a sort of early Peerage.  There is\\r hardly a single title in the Upper House, with the exception of\\r course of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords, which\\r does not appear in Shakespeare along with many details of family\\r history, creditable and discreditable.  Indeed if it be really\\r necessary that the School Board children should know all about the\\r Wars of the Roses, they could learn their lessons just as well out\\r of Shakespeare as out of shilling primers, and learn them, I need\\r not say, far more pleasurably.  Even in Shakespeare\'s own day this\\r use of his plays was recognised.  \'The historical plays teach\\r history to those who cannot read it in the chronicles,\' says\\r Heywood in a tract about the stage, and yet I am sure that\\r sixteenth-century chronicles were much more delightful reading than\\r nineteenth-century primers are.\\r \\r Of course the aesthetic value of Shakespeare\'s plays does not, in\\r the slightest degree, depend on their facts, but on their Truth,\\r and Truth is independent of facts always, inventing or selecting\\r them at pleasure.  But still Shakespeare\'s use of facts is a most\\r interesting part of his method of work, and shows us his attitude\\r towards the stage, and his relations to the great art of illusion.\\r Indeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classing\\r his plays with \'fairy tales,\' as Lord Lytton does; for one of his\\r aims was to create for England a national historical drama, which\\r should deal with incidents with which the public was well\\r acquainted, and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people.\\r Patriotism, I need hardly say, is not a necessary quality of art;\\r but it means, for the artist, the substitution of a universal for\\r an individual feeling, and for the public the presentation of a\\r work of art in a most attractive and popular form.  It is worth\\r noticing that Shakespeare\'s first and last successes were both\\r historical plays.\\r \\r It may be asked, what has this to do with Shakespeare\'s attitude\\r towards costume?  I answer that a dramatist who laid such stress on\\r historical accuracy of fact would have welcomed historical accuracy\\r of costume as a most important adjunct to his illusionist method.\\r And I have no hesitation in saying that he did so.  The reference\\r to helmets of the period in the prologue to HENRY THE FIFTH may be\\r considered fanciful, though Shakespeare must have often seen\\r \\r \\r The very casque\\r That did affright the air at Agincourt,\\r \\r \\r where it still hangs in the dusky gloom of Westminster Abbey, along\\r with the saddle of that \'imp of fame,\' and the dinted shield with\\r its torn blue velvet lining and its tarnished lilies of gold; but\\r the use of military tabards in HENRY THE SIXTH is a bit of pure\\r archaeology, as they were not worn in the sixteenth century; and\\r the King\'s own tabard, I may mention, was still suspended over his\\r tomb in St. George\'s Chapel, Windsor, in Shakespeare\'s day.  For,\\r up to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the Philistines in\\r 1645, the chapels and cathedrals of England were the great national\\r museums of archaeology, and in them were kept the armour and attire\\r of the heroes of English history.  A good deal was of course\\r preserved in the Tower, and even in Elizabeth\'s day tourists were\\r brought there to see such curious relics of the past as Charles\\r Brandon\'s huge lance, which is still, I believe, the admiration of\\r our country visitors; but the cathedrals and churches were, as a\\r rule, selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception of\\r the historic antiquities.  Canterbury can still show us the helm of\\r the Black Prince, Westminster the robes of our kings, and in old\\r St. Paul\'s the very banner that had waved on Bosworth field was\\r hung up by Richmond himself.\\r \\r In fact, everywhere that Shakespeare turned in London, he saw the\\r apparel and appurtenances of past ages, and it is impossible to\\r doubt that he made use of his opportunities.  The employment of\\r lance and shield, for instance, in actual warfare, which is so\\r frequent in his plays, is drawn from archaeology, and not from the\\r military accoutrements of his day; and his general use of armour in\\r battle was not a characteristic of his age, a time when it was\\r rapidly disappearing before firearms.  Again, the crest on\\r Warwick\'s helmet, of which such a point is made in HENRY THE SIXTH,\\r is absolutely correct in a fifteenth-century play when crests were\\r generally worn, but would not have been so in a play of\\r Shakespeare\'s own time, when feathers and plumes had taken their\\r place - a fashion which, as he tells us in HENRY THE EIGHTH, was\\r borrowed from France.  For the historical plays, then, we may be\\r sure that archaeology was employed, and as for the others I feel\\r certain that it was the case also.  The appearance of Jupiter on\\r his eagle, thunderbolt in hand, of Juno with her peacocks, and of\\r Iris with her many-coloured bow; the Amazon masque and the masque\\r of the Five Worthies, may all be regarded as archaeological; and\\r the vision which Posthumus sees in prison of Sicilius Leonatus -\\r \'an old man, attired like a warrior, leading an ancient matron\' -\\r is clearly so.  Of the \'Athenian dress\' by which Lysander is\\r distinguished from Oberon I have already spoken; but one of the\\r most marked instances is in the case of the dress of Coriolanus,\\r for which Shakespeare goes directly to Plutarch.  That historian,\\r in his Life of the great Roman, tells us of the oak-wreath with\\r which Caius Marcius was crowned, and of the curious kind of dress\\r in which, according to ancient fashion, he had to canvass his\\r electors; and on both of these points he enters into long\\r disquisitions, investigating the origin and meaning of the old\\r customs.  Shakespeare, in the spirit of the true artist, accepts\\r the facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic and\\r picturesque effects  and, as far as dramatic value goes, to confuse\\r the costumes is to confuse the play.  Costume is a growth, an\\r evolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, sign\\r of the manners, customs and mode of life of each century.  The\\r Puritan dislike of colour, adornment and grace in apparel was part\\r of the great revolt of the middle classes against Beauty in the\\r seventeenth century.  A historian who disregarded it would give us\\r a most inaccurate picture of the time, and a dramatist who did not\\r avail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing an\\r illusionist effect.  The effeminacy of dress that characterised the\\r reign of Richard the Second was a constant theme of contemporary\\r authors.  Shakespeare, writing two hundred years after, makes the\\r king\'s fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in the\\r play, from John of Gaunt\'s reproaches down to Richard\'s own speech\\r in the third act on his deposition from the throne.  And that\\r Shakespeare examined Richard\'s tomb in Westminster Abbey seems to\\r me certain from York\'s speech  it is not merely a dangerous\\r colour to wear by gaslight, but it is really difficult in England\\r to get a thoroughly good blue.  The fine Chinese blue, which we all\\r so much admire, takes two years to dye, and the English public will\\r not wait so long for a colour.  Peacock blue, of course, has been\\r employed on the stage, notably at the Lyceum, with great advantage;\\r but all attempts at a good light blue, or good dark blue, which I\\r have seen have been failures.  The value of black is hardly\\r appreciated; it was used effectively by Mr. Irving in HAMLET as the\\r central note of a composition, but as a tone-giving neutral its\\r importance is not recognised.  And this is curious, considering the\\r general colour of the dress of a century in which, as Baudelaire\\r says, \'Nous celebrons tous quelque enterrement.\'  The archaeologist\\r of the future will probably point to this age as the time when the\\r beauty of black was understood; but I hardly think that, as regards\\r stage-mounting or house decoration, it really is.  Its decorative\\r value is, of course, the same as that of white or gold; it can\\r separate and harmonise colours.  In modern plays the black frock-\\r coat of the hero becomes important in itself, and should be given a\\r suitable background.  But it rarely is.  Indeed the only good\\r background for a play in modern dress which I have ever seen was\\r the dark grey and cream-white scene of the first act of the\\r PRINCESSE GEORGES in Mrs. Langtry\'s production.  As a rule, the\\r hero is smothered in BRIC-E-BRAC and palm-trees, lost in the gilded\\r abyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge in\\r the midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always be\\r kept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.  This, of\\r course, can only be done when there is one single mind directing\\r the whole production.  The facts of art are diverse, but the\\r essence of artistic effect is unity.  Monarchy, Anarchy, and\\r Republicanism may contend for the government of nations; but a\\r theatre should be in the power of a cultured despot.  There may be\\r division of labour, but there must be no division of mind.  Whoever\\r understands the costume of an age understands of necessity its\\r architecture and its surroundings also, and it is easy to see from\\r the chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines or\\r not.  In fact, in art there is no specialism, and a really artistic\\r production should bear the impress of one master, and one master\\r only, who not merely should design and arrange everything, but\\r should have complete control over the way in which each dress is to\\r be worn.\\r \\r Mademoiselle Mars, in the first production of HERNANI, absolutely\\r refused to call her lover \'MON LION!\' unless she was allowed to\\r wear a little fashionable TOQUE then much in vogue on the\\r Boulevards; and many young ladies on our own stage insist to the\\r present day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under Greek\\r dresses, to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold; but\\r these wicked things should not be allowed.  And there should be far\\r more dress rehearsals than there are now.  Actors such as Mr.\\r Forbes-Robertson, Mr. Conway, Mr. George Alexander, and others, not\\r to mention older artists, can move with ease and elegance in the\\r attire of any century; but there are not a few who seem dreadfully\\r embarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets, and who\\r always wear their dresses as if they were costumes.  Costumes, of\\r course, they are to the designer; but dresses they should be to\\r those that wear them.  And it is time that a stop should be put to\\r the idea, very prevalent on the stage, that the Greeks and Romans\\r always went about bareheaded in the open air - a mistake the\\r Elizabethan managers did not fall into, for they gave hoods as well\\r as gowns to their Roman senators.\\r \\r More dress rehearsals would also be of value in explaining to the\\r actors that there is a form of gesture and movement that is not\\r merely appropriate to each style of dress, but really conditioned\\r by it.  The extravagant use of the arms in the eighteenth century,\\r for instance, was the necessary result of the large hoop, and the\\r solemn dignity of Burleigh owed as much to his ruff as to his\\r reason.  Besides until an actor is at home in his dress, he is not\\r at home in his part.\\r \\r Of the value of beautiful costume in creating an artistic\\r temperament in the audience, and producing that joy in beauty for\\r beauty\'s sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never\\r be understood, I will not here speak; though it is worth while to\\r notice how Shakespeare appreciated that side of the question in the\\r production of his tragedies, acting them always by artificial\\r light, and in a theatre hung with black; but what I have tried to\\r point out is that archaeology is not a pedantic method, but a\\r method of artistic illusion, and that costume is a means of\\r displaying character without description, and of producing dramatic\\r situations and dramatic effects.  And I think it is a pity that so\\r many critics should have set themselves to attack one of the most\\r important movements on the modern stage before that movement has at\\r all reached its proper perfection.  That it will do so, however, I\\r feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics\\r in the future higher qualification than that they can remember\\r Macready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them,\\r indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty.  POUR ETRE PLUS\\r DIFFICILE, LA TACHE N\'EN EST QUE PLUS GLORIEUSE.  And if they will\\r not encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of which\\r Shakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it has\\r the illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beauty\\r for its result.  Not that I agree with everything that I have said\\r in this essay.  There is much with which I entirely disagree.  The\\r essay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in aesthetic\\r criticism attitude is everything.  For in art there is no such\\r thing as a universal truth.  A Truth in art is that whose\\r contradictory is also true.  And just as it is only in art-\\r criticism, and through it, that we can apprehend the Platonic\\r theory of ideas, so it is only in art-criticism, and through it,\\r that we can realise Hegel\'s system of contraries.  The truths of\\r metaphysics are the truths of masks.\\r \\r \\r \\r \\r \\r End","source":"@site/google/THE TRUTH OF MASKS.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/THE TRUTH OF MASKS","permalink":"/google/THE TRUTH OF MASKS","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/google/THE TRUTH OF MASKS.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"THE TRAVELLING COMPANION","permalink":"/google/THE TRAVELLING COMPANION"},"next":{"title":"THE UGLY DUCKLING","permalink":"/google/THE UGLY DUCKLING"}},{"id":"THE UGLY DUCKLING","title":"THE UGLY DUCKLING","description":"1872","source":"@site/google/THE UGLY DUCKLING.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/THE UGLY DUCKLING","permalink":"/google/THE UGLY DUCKLING","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/google/THE UGLY DUCKLING.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"THE TRUTH OF MASKS","permalink":"/google/THE TRUTH OF MASKS"},"next":{"title":"THE UNDERGROUND WORKERS","permalink":"/google/THE UNDERGROUND WORKERS"}},{"id":"The Ultimate Standard of Value","title":"The Ultimate Standard of Value","description":"The Ultimate Standard of Value Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science volume 5, (1894-95), pp. 149-208 by Eugen Bohm-Bawerk translated by C.W.

ANDERSEN                               A LEAF FROM HEAVEN                           by Hans Christian Andersen    HIGH up in the clear, pure air flew an angel, with a flowerplucked from the garden of heaven. As he was kissing the flower a verylittle leaf fell from it and sunk down into the soft earth in themiddle of a wood. It immediately took root, sprouted, and sent outshoots among the other plants.    \\"What a ridiculous little shoot!\\" said one. \\"No one will recognizeit; not even the thistle nor the stinging-nettle.\\"    \\"It must be a kind of garden plant,\\" said another; and so theysneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden.    \\"Where are you coming?\\" said the tall thistles whose leaves wereall armed with thorns. \\"It is stupid nonsense to allow yourself toshoot out in this way; we are not here to support you.\\"    Winter came, and the plant was covered with snow, but the snowglittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as above.    When spring came, the plant appeared in full bloom: a morebeautiful object than any other plant in the forest. And now theprofessor of botany presented himself, one who could explain hisknowledge in black and white. He examined and tested the plant, but itdid not belong to his system of botany, nor could he possibly find outto what class it did belong. \\"It must be some degenerate species,\\"said he; \\"I do not know it, and it is not mentioned in any system.\\"    \\"Not known in any system!\\" repeated the thistles and the nettles.    The large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard theremarks, but they said not a word either good or bad, which is thewisest plan for those who are ignorant.    There passed through the forest a poor innocent girl; her heartwas pure, and her understanding increased by her faith. Her chiefinheritance had been an old Bible, which she read and valued. From itspages she heard the voice of God speaking to her, and telling her toremember what was said of Joseph\'s brethren when persons wished toinjure her. \\"They imagined evil in their hearts, but God turned itto good.\\" If we suffer wrongfully, if we are misunderstood ordespised, we must think of Him who was pure and holy, and who prayedfor those who nailed Him to the cross, \\"Father forgive them, forthey know not what they do.\\"    The girl stood still before the wonderful plant, for the greenleaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance, and the flowersglittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames, and theharmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each concealedwithin itself a deep fount of melody, which thousands of years couldnot exhaust. With pious gratitude the girl looked upon this gloriouswork of God, and bent down over one of the branches, that she mightexamine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume. Then a light broke inon her mind, and her heart expanded. Gladly would she have plucked aflower, but she could not overcome her reluctance to break one off.She knew it would so soon fade; so she took only a single greenleaf, carried it home, and laid it in her Bible, where it remainedever green, fresh, and unfading. Between the pages of the Bible itstill lay when, a few weeks afterwards, that Bible was laid underthe young girl\'s head in her coffin. A holy calm rested on her face,as if the earthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she nowstood in the presence of God.    In the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till itgrew and became almost a tree, and all the birds of passage bowedthemselves before it.    \\"That plant is a foreigner, no doubt,\\" said the thistles and theburdocks. \\"We can never conduct ourselves like that in thiscountry.\\" And the black forest snails actually spat at the flower.    Then came the swineherd; he was collecting thistles and shrubsto burn them for the ashes. He pulled up the wonderful plant, rootsand all, and placed it in his bundle. \\"This will be as useful as any,\\"he said; so the plant was carried away.    Not long after, the king of the country suffered from thedeepest melancholy. He was diligent and industrious, but employmentdid him no good. They read deep and learned books to him, and then thelightest and most trifling that could be found, but all to no purpose.Then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the world,and he sent them a message to say that there was one remedy whichwould relieve and cure him, and that it was a plant of heavenly originwhich grew in the forest in the king\'s own dominions. The messengerdescribed the flower so that is appearance could not be mistaken.    Then said the swineherd, \\"I am afraid I carried this plant awayfrom the forest in my bundle, and it has been burnt to ashes long ago.But I did not know any better.\\"    \\"You did not know, any better! Ignorance upon ignorance indeed!\\"    The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they wereaddressed to him; he knew not that there were others who wereequally ignorant. Not even a leaf of the plant could be found. Therewas one, but it lay in the coffin of the dead; no one knew anythingabout it.    Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot inthe wood. \\"Here is where the plant stood,\\" he said; \\"it is a sacredplace.\\" Then he ordered that the place should be surrounded with agolden railing, and a sentry stationed near it.    The botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenlyplant, and for this he was loaded with gold, which improved theposition of himself and his family.    And this part is really the most pleasant part of the story. Forthe plant had disappeared, and the king remained as melancholy and sadas ever, but the sentry said he had always been so.                            THE END.","source":"@site/learn/A LEAF FROM HEAVEN.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A LEAF FROM HEAVEN","permalink":"/learn/A LEAF FROM

CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                           A ROSE FROM HOMER\'S GRAVE                           by Hans Christian Andersen    ALL the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale forthe rose in the silent starlight night. The winged songsterserenades the fragrant flowers.    Not far from Smyrna, where the merchant drives his loadedcamels, proudly arching their long necks as they journey beneath thelofty pines over holy ground, I saw a hedge of roses. Theturtle-dove flew among the branches of the tall trees, and as thesunbeams fell upon her wings, they glistened as if they weremother-of-pearl. On the rose-bush grew a flower, more beautiful thanthem all, and to her the nightingale sung of his woes; but the roseremained silent, not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of sympathy on herleaves. At last she bowed her head over a heap of stones, and said,\\"Here rests the greatest singer in the world; over his tomb will Ispread my fragrance, and on it I will let my leaves fall when thestorm scatters them. He who sung of Troy became earth, and from thatearth I have sprung. I, a rose from the grave of Homer, am too loftyto bloom for a nightingale.\\" Then the nightingale sung himself todeath. A camel-driver came by, with his loaded camels and his blackslaves; his little son found the dead bird, and buried the lovelysongster in the grave of the great Homer, while the rose trembled inthe wind.    The evening came, and the rose wrapped her leaves more closelyround her, and dreamed: and this was her dream.    It was a fair sunshiny day; a crowd of strangers drew near who hadundertaken a pilgrimage to the grave of Homer. Among the strangers wasa minstrel from the north, the home of the clouds and the brilliantlights of the aurora borealis. He plucked the rose and placed it ina book, and carried it away into a distant part of the world, hisfatherland. The rose faded with grief, and lay between the leaves ofthe book, which he opened in his own home, saying, \\"Here is a rosefrom the grave of Homer.\\"    Then the flower awoke from her dream, and trembled in the wind.A drop of dew fell from the leaves upon the singer\'s grave. The sunrose, and the flower bloomed more beautiful than ever. The day washot, and she was still in her own warm Asia. Then footstepsapproached, strangers, such as the rose had seen in her dream, cameby, and among them was a poet from the north; he plucked the rose,pressed a kiss upon her fresh mouth, and carried her away to thehome of the clouds and the northern lights. Like a mummy, the flowernow rests in his \\"Iliad,\\" and, as in her dream, she hears him say,as he opens the book, \\"Here is a rose from the grave of Homer.\\"                            THE END.","source":"@site/learn/A ROSE FROM HOMER\'S GRAVE.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A ROSE FROM HOMER\'S GRAVE","permalink":"/learn/A ROSE FROM HOMER\'S GRAVE","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/A ROSE FROM HOMER\'S GRAVE.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"A Question of Latitude","permalink":"/learn/A Question of Latitude"},"next":{"title":"A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET","permalink":"/learn/A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET"}},{"id":"A Second Home","title":"A Second Home","description":"A Second Home","source":"@site/learn/A Second Home.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A Second Home","permalink":"/learn/A Second Home","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/A Second Home.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"A STORY","permalink":"/learn/A STORY"},"next":{"title":"A Short History of Wales","permalink":"/learn/A Short History of Wales"}},{"id":"A Short History of Wales","title":"A Short History of Wales","description":"A Short History of Wales","source":"@site/learn/A Short History of Wales.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A Short History of Wales","permalink":"/learn/A Short History of Wales","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/A Short History of Wales.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"A Second Home","permalink":"/learn/A Second Home"},"next":{"title":"A Simple Soul","permalink":"/learn/A Simple Soul"}},{"id":"A Simple Soul","title":"A Simple Soul","description":"A Simple Soul","source":"@site/learn/A Simple Soul.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A Simple Soul","permalink":"/learn/A Simple Soul","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/A Simple Soul.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"A Short History of Wales","permalink":"/learn/A Short History of Wales"},"next":{"title":"A Smaller History of Greece","permalink":"/learn/A Smaller History of Greece"}},{"id":"A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET","title":"A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET","description":"A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET","source":"@site/learn/A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET","permalink":"/learn/A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"A ROSE FROM HOMER\'S GRAVE","permalink":"/learn/A ROSE FROM HOMER\'S GRAVE"},"next":{"title":"A STORY FROM THE SAND-HILLS","permalink":"/learn/A STORY FROM THE SAND-HILLS"}},{"id":"A Smaller History of Greece","title":"A Smaller History of Greece","description":"A Smaller History of Greece","source":"@site/learn/A Smaller History of Greece.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A Smaller History of Greece","permalink":"/learn/A Smaller History of Greece","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/A Smaller History of Greece.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"A Simple Soul","permalink":"/learn/A Simple Soul"},"next":{"title":"A Start in Life","permalink":"/learn/A Start in Life"}},{"id":"A Start in Life","title":"A Start in Life","description":"A Start in Life","source":"@site/learn/A Start in Life.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A Start in Life","permalink":"/learn/A Start in Life","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/A Start in Life.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"A Smaller History of Greece","permalink":"/learn/A Smaller History of Greece"},"next":{"title":"A Straight Deal","permalink":"/learn/A Straight Deal"}},{"id":"A STORY","title":"A STORY","description":"1872                     FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                                    A STORY                           by Hans Christian Andersen    IN the garden all the apple-trees were in blossom. They hadhastened to bring forth flowers before they got green leaves, and inthe yard all the ducklings walked up and down, and the cat too \\"God\'s kindness to us men is beyond all limits.\\" But insidethe church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and spoke very loudly andangrily. He said that all men were wicked, and God would punish themfor their sins, and that the wicked, when they died, would be castinto hell, to burn for ever and ever. He spoke very excitedly,saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed, norwould the fire be extinguished, and they should never find rest.That was terrible to hear, and he said it in such a tone ofconviction; he described hell to them as a miserable hole where allthe refuse of the world gathers. There was no air beside the hotburning sulphur flame, and there was no ground under their feet; they,the wicked ones, sank deeper and deeper, while eternal silencesurrounded them! It was dreadful to hear all that, for the preacherspoke from his heart, and all the people in the church were terrified.Meanwhile, the birds sang merrily outside, and the sun was shiningso beautifully warm, it seemed as though every little flower said pride, avarice, drunkenness, wantonness- in short, thewhole seven-coloured bow of sin.    \\"Yes, therein, as I believed, as I knew it,\\" said the pastor, \\"areliving those who are abandoned to the eternal fire.\\" And they werestanding before the magnificently illuminated gate; the broad stepswere adorned with carpets and flowers, and dance music was soundingthrough the festive halls. A footman dressed in silk and velvetstood with a large silver-mounted rod near the entrance.    \\"Our ball can compare favourably with the king\'s,\\" he said, andturned with contempt towards the gazing crowd in the street. What hethought was sufficiently expressed in his features and movements theywere all fools there.    Then they flew within the four naked walls of the miser. Lean as askeleton, trembling with cold, and hunger, the old man was clingingwith all his thoughts to his money. They saw him jump up feverishlyfrom his miserable couch and take a loose stone out of the wall; therelay gold coins in an old stocking. They saw him anxiously feeling overan old ragged coat in which pieces of gold were sewn, and his clammyfingers trembled.    \\"He is ill! That is madness- a joyless madness- besieged by fearand dreadful dreams!\\"    They quickly went away and came before the beds of thecriminals; these unfortunate people slept side by side, in longrows. Like a ferocious animal, one of them rose out of his sleep anduttered a horrible cry, and gave his comrade a violent dig in the ribswith his pointed elbow, and this one turned round in his sleep:    \\"Be quiet, monster- sleep! This happens every night!\\"    \\"Every night!\\" repeated the other. \\"Yes, every night he comesand tortures me! In my violence I have done this and that. I wasborn with an evil mind, which has brought me hither for the secondtime; but if I have done wrong I suffer punishment for it. Onething, however, I have not yet confessed. When I came out a littlewhile ago, and passed by the yard of my former master, evil thoughtsrose within me when I remembered this and that. I struck a match alittle bit on the wall; probably it came a little too close to thethatched roof. All burnt down- a great heat rose, such as sometimesovercomes me. I myself helped to rescue cattle and things, nothingalive burnt, except a flight of pigeons, which flew into the fire, andthe yard dog, of which I had not thought; one could hear him howlout of the fire, and this howling I still hear when I wish to sleep;and when I have fallen asleep, the great rough dog comes and placeshimself upon me, and howls, presses, and tortures me. Now listen towhat I tell you! You can snore; you are snoring the whole night, and Ihardly a quarter of an hour!\\" And the blood rose to the head of theexcited criminal; he threw himself upon his comrade, and beat him withhis clenced fist in the face.    \\"Wicked Matz has become mad again!\\" they said amongstthemselves. The other criminals seized him, wrestled with him, andbent him double, so that his head rested between his knees, and theytied him, so that the blood almost came out of his eyes and out of allhis pores.    \\"You are killing the unfortunate man,\\" said the pastor, and ashe stretched out his hand to protect him who already suffered toomuch, the scene changed. They flew through rich halls and wretchedhovels; wantonness and envy, all the deadly sins, passed beforethem. An angel of justice read their crimes and their defence; thelatter was not a brilliant one, but it was read before God, Whoreads the heart, Who knows everything, the wickedness that comesfrom within and from without, Who is mercy and love personified. Thepastor\'s hand trembled; he dared not stretch it out, he did notventure to pull a hair out of the sinner\'s head. And tears gushed fromhis eyes like a stream of mercy and love, the cooling waters ofwhich extinguished the eternal fire of hell.    Just then the cock crowed.    \\"Father of all mercy, grant Thou to her the peace that I wasunable to procure for her!\\"    \\"I have it now!\\" said the dead woman. \\"It was your hard words,your despair of mankind, your gloomy belief in God and His creation,which drove me to you. Learn to know mankind! Even in the wicked onelives a part of God- and this extinguishes and conquers the flame ofhell!\\"    The pastor felt a kiss on his lips; a gleam of light surroundedhim- God\'s bright sun shone into the room, and his wife, alive,sweet and full of love, awoke him from a dream which God had sent him!

The wide sea is the highroad from nation to nation; journeyin thought; then, to sunny Spain. It is warm and beautiful there;the fiery pomegranate flowers peep from among dark laurels; a coolrefreshing breeze from the mountains blows over the orange gardens,over the Moorish halls with their golden cupolas and coloured walls.Children go through the streets in procession with candles andwaving banners, and the sky, lofty and clear with its glitteringstars, rises above them. Sounds of singing and castanets can be heard,and youths and maidens dance upon the flowering acacia trees, whileeven the beggar sits upon a block of marble, refreshing himself with ajuicy melon, and dreamily enjoying life. It all seems like a beautifuldream.    Here dwelt a newly married couple who completely gave themselvesup to the charm of life; indeed they possessed every good thing theycould desire- health and happiness, riches and honour.    We are as happy as human beings can be,\\" said the young couplefrom the depths of their hearts. They had indeed only one stephigher to mount on the ladder of happiness- they hoped that Godwould give them a child, a son like them in form and spirit. The happylittle one was to be welcomed with rejoicing, to be cared for withlove and tenderness, and enjoy every advantage of wealth and luxurythat a rich and influential family can give. So the days went bylike a joyous festival.    \\"Life is a gracious gift from God, almost too great a gift forus to appreciate!\\" said the young wife. \\"Yet they say that fulnessof joy for ever and ever can only be found in the future life. Icannot realise it!\\"    \\"The thought arises, perhaps, from the arrogance of men,\\" said thehusband. \\"It seems a great pride to believe that we shall live forever, that we shall be as gods! Were not these the words of theserpent, the father of lies?\\"    \\"Surely you do not doubt the existence of a future life?\\"exclaimed the young wife. It seemed as if one of the first shadowspassed over her sunny thoughts.    \\"Faith realises it, and the priests tell us so,\\" replied herhusband; \\"but amid all my happiness I feel that it is arrogant todemand a continuation of it- another life after this. Has not somuch been given us in this world that we ought to be, we must be,contented with it?\\"    \\"Yes, it has been given to us,\\" said the young wife, \\"but thislife is nothing more than one long scene of trial and hardship to manythousands. How many have been cast into this world only to endurepoverty, shame, illness, and misfortune? If there were no future life,everything here would be too unequally divided, and God would not bethe personification of justice.\\"    \\"The beggar there,\\" said her husband, \\"has joys of his own whichseem to him great, and cause him as much pleasure as a king would findin the magnificence of his palace. And then do you not think thatthe beast of burden, which suffers blows and hunger, and worksitself to death, suffers just as much from its miserable fate? Thedumb creature might demand a future life also, and declare the lawunjust that excludes it from the advantages of the higher creation.\\"    \\"Christ said                 \\"Farewell, he said, and sailed away.                  And many recollect that day.                  The ropes were of silk, the anchor of gold,                  And everywhere riches and wealth untold.\\"    These words would aptly describe the vessel from Spain, for herewas the same luxury, and the same parting thought naturally arose    \\"There\'s a large ship stranded on the farthest reef.\\"    In a moment the fisher people sprung from their beds and hastilydressed themselves. The moon had risen, and it was light enough tomake the surrounding objects visible to those who could open theireyes in the blinding clouds of sand; the violence of the wind wasterrible, and it was only possible to pass among the sand-hills if onecrept forward between the gusts; the salt spray flew up from the sealike down, and the ocean foamed like a roaring cataract towards thebeach. Only a practised eye could discern the vessel out in theoffing; she was a fine brig, and the waves now lifted her over thereef, three or four cables\' length out of the usual channel. She drovetowards the shore, struck on the second reef, and remained fixed.    It was impossible to render assistance; the sea rushed in upon thevessel, making a clean breach over her. Those on shore thought theyheard cries for help from those on board, and could plainlydistinguish the busy but useless efforts made by the stranded sailors.Now a wave came rolling onward. It fell with enormous force on thebowsprit, tearing it from the vessel, and the stern was lifted highabove the water. Two people were seen to embrace and plunge togetherinto the sea, and the next moment one of the largest waves that rolledtowards the sand-hills threw a body on the beach. It was a woman;the sailors said that she was quite dead, but the women thought theysaw signs of life in her, so the stranger was carried across thesand-hills to the fisherman\'s cottage. How beautiful and fair she was!She must be a great lady, they said.    They laid her upon the humble bed; there was not a yard of linenon it, only a woollen coverlet to keep the occupant warm.    Life returned to her, but she was delirious, and knew nothing ofwhat had happened or where she was; and it was better so, foreverything she loved and valued lay buried in the sea. The samething happened to her ship as to the one spoken of in the song about\\"The King of England\'s Son.\\"                  \\"Alas! how terrible to see                   The gallant bark sink rapidly.\\"    Fragments of the wreck and pieces of wood were washed ashore; theywere all that remained of the vessel. The wind still blew violently onthe coast.    For a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest; but she awokein pain, and uttered cries of anguish and fear. She opened herwonderfully beautiful eyes, and spoke a few words, but nobodyunderstood her.- And lo! as a reward for the sorrow and sufferingshe had undergone, she held in her arms a new-born babe. The childthat was to have rested upon a magnificent couch, draped with silkencurtains, in a luxurious home; it was to have been welcomed with joyto a life rich in all the good things of this world; and now Heavenhad ordained that it should be born in this humble retreat, that itshould not even receive a kiss from its mother, for when thefisherman\'s wife laid the child upon the mother\'s bosom, it restedon a heart that beat no more- she was dead.    The child that was to have been reared amid wealth and luxurywas cast into the world, washed by the sea among the sand-hills toshare the fate and hardships of the poor.    Here we are reminded again of the song about \\"The King ofEngland\'s Son,\\" for in it mention is made of the custom prevalent atthe time, when knights and squires plundered those who had beensaved from shipwreck. The ship had stranded some distance south ofNissum Bay, and the cruel, inhuman days, when, as we have just said,the inhabitants of Jutland treated the shipwrecked people so crudelywere past, long ago. Affectionate sympathy and self-sacrifice forthe unfortunate existed then, just as it does in our own time inmany a bright example. The dying mother and the unfortunate childwould have found kindness and help wherever they had been cast bythe winds, but nowhere would it have been more sincere than in thecottage of the poor fisherman\'s wife, who had stood, only the daybefore, beside her child\'s grave, who would have been five years oldthat day if God had spared it to her.    No one knew who the dead stranger was, they could not even forma conjecture; the fragments of wreckage gave no clue to the matter.    No tidings reached Spain of the fate of the daughter andson-in-law. They did not arrive at their destination, and violentstorms had raged during the past weeks. At last the verdict was given    \\"The eels went into the bay, and the young ones begged leave to goa little farther out. \'Don\'t go too far,\' said their mother; \'the uglyeel-spearer might come and snap you all up.\' But they went too far,and of eight daughters only three came back to the mother, and thesewept and said, \'We only went a little way out, and the uglyeel-spearer came immediately and stabbed five of our sisters todeath.\' \'They\'ll come back again,\' said the mother eel. \'Oh, no,\'exclaimed the daughters, \'for he skinned them, cut them in two, andfried them.\' \'Oh, they\'ll come back again,\' the mother eelpersisted. \'No,\' replied the daughters, \'for he ate them up.\' \'They\'llcome back again,\' repeated the mother eel. \'But he drank brandyafter them,\' said the daughters. \'Ah, then they\'ll never come back,\'said the mother, and she burst out crying, \'it\'s the brandy thatburies the eels.\'\\"    \\"And therefore,\\" said the eel-breeder in conclusion, \\"it is alwaysthe proper thing to drink brandy after eating eels.\\"    This story was the tinsel thread, the most humorous recollectionof Jurgen\'s life. He also wanted to go a little way farther out and upthe bay- that is to say, out into the world in a ship- but hismother said, like the eel-breeder, \\"There are so many bad people-eel spearers!\\" He wished to go a little way past the sand-hills, outinto the dunes, and at last he did    A dead body had been found on the coast, and the peasants buriedit in the churchyard. From that time the sand began to fly about andthe sea broke in with violence. A wise man in the district advisedthem to open the grave and see if the buried man was not lying suckinghis thumb, for if so he must be a sailor, and the sea would not restuntil it had got him back. The grave was opened, and he really wasfound with his thumb in his mouth. So they laid him upon a cart, andharnessed two oxen to it; and the oxen ran off with the sailor overheath and moor to the ocean, as if they had been stung by an adder.Then the sand ceased to fly inland, but the hills that had beenpiled up still remained.    All this Jurgen listened to and treasured up in his memory ofthe happiest days of his childhood- the days of the burial feast.    How delightful it was to see fresh places and to mix withstrangers! And he was to go still farther, for he was not yet fourteenyears old when he went out in a ship to see the world. Heencountered bad weather, heavy seas, unkindness, and hard men- suchwere his experiences, for he became ship-boy. Cold nights, bad living,and blows had to be endured; then he felt his noble Spanish blood boilwithin him, and bitter, angry, words rose to his lips, but he gulpedthem down; it was better, although he felt as the eel must feel whenit is skinned, cut up, and put into the frying-pan.    \\"I shall get over it,\\" said a voice within him.    He saw the Spanish coast, the native land of his parents. Heeven saw the town where they had lived in joy and prosperity, but heknew nothing of his home or his relations, and his relations knew justas little about him.    The poor ship boy was not permitted to land, but on the last dayof their stay he managed to get ashore. There were several purchasesto be made, and he was sent to carry them on board.    Jurgen stood there in his shabby clothes which looked as if theyhad been washed in the ditch and dried in the chimney; he, who hadalways dwelt among the sand-hills, now saw a great city for thefirst time. How lofty the houses seemed, and what a number of peoplethere were in the streets! some pushing this way, some that- a perfectmaelstrom of citizens and peasants, monks and soldiers- the jinglingof bells on the trappings of asses and mules, the chiming of churchbells, calling, shouting, hammering and knocking- all going on atonce. Every trade was located in the basement of the houses or inthe side thoroughfares; and the sun shone with such heat, and theair was so close, that one seemed to be in an oven full of beetles,cockchafers, bees and flies, all humming and buzzing together.Jurgen scarcely knew where he was or which way he went. Then he sawjust in front of him the great doorway of a cathedral; the lights weregleaming in the dark aisles, and the fragrance of incense was waftedtowards him. Even the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into thesanctuary. Jurgen followed the sailor he was with into the church, andstood in the sacred edifice. Coloured pictures gleamed from theirgolden background, and on the altar stood the figure of the Virginwith the child Jesus, surrounded by lights and flowers; priests infestive robes were chanting, and choir boys in dazzling attire swungsilver censers. What splendour and magnificence he saw there! Itstreamed in upon his soul and overpowered him    \\"Hit me in the face! I deserve it. But sometimes I feel as if Ihad a pot in me that boils over.\\"    \\"There, let the thing rest,\\" replied Martin.    And after that they were almost better friends than ever; whenafterwards they returned to the dunes and began telling theiradventures, this was told among the rest. Martin said that Jurgenwas certainly passionate, but a good fellow after all.    They were both young and healthy, well-grown and strong; butJurgen was the cleverer of the two.    In Norway the peasants go into the mountains and take the cattlethere to find pasture. On the west coast of Jutland huts have beenerected among the sand-hills; they are built of pieces of wreck, andthatched with turf and heather; there are sleeping places round thewalls, and here the fishermen live and sleep during the earlyspring. Every fisherman has a female helper, or manager as she iscalled, who baits his hooks, prepares warm beer for him when hecomes ashore, and gets the dinner cooked and ready for him by the timehe comes back to the hut tired and hungry. Besides this the managersbring up the fish from the boats, cut them open, prepare them, andhave generally a great deal to do.    Jurgen, his father, and several other fishermen and their managersinhabited the same hut; Martin lived in the next one.    One of the girls, whose name was Else, had known Jurgen fromchildhood; they were glad to see each other, and were of the sameopinion on many points, but in appearance they were entirely opposite;for he was dark, and she was pale, and fair, and had flaxen hair,and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine.    As they were walking together one day, Jurgen held her hand veryfirmly in his, and she said to him he had never thought of Else inthis way before, but now it all became plain to him.    When the sea is rather rough, and the fishermen are coming home intheir great boats, it is wonderful to see how they cross the reefs.One of them stands upright in the bow of the boat, and the otherswatch him sitting with the oars in their hands. Outside the reef itlooks as if the boat was not approaching land but going back to sea;then the man who is standing up gives them the signal that the greatwave is coming which is to float them across the reef. The boat islifted high into the air, so that the keel is seen from the shore; thenext moment nothing can be seen, mast, keel, and people are allhidden- it seems as though the sea had devoured them; but in a fewmoments they emerge like a great sea animal climbing up the waves, andthe oars move as if the creature had legs. The second and third reefare passed in the same manner; then the fishermen jump into thewater and push the boat towards the shore- every wave helps them-and at length they have it drawn up, beyond the reach of the breakers.    A wrong order given in front of the reef- the slightesthesitation- and the boat would be lost,    \\"Then it would be all over with me and Martin too!\\"    This thought passed through Jurgen\'s mind one day while theywere out at sea, where his foster-father had been taken suddenlyill. The fever had seized him. They were only a few oars\' strokes fromthe reef, and Jurgen sprang from his seat and stood up in the bow.    \\"Father-let me come!\\" he said, and he glanced at Martin and acrossthe waves; every oar bent with the exertions of the rowers as thegreat wave came towards them, and he saw his father\'s pale face, anddared not obey the evil impulse that had shot through his brain. Theboat came safely across the reef to land; but the evil thoughtremained in his heart, and roused up every little fibre ofbitterness which he remembered between himself and Martin since theyhad known each other. But he could not weave the fibres together,nor did he endeavour to do so. He felt that Martin had robbed him, andthis was enough to make him hate his former friend. Several of thefishermen saw this, but Martin did not- he remained as obliging andtalkative as ever, in fact he talked rather too much.    Jurgen\'s foster-father took to his bed, and it became hisdeath-bed, for he died a week afterwards; and now Jurgen was heir tothe little house behind the sand-hills. It was small, certainly, butstill it was something, and Martin had nothing of the kind.    \\"You will not go to sea again, Jurgen, I suppose,\\" observed one ofthe old fishermen. \\"You will always stay with us now.\\"    But this was not Jurgen\'s intention; he wanted to see something ofthe world. The eel-breeder of Fjaltring had an uncle at Old Skjagen,who was a fisherman, but also a prosperous merchant with ships uponthe sea; he was said to be a good old man, and it would not be a badthing to enter his service. Old Skjagen lies in the extreme north ofJutland, as far away from the Hunsby dunes as one can travel in thatcountry; and this is just what pleased Jurgen, for he did not wantto remain till the wedding of Martin and Else, which would takeplace in a week or two.    The old fisherman said it was foolish to go away, for now thatJurgen had a home Else would very likely be inclined to take himinstead of Martin.    Jurgen gave such a vague answer that it was not easy to make outwhat he meant- the old man brought Else to him, and she said    \\"If Martin had a house like mine, which of us would you ratherhave?\\"    \\"But Martin has no house and cannot get one.\\"    \\"Suppose he had one?\\"    \\"Well, then I would certainly take Martin, for that is what myheart tells me; but one cannot live upon love.\\"    Jurgen turned these things over in his mind all night. Somethingwas working within him, he hardly knew what it was, but it was evenstronger than his love for Else; and so he went to Martin\'s, andwhat he said and did there was well considered. He let the house toMartin on most liberal terms, saying that he wished to go to seaagain, because he loved it. And Else kissed him when she heard ofit, for she loved Martin best.    Jurgen proposed to start early in the morning, and on theevening before his departure, when it was already getting rather late,he felt a wish to visit Martin once more. He started, and among thedunes met the old fisherman, who was angry at his leaving the place.The old man made jokes about Martin, and declared there must be somemagic about that fellow, of whom the girls were so fond.    Jurgen did not pay any attention to his remarks, but said good-byeto the old man and went on towards the house where Martin dwelt. Heheard loud talking inside; Martin was not alone, and this madeJurgen waver in his determination, for he did not wish to see Elseagain. On second thoughts, he decided that it was better not to hearany more thanks from Martin, and so he turned back.    On the following morning, before the sun rose, he fastened hisknapsack on his back, took his wooden provision box in his hand, andwent away among the sand-hills towards the coast path. This way wasmore pleasant than the heavy sand road, and besides it was shorter;and he intended to go first to Fjaltring, near Bovbjerg, where theeel-breeder lived, to whom he had promised a visit.    The sea lay before him, clear and blue, and the mussel shellsand pebbles, the playthings of his childhood, crunched over hisfeet. While he thus walked on his nose suddenly began to bleed; it wasa trifling occurrence, but trifles sometimes are of greatimportance. A few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves.He wiped them off and stopped the bleeding, and it seemed to him as ifthis had cleared and lightened his brain. The sea-cale bloomed hereand there in the sand as he passed. He broke off a spray and stuckit in his hat; he determined to be merry and light-hearted, for he wasgoing out into the wide world- \\"a little way out, beyond the bay,\\"as the young eels had said. \\"Beware of bad people who will catchyou, and skin you, and put you in the frying-pan!\\" he repeated inhis mind, and smiled, for he thought he should find his way throughthe world- good courage is a strong weapon!    The sun was high in the heavens when he approached the narrowentrance to Nissum Bay. He looked back and saw a couple of horsemengalloping a long distance behind him, and there were other people withthem. But this did not concern him.    The ferry-boat was on the opposite side of the bay. Jurgencalled to the ferry-man, and the latter came over with his boat.Jurgen stepped in; but before he had got half-way across, the men whomhe had seen riding so hastily, came up, hailed the ferry-man, andcommanded him to return in the name of the law. Jurgen did notunderstand the reason of this, but he thought it would be best to turnback, and therefore he himself took an oar and returned. As soon asthe boat touched the shore, the men sprang on board, and before he wasaware of it, they had bound his hands with a rope.    \\"This wicked deed will cost you your life,\\" they said. \\"It is agood thing we have caught you.\\"    He was accused of nothing less than murder. Martin had beenfound dead, with his throat cut. One of the fishermen, late on theprevious evening, had met Jurgen going towards Martin\'s house; thiswas not the first time Jurgen had raised his knife against Martin,so they felt sure that he was the murderer. The prison was in a townat a great distance, and the wind was contrary for going there by sea;but it would not take half an hour to get across the bay, andanother quarter of an hour would bring them to Norre-Vosborg, thegreat castle with ramparts and moat. One of Jurgen\'s captors was afisherman, a brother of the keeper of the castle, and he said it mightbe managed that Jurgen should be placed for the present in the dungeonat Vosborg, where Long Martha the gipsy had been shut up till herexecution. They paid no attention to Jurgen\'s defence; the few dropsof blood on his shirt-sleeve bore heavy witness against him. But hewas conscious of his innocence, and as there was no chance of clearinghimself at present he submitted to his fate.    The party landed just at the place where Sir Bugge\'s castle hadstood, and where Jurgen had walked with his foster-parents after theburial feast, during. the four happiest days of his childhood. Hewas led by the well-known path, over the meadow to Vosborg; oncemore the elders were in bloom and the lofty lime-trees gave forthsweet fragrance, and it seemed as if it were but yesterday that he hadlast seen the spot. In each of the two wings of the castle there was astaircase which led to a place below the entrance, from whence thereis access to a low, vaulted cellar. In this dungeon Long Martha hadbeen imprisoned, and from here she was led away to the scaffold. Shehad eaten the hearts of five children, and had imagined that if shecould obtain two more she would be able to fly and make herselfinvisible. In the middle of the roof of the cellar there was alittle narrow air-hole, but no window. The flowering lime treescould not breathe refreshing fragrance into that abode, whereeverything was dark and mouldy. There was only a rough bench in thecell; but a good conscience is a soft pillow, and therefore Jurgencould sleep well.    The thick oaken door was locked, and secured on the outside byan iron bar; but the goblin of superstition can creep through akeyhole into a baron\'s castle just as easily as it can into afisherman\'s cottage, and why should he not creep in here, where Jurgensat thinking of Long Martha and her wicked deeds? Her last thoughts onthe night before her execution had filled this place, and the magicthat tradition asserted to have been practised here, in SirSvanwedel\'s time, came into Jurgen\'s mind, and made him shudder; but asunbeam, a refreshing thought from without, penetrated his hearteven here- it was the remembrance of the flowering elder and the sweetsmelling lime-trees.    He was not left there long. They took him away to the town ofRingkjobing, where he was imprisoned with equal severity.    Those times were not like ours. The common people were treatedharshly; and it was just after the days when farms were converted intoknights\' estates, when coachmen and servants were often mademagistrates, and had power to sentence a poor man, for a smalloffence, to lose his property and to corporeal punishment. Judges ofthis kind were still to be found; and in Jutland, so far from thecapital, and from the enlightened, well-meaning, head of theGovernment, the law was still very loosely administered sometimes- thesmallest grievance Jurgen could expect was that his case should bedelayed.    His dwelling was cold and comfortless; and how long would he beobliged to bear all this? It seemed his fate to suffer misfortuneand sorrow innocently. He now had plenty of time to reflect on thedifference of fortune on earth, and to wonder why this fate had beenallotted to him; yet he felt sure that all would be made clear inthe next life, the existence that awaits us when this life is over.His faith had grown strong in the poor fisherman\'s cottage; thelight which had never shone into his father\'s mind, in all therichness and sunshine of Spain, was sent to him to be his comfort inpoverty and distress, a sign of that mercy of God which never fails.    The spring storms began to blow. The rolling and moaning of theNorth Sea could be heard for miles inland when the wind was blowing,and then it sounded like the rushing of a thousand waggons over a hardroad with a mine underneath. Jurgen heard these sounds in hisprison, and it was a relief to him. No music could have touched hisheart as did these sounds of the sea- the rolling sea, the boundlesssea, on which a man can be borne across the world before the wind,carrying his own house with him wherever he goes, just as the snailcarries its home even into a strange country.    He listened eagerly to its deep murmur and then the thought arose-\\"Free! free! How happy to be free, even barefooted and in raggedclothes!\\" Sometimes, when such thoughts crossed his mind, the fierynature rose within him, and he beat the wall with his clenched fists.    Weeks, months, a whole year had gone by, when Niels the thief,called also a horse-dealer, was arrested; and now better times came,and it was seen that Jurgen had been wrongly accused.    On the afternoon before Jurgen\'s departure from home, and beforethe murder, Niels the thief, had met Martin at a beer-house in theneighbourhood of Ringkjobing. A few glasses were drank, not enoughto cloud the brain, but enough to loosen Martin\'s tongue. He beganto boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended tomarry, and when Niels asked him where he was going to get the money,he slapped his pocket proudly and said we will evenburn the almanack. In two days we will start for dear, friendly,peaceful Skjagen. People call it an out-of-the-way corner; but it is agood warm chimney-corner, and its windows open toward every part ofthe world.\\"    What a journey that was plenty to eat and drink, clean, prettily decorated rooms,active minds, cheerful tempers, and hospitality can be found there, asin an Arab\'s tent.    Jurgen had never spent such a happy time since the famous burialfeast, and yet Miss Clara was absent, except in the thoughts andmemory of all.    In April a ship was to start for Norway, and Jurgen was to sail init. He was full of life and spirits, and looked so sturdy and wellthat Dame Bronne said it did her good to see him.    \\"And it does one good to look at you also, old wife,\\" said themerchant. \\"Jurgen has brought fresh life into our winter evenings, andinto you too, mother. You look younger than ever this year, and seemwell and cheerful. But then you were once the prettiest girl inViborg, and that is saying a great deal, for I have always found theViborg girls the prettiest of any.\\"    Jurgen said nothing, but he thought of a certain maiden ofSkjagen, whom he was soon to visit. The ship set sail forChristiansand in Norway, and as the wind was favourable it soonarrived there.    One morning merchant Bronne went out to the lighthouse, whichstands a little way out of Old Skjagen, not far from \\"Grenen.\\" Thelight was out, and the sun was already high in the heavens, when hemounted the tower. The sand-banks extend a whole mile from theshore, beneath the water, outside these banks; many ships could beseen that day, and with the aid of his telescope the old man thoughthe descried his own ship, the Karen Bronne. Yes! certainly, thereshe was, sailing homewards with Clara and Jurgen on board.    Clara sat on deck, and saw the sand-hills gradually appearing inthe distance; the church and lighthouse looked like a heron and a swanrising from the blue waters. If the wind held good they might reachhome in about an hour. So near they were to home and all its joys-so near to death and all its terrors! A plank in the ship gave way,and the water rushed in; the crew flew to the pumps, and did theirbest to stop the leak. A signal of distress was hoisted, but they werestill fully a mile from the shore. Some fishing boats were in sight,but they were too far off to be of any use. The wind blew towardsthe land, the tide was in their favour, but it was all useless; theship could not be saved.    Jurgen threw his right arm round Clara, and pressed her to him.With what a look she gazed up into his face, as with a prayer to Godfor help he breasted the waves, which rushed over the sinking ship!She uttered a cry, but she felt safe and certain that he would notleave her to sink. And in this hour of terror and danger Jurgen feltas the king\'s son did, as told in the old song all at once his mindseemed to become clearer, and a restless feeling came over him, suchas had often, in his younger days, driven him out to wander over thesand-hills or on the heath. \\"Home, home!\\" he cried. No one heardhim. He went out and walked towards the dunes. Sand and stones blewinto his face, and whirled round him; he went in the direction ofthe church. The sand was banked up the walls, half covering thewindows, but it had been cleared away in front of the door, and theentrance was free and easy to open, so Jurgen went into the church.    The storm raged over the town of Skjagen; there had not beensuch a terrible tempest within the memory of the inhabitants, nor sucha rough sea. But Jurgen was in the temple of God, and while thedarkness of night reigned outside, a light arose in his soul thatwas never to depart from it; the heavy weight that pressed on hisbrain burst asunder. He fancied he heard the organ, but it was onlythe storm and the moaning of the sea. He sat down on one of the seats,and lo! the candies were lighted one by one, and there wasbrightness and grandeur such as he had only seen in the Spanishcathedral. The portraits of the old citizens became alive, steppeddown from the walls against which they had hung for centuries, andtook seats near the church door. The gates flew open, and all the deadpeople from the churchyard came in, and filled the church, whilebeautiful music sounded. Then the melody of the psalm burst forth,like the sound of the waters, and Jurgen saw that his foster parentsfrom the Hunsby dunes were there, also old merchant Bronne with hiswife and their daughter Clara, who gave him her hand. They both wentup to the altar where they had knelt before, and the priest joinedtheir hands and united them for life. Then music was heard again; itwas wonderfully sweet, like a child\'s voice, full of joy andexpectation, swelling to the powerful tones of a full organ, sometimessoft and sweet, then like the sounds of a tempest, delightful andelevating to hear, yet strong enough to burst the stone tombs of thedead. Then the little ship that hung from the roof of the choir waslet down and looked wonderfully large and beautiful with its silkensails and rigging:             \\"The ropes were of silk, the anchor of gold,              And everywhere riches and pomp untold,\\"as the old song says.    The young couple went on board, accompanied by the wholecongregation, for there was room and enjoyment for them all. Thenthe walls and arches of the church were covered with floweringjunipers and lime trees breathing forth fragrance; the branches waved,creating a pleasant coolness; they bent and parted, and the shipsailed between them through the air and over the sea. Every candlein the church became a star, and the wind sang a hymn in which theyall joined. \\"Through love to glory, no life is lost, the future isfull of blessings and happiness. Hallelujah!\\" These were the lastwords Jurgen uttered in this world, for the thread that bound hisimmortal soul was severed, and nothing but the dead body lay in thedark church, while the storm raged outside, covering it with loosesand.    The next day was Sunday, and the congregation and their pastorwent to the church. The road had always been heavy, but now it wasalmost unfit for use, and when they at last arrived at the church, agreat heap of sand lay piled up in front of them. The whole church wascompletely buried in sand. The clergyman offered a short prayer, andsaid that God had closed the door of His house here, and that thecongregation must go and build a new one for Him somewhere else. Sothey sung a hymn in the open air, and went home again.    Jurgen could not be found anywhere in the town of Skjagen, noron the dunes, though they searched for him everywhere. They came tothe conclusion that one of the great waves, which had rolled far upon the beach, had carried him away; but his body lay buried in agreat sepulchre- the church itself. The Lord had thrown down acovering for his grave during the storm, and the heavy mound of sandlies upon it to this day. The drifting sand had covered the vaultedroof of the church, the arched cloisters, and the stone aisles. Thewhite thorn and the dog rose now blossom above the place where thechurch lies buried, but the spire, like an enormous monument over agrave, can be seen for miles round. No king has a more splendidmemorial. Nothing disturbs the peaceful sleep of the dead. I was thefirst to hear this story, for the storm sung it to me among thesand-hills.                            THE END.","source":"@site/learn/A STORY FROM THE SAND-HILLS.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/A STORY FROM THE SAND-HILLS","permalink":"/learn/A STORY FROM THE

ANNE LISBETH                           by Hans Christian Andersen    ANNE LISBETH was a beautiful young woman, with a red and whitecomplexion, glittering white teeth, and clear soft eyes; and herfootstep was light in the dance, but her mind was lighter still. Shehad a little child, not at all pretty; so he was put out to benursed by a laborer\'s wife, and his mother went to the count\'s castle.She sat in splendid rooms, richly decorated with silk and velvet;not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her, and no one wasallowed to speak to her harshly, for she was nurse to the count\'schild. He was fair and delicate as a prince, and beautiful as anangel; and how she loved this child! Her own boy was provided for bybeing at the laborer\'s where the mouth watered more frequently thanthe pot boiled, and where in general no one was at home to take careof the child. Then he would cry, but what nobody knows nobody caresfor; so he would cry till he was tired, and then fall asleep; andwhile we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst. Ah, yes;sleep is a capital invention.    As years went on, Anne Lisbeth\'s child grew apace like weeds,although they said his growth had been stunted. He had become quitea member of the family in which he dwelt; they received money tokeep him, so that his mother got rid of him altogether. She had becomequite a lady; she had a comfortable home of her own in the town; andout of doors, when she went for a walk, she wore a bonnet; but shenever walked out to see the laborer howshe longed to see him!    Now that Anne Lisbeth was at her journey\'s end, she was keptwaiting a long time; and for those who wait, time passes slowly. Butbefore the great people went in to dinner, she was called in andspoken to very graciously. She was to go in again after dinner, andthen she would see her sweet boy once more. How tall, and slender, andthin he had grown; but the eyes and the sweet angel mouth were stillbeautiful. He looked at her, but he did not speak, he certainly didnot know who she was. He turned round and was going away, but sheseized his hand and pressed it to her lips.    \\"Well, well,\\" he said; and with that he walked out of the room. Hewho filled her every thought! he whom she loved best, and who washer whole earthly pride!    Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road,feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and night, andeven now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and strange, andhad not a word or thought respecting her. A great black raven darteddown in front of her on the high road, and croaked dismally.    \\"Ah,\\" said she, \\"what bird of ill omen art thou?\\" Presently shepassed the laborer\'s hut; his wife stood at the door, and the twowomen spoke to each other.    \\"You look well,\\" said the woman; \\"you\'re fat and plump; you arewell off.\\"    \\"Oh yes,\\" answered Anne Lisbeth.    \\"The boat went down with them,\\" continued the woman; \\"Hans theskipper and the boy were both drowned; so there\'s an end of them. Ialways thought the boy would be able to help me with a few dollars.He\'ll never cost you anything more, Anne Lisbeth.\\"    \\"So they were drowned,\\" repeated Anne Lisbeth; but she said nomore, and the subject was dropped. She felt very low-spirited, becauseher count-child had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved himso well, and who had travelled so far to see him. The journey had costmoney too, and she had derived no great pleasure from it. Still shesaid not a word of all this; she could not relieve her heart bytelling the laborer\'s wife, lest the latter should think she did notenjoy her former position at the castle. Then the raven flew over her,screaming again as he flew.    \\"The black wretch!\\" said Anne Lisbeth, \\"he will end by frighteningme today.\\" She had brought coffee and chicory with her, for shethought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give them to her toboil a cup of coffee, and then she would take a cup herself.    The woman prepared the coffee, and in the meantime Anne Lisbethseated her in a chair and fell asleep. Then she dreamed of somethingwhich she had never dreamed before; singularly enough she dreamed ofher own child, who had wept and hungered in the laborer\'s hut, and hadbeen knocked about in heat and in cold, and who was now lying in thedepths of the sea, in a spot only known by God. She fancied she wasstill sitting in the hut, where the woman was busy preparing thecoffee, for she could smell the coffee-berries roasting. Butsuddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the threshold abeautiful young form, as beautiful as the count\'s child, and thisapparition said to her, \\"The world is passing away; hold fast to me,for you are my mother after all; you have an angel in heaven, holdme fast;\\" and the child-angel stretched out his hand and seized her.Then there was a terrible crash, as of a world crumbling to pieces,and the angel-child was rising from the earth, and holding her bythe sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground;but, on the other hand, something heavy hung to her feet and draggedher down, and it seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging toher, and crying, \\"If thou art to be saved, we must be saved too.Hold fast, hold fast.\\" And then they all hung on her, but there weretoo many; and as they clung the sleeve was torn, and Anne Lisbeth felldown in horror, and awoke. Indeed she was on the point of falling overin reality with the chair on which she sat; but she was so startledand alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed, onlythat it was something very dreadful.    They drank their coffee and had a chat together, and then AnneLisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to meet thecarrier, who was to drive her back to her own home. But when shecame to him she found that he would not be ready to start till theevening of the next day. Then she began to think of the expense, andwhat the distance would be to walk. She remembered that the route bythe sea-shore was two miles shorter than by the high road; and asthe weather was clear, and there would be moonlight, she determined tomake her way on foot, and to start at once, that she might reachhome the next day.    The sun had set, and the evening bells sounded through the airfrom the tower of the village church, but to her it was not the bells,but the cry of the frogs in the marshes. Then they ceased, and allaround became still; not a bird could be heard, they were all at rest,even the owl had not left her hiding place; deep silence reigned onthe margin of the wood by the sea-shore. As Anne Lisbeth walked on shecould hear her own footsteps in the sands; even the waves of the seawere at rest, and all in the deep waters had sunk into silence.There was quiet among the dead and the living in the deep sea. AnneLisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing at all, as people say, orrather her thoughts wandered, but not away from her, for thought isnever absent from us, it only slumbers. Many thoughts that have laindormant are roused at the proper time, and begin to stir in the mindand the heart, and seem even to come upon us from above. It iswritten, that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit; and it isalso written, that the wages of sin is death. Much has been said andmuch written which we pass over or know nothing of. A light ariseswithin us, and then forgotten things make themselves remembered; andthus it was with Anne Lisbeth. The germ of every vice and every virtuelies in our heart, in yours and in mine; they lie like little grainsof seed, till a ray of sunshine, or the touch of an evil hand, oryou turn the corner to the right or to the left, and the decision ismade. The little seed is stirred, it swells and shoots up, and poursits sap into your blood, directing your course either for good orevil. Troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind, fermentingthere, which are not realized by us while the senses are as it wereslumbering; but still they are there. Anne Lisbeth walked on thus withher senses half asleep, but the thoughts were fermenting within her.    From one Shrove Tuesday to another, much may occur to weigh downthe heart; it is the reckoning of a whole year; much may be forgotten,sins against heaven in word and thought, sins against our neighbor,and against our own conscience. We are scarcely aware of theirexistence; and Anne Lisbeth did not think of any of her errors. Shehad committed no crime against the law of the land; she was anhonorable person, in a good position- that she knew.    She continued her walk along by the margin of the sea. What was itshe saw lying there? An old hat; a man\'s hat. Now when might that havebeen washed overboard? She drew nearer, she stopped to look at thehat; \\"Ha! what was lying yonder?\\" She shuddered; yet it was nothingsave a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone,but it looked like a corpse.

FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                       BEAUTY OF FORM AND BEAUTY OF MIND                           by Hans Christian Andersen    THERE was once a sculptor, named Alfred, who having won thelarge gold medal and obtained a travelling scholarship, went to Italy,and then came back to his native land. He was young at that time-indeed, he is young still, although he is ten years older than hewas then. On his return, he went to visit one of the little towns inthe island of Zealand. The whole town knew who the stranger was; andone of the richest men in the place gave a party in his honor, and allwho were of any consequence, or who possessed some property, wereinvited. It was quite an event, and all the town knew of it, so thatit was not necessary to announce it by beat of drum.Apprentice-boys, children of the poor, and even the poor peoplethemselves, stood before the house, watching the lighted windows;and the watchman might easily fancy he was giving a party also,there were so many people in the streets. There was quite an air offestivity about it, and the house was full of it; for Mr. Alfred,the sculptor, was there. He talked and told anecdotes, and every onelistened to him with pleasure, not unmingled with awe; but none feltso much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a naval officer.She seemed, so far as Mr. Alfred was concerned, to be like a pieceof fresh blotting-paper that absorbed all he said and asked formore. She was very appreciative, and incredibly ignorant- a kind offemale Gaspar Hauser.    \\"I should like to see Rome,\\" she said; \\"it must be a lovelycity, or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving there.Now, do give me a description of Rome. How does the city look when youenter in at the gate?\\"    \\"I cannot very well describe it,\\" said the sculptor; \\"but youenter on a large open space, in the centre of which stands an obelisk,which is a thousand years old.\\"    \\"An organist!\\" exclaimed the lady, who had never heard the word\'obelisk.\' Several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing,and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping hiscountenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sightof a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady.They belonged to her daughter; and surely no one who had such adaughter could be silly. The mother was like a fountain ofquestions; and the daughter, who listened but never spoke, mighthave passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain. How charming shewas! She was a study for the sculptor to contemplate, but not toconverse with; for she did not speak, or, at least, very seldom.    \\"Has the pope a great family?\\" inquired the lady.    The young man answered considerately, as if the question hadbeen a different one, \\"No; he does not come from a great family.\\"    \\"That is not what I asked,\\" persisted the widow; \\"I mean, has he awife and children?\\"    \\"The pope is not allowed to marry,\\" replied the gentleman.    \\"I don\'t like that,\\" was the lady\'s remark.    She certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if shehad not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughterhave been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and lookingstraight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on herface?    Mr. Alfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious colors inItalian scenery; the purple hills, the deep blue of the Mediterranean,the azure of southern skies, whose brightness and glory could onlybe surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of a maiden; and hesaid this with a peculiar intonation; but she who should haveunderstood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it, which alsowas charming.    \\"Beautiful Italy!\\" sighed some of the guests.    \\"Oh, to travel there!\\" exclaimed others.    \\"Charming! Charming!\\" echoed from every voice.    \\"I may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery,\\"said the naval officer\'s widow; \\"and if I do, we will travel- I and mydaughter; and you, Mr. Alfred, must be our guide. We can all threetravel together, with one or two more of our good friends.\\" And shenodded in such a friendly way at the company, that each imaginedhimself to be the favored person who was to accompany them to Italy.\\"Yes, we must go,\\" she continued; \\"but not to those parts wherethere are robbers. We will keep to Rome. In the public roads one isalways safe.\\"    The daughter sighed very gently; and how much there may be in asigh, or attributed to it! The young man attributed a great deal ofmeaning to this sigh. Those deep-blue eyes, which had been lit up thisevening in honor of him, must conceal treasures, treasures of heartand mind, richer than all the glories of Rome; and so when he left theparty that night, he had lost it completely to the young lady. Thehouse of the naval officer\'s widow was the one most constantly visitedby Mr. Alfred, the sculptor. It was soon understood that his visitswere not intended for that lady, though they were the persons who keptup the conversation. He came for the sake of the daughter. They calledher Kaela. Her name was really Karen Malena, and these two names hadbeen contracted into the one name Kaela. She was really beautiful; butsome said she was rather dull, and slept late of a morning.    \\"She has been accustomed to that,\\" her mother said. \\"She is abeauty, and they are always easily tired. She does sleep ratherlate; but that makes her eyes so clear.\\"    What power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes! Theyoung man felt the truth of the proverb, \\"Still waters run deep-    \\"It is difficult to follow you; but I go hobbling along afteryou with my thoughts, though what you say makes my head whirl roundand round. Still I contrive to lay hold on some of it.\\"    Kaela\'s beauty had a firm hold on Alfred; it filled his soul,and held a mastery over him. Beauty beamed from Kaela\'s every feature,glittered in her eyes, lurked in the corners of her mouth, andpervaded every movement of her agile fingers. Alfred, the sculptor,saw this. He spoke only to her, thought only of her, and the twobecame one; and so it may be said she spoke much, for he was alwaystalking to her; and he and she were one. Such was the betrothal, andthen came the wedding, with bride\'s-maids and wedding presents, allduly mentioned in the wedding speech. Mamma-in-law had set upThorwalsden\'s bust at the end of the table, attired in adressing-gown; it was her fancy that he should be a guest. Songswere sung, and cheers given; for it was a gay wedding, and they were ahandsome pair. \\"Pygmalion loved his Galatea,\\" said one of the songs.    \\"Ah, that is some of your mythologies,\\" said mamma-in-law.    Next day the youthful pair started for Copenhagen, where they wereto live; mamma-in-law accompanied them, to attend to the \\"coarsework,\\" as she always called the domestic arrangements. Kaela lookedlike a doll in a doll\'s house, for everything was bright and new,and so fine. There they sat, all three; and as for Alfred, a proverbmay describe his position- he looked like a swan amongst the geese.The magic of form had enchanted him; he had looked at the casketwithout caring to inquire what it contained, and that omission oftenbrings the greatest unhappiness into married life. The casket may beinjured, the gilding may fall off, and then the purchaser regretshis bargain.    In a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button givingway, with no studs at hand to fall back upon; but it is worse still ina large company to be conscious that your wife and mother-in-law aretalking nonsense, and that you cannot depend upon yourself toproduce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the wholeaffair.    The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he wouldtalk, but she could only now and then let fall a word in the samemelodious voice, the same bell-like tones. It was a mental relief whenSophy, one of her friends, came to pay them a visit. Sophy was not,pretty. She was, however, quite free from any physical deformity,although Kaela used to say she was a little crooked; but no eye,save an intimate acquaintance, would have noticed it. She was a verysensible girl, yet it never occurred to her that she might be adangerous person in such a house. Her appearance created a newatmosphere in the doll\'s house, and air was really required, theyall owned that. They felt the want of a change of air, andconsequently the young couple and their mother travelled to Italy.    \\"Thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls,\\"said mamma-in-law and daughter both, on their return after a year\'sabsence.    \\"There is no real pleasure in travelling,\\" said mamma; \\"to tellthe truth, it\'s very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so. I was soonvery tired of it, although I had my children with me; and, besides,it\'s very expensive work travelling, very expensive. And all thosegalleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of things you areobliged to run after! It must be done, for very shame; you are sure tobe asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will mostlikely be told that you\'ve omitted to see what was best worth seeingof all. I got tired at last of those endless Madonnas; I began tothink I was turning into a Madonna myself.\\"    \\"And then the living, mamma,\\" said Kaela.    \\"Yes, indeed,\\" she replied, \\"no such a thing as a respectable meatsoup- their cookery is miserable stuff.\\"    The journey had also tired Kaela; but she was always fatigued,that was the worst of it. So they sent for Sophy, and she was takeninto the house to reside with them, and her presence there was a greatadvantage. Mamma-in-law acknowledged that Sophy was not only aclever housewife, but well-informed and accomplished, though thatcould hardly be expected in a person of her limited means. She wasalso a generous-hearted, faithful girl; she showed that thoroughlywhile Kaela lay sick, fading away. When the casket is everything,the casket should be strong, or else all is over. And all was overwith the casket, for Kaela died.    \\"She was beautiful,\\" said her mother; \\"she was quite differentfrom the beauties they call \'antiques,\' for they are so damaged. Abeauty ought to be perfect, and Kaela was a perfect beauty.\\"    Alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning. Theblack dress suited mamma very well, and she wore mourning the longest.She had also to experience another grief in seeing Alfred marry again,marry Sophy, who was nothing at all to look at. \\"He\'s gone to the veryextreme,\\" said mamma-in-law; \\"he has gone from the most beautiful tothe ugliest, and he has forgotten his first wife. Men have noconstancy. My husband was a very different man,- but then he diedbefore me.\\"    \\"\'Pygmalion loved his Galatea,\' was in the song they sung at myfirst wedding,\\" said Alfred; \\"I once fell in love with a beautifulstatue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred soul, which isa gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and sympathize with andelevate us, I have not found and won till now. You came, Sophy, not inthe glory of outward beauty, though you are even fairer than isnecessary. The chief thing still remains. You came to teach thesculptor that his work is but dust and clay only, an outward form madeof a material that decays, and that what we should seek to obtain isthe ethereal essence of mind and spirit. Poor Kaela! our life wasbut as a meeting by the way-side; in yonder world, where we shall knoweach other from a union of mind, we shall be but mere acquaintances.\\"    \\"That was not a loving speech,\\" said Sophy, \\"nor spoken like aChristian.

CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                           DELAYING IS NOT FORGETTING                           by Hans Christian Andersen    THERE was an old mansion surrounded by a marshy ditch with adrawbridge which was but seldom let down however, not done in the wideworld, but in her heart, and what is preserved there is not forgotten.Delaying is not forgetting!    Now she goes from the mansion to a little peasant hut in thefield. Therein lives a poor paralysed girl; the window of her littleroom looks northward, the sun does not enter here. The girl can onlysee a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high fence. Butto-day the sun shines here- the warm, beautiful sun of God is withinthe little room; it comes from the south through the new window, whereformerly the wall was.    The paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see thewood and the lake; the world had become so large, so beautiful, andonly through a single word from the kind mistress of the mansion.    \\"The word was so easy, the deed so small,\\" she said, \\"the joy itafforded me was infinitely great and sweet!\\"    And therefore she does many a good deed, thinks of all in thehumble cottages and in the rich mansions, where there are alsoafflicted ones. It is concealed and hidden, but God does not forgetit. Delayed is not forgotten!    An old house stood there; it was in the large town with its busytraffic. There are rooms and halls in it, but we do not enter them, weremain in the kitchen, where it is warm and light, clean and tidy; thecopper utensils are shining, the table as if polished with beeswax;the sink looks like a freshly scoured meatboard. All this a singleservant has done, and yet she has time to spare as if she wished to goto church; she wears a bow on her cap, a black bow, that signifiesmourning. But she has no one to mourn, neither father nor mother,neither relations nor sweetheart. She is a poor girl. One day shewas engaged to a poor fellow; they loved each other dearly.    One day he came to her and said:    \\"We both have nothing! The rich widow over the way in the basementhas made advances to me; she will make me rich, but you are in myheart; what do you advise me to do?\\"    \\"I advise you to do what you think will turn out to yourhappiness,\\" said the girl. \\"Be kind and good to her, but rememberthis; from the hour we part we shall never see each other again.\\"    Years passed; then one day she met the old friend and sweetheartin the street; he looked ill and miserable, and she could not helpasking him, \\"How are you?\\"    \\"Rich and prospering in every respect,\\" he said; \\"the woman isbrave and good, but you are in my heart. I have fought the battle,it will soon be ended; we shall not see each other again now untilwe meet before God!\\"    A week has passed; this morning his death was in the newspaper,that is the reason of the girl\'s mourning! Her old sweetheart isdead and has left a wife and three step-children, as the paper says;it sounds as if there is a crack, but the metal is pure.    The black bow signifies mourning, the girl\'s face points to thesame in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart and willnever be forgotten. Delaying is not forgetting!    These are three stories you see, three leaves on the same stalk.Do you wish for some more trefoil leaves? In the little heartbookare many more of them. Delaying is not forgetting!                            THE END.","source":"@site/learn/DELAYING IS NOT FORGETTING.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/DELAYING IS NOT FORGETTING","permalink":"/learn/DELAYING IS NOT

It is just that this youngster should dieaway but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it thence proceeds mawkishness,and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of mustnecessarily taste in going over the following pages.  I hope I have not in too late a day touched the beautifulmythology of Greece and dulled its brightness        Its loveliness increases; it will never        Pass into nothingness; but still will keep        A bower quiet for us, and a sleep        Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.        Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing        A flowery band to bind us to the earth,        Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth        Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,        Of all the unhealthy and o\'er-darkened ways        Made for our searching        And such too is the grandeur of the dooms        We have imagined for the mighty dead;        All lovely tales that we have heard or read so I will begin        Now while I cannot hear the city\'s din;        Now while the early budders are just new,        And run in mazes of the youngest hue        About old forests; while the willow trails        Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails        Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year        Grows lush in juicy stalks, I\'ll smoothly steer        My little boat, for many quiet hours,        With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.        Many and many a verse I hope to write,        Before the daisies, vermeil rimm\'d and white,        Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees        Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,        I must be near the middle of my story.        O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,        See it half finish\'d        There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress        My uncertain path with green, that I may speed        Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.          Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread        A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed        So plenteously all weed-hidden roots        Into o\'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.        And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,        Where no man went; and if from shepherd\'s keep        A lamb stray\'d far a-down those inmost glens,        Never again saw he the happy pens        Whither his brethren, bleating with content,        Over the hills at every nightfall went.        Among the shepherds, \'twas believed ever,        That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever        From the white flock, but pass\'d unworried        By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,        Until it came to some unfooted plains        Where fed the herds of Pan who could tell        The freshness of the space of heaven above,        Edg\'d round with dark tree tops? through which a dove        Would often beat its wings, and often too        A little cloud would move across the blue.          Full in the middle of this pleasantness        There stood a marble altar, with a tress        Of flowers budded newly; and the dew        Had taken fairy phantasies to strew        Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,        And so the dawned light in pomp receive.        For \'twas the morn rain-scented eglantine        Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;        The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run        To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;        Man\'s voice was on the mountains; and the mass        Of nature\'s lives and wonders puls\'d tenfold,        To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.          Now while the silent workings of the dawn        Were busiest, into that self-same lawn        All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped        A troop of little children garlanded;        Who gathering round the altar, seem\'d to pry        Earnestly round as wishing to espy        Some folk of holiday        But let a portion of ethereal dew        Fall on my head, and presently unmew        My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,        To stammer where old Chaucer us\'d to sing.          Leading the way, young damsels danced along,        Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;        Each having a white wicker over brimm\'d        With April\'s tender younglings        Some idly trail\'d their sheep-hooks on the ground,        And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound        With ebon-tipped flutes alway his eye        Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,        And after him his sacred vestments swept.        From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,        Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;        And in his left he held a basket full        Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull        Who stood therein did seem of great renown        Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,        Showing like Ganymede to manhood grown;        And, for those simple times, his garments were        A chieftain king\'s        But there were some who feelingly could scan        A lurking trouble in his nether lip,        And see that oftentimes the reins would slip        Through his forgotten hands each look was chang\'d        To sudden veneration \\"Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!        Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks        Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare        The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;        And all ye gentle girls who foster up        Udderless lambs, and in a little cup        Will put choice honey for a favoured youth the merry lark has pour\'d        His early song against yon breezy sky,        That spreads so clear o\'er our solemnity.\\"          Thus ending, on the shrine he heap\'d a spire        Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;        Anon he stain\'d the thick and spongy sod        With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.        Now while the earth was drinking it, and while        Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,        And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright        \'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light        Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang O thou, to whom        Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom        Their ripen\'d fruitage; yellow girted bees        Their golden honeycombs; our village leas        Their fairest blossom\'d beans and poppied corn;        The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,        To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries        Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies        Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year        All its completions- be quickly near,        By every wind that nods the mountain pine,        O forester divine!          \\"Thou, to whom every faun and satyr flies        For willing service; whether to surprise        The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;        Or upward ragged precipices flit        To save poor lambkins from the eagle\'s maw;        Or by mysterious enticement draw        Bewildered shepherds to their path again;        Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,        And gather up all fancifullest shells        For thee to tumble into Naiads\' cells,        And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;        Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,        The while they pelt each other on the crown        With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown-        By all the echoes that about thee ring,        Hear us, O satyr king!          \\"O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears        While ever and anon to his shorn peers        A ram goes bleating Breather round our farms,        To keep off mildews, and all weather harms        Dread opener of the mysterious doors        Leading to universal knowledge- see,        Great son of Dryope,        The many that are come to pay their vows        With leaves about their brows!          \\"Be still the unimaginable lodge        For solitary thinkings; such as dodge        Conception to the very bourne of heaven,        Then leave the naked brain        Be still a symbol of immensity;        A firmament reflected in a sea;        An element filling the space between;        An unknown- but no more        Fair creatures! whose young children\'s children bred        Thermopylae its heroes- not yet dead,        But in old marbles ever beautiful.        High genitors, unconscious did they cull        Time\'s sweet first-fruits- they danc\'d to weariness,        And then in quiet circles did they press        The hillock turf, and caught the latter end        Of some strange history, potent to send        A young mind from its bodily tenement.        Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent        On either side; pitying the sad death        Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath        Of Zephyr slew him,- Zephyr penitent,        Who now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,        Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.        The archers too, upon a wider plain,        Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,        And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft        Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,        Call\'d up a thousand thoughts to envelope        Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee        And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,        Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young        Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue        Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,        And very, very deadliness did nip        Her motherly cheeks. Arous\'d from this sad mood        By one, who at a distance loud halloo\'d,        Uplifting his strong bow into the air,        Many might after brighter visions stare \'twas even an awful shine        From the exaltation of Apollo\'s bow;        A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.        Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,        Might turn their steps towards the sober ring        Where sat Endymion and the aged priest        \'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas\'d        The silvery setting of their mortal star.        There they discours\'d upon the fragile bar        That keeps us from our homes ethereal;        And what our duties there besides these,        A world of other unguess\'d offices.        Anon they wander\'d, by divine converse,        Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse        Each one his own anticipated bliss.        One felt heart-certain that he could not miss        His quick gone love, among fair blossom\'d boughs,        Where every zephyr-sigh pouts, and endows        Her lips with music for the welcoming.        Another wish\'d, mid that eternal spring,        To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,        Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales yet hourly had he striven        To hide the cankering venom, that had riven        His fainting recollections. Now indeed        His senses had swoon\'d off        But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,        Like one who on the earth had never stept.        Aye, even as dead still as a marble man,        Frozen in that old tale Arabian.          Who whispers him so pantingly and close?        Peona, his sweet sister        She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse        Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,        Along a path between two little streams,-        Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,        From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow        From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;        Until they came to where these streamlets fall,        With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,        Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush        With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.        A little shallop, floating there hard by,        Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;        And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,        And dipt again, with the young couple\'s weight,-        Peona guiding, through the water straight,        Towards a bowery island opposite;        Which gaining presently, she steered light        Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,        Where nested was an arbour, overwove        By many a summer\'s silent fingering;        To whose cool bosom she was used to bring        Her playmates, with their needle broidery,        And minstrel memories of times gone by.          So she was gently glad to see him laid        Under her favourite bower\'s quiet shade,        On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,        Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves        When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,        And the tann\'d harvesters rich armfuls took.        Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest so that a whispering blade        Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling        Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling        Among sere leaves and twigs, might all be heard.          O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,        That broodest o\'er the troubled sea of the mind        Till it is hush\'d and smooth! O unconfin\'d        Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key        To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,        Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,        Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves        And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world        Of silvery enchantment!- who, upfurl\'d        Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,        But renovates and lives?- Thus, in the bower,        Endymion was calm\'d to life again.        Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,        He said thou art as a dove        Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings        About me; and the pearliest dew not brings        Such morning incense from the fields of May,        As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray        From those kind eyes,- the very home and haunt        Of sisterly affection. Can I want        Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?        Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears        That, any longer, I will pass my days        Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise        My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more        Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar again I\'ll poll        The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow \\"Brother, \'tis vain to hide        That thou dost know of things mysterious,        Immortal, starry; such alone could thus        Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn\'d in aught        Offensive to the heavenly power? Caught        A Paphian dove upon a message sent?        Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent        Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen        Her naked limbs among the alders green;        And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace        Something more high perplexing in thy face!\\"          Endymion look\'d at her, and press\'d her hand,        And said, \\"Art thou so pale, who wast so bland        And merry in our meadows? How is this?        Tell me thine ailment with so deadly gasp        No man e\'er panted for a mortal love.        So all have set my heavier grief above        These things which happen. Rightly have they done        And in that nook, the very pride of June,        Had I been used to pass my weary eves;        The rather for the sun unwilling leaves        So dear a picture of his sovereign power,        And I could witness his most kingly hour,        When he doth tighten up the golden reins,        And paces leisurely down amber plains        His snorting four. Now when his chariot last        Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,        There blossom\'d suddenly a magic bed        Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red such garland wealth        Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,        Until my head was dizzy and distraught.        Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole        A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;        And shaping visions all about my sight        Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;        The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,        And then were gulph\'d in a tumultuous swim yet such a dream        That never tongue, although it overteem        With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,        Could figure out and to conception bring        All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay        Watching the zenith, where the milky way        Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;        And travelling my eye, until the doors        Of heaven appear\'d to open for my flight,        I became loth and fearful to alight        From such high soaring by a downward glance        At which I sigh\'d that I could not pursue,        And dropt my vision to the horizon\'s verge;        And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge        The loveliest moon, that ever silver\'d o\'er        A shell for Neptune\'s goblet but it was quite dazed        By a bright something, sailing down apace,        Making me quickly veil my eyes and face Ah! \'twas too much;        Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,        Yet held my recollections, even as one        Who dives three fathoms where the waters run        Gurgling in beds of coral but \'twas to live,        To take in draughts of life from the gold fount        Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count        The moments, by some greedy help that seem\'d        A second self, that each might be redeem\'d        And plunder\'d of its load of blessedness.        Ah, desperate mortal! I e\'en dar\'d to press        Her very cheek against my crowned lip,        And, at that moment, felt my body dip        Into a warmer air Ah! my sighs, my tears,        My clenched hands the solitary breeze        Bluster\'d, and slept, and its wild self did teaze        With wayward melancholy; and I thought,        Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought        Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!-        Away I wander\'d- all the pleasant hues        Of heaven and earth had faded        Therefore I eager followed, and did curse        The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,        Rock\'d me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!        These things, with all their comfortings, are given        To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,        Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea        Of weary life.\\"                            Thus ended he, and both        Sat silent \\"Is this the cause?        This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!        That one who through this middle earth should pass        Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave        His name upon the harp-string, should achieve        No higher bard than simple maidenhood,        Singing alone, and fearfully,- how the blood        Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray        He knew not where; and how he would say, nay,        If any said \'twas love and then, that love doth scathe        The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;        And then the ballad of his sad life closes        With sighs, and an alas!- Endymion!        Be rather in the trumpet\'s mouth,- anon        Among the winds at large- that all may hearken!        Although, before the crystal heavens darken,        I watch and dote upon the silver lakes        Pictur\'d in western cloudiness, that takes        The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,        Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands        With horses prancing o\'er them, palaces        And towers of amethyst,- would I so teaze        My pleasant days, because I could not mount        Into those regions? The Morphean fount        Of that fine element that visions, dreams,        And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams        Into its airy channels with so subtle,        So thin a breathing, not the spider\'s shuttle,        Circled a million times within the space        Of a swallow\'s nest-door, could delay a trace,        A tinting of its quality a conflicting of shame and ruth        Was in his plaited brow amid his pains        He seem\'d to taste a drop of manna-dew,        Full palatable; and a colour grew        Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.          \\"Peona! ever have I long\'d to slake        My thirst for the world\'s praises yet my higher hope        Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,        To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.        Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks        Our ready minds to fellowship divine,        A fellowship with essence; till we shine,        Full alchemiz\'d, and free of space. Behold        The clear religion of heaven! Fold        A rose leaf round thy finger\'s taperness,        And soothe thy lips        Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;        Old ditties sigh above their father\'s grave;        Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave        Round every spot where trod Apollo\'s foot;        Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,        Where long ago a giant battle was;        And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass        In every place where infant Orpheus slept.        Feel we these things?- that moment have we stept        Into a sort of oneness, and our state        Is like a floating spirit\'s. But there are        Richer entanglements, enthralments far        More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,        To the chief intensity its influence,        Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,        At which we start and fret; till in the end,        Melting into its radiance, we blend,        Mingle, and so become a part of it,-        Nor with aught else can our souls interknit        So wingedly        For I have ever thought that it might bless        The world with benefits unknowingly;        As does the nightingale, upperched high,        And cloister\'d among cool and bunched leaves-        She sings but to her love, nor e\'er conceives        How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.        Just so may love, although \'tis understood        The mere commingling of passionate breath,        Produce more than our searching witnesseth but who, of men, can tell        That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell        To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,        The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,        The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,        The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,        Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,        If human souls did never kiss and greet?          \\"Now, if this earthly love has power to make        Men\'s being mortal, immortal; to shake        Ambition from their memories, and brim        Their measure of content        \'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits        In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,        When all above was faint with mid-day heat.        And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,        I\'d bubble up the water through a reed;        So reaching back to boy-hood so happy, I was fain        To follow it upon the open plain,        And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!        A wonder, fair as any I have told-        The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,        Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap        Through the cool depth.- It moved as if to flee-        I started up, when lo! refreshfully        There came upon my face in plenteous showers        Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,        Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,        Bathing my spirit in a new delight.        Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss        Alone preserved me from the drear abyss        Of death, for the fair form had gone again.        Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain        Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth        On the deer\'s tender haunches        And a whole age of lingering moments crept        Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept        Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.        Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;        Once more been tortured with renewed life.        When last the wintry gusts gave over strife        With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies        Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes        In pity of the shatter\'d infant buds,-        That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,        My hunting cap, because I laugh\'d and smil\'d,        Chatted with thee, and many days exil\'d        All torment from my breast;- \'twas even then,        Straying about, yet, coop\'d up in the den        Of helpless discontent,- hurling my lance        From place to place, and following at chance,        At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,        And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck        In the middle of a brook,- whose silver ramble        Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,        Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,        Whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave        The nether sides of mossy stones and rock,-        \'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock        Its own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,        Hung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread        Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph\'s home.       \'Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?\'        Said I, low voic\'d       \'Or \'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,       \'And babbles thorough silence, till her wits       \'Are gone in tender madness, and anon,       \'Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone       \'Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,       \'And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,       \'To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,       \'Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,       \'And weave them dyingly- send honey-whispers       \'Round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers       \'May sigh my love unto her pitying!       \'O charitable Echo! hear, and sing       \'This ditty to her!- tell her\'- so I stay\'d        My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,        Stood stupefied with my own empty folly,        And blushing for the freaks of melancholy.        Salt tears were coming, when I heard my name        Most fondly lipp\'d, and then these accents came so farewell, sad sigh;        And come instead demurest meditation,        To occupy me wholly, and to fashion        My pilgrimage for the world\'s dusky brink.        No more will I count over, link by link,        My chain of grief aye, thou shalt see,        Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;        What a calm round of hours shall make my days.        There is a paly flame of hope that plays        Where\'er I look        They stept into the boat, and launch\'d from land.                        BOOK II.        O sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm!        All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,        And shadowy, through the mist of passed years        Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain        The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.        Hence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!        Swart planet in the universe of deeds!        Wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds        Along the pebbled shore of memory!        Many old rotten-timber\'d boats there be        Upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified        To goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,        And golden keel\'d, is left unlaunch\'d and dry.        But wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly        About the great Athenian admiral\'s mast?        What care, though striding Alexander past        The Indus with his Macedonian numbers?        Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers        The glutted Cyclops, what care?- Juliet leaning        Amid her window-flowers,- sighing,- weaning        Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,        Doth more avail than these        Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;        Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes        Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,        Hour after hour, to each lush-leav\'d rill.        Now he is sitting by a shady spring,        And elbow-deep with feverous fingering        Stems the upbursting cold lo! but now        He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water        Onward it flies. From languor\'s sullen bands        His limbs are loos\'d, and eager, on he hies        Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.        It seem\'d he flew, the way so easy was;        And like a new-born spirit did he pass        Through the green evening quiet in the sun,        O\'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,        Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams        The summer time away. One track unseams        A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue        Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,        He sinks adown a solitary glen,        Where there was never sound of mortal men,        Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences        Melting to silence, when upon the breeze        Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,        To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet        Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,        Until it reach\'d a splashing fountain\'s side        That, near a cavern\'s mouth, for ever pour\'d        Unto the temperate air so it did, with touch        Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch        Even with mealy gold the waters clear.        But, at that very touch, to disappear        So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,        Endymion sought around, and shook each bed        Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung        Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,        What whisperer disturb\'d his gloomy rest?        It was a nymph uprisen to the breast        In the fountain\'s pebbly margin, and she stood        \'Mong lillies, like the youngest of the brood.        To him her dripping hand she softly kist,        And anxiously began to plait and twist        Her ringlets round her fingers, saying too long indeed,        Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed        Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer        All the bright riches of my crystal coffer        To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,        Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,        Vermilion-tail\'d, or finn\'d with silvery gauze;        Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws        A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands        Tawny and gold, ooz\'d slowly from far lands        By my diligent springs; my level lillies, shells,        My charming rod, my potent river spells;        Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup        Meander gave me,- for I bubbled up        To fainting creatures in a desert wild.        But woe is me, I am but as a child        To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,        Is, that I pity thee; that on this day        I\'ve been thy guide; that thou must wander far        In other regions, past the scanty bar        To mortal steps, before thou canst be ta\'en        From every wasting sigh, from every pain,        Into the gentle bosom of thy love.        Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above        The dashing fount pour\'d on, and where its pool        Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,        Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,        And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill        Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,        Holding his forehead, to keep off the bur        Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;        And, while beneath the evening\'s sleepy frown        Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,        Thus breath\'d he to himself        Yet, for him there\'s refreshment even in toil;        Another city doth he set about,        Free from the smallest pebble-head of doubt        That he will seize on trickling honey-combs;        Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,        And onward to another city speeds.        But this is human life I can see        Naught earthly worth my compassing; so stand        Upon a misty, jutting head of land-        Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,        When mad Eurydice is listening to\'t;        I\'d rather stand upon this misty peak,        With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,        But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,        Than be- I care not what. O meekest dove        Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!        From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,        Glance but one little beam of temper\'d light        Into my bosom, that the dreadful might        And tyranny of love be somewhat scar\'d!        Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar\'d,        Would give a pang to jealous misery,        Worse than the torment\'s self \\"Descend,        Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend        Into the sparry hollows of the world!        Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl\'d        As from thy threshold; day by day hast been        A little lower than the chilly sheen        Of icy pinnacles, and dipp\'dst thine arms        Into the deadening ether that still charms        Their marble being so through the hollow,        The silent mysteries of earth, descend!\\"          He heard but the last words, nor could contend        One moment in reflection        Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,        Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,        Like Vulcan\'s rainbow, with some monstrous roof        Curves hugely anon it leads        Through winding passages, where sameness breeds        Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;        Whether to silver grots, or giant range        Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge        Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge        Now fareth he, that o\'er the vast beneath        Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth        A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come        But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb        His bosom grew, when first he, far away        Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray        Old darkness from his throne and with such a stun        Came the amazement, that, absorb\'d in it,        He saw not fiercer wonders- past the wit        Of any spirit to tell, but one of those        Who, when this planet\'s sphering time doth close,        Will be its high remembrancers        And long he travers\'d to and fro, to acquaint        Himself with every mystery, and awe;        Till, weary, he sat down before the maw        Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim,        To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.        There, when new wonders ceas\'d to float before,        And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore        The journey homeward to habitual self        A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,        Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,        Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,        Into the bosom of a hated thing.          What misery most drowningly doth sing        In lone Endymion\'s ear, now he has raught        The goal of consciousness? Ah, \'tis the thought,        The deadly feel of solitude so that when again        He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,        Moving more near the while thou dost taste        Freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste        Thy loveliness in dismal elements;        But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,        There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee        It feels Elysian, how rich to me,        An exil\'d mortal, sounds its pleasant name!        Within my breast there lives a choking flame-        O let me cool\'t the zephyr-boughs among!        A homeward fever parches up my tongue-        O let me slake it at the running springs!        Upon my ear a noisy nothing rings-        O let me once more hear the linnet\'s note!        Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float-        O let me \'noint them with the heaven\'s light!        Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?        O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!        Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?        O think how this dry palate would rejoice!        If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,        O think how I should love a bed of flowers!-        Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!        Deliver me from this rapacious deep!\\"          Thus ending loudly, as he would o\'erleap        His destiny, alert he stood refreshment drowns        Itself, and strives its own delights to hide-        Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride        In a long whispering birth enchanted grew        Before his footsteps; as when heav\'d anew        Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,        Down whose green back the short-liv\'d foam, all hoar,        Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.          Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,        Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;        So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes        One moment with his hand among the sweets        For it came more softly than the east could blow        Arion\'s magic to the Atlantic isles;        Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles        Of thron\'d Apollo, could breathe back the lyre        To seas Ionian and Tyrian.          O did he ever live, that lonely man,        Who lov\'d- and music slew not? \'Tis the pest        Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;        That things of delicate and tenderest worth        Are swallow\'d all, and made a seared dearth,        By one consuming flame then the sounds again        Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain        Over a bower, where little space he stood;        For as the sunset peeps into a wood        So saw he panting light, and towards it went        Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!        Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,        Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.          After a thousand mazes overgone,        At last, with sudden step, he came upon        A chamber, myrtle wall\'d, embowered high,        Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,        And more of beautiful and strange beside        And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,        Or ripe October\'s faded marigolds,        Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds-        Not hiding up an Apollonian curve        Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve        Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;        But rather, giving them to the filled sight        Officiously. Sideway his face repos\'d        On one white arm, and tenderly unclos\'d,        By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth        To slumbery pout; just as the morning south        Disparts a dew-lipp\'d rose. Above his head,        Four lilly stalks did their white honours wed        To make a coronal; and round him grew        All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,        Together intertwin\'d and trammel\'d fresh \\"Though from upper day        Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here        Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!        For \'tis the nicest touch of human honour,        When some ethereal and high-favouring donor        Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;        As now \'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence        Was I in no wise startled. So recline        Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,        Alive with sparkles- never, I aver,        Since Ariadne was a vintager,        So cool a purple here is cream,        Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;        Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm\'d        For the boy Jupiter        And here is manna pick\'d from Syrian trees,        In starlight, by the three Hesperides.        Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know        Of all these things around us.\\" He did so,        Still brooding o\'er the cadence of his lyre;        And thus so away she flew        To Jove\'s high throne, and by her plainings drew        Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer\'s beard;        Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear\'d        Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,        That same Adonis, safe in the privacy        Of this still region all his winter-sleep.        Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep        Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower        Heal\'d up the wound, and, with a balmy power,        Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness see! behold!\\"- This clamant word        Broke through the careful silence; for they heard        A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter\'d        Pigeons and doves        Rise, Cupids! or we\'ll give the blue-bell pinch        To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!\\"        At this, from every side they hurried in,        Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,        And doubling over head their little fists        In backward yawns. But all were soon alive when lo! the wreathed green        Disparted, and far upward could be seen        Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,        Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,        Spun off a drizzling dew,- which falling chill        On soft Adonis\' shoulders, made him still        Nestle and turn uneasily about.        Soon were the white doves plain, with neck stretch\'d out,        And silken traces lighten\'d in descent;        And soon, returning from love\'s banishment,        Queen Venus leaning downward open arm\'d awfully he stands;        A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;        No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;        His quiver is mysterious, none can know        What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes        There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes \\"My child,        Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild        With love- he- but alas! too well I see        Thou know\'st the deepness of his misery.        Ah, smile not so, my son for vexing Mars had teaz\'d        Me even to tears        Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind;        Those same full fringed lids a constant blind        Over his sullen eyes I have mark\'d each cheek,        And find it is the vainest thing to seek;        And that of all things \'tis kept secretest.        Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest he felt assur\'d        Of happy times, when all he had endur\'d        Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.        So, with unusual gladness, on he hies        Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,        Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,        Black polish\'d porticos of awful shade,        And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,        Leading afar past wild magnificence,        Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence        Stretching across a void, then guiding o\'er        Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,        Streams subterranean teaze their granite beds;        Then heighten\'d just above the silvery heads        Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash        The waters with his spear; but at the splash,        Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose        Sudden a poplar\'s height, and \'gan to enclose        His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round        Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,        Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells        Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells        On this delight; for, every minute\'s space,        The streams with changed magic interlace aye, all so huge and strange,        The solitary felt a hurried change        Working within him into something dreary,-        Vex\'d like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,        And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.        But he revives at once        Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,        Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell        Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,        And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath\'d,        Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath\'d        So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem\'d        Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem\'d        With airs delicious. In the greenest nook        The eagle landed him, and farewell took.          It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown        With golden moss. His every sense had grown        Ethereal for pleasure; \'bove his head        Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread        Was Hesperean; to his capable ears        Silence was music from the holy spheres;        A dewy luxury was in his eyes;        The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs        And stirr\'d them faintly. Verdant cave and cell        He wander\'d through, oft wondering at such swell        Of sudden exaltation I know this cannot be.        O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee        To her entrancements \\"Fair Cupid, whence is this?\\"        A well-known voice sigh\'d, \\"Sweetest, here am I!\\"        At which soft ravishment, with doting cry        They trembled to each other.- Helicon!        O fountain\'d hill! Old Homer\'s Helicon!        That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o\'er        These sorry pages; then the verse would soar        And sing above this gentle pair, like lark        Over his nested young our dazed eyes        Have seen a new tinge in the western skies yet must I hence Ah, dearest, do not groan        Or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,        And I must blush in heaven. O that I        Had done\'t already; that the dreadful smiles        At my lost brightness, my impassion\'d wiles,        Had waned from Olympus\' solemn height,        And from all serious Gods; that our delight        Was quite forgotten, save of us alone!        And wherefore so ashamed? \'Tis but to atone        For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes yes, Pallas has been sighing,        While every eve saw me my hair uptying        With fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,        I was as vague as solitary dove,        Nor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss-        Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,        An immortality of passion\'s thine woe! woe! is grief contain\'d        In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?\\"-        Hereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife        Melted into a languor. He return\'d        Entranced vows and tears.                                 Ye who have yearn\'d        With too much passion, will here stay and pity,        For the mere sake of truth; as \'tis a ditty        Not of these days, but long ago \'twas told        By a cavern wind unto a forest old;        And then the forest told it in a dream        To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam        A poet caught as he was journeying        To Phoebus\' shrine; and in it he did fling        His weary limbs, bathing an hour\'s space,        And after, straight in that inspired place        He sang the story up into the air,        Giving it universal freedom. There        Has it been ever sounding for those ears        Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers        Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it        Must surely be self-doom\'d or he will rue it he sickly guess\'d        How lone he was once more, and sadly press\'d        His empty arms together, hung his head,        And most forlorn upon that widow\'d bed        Sat silently. Love\'s madness he had known no longer did he wage        A rough-voic\'d war against the dooming stars.        No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars O he had swoon\'d        Drunken from pleasure\'s nipple; and his love        Henceforth was dove-like.- Loth was he to move        From the imprinted couch, and when he did,        \'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid        In muffling hands. So temper\'d, out he stray\'d        Half seeing visions that might have dismay\'d        Alecto\'s serpents; ravishments more keen        Than Hermes\' pipe, when anxious he did lean        Over eclipsing eyes his youth, up to the day        When \'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,        He stept upon his shepherd throne        Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,        With every friend and fellow-woodlander-        Pass\'d like a dream before him. Then the spur        Of the old bards to mighty deeds        That wondrous night        His sister\'s sorrow; and his wanderings all,        Until into the earth\'s deep maw he rush\'d essences,        Once spiritual, are like muddy lees,        Meant but to fertilize my earthly root,        And make my branches lift a golden fruit        Into the bloom of heaven        Fair maid, be pitiful to my great woe.        Stay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,        A happy wooer, to the flowery mead        Where all that beauty snar\'d me.\\"- \\"Cruel god,        Desist! or my offended mistress\' nod        Will stagnate all thy fountains in mercy then away,        Kindest Alpheus, for should I obey        My own dear will, \'twould be a deadly bane.        O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain        Like this of mine, then would I fearless turn        And be a criminal. Alas, I burn,        I shudder- gentle river, get thee hence.        Alpheus! thou enchanter! every sense        Of mine was once made perfect in these woods.        Fresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,        Ripe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;        But ever since I heedlessly did lave        In thy deceitful stream, a panting glow        Grew strong within me there are deities        Will shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs        \'Tis almost death to hear and thou shouldst please        Thyself to choose the richest, where we might        Be incense-pillow\'d every summer night.        Doff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,        And let us be thus comforted; unless        Thou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream        Hurry distracted from Sol\'s temperate beam,        And pour to death along some hungry sands.\\"-       \\"What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands        Severe before me \\"I urge        Thee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,        By our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,        If thou art powerful, these lovers\' pains;        And make them happy in some happy plains.\\"          He turn\'d- there was a whelming sound- he stept,        There was a cooler light; and so he kept        Towards it by a sandy path, and lo!        More suddenly than doth a moment go,        The visions of the earth were gone and fled-        He saw the giant sea above his head.                       BOOK III.        There are who lord it o\'er their fellow-men        With most prevailing tinsel        O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din        The while they feel thine airy fellowship.        Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip        Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,        Couch\'d in thy brightness, dream of fields divine the nested wren        Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,        And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf        Takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief        To the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps        Within its pearly house.- The mighty deeps,        The monstrous sea is thine- the myriad sea!        O Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,        And Tellus feels his forehead\'s cumbrous load.          Cynthia! where art thou now? What far abode        Of green or silvery bower doth enshrine        Such utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine        For one as sorrowful thou dost bewail        His tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?        Ah! surely that light peeps from Vesper\'s eye,        Or what a thing is love! \'Tis She, but lo!        How chang\'d, how full of ache, how gone in woe!        She dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness        Is wan on Neptune\'s blue for down-glancing thence        She fathoms eddies, and runs wild about        O\'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out        The thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright\'ning        Their savage eyes with unaccustom\'d lightning.        Where will the splendour be content to reach?        O love! how potent hast thou been to teach        Strange journeyings! Wherever beauty dwells,        In gulph or aerie, mountains or deep dells,        In light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,        Thou pointest out the way, and straight \'tis won.        Amid his toil thou gav\'st Leander breath;        Thou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;        Thou madest Pluto bear thin element;        And now, O winged Chieftain! thou hast sent        A moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,        To find Endymion.                               On gold sand impearl\'d        With lilly shells, and pebbles milky white,        Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth\'d her light        Against his pallid face \'twas very sweet; he stay\'d        His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid        His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,        To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,        Lash\'d from the crystal roof by fishes\' tails.        And so he kept, until the rosy veils        Mantling the east, by Aurora\'s peering hand        Were lifted from the water\'s breast, and fann\'d        Into sweet air; and sober\'d morning came        Meekly through billows        Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large        Of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;        Rudders that for a hundred years had lost        The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss\'d        With long-forgotten story, and wherein        No reveller had ever dipp\'d a chin        But those of Saturn\'s vintage; mouldering scrolls,        Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls        Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude        In ponderous stone, developing the mood        Of ancient Nox;- then skeletons of man,        Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,        And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw        Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe        These secrets struck into him; and unless        Dian had chaced away that heaviness,        He might have died hand in hand we went        From eve to morn across the firmament.        No apples would I gather from the tree,        Till thou hadst cool\'d their cheeks deliciously        No woods were green enough, no bower divine,        Until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine thou wast the deep glen;        Thou wast the mountain-top- the sage\'s pen-        The poet\'s harp- the voice of friends- the sun;        Thou wast the river- thou wast glory won;        Thou wast my clarion\'s blast- thou wast my steed-        My goblet full of wine- my topmost deed I prest        Nature\'s soft pillow in a wakeful rest.        But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss-        My strange love came- Felicity\'s abyss!        She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away-        Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway        Has been an under-passion to this hour.        Now I begin to feel thine orby power        Is coming fresh upon me every ocean-form        Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,        And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar,        Quicksand, and whirlpool, and deserted shore,        Were emblem\'d in the woof; with every shape        That skims, or dives, or sleeps, \'twixt cape and cape.        The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,        Yet look upon it, and \'twould size and swell        To its huge self; and the minutest fish        Would pass the very hardest gazer\'s wish,        And show his little eye\'s anatomy.        Then there was pictur\'d the regality        Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,        In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.        Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,        And in his lap a book, the which he conn\'d        So stedfastly, that the new denizen        Had time to keep him in amazed ken,        To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.          The old man rais\'d his hoary head and saw        The wilder\'d stranger- seeming not to see,        His features were so lifeless. Suddenly        He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows        Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs        Furrow\'d deep wrinkles in his forehead large,        Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,        Till round his wither\'d lips had gone a smile.        Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil        Had watch\'d for years in forlorn hermitage,        Who had not from mid-life to utmost age        Eas\'d in one accent his o\'er-burden\'d soul,        Even to the trees. He rose-          \\"Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head        In peace upon my watery pillow        To northern seas I\'ll in a twinkling sail,        And mount upon the snortings of a whale        To some black cloud; thence down I\'ll madly sweep        On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,        Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl\'d        With rapture to the other side of the world!        O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,        I bow full hearted to your old decree!        Yes, every god be thank\'d, and power benign,        For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.        Thou art the man!\\" Endymion started back        Dismay\'d; and, like a wretch from whom the rack        Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,        Mutter\'d        Her lips were all my own, and- ah, ripe sheaves        Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,        But never may be garner\'d. I must stoop        My head, and kiss death\'s foot. Love! love, farewell!        Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell        Would melt at thy sweet breath.- By Dian\'s hind        Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind        I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,        I care not for this old mysterious man!\\"          He spake, and walking to that aged form,        Look\'d high defiance. Lo! his heart \'gan warm        With pity, for the grey-hair\'d creature wept.        Had he then wrong\'d a heart where sorrow kept?        Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought        Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to humane thought,        Convulsion to a mouth of many years?        He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.        The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt        Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt        About his large dark locks, and faultering spake for why? thou openest        The prison gates that have so long opprest        My weary watching. Though thou know\'st it not,        Thou art commission\'d to this fated spot        For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;        I am a friend to love, to loves of yore in this tottering case        Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays        As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,        For thou shalt hear this secret all display\'d,        Now as we speed towards our joyous task.\\"          So saying, this young soul in age\'s mask        Went forward with the Carian side by side while ocean\'s tide        Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel\'d sands        Took silently their foot-prints.                                      \\"My soul stands        Now past the midway from mortality,        And so I can prepare without a sigh        To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.        I was a fisher once, upon this main,        And my boat danc\'d in every creek and bay;        Rough billows were my home by night and day,-        The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had        No housing from the storm and tempests mad,        But hollow rocks,- and they were palaces        Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease now I am no longer wretched thrall,        My long captivity and moanings all        Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,        The which I breathe away, and thronging come        Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.          \\"I touch\'d no lute, I sang not, trod no measures        More did I love to lie in cavern rude,        Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune\'s voice,        And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!        There blush\'d no summer eve but I would steer        My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear        The shepherd\'s pipe come clear from aery steep,        Mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep        For I would watch all night to see unfold        Heaven\'s gates, and AEthon snort his morning gold        Wide o\'er the swelling streams        They knew not whence this bounty, and elate        Would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.          \\"Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach        At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!        Had been my dreary death? Fool! I began        To feel distemper\'d longings to be free        Of all his kingdom. Long in misery        I wasted, ere in one extremest fit        I plung\'d for life or death. To interknit        One\'s senses with so dense a breathing stuff        Might seem a work of pain; so not enough        Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,        And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt        Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;        Forgetful utterly of self-intent;        Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.        Then, like a new fledg\'d bird that first doth show        His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,        I tried in fear the pinions of my will.        \'Twas freedom! and at once I visited        The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.        No need to tell thee of them, for I see        That thou hast been a witness- it must be-        For these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,        By the melancholy corners of that mouth.        So I will in my story straightway pass        To more immediate matter. Woe, alas!        That love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!        Why did poor Glaucus ever- ever dare        To sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger- youth!        I lov\'d her to the very white of truth,        And she would not conceive it. Timid thing!        She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,        Round every isle, and point, and promontory,        From where large Hercules wound up his story        Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew        The more, the more I saw her dainty hue        Gleam delicately through the azure clear-        It seem\'d to whirl around me, and a swoon        Left me dead-drifting to that fatal power.          \\"When I awoke, \'twas in a twilight bower;        Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,        Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.        How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,        And over it a sighing voice expire.        It ceased- I caught light footsteps; and anon        The fairest face that morn e\'er look\'d upon        Push\'d through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!        With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove        A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all        The range of flower\'d Elysium. Thus did fall        The dew of her rich speech but if beyond       \'Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond       \'Of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;       \'If thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;       \'If smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,       \'Hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,       \'O let me pluck it for thee.\' Thus she link\'d        Her charming syllables, till indistinct        Their music came to my o\'er-sweeten\'d soul;        And then she hover\'d over me, and stole        So near, that if no nearer it had been        This furrow\'d visage thou hadst never seen.          \\"Young man of Latmos! thus particular        Am I, that thou may\'st plainly see how far        This fierce temptation went nor would thence        Have mov\'d, even though Amphion\'s harp had woo\'d        Me back to Scylla o\'er the billows rude.        For as Apollo each eve doth devise        A new appareling for western skies;        So every eve, nay every spendthrift hour        Shed balmy consciousness within that bower.        And I was free of haunts umbrageous;        Could wander in the mazy forest-house        Of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler\'d deer,        And birds from coverts innermost and drear        Warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow-        To me new born delights!                                  \\"Now let me borrow,        For moments few, a temperament as stern        As Pluto\'s sceptre, that my words not burn        These uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell        How specious heaven was changed to real hell.          \\"One morn she left me sleeping while I stumbled        Down a precipitous path, as if impell\'d.        I came to a dark valley.- Groanings swell\'d        Poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,        The nearer I approach\'d a flame\'s gaunt blue,        That glar\'d before me through a thorny brake.        This fire, like the eye of gordian snake,        Bewitch\'d me towards; and I soon was near        A sight too fearful for the feel of fear        Groan\'d one and all, as if some piercing trial        Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.        She lifted up the charm        Then was appalling silence she banish\'d        These phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark        Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,        With dancing and loud revelry,- and went        Swifter than centaurs after rapine bent.-        Sighing an elephant appear\'d and bow\'d        Before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud        In human accent       \'Or give me to the air, or let me die!       \'I sue not for my happy crown again;       \'I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;       \'I sue not for my lone, my widow\'d wife;       \'I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,       \'My children fair, my lovely girls and boys!       \'I will forget them; I will pass these joys;       \'Ask nought so heavenward, so too- too high truth had come        Naked and sabre-like against my heart.        I saw a fury whetting a death-dart;        And my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,        Fainted away in that dark lair of night.        Think, my deliverer, how desolate        My waking must have been! disgust, and hate,        And terrors manifold divided me        A spoil amongst them. I prepar\'d to flee        Into the dungeon core of that wild wood yes,       \'I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch and it shall still its cries       \'Upon some breast more lilly-feminine.       \'Oh, no- it shall not pine, and pine, and pine       \'More than one pretty, trifling thousand years;       \'And then \'twere pity, but fate\'s gentle shears       \'Cut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!       \'Young dove of the waters! truly I\'ll not hurt       \'One hair of thine Mark me! Thou hast thews       \'Immortal, for thou art of heavenly race which gone, I then bequeath       \'Thy fragile bones to unknown burial.       \'Adieu, sweet love, adieu!\'- As shot stars fall,        She fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung        And poison\'d was my spirit soon these limbs became        Gaunt, wither\'d, sapless, feeble, cramp\'d, and lame.          \\"Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,        Without one hope, without one faintest trace        Of mitigation, or redeeming bubble        Of colour\'d phantasy; for I fear \'twould trouble        Thy brain to loss of reason soon she seem\'d to sink        Away from me again, as though her course        Had been resum\'d in spite of hindering force-        So vanish\'d therefore all the billows green        Toss\'d up the silver spume against the clouds.        The tempest came        I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.        O they had all been sav\'d but crazed eld        Annull\'d my vigorous cravings but the downward weight        O\'erpowered me- it sank. Then \'gan abate        The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst        The comfortable sun. I was athirst        To search the book, and in the warming air        Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.        Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on        My soul page after page, till well-nigh won        Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,        I read these words, and read again, and tried        My eyes against the heavens, and read again.        O what a load of misery and pain        Each Atlas-line bore off!- a shine of hope        Came gold around me, cheering me to cope        Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!        For thou hast brought their promise to an end.          \\"In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,        Doom\'d with enfeebled carcase to outstretch        His loath\'d existence through ten centuries,        And then to die alone. Who can devise        A total opposition? No one. So        One million times ocean must ebb and flow,        And he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,        These things accomplish\'d        Which done, and all these labours ripened,        A youth, by heavenly power lov\'d and led,        Shall stand before him; whom he shall direct        How to consummate all. The youth elect        Must do the thing, or both will be destroy\'d.\\"-          \\"Then,\\" cried the young Endymion, overjoy\'d,       \\"We are twin brothers in this destiny!        Say, I intreat thee, what achievement high        Is, in this restless world, for me reserv\'d.        What! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv\'d,        Had we both perish\'d?\\"- \\"Look!\\" the sage replied,       \\"Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,        Of diverse brilliances? \'tis the edifice        I told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;        And where I have enshrined piously        All lovers, whom fell storms have doom\'d to die        Throughout my bondage.\\" Thus discoursing, on        They went till unobscur\'d the porches shone;        Which hurryingly they gain\'d, and enter\'d straight.        Sure never since king Neptune held his state        Was seen such wonder underneath the stars.        Turn to some level plain where haughty Mars        Has legion\'d all his battle; and behold        How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold        His even breast-        So in that crystal place, in silent rows,        Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.-        The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac\'d        Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac\'d;        Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips        All ruddy,- for here death no blossom nips.        He mark\'d their brows and foreheads; saw their hair        Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;        And each one\'s gentle wrists, with reverence,        Put cross-wise to its heart.                                   \\"Let us commence,\\"        Whisper\'d the guide, stuttering with joy, \\"even now.\\"        He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,        Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,        Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.        He tore it into pieces small as snow        That drifts unfeather\'d when bleak northerns blow;        And having done it, took his dark blue cloak        And bound it round Endymion        But first a little patience; first undo        This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.        Ah, gentle! \'tis as weak as spider\'s skein;        And shouldst thou break it- What, is it done so clean?        A power overshadows thee! O, brave!        The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.        Here is a shell; \'tis pearly blank to me,        Nor mark\'d with any sign or charactery-        Canst thou read aught? O read for pity\'s sake!        Olympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break        This wand against yon lyre on the pedestal.\\"          \'Twas done he left them to their joy,        And onward went upon his high employ,        Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.        And, as he pass\'d, each lifted up its head,        As doth a flower at Apollo\'s touch.        Death felt it to his inwards        Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.        The Latmian persever\'d along, and thus        All were re-animated. There arose        A noise of harmony, pulses and throes        Of gladness in the air- while many, who        Had died in mutual arms devout and true,        Sprang to each other madly; and the rest        Felt a high certainty of being blest.        They gaz\'d upon Endymion. Enchantment        Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent.        Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,        Budded, and swell\'d, and, full-blown, shed full showers        Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.        The two deliverers tasted a pure wine        Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz\'d out.        Speechless they eyed each other, and about        The fair assembly wander\'d to and fro,        Distracted with the richest overflow        Of joy that ever pour\'d from heaven.                                              -\\"Away!\\"        Shouted the new born god; \\"Follow, and pay        Our piety to Neptunus supreme!\\"-        Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,        They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,        Through portal columns of a giant size,        Into the vaulted, boundless emerald.        Joyous all follow\'d as the leader call\'d,        Down marble steps; pouring as easily        As hour-glass sand,- and fast, as you might see        Swallows obeying the south summer\'s call,        Or swans upon a gentle waterfall.          Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,        Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,        Just within ken, they saw descending thick        Another multitude. Whereat more quick        Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,        And of those numbers every eye was wet;        For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,        Like what was never heard in all the throes        Of wind and waters        Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,        To which the leaders sped; but not half raught        Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,        And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes        Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.        Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze        Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,        And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne        Of emerald deep and as the blue        Doth vault the waters, so the waters drew        Their doming curtains, high, magnificent,        Aw\'d from the throne aloof;- and when storm-rent        Disclos\'d the thunder-gloomings in Jove\'s air;        But sooth\'d as now, flash\'d sudden everywhere,        Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering        Death to a human eye air verily,        But for the portraiture of clouds and sky        Behold!\\"- Two copious tear-drops instant fell        From the God\'s large eyes; he smil\'d delectable,        And over Glaucus held his blessing hands.-       \\"Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands        Of love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour        I met thee in earth\'s bosom, all my power        Have I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet        Escap\'d from dull mortality\'s harsh net?        A little patience, youth! \'twill not be long,        Or I am skilless quite and were I given        To utter secrets, haply I might say        Some pleasant words thou wilt find        Cupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;        And pray persuade with thee- Ah, I have done,        All blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!\\"-        Thus the fair goddess an empire stern hast thou;        And it hath furrow\'d that large front        His fingers went across it- All were mute        To gaze on Amphitrite, queen of pearls,        And Thetis pearly too.-                                 The palace whirls        Around giddy Endymion; seeing he        Was there far strayed from mortality.        He could not bear it- shut his eyes in vain;        Imagination gave a dizzier pain.       \\"O I shall die! sweet Venus, be my stay!        Where is my lovely mistress? Well-away!        I die- I hear her voice- I feel my wing-\\"        At Neptune\'s feet he sank. A sudden ring        Of Nereids were about him, in kind strife        To usher back his spirit into life        Dearest Endymion! my entire love!        How have I dwelt in fear of fate a placid lake        Came quiet to his eyes; and forest green,        Cooler than all the wonders he had seen,        Lull\'d with its simple song his fluttering breast.        How happy once again in grassy nest!                        BOOK IV.        Muse of my native land! loftiest Muse!        O first-born on the mountains! by the hues        Of heaven on the spiritual air begot- yet didst thou divine        Such home-bred glory, that they cry\'d in vain,       \\"Come hither, Sister of the Island!\\" Plain        Spake fair Ausonia; and once more she spake        A higher summons despondency besets        Our pillows; and the fresh to-morrow morn        Seems to give forth its light in very scorn        Of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives.        Long have I said, how happy he who shrives        To thee! But then I thought on poets gone,        And could not pray        Yet I would have, great gods! but one short hour        Of native air- let me but die at home.\\"          Endymion to heaven\'s airy dome        Was offering up a hecatomb of vows,        When these words reach\'d him. Whereupon he bows        His head through thorny-green entanglement        Of underwood, and to the sound is bent,        Anxious as hind towards her hidden fawn.          \\"Is no one near to help me? No fair dawn        Of life from charitable voice? No sweet saying        To set my dull and sadden\'d spirit playing?        No hand to toy with mine? No lips so sweet        That I may worship them? No eyelids meet        To twinkle on my bosom? No one dies        Before me, till from these enslaving eyes        Redemption sparkles!- I am sad and lost.\\"          Thou, Carian lord, hadst better have been tost        Into a whirlpool. Vanish into air,        Warm mountaineer! for canst thou only bear        A woman\'s sigh alone and in distress?        See not her charms! Is Phoebe passionless?        Phoebe is fairer far- O gaze no more there\'s not a sound,        Melodious howsoever, can confound        The heavens and earth in one to such a death        As doth the voice of love O impious,        That he can ever dream upon it thus!-        Thought he, \\"Why am I not as are the dead,        Since to a woe like this I have been led        Through the dark earth, and through the wondrous sea?        Goddess! I love thee not the less there she lay,        Sweet as a muskrose upon new-made hay;        With all her limbs on tremble, and her eyes        Shut softly up alive. To speak he tries.       \\"Fair damsel, pity me! forgive that I        Thus violate thy bower\'s sanctity!        O pardon me, for I am full of grief-        Grief born of thee, young angel! fairest thief!        Who stolen hast away the wings wherewith        I was to top the heavens. Dear maid, sith        Thou art my executioner, and I feel        Loving and hatred, misery and weal,        Will in a few short hours be nothing to me,        And all my story that much passion slew me;        Do smile upon the evening of my days       \\"Why must such desolation betide        As that thou speak\'st of?

Though if thou wilt,        Methinks \'twould be a guilt- a very guilt-        Not to companion thee, and sigh away        The light- the dusk- the dark- till break of day!\\"       \\"Dear lady,\\" said Endymion, \\"\'tis past        Let me have music dying, and I seek        No more delight- I bid adieu to all.

Endymion could not speak, but gazed on her;        And listened to the wind that now did stir        About the crisped oaks full drearily,        Yet with as sweet a softness as might be        Remember\'d from its velvet summer song.        At last he said        I cannot choose but kneel here and adore.        Alas, I must not think- by Phoebe, no!        Let me not think, soft Angel! shall it be so?        Say, beautifullest, shall I never think?        O thou could\'st foster me beyond the brink        Of recollection! make my watchful care        Close up its bloodshot eyes, nor see despair!        Do gently murder half my soul, and        Shall feel the other half so utterly!-        I\'m giddy at that cheek so fair and smooth;        O let it blush so ever! let it soothe        My madness! let it mantle rosy-warm        With the tinge of love, panting in safe alarm.-        This cannot be thy hand, and yet it is;        And this is sure thine other softling- this        Thine own fair bosom, and I am so near!        Wilt fall asleep? O let me sip that tear!        And whisper one sweet word that I may know        This is this world- sweet dewy blossom!\\"- Woe!        Woe! Woe to that Endymion! Where is he?-        Even these words went echoing dismally        Through the wide forest- a most fearful tone,        Like one repenting in his latest moan;        And while it died away a shade pass\'d by,        As of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly        Through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth        Their timid necks and tremble; so these both        Leant to each other trembling, and sat so        Waiting for some destruction- when lo,        Foot-feather\'d Mercury appear\'d sublime        Beyond the tall tree tops; and in less time        Than shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt        Towards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt        One moment from his home I have beneath my glance        Those towering horses and their mournful freight.        Could I thus sail, and see, and thus await        Fearless for power of thought, without thine aid?-          There is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade        From some approaching wonder, and behold        Those winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold        Snuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,          Dying to embers from their native fire!          There curl\'d a purple mist around them; soon,        It seem\'d as when around the pale new moon        Sad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow and meanwhile        The mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks        On heaven\'s pavement; brotherly he talks        To divine powers        He tries the nerve of Phoebus\' golden bow,        And asketh where the golden apples grow arch Hebe brings        A full-brimm\'d goblet, dances lightly, sings        And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,        And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,        Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.        He blows a bugle,- an ethereal band        Are visible above lo!        She rises crescented!\\" He looks, \'tis she,        His very goddess; good-bye earth, and sea,        And air, and pains, and care, and suffering;        Good-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring        Towards her, and awakes- and, strange, o\'erhead,        Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,        Beheld awake his very dream then he grew        Awhile forgetful of all beauty save        Young Phoebe\'s, golden hair\'d; and so \'gan crave        Forgiveness \\"Bright goddess, stay!        Search my most hidden breast! By truth\'s own tongue,        I have no daedale heart        Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses        With \'haviour soft. Sleep yawn\'d from underneath.       \\"Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe        This murky phantasm! thou contented seem\'st        Pillow\'d in lovely idleness, nor dream\'st        What horrors may discomfort thee and me.        Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!-        Yet did she merely weep- her gentle soul        Hath no revenge in it where, where is it?        By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit        Alone about the dark- Forgive me, sweet they beat        Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,        Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.          The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,        And Vesper, risen star, began to throe        In the dusk heavens silverly, when they        Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.        Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange-        Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,        In such wise, in such temper, so aloof        Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,        So witless of their doom, that verily        \'Tis well nigh past man\'s search their hearts to see;        Whether they wept, or laugh\'d, or griev\'d, or toy\'d-        Most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy\'d.          Full facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,        The moon put forth a little diamond peak,        No bigger than an unobserved star,        Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;        Bright signal that she only stoop\'d to tie        Her silver sandals, ere deliciously        She bow\'d into the heavens her timid head.        Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,        While to his lady meek the Carian turn\'d,        To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern\'d        This beauty in its birth- Despair! despair!        He saw her body fading gaunt and spare        In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz\'d her wrist;        It melted from his grasp        And in these regions many a venom\'d dart        At random flies; they are the proper home        Of every ill        Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,        Yet all is still within and desolate.        Beset with plainful gusts, within ye hear        No sound so loud as when on curtain\'d bier        The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none        Who strive therefore a grievous feud        Hath led thee to this Cave of Quietude.        Aye, his lull\'d soul was there, although upborne        With dangerous speed with fierce alarm        He flapp\'d towards the sound. Alas, no charm        Could lift Endymion\'s head, or he had view\'d        A skyey mask, a pinion\'d multitude,-        And silvery was its passing lo! upon his silver wings        He leans away for highest heaven and sings,        Snapping his lucid fingers merrily!-        Ah, Zephyrus! art here, and Flora too!        Ye tender bibbers of the rain and dew,        Young playmates of the rose and daffodil,        Be careful, ere ye enter in, to fill              Your baskets high        With fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,        Savory, latter-mint, and columbines,        Cool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;        Yea, every flower and leaf of every clime,        All gather\'d in the dewy morning        Dissolve the frozen purity of air;        Let thy white shoulders silvery and bare        Show cold through water pinions; make more bright        The Star-Queen\'s crescent on her marriage night        A third is in the race! who is the third        Speeding away swift as the eagle bird?              The ramping Centaur!        The Lion\'s mane\'s on end far forth his bow is bent        Into the blue of heaven. He\'ll be shent,              Pale unrelentor,        When he shall hear the wedding lutes a playing.-        Andromeda! sweet woman! why delaying        So timidly among the stars        Ye shall for ever live and love, for all              Thy tears are flowing.-        By Daphne\'s fright, behold Apollo!-\\"                                             More        Endymion heard not to him        Who lives beyond earth\'s boundary, grief is dim,        Sorrow is but a shadow let our fate stop here- a kid        I on this spot will offer so my story        Will I to children utter, and repent.        There never liv\'d a mortal man, who bent        His appetite beyond his natural sphere,        But starv\'d and died. My sweetest Indian, here,        Here will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast        My life from too thin breathing so thou wilt shine        On me, and on this damsel fair of mine,        And bless our silver lives. My Indian bliss!        My river-lilly bud! one human kiss!        One sigh of real breath- one gentle squeeze,        Warm as a dove\'s nest among summer trees,        And warm with dew at ooze from living blood!        Whither didst melt? Ah, what of that!- all good        We\'ll talk about- no more of dreaming.- Now,        Where shall our dwelling be? Under the brow        Of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun        Would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;        And where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,        Will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?        O thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;        Dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace        Those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin\'d        Pipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,        That thou mayst always know whither I roam,        When it shall please thee in our quiet home        To listen and think of love. Still let me speak;        Still let me dive into the joy I seek,-        For yet the past doth prison me. The rill,        Thou haply mayst delight in, will I fill        With fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,        And thou shalt feed them from the squirrel\'s barn.        Its bottom will I strew with amber shells,        And pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.        Its sides I\'ll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,        And honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.        I will entice this crystal rill to trace        Love\'s silver name upon the meadow\'s face.        I\'ll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;        And to god Phoebus, for a golden lyre;        To Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;        To Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,        That I may see thy beauty through the night;        To Flora, and a nightingale shall light        Tame on thy finger; to the River-gods,        And they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods        Of gold, and lines of Naiads\' long bright tress.        Heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!        Thy mossy footstool shall the altar be        \'Fore which I\'ll bend, bending, dear love, to thee        And that affectionate light, those diamond things,        Those eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,        Shall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure.        Say, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?        O that I could not doubt!\\"                                       The mountaineer        Thus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear        His briar\'d path to some tranquillity.        It gave bright gladness to his lady\'s eye,        And yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;        Answering thus, just as the golden morrow        Beam\'d upward from the vallies of the east        And I do think that at my very birth        I lisp\'d thy blooming titles inwardly;        For at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,        With uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.        Art thou not cruel? Ever have I striven        To think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!        When yet a child, I heard that kisses drew        Favour from thee, and so I kisses gave        To the void air, bidding them find out love I am forbidden-        Indeed I am- thwarted, affrighted, chidden,        By things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.        Twice hast thou ask\'d whither I went voluptuous thought!        Enlarge not to my hunger, or I\'m caught        In trammels of perverse deliciousness.        No, no, that shall not be both lovelorn, silent, wan,        Into the vallies green together went.        Far wandering, they were perforce content        To sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;        Nor at each other gaz\'d, but heavily        Por\'d on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves.          Endymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves        Me to behold thee thus in last extreme        Nor could an arrow light, or javelin,        Fly in the air where his had never been-        And yet he knew it not.                                 O treachery!        Why does his lady smile, pleasing her eye        With all his sorrowing? He sees her not.        But who so stares on him? His sister sure!        Peona of the woods!- Can she endure-        Impossible- how dearly they embrace!        His lady smiles; delight is in her face;        It is no treachery.                           \\"Dear brother mine!        Endymion, weep not so! Why shouldst thou pine        When all great Latmos so exalt will be?        Thank the great gods, and look not bitterly;        And speak not one pale word, and sigh no more.        Sure I will not believe thou hast such store        Of grief, to last thee to my kiss again.        Thou surely canst not bear a mind in pain,        Come hand in hand with one so beautiful.        Be happy both of you! for I will pull        The flowers of autumn for your coronals.        Pan\'s holy priest for young Endymion calls;        And when he is restor\'d, thou, fairest dame,        Shalt be our queen. Now, is it not a shame        To see ye thus,- not very, very sad?        Perhaps ye are too happy to be glad        Therefore for her these vesper-carols are.        Our friends will all be there from nigh and far.        Many upon thy death have ditties made;        And many, even now, their foreheads shade        With cypress, on a day of sacrifice.        New singing for our maids shalt thou devise,        And pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen\'s brows.        Tell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse        This wayward brother to his rightful joys!        His eyes are on thee bent, as thou didst poize        His fate most goddess-like. Help me, I pray,        To lure- Endymion, dear brother, say        What ails thee?\\" He could bear no more, and so        Bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,        And twang\'d it inwardly, and calmly said        But there are higher ones I may not see,        If impiously an earthly realm I take.        Since I saw thee, I have been wide awake        Night after night, and day by day, until        Of the empyrean I have drunk my fill.        Let it content thee, Sister, seeing me        More happy than betides mortality.        A hermit young, I\'ll live in mossy cave,        Where thou alone shalt come to me, and lave        Thy spirit in the wonders I shall tell.        Through me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;        For to thy tongue will I all health confide.        And, for my sake, let this young maid abide        With thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,        Peona, mayst return to me. I own        This may sound strangely       \\"Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,        Of jubilee to Dian        In that same void white Chastity shall sit,        And monitor me nightly to lone slumber.        With sanest lips I vow me to the number        Of Dian\'s sisterhood; and, kind lady,        With thy good help, this very night shall see        My future days to her fane consecrate.\\"          As feels a dreamer what doth most create        His own particular fright, so these three felt or when in mine        Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends        Who know him not. Each diligently bends        Towards common thoughts and things for very fear;        Striving their ghastly malady to cheer,        By thinking it a thing of yes and no,        That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow        Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last        Endymion said so I\'d fain,        Peona, ye should hand in hand repair        Into those holy groves, that silent are        Behind great Dian\'s temple. I\'ll be yon,        At Vesper\'s earliest twinkle- they are gone-        But once, once, once again-\\" At this he press\'d        His hands against his face, and then did rest        His head upon a mossy hillock green,        And so remain\'d as he a corpse had been        All the long day; save when he scantly lifted        His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted        With the slow move of time,- sluggish and weary        Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,        Had reach\'d the river\'s brim. Then up he rose,        And, slowly as that very river flows,        Walk\'d towards the temple grove with this lament so in all this        We miscall grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,        What is there to plain of? By Titan\'s foe        I am but rightly serv\'d.\\" So saying, he        Tripp\'d lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;        Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,        As though they jests had been \\"Ha! I said,        King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,        And by old Rhadamanthus\' tongue of doom,        This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,        And the Promethean clay by thief endued,        By old Saturnus\' forelock, by his head        Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed        Myself to things of light from infancy;        And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,        Is sure enough to make a mortal man        Grow impious.\\" So he inwardly began        On things for which no wording can be found;        Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown\'d        Beyond the reach of music \\"Sister, I would have command,        If it were heaven\'s will, on our sad fate.\\"        At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate        And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,        To Endymion\'s amaze        Her long black hair swell\'d ampler, in display        Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day        Dawn\'d blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld        Phoebe, his passion! joyous she upheld        Her lucid bow, continuing thus        Her brother kiss\'d her too, and knelt adown        Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon.        She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,        Before three swiftest kisses he had told,        They vanish\'d far away!- Peona went        Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.                        THE END.","source":"@site/learn/ENDYMION- A POETIC ROMANCE.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/ENDYMION- A POETIC ROMANCE","permalink":"/learn/ENDYMION- A POETIC

At the border of the wood,near a large lake, stood the old mansionthey called it singing- indeed, they did their best. Laughter andthe howls of dogs were heard through the open windows themother superintended the household, and the father looked after thingsout-of-doors, and they were indeed very prosperous.    Where honesty leads the way, prosperity is sure to follow. The oldmansion was repaired and painted, the ditches were cleaned andfruit-trees planted; all was homely and pleasant, and the floorswere as white and shining as a pasteboard. In the long winter eveningsthe mistress and her maids sat at the spinning-wheel in the largehall; every Sunday the counsellor- this title the pedlar had obtained,although only in his old days- read aloud a portion from the Bible.The children (for they had children) all received the besteducation, but they were not all equally clever, as is the case in allfamilies.    In the meantime the willow tree near the drawbridge had grown upinto a splendid tree, and stood there, free, and was never clipped.\\"It is our genealogical tree,\\" said the old people to theirchildren, \\"and therefore it must be honoured.\\"    A hundred years had elapsed. It was in our own days; the lakehad been transformed into marsh land; the whole baronial seat had,as it were, disappeared. A pool of water near some ruined walls wasthe only remainder of the deep ditches; and here stood a magnificentold tree with overhanging branches- that was the genealogical tree.Here it stood, and showed how beautiful a willow can look if onedoes not interfere with it. The trunk, it is true, was cleft in themiddle from the root to the crown; the storms had bent it a little,but it still stood there, and out of every crevice and cleft, in whichwind and weather had carried mould, blades of grass and flowers sprangforth. Especially above, where the large boughs parted, there wasquite a hanging garden, in which wild raspberries and hart\'s-tongueferns throve, and even a little mistletoe had taken root, and grewgracefully in the old willow branches, which were reflected in thedark water beneath when the wind blew the chickweed into the corner ofthe pool. A footpath which led across the fields passed close by theold tree. High up, on the woody hillside, stood the new mansion. Ithad a splendid view, and was large and magnificent; its window paneswere so clear that one might have thought there were none there atall. The large flight of steps which led to the entrance looked like abower covered with roses and broad-leaved plants. The lawn was asgreen as if each blade of grass was cleaned separately morning andevening. Inside, in the hall, valuable oil paintings were hanging onthe walls. Here stood chairs and sofas covered with silk and velvet,which could be easily rolled about on castors; there were tableswith polished marble tops, and books bound in morocco with gilt edges.Indeed, well-to-do and distinguished people lived here; it was thedwelling of the baron and his family. Each article was in keeping withits surroundings. \\"Everything in the right place\\" was the mottoaccording to which they also acted here, and therefore all thepaintings which had once been the honour and glory of the oldmansion were now hung up in the passage which led to the servants\'rooms. It was all old lumber, especially two portraits- onerepresenting a man in a scarlet coat with a wig, and the other alady with powdered and curled hair holding a rose in her hand, each ofthem being surrounded by a large wreath of willow branches. Bothportraits had many holes in them, because the baron\'s sons used thetwo old people as targets for their crossbows. They represented thecounsellor and his wife, from whom the whole family descended. \\"Butthey did not properly belong to our family,\\" said one of the boys; \\"hewas a pedlar and she kept the geese. They were not like papa andmamma.\\" The portraits were old lumber, and \\"everything in its rightplace.\\" That was why the great-grandparents had been hung up in thepassage leading to the servants\' rooms.    The son of the village pastor was tutor at the mansion. One day hewent for a walk across the fields with his young pupils and theirelder sister, who had lately been confirmed. They walked along theroad which passed by the old willow tree, and while they were on theroad she picked a bunch of field-flowers. \\"Everything in the rightplace,\\" and indeed the bunch looked very beautiful. At the same timeshe listened to all that was said, and she very much liked to hear thepastor\'s son speak about the elements and of the great men and womenin history. She had a healthy mind, noble in thought and deed, andwith a heart full of love for everything that God had created. Theystopped at the old willow tree, as the youngest of the baron\'s sonswished very much to have a flute from it, such as had been cut for himfrom other willow trees; the pastor\'s son broke a branch off. \\"Oh,pray do not do it!\\" said the young lady; but it was already done.\\"That is our famous old tree. I love it very much. They often laugh atme at home about it, but that does not matter. There is a storyattached to this tree.\\" And now she told him all that we alreadyknow about the tree- the old mansion, the pedlar and the goose-girlwho had met there for the first time, and had become the ancestorsof the noble family to which the young lady belonged.    \\"They did not like to be knighted, the good old people,\\" she said;\\"their motto was \'everything in the right place,\' and it would notbe right, they thought, to purchase a title for money. My grandfather,the first baron, was their son. They say he was a very learned man,a great favourite with the princes and princesses, and was invitedto all court festivities. The others at home love him best; but, Ido not know why, there seemed to me to be something about the oldcouple that attracts my heart! How homely, how patriarchal, it musthave been in the old mansion, where the mistress sat at thespinning-wheel with her maids, while her husband read aloud out of theBible!\\"    \\"They must have been excellent, sensible people,\\" said thepastor\'s son. And with this the conversation turned naturally tonoblemen and commoners; from the manner in which the tutor spoke aboutthe significance of being noble, it seemed almost as if he did notbelong to a commoner\'s family.    \\"It is good fortune to be of a family who have distinguishedthemselves, and to possess as it were a spur in oneself to advanceto all that is good. It is a splendid thing to belong to a noblefamily, whose name serves as a card of admission to the highestcircles. Nobility is a distinction; it is a gold coin that bears thestamp of its own value. It is the fallacy of the time, and manypoets express it, to say that all that is noble is bad and stupid, andthat, on the contrary, the lower one goes among the poor, the morebrilliant virtues one finds. I do not share this opinion, for it iswrong. In the upper classes one sees many touchingly beautiful traits;my own mother has told me of such, and I could mention several. Oneday she was visiting a nobleman\'s house in town; my grandmother, Ibelieve, had been the lady\'s nurse when she was a child. My mother andthe nobleman were alone in the room, when he suddenly noticed an oldwoman on crutches come limping into the courtyard; she came everySunday to carry a gift away with her.    \\"\'There is the poor old woman,\' said the nobleman; \'it is sodifficult for her to walk.\'    \\"My mother had hardly understood what he said before hedisappeared from the room, and went downstairs, in order to save herthe troublesome walk for the gift she came to fetch. Of course this isonly a little incident, but it has its good sound like the poorwidow\'s two mites in the Bible, the sound which echoes in the depth ofevery human heart; and this is what the poet ought to show and pointout- more especially in our own time he ought to sing of this; it doesgood, it mitigates and reconciles! But when a man, simply because heis of noble birth and possesses a genealogy, stands on his hind legsand neighs in the street like an Arabian horse, and says when acommoner has been in a room: \'Some people from the street have beenhere,\' there nobility is decaying; it has become a mask of the kindthat Thespis created, and it is amusing when such a person isexposed in satire.\\"    Such was the tutor\'s speech; it was a little long, but while hedelivered it he had finished cutting the flute.    There was a large party at the mansion; many guests from theneighbourhood and from the capital had arrived. There were ladies withtasteful and with tasteless dresses; the big hall was quite crowdedwith people. The clergymen stood humbly together in a corner, andlooked as if they were preparing for a funeral, but it was a festival-only the amusement had not yet begun. A great concert was to takeplace, and that is why the baron\'s young son had brought his willowflute with him; but he could not make it sound, nor could hisfather, and therefore the flute was good for nothing.    There was music and songs of the kind which delight most thosethat perform them; otherwise quite charming!    \\"Are you an artist?\\" said a cavalier, the son of his father;\\"you play on the flute, you have made it yourself; it is genius thatrules- the place of honour is due to you.\\"    \\"Certainly not! I only advance with the time, and that of courseone can\'t help.\\"    \\"I hope you will delight us all with the little instrument- willyou not?\\" Thus saying he handed to the tutor the flute which hadbeen cut from the willow tree by the pool; and then announced in aloud voice that the tutor wished to perform a solo on the flute.They wished to tease him- that was evident, and therefore the tutordeclined to play, although he could do so very well. They urged andrequested him, however, so long, that at last he took up the flute andplaced it to his lips.    That was a marvellous flute! Its sound was as thrilling as thewhistle of a steam engine; in fact it was much stronger, for itsounded and was heard in the yard, in the garden, in the wood, andmany miles round in the country; at the same time a storm rose androared; \\"Everything in the right place.\\" And with this the baron, asif carried by the wind, flew out of the hall straight into theshepherd\'s cottage, and the shepherd flew- not into the hall,thither he could not come- but into the servants\' hall, among thesmart footmen who were striding about in silk stockings; these haughtymenials looked horror-struck that such a person ventured to sit attable with them. But in the hall the baron\'s daughter flew to theplace of honour at the end of the table- she was worthy to sitthere; the pastor\'s son had the seat next to her; the two sat there asif they were a bridal pair. An old Count, belonging to one of theoldest families of the country, remained untouched in his place ofhonour; the flute was just, and it is one\'s duty to be so. Thesharp-tongued cavalier who had caused the flute to be played, andwho was the child of his parents, flew headlong into the fowl-house,but not he alone.    The flute was heard at the distance of a mile, and strangeevents took place. A rich banker\'s family, who were driving in a coachand four, were blown out of it, and could not even find room behind itwith their footmen. Two rich farmers who had in our days shot uphigher than their own corn-fields, were flung into the ditch; it was adangerous flute. Fortunately it burst at the first sound, and that wasa good thing, for then it was put back into its owner\'s pocket- \\"itsright place.\\"    The next day, nobody spoke a word about what had taken place; thusoriginated the phrase, \\"to pocket the flute.\\" Everything was againin its usual order, except that the two old pictures of the peddlarand the goose-girl were hanging in the banqueting-hall. There theywere on the wall as if blown up there; and as a real expert saidthat they were painted by a master\'s hand, they remained there andwere restored. \\"Everything in the right place,\\" and to this it willcome. Eternity is long, much longer indeed than this story.                            THE END.","source":"@site/learn/EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PLACE.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PLACE","permalink":"/learn/EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT

She wears a dress of heavy, rich silk, with large flowers workedon it; and it rustles when she moves. And then she can tell the mostwonderful stories. Grandmother knows a great deal, for she was alivebefore father and mother- that\'s quite certain. She has a hymn-bookwith large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book,between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry; it is not sopretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet shesmiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes. \\"Iwonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old bookthat way? Do you know?\\" Why, when grandmother\'s tears fall upon therose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and fills the roomwith its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist, and all aroundher is the glorious green wood, where in summer the sunlight streamsthrough thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is young again, acharming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy cheeks, fair,bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes, thosemild, saintly eyes, are the same,- they have been left to grandmother.At her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose andshe smiles. Grandmother cannot smile like that now. Yes, she issmiling at the memory of that day, and many thoughts and recollectionsof the past; but the handsome young man is gone, and the rose haswithered in the old book, and grandmother is sitting there, again anold woman, looking down upon the withered rose in the book.    Grandmother is dead now. She had been sitting in her arm-chair,telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was finished, shesaid she was tired, and leaned her head back to sleep awhile. We couldhear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually it became quieterand calmer, and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace. Itwas as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine. She smiled once more, andthen people said she was dead. She was laid in a black coffin, lookingmild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, thoughher eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hairlooked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile.We did not feel at all afraid to look at the corpse of her who hadbeen such a dear, good grandmother. The hymn-book, in which the rosestill lay, was placed under her head, for so she had wished it; andthen they buried grandmother.    On the grave, close by the churchyard wall, they planted arose-tree; it was soon full of roses, and the nightingale sat amongthe flowers, and sang over the grave. From the organ in the churchsounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms, which werewritten in the old book under the head of the dead one.    The moon shone down upon the grave, but the dead was not there;every child could go safely, even at night, and pluck a rose fromthe tree by the churchyard wall. The dead know more than we do who areliving. They know what a terror would come upon us if such a strangething were to happen, as the appearance of a dead person among us.They are better off than we are; the dead return no more. The earthhas been heaped on the coffin, and it is earth only that lies withinit. The leaves of the hymn-book are dust; and the rose, with all itsrecollections, has crumbled to dust also. But over the grave freshroses bloom, the nightingale sings, and the organ sounds and therestill lives a remembrance of old grandmother, with the loving,gentle eyes that always looked young. Eyes can never die. Ours willonce again behold dear grandmother, young and beautiful as when, forthe first time, she kissed the fresh, red rose, that is now dust inthe grave.

CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                                 HOLGER DANSKE                           by Hans Christian Andersen    IN Denmark there stands an old castle named Kronenburg, close bythe Sound of Elsinore, where large ships, both English, Russian, andPrussian, pass by hundreds every day. And they salute the old castlewith cannons, \\"Boom, boom,\\" which is as if they said, \\"Good-day.\\"And the cannons of the old castle answer \\"Boom,\\" which means \\"Manythanks.\\" In winter no ships sail by, for the whole Sound is coveredwith ice as far as the Swedish coast, and has quite the appearanceof a high-road. The Danish and the Swedish flags wave, and Danes andSwedes say, \\"Good-day,\\" and \\"Thank you\\" to each other, not withcannons, but with a friendly shake of the hand; and they exchangewhite bread and biscuits with each other, because foreign articlestaste the best.    But the most beautiful sight of all is the old castle ofKronenburg, where Holger Danske sits in the deep, dark cellar, intowhich no one goes. He is clad in iron and steel, and rests his head onhis strong arm; his long beard hangs down upon the marble table,into which it has become firmly rooted; he sleeps and dreams, but inhis dreams he sees everything that happens in Denmark. On eachChristmas-eve an angel comes to him and tells him that all he hasdreamed is true, and that he may go to sleep again in peace, asDenmark is not yet in any real danger; but should danger ever come,then Holger Danske will rouse himself, and the table will burstasunder as he draws out his beard. Then he will come forth in hisstrength, and strike a blow that shall sound in all the countries ofthe world.    An old grandfather sat and told his little grandson all this aboutHolger Danske, and the boy knew that what his grandfather told himmust be true. As the old man related this story, he was carving animage in wood to represent Holger Danske, to be fastened to the prowof a ship; for the old grandfather was a carver in wood, that is,one who carved figures for the heads of ships, according to thenames given to them. And now he had carved Holger Danske, who stoodthere erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand hisbroad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the Danish arms.The old grandfather told the little boy a great deal about Danishmen and women who had distinguished themselves in olden times, so thathe fancied he knew as much even as Holger Danske himself, who, afterall, could only dream; and when the little fellow went to bed, hethought so much about it that he actually pressed his chin against thecounterpane, and imagined that he had a long beard which had becomerooted to it. But the old grandfather remained sitting at his work andcarving away at the last part of it, which was the Danish arms. Andwhen he had finished he looked at the whole figure, and thought of allhe had heard and read, and what he had that evening related to hislittle grandson. Then he nodded his head, wiped his spectacles and putthem on, and said, \\"Ah, yes; Holger Danske will not appear in mylifetime, but the boy who is in bed there may very likely live tosee him when the event really comes to pass.\\" And the oldgrandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at Holger Danske, themore satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him. Itseemed to glow with the color of life; the armor glittered like ironand steel. The hearts in the Danish arms grew more and more red; whilethe lions, with gold crowns on their heads, were leaping up. \\"Thatis the most beautiful coat of arms in the world,\\" said the old man.\\"The lions represent strength; and the hearts, gentleness and love.\\"And as he gazed on the uppermost lion, he thought of King Canute,who chained great England to Denmark\'s throne; and he looked at thesecond lion, and thought of Waldemar, who untied Denmark and conqueredthe Vandals. The third lion reminded him of Margaret, who unitedDenmark, Sweden, and Norway. But when he gazed at the red hearts,their colors glowed more deeply, even as flames, and his memoryfollowed each in turn. The first led him to a dark, narrow prison,in which sat a prisoner, a beautiful woman, daughter of Christianthe Fourth, Eleanor Ulfeld, and the flame became a rose on herbosom, and its blossoms were not more pure than the heart of thisnoblest and best of all Danish women. \\"Ah, yes; that is indeed a nobleheart in the Danish arms,\\" said the grandfather. and his spiritfollowed the second flame, which carried him out to sea, where cannonsroared and the ships lay shrouded in smoke, and the flaming heartattached itself to the breast of Hvitfeldt in the form of the ribbonof an order, as he blew himself and his ship into the air in orderto save the fleet. And the third flame led him to Greenland\'s wretchedhuts, where the preacher, Hans Egede, ruled with love in every wordand action. The flame was as a star on his breast, and added anotherheart to the Danish arms. And as the old grandfather\'s spirit followedthe next hovering flame, he knew whither it would lead him. In apeasant woman\'s humble room stood Frederick the Sixth, writing hisname with chalk on the beam. The flame trembled on his breast and inhis heart, and it was in the peasant\'s room that his heart becameone for the Danish arms. The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for hehad known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blueeyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remainedfor some time silent. Then his daughter came to him and said it wasgetting late, that he ought to rest for a while, and that the supperwas on the table.    \\"What you have been carving is very beautiful, grandfather,\\"said she. \\"Holger Danske and the old coat of arms; it seems to me asif I have seen the face somewhere.\\"    \\"No, that is impossible,\\" replied the old grandfather; \\"but I haveseen it, and I have tried to carve it in wood, as I have retained itin my memory. It was a long time ago, while the English fleet lay inthe roads, on the second of April, when we showed that we were true,ancient Danes. I was on board the Denmark, in Steene Bille\'s squadron;I had a man by my side whom even the cannon balls seemed to fear. Hesung old songs in a merry voice, and fired and fought as if he weresomething more than a man. I still remember his face, but fromwhence he came, or whither he went, I know not; no one knows. I haveoften thought it might have been Holger Danske himself, who had swamdown to us from Kronenburg to help us in the hour of danger. Thatwas my idea, and there stands his likeness.\\"    The wooden figure threw a gigantic shadow on the wall, and even onpart of the ceiling; it seemed as if the real Holger Danske stoodbehind it, for the shadow moved; but this was no doubt caused by theflame of the lamp not burning steadily. Then the daughter-in-lawkissed the old grandfather, and led him to a large arm-chair by thetable; and she, and her husband, who was the son of the old man andthe father of the little boy who lay in bed, sat down to supper withhim. And the old grandfather talked of the Danish lions and the Danishhearts, emblems of strength and gentleness, and explained quiteclearly that there is another strength than that which lies in asword, and he pointed to a shelf where lay a number of old books,and amongst them a collection of Holberg\'s plays, which are muchread and are so clever and amusing that it is easy to fancy we haveknown the people of those days, who are described in them.    \\"He knew how to fight also,\\" said the old man; \\"for he lashedthe follies and prejudices of people during his whole life.\\"    Then the grandfather nodded to a place above the looking-glass,where hung an almanac, with a representation of the Round Tower uponit, and said \\"Tycho Brahe was another of those who used a sword, butnot one to cut into the flesh and bone, but to make the way of thestars of heaven clear, and plain to be understood. And then he whosefather belonged to my calling,- yes, he, the son of the oldimage-carver, he whom we ourselves have seen, with his silvery locksand his broad shoulders, whose name is known in all lands;- yes, hewas a sculptor, while I am only a carver. Holger Danske can appearin marble, so that people in all countries of the world may hear ofthe strength of Denmark. Now let us drink the health of Bertel.\\"    But the little boy in bed saw plainly the old castle ofKronenburg, and the Sound of Elsinore, and Holger Danske, far downin the cellar, with his beard rooted to the table, and dreaming ofeverything that was passing above him.    And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in which theimage-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he nodded inhis dream, saying, \\"Ah, yes, remember me, you Danish people, keep mein your memory, I will come to you in the hour of need.\\"    The bright morning light shone over Kronenburg, and the windbrought the sound of the hunting-horn across from the neighboringshores. The ships sailed by and saluted the castle with the boom ofthe cannon, and Kronenburg returned the salute, \\"Boom, boom.\\" Butthe roaring cannons did not awake Holger Danske, for they meant only\\"Good morning,\\" and \\"Thank you.\\" They must fire in another fashionbefore he awakes; but wake he will, for there is energy yet inHolger Danske.

Deep in the shady sadness of a vale        Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,        Far from the fiery noon, and eve\'s one star,        Sat gray-hair\'d Saturn, quiet as a stone,        Still as the silence round about his lair;        Forest on forest hung about his head        Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,        Not so much life as on a summer\'s day        Robs not one light seed from the feather\'d grass,        But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.        A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more        By reason of his fallen divinity        Spreading a shade        How beautiful, if sorrow had not made        Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty\'s self.        There was a listening fear in her regard,        As if calamity had but begun;        As if the vanward clouds of evil days        Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear        Was with its stored thunder labouring up.        One hand she press\'d upon that aching spot        Where beats the human heart, as if just there,        Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain        Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue        Would come in these like accents; O how frail        To that large utterance of the early Gods!       \\"Saturn, look up!- though wherefore, poor old King?       \\"I have no comfort for thee, no not one- O thoughtless, why did I       \\"Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?       \\"Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?       \\"Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.\\"          As when, upon a tranced summer-night,        Those green-rob\'d senators of mighty woods,        Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,        Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,        Save from one gradual solitary gust        Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,        As if the ebbing air had but one wave;        So came these words and went; the while in tears        She touch\'d her fair large forehead to the ground,        Just where her falling hair might be outspread        A soft and silken mat for Saturn\'s feet.        One moon, with alteration slow, had shed        Her silver seasons four upon the night,        And still these two were postured motionless,        Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;        The frozen God still couchant on the earth,        And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet       \\"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,       \\"Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;       \\"Look up, and let me see our doom in it;       \\"Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape       \\"Is Saturn\'s; tell me, if thou hear\'st the voice       \\"Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,       \\"Naked and bare of its great diadem,       \\"Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power       \\"To make me desolate? whence came the strength?       \\"How was it nurtur\'d to such bursting forth,       \\"While Fate seem\'d strangled in my nervous grasp?       \\"But it is so; and I am smother\'d up,       \\"And buried from all godlike exercise       \\"Of influence benign on planets pale,       \\"Of admonitions to the winds and seas,       \\"Of peaceful sway above man\'s harvesting,       \\"And all those acts which Deity supreme       \\"Doth ease its heart of love in.- I am gone       \\"Away from my own bosom space starr\'d, and lorn of light;       \\"Space region\'d with life-air; and barren void;       \\"Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.-       \\"Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest       \\"A certain shape or shadow, making way       \\"With wings or chariot fierce to repossess       \\"A heaven he lost erewhile       \\"Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?\\"          This passion lifted him upon his feet,        And made his hands to struggle in the air,        His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,        His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.        He stood, and heard not Thea\'s sobbing deep;        A little time, and then again he snatch\'d        Utterance thus.- \\"But cannot I create?       \\"Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth       \\"Another world, another universe,       \\"To overbear and crumble this to naught?       \\"Where is another chaos? Where?\\"- That word        Found way unto Olympus, and made quake        The rebel three.- Thea was startled up,        And in her bearing was a sort of hope,        As thus she quick-voic\'d spake, yet full of awe.       \\"This cheers our fallen house        He follow\'d, and she turn\'d to lead the way        Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist        Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.          Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,        More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,        Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe        For as among us mortals omens drear        Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he-        Not at dog\'s howl, or gloom-bird\'s hated screech,        Or the familiar visiting of one        Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,        Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;        But horrors, portion\'d to a giant nerve,        Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright        Bastion\'d with pyramids of glowing gold,        And touch\'d with shade of bronzed obelisks,        Glar\'d a blood-red through all its thousand courts,        Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;        And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds        Flush\'d angerly        And so, when harbour\'d in the sleepy west,        After the full completion of fair day,-        For rest divine upon exalted couch        And slumber in the arms of melody,        He pac\'d away the pleasant hours of ease        With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;        While far within each aisle and deep recess,        His winged minions in close clusters stood,        Amaz\'d and full of fear; like anxious men        Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,        When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.        Even now, while Saturn, rous\'d from icy trance,        Went step for step with Thea through the woods,        Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,        Came slope upon the threshold of the west;        Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope        In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,        Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet        And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;        And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,        In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,        That inlet to severe magnificence        Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.          He enter\'d, but he enter\'d full of wrath;        His flaming robes stream\'d out beyond his heels,        And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,        That scar\'d away the meek ethereal Hours        And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,        From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,        Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,        And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,        Until he reach\'d the great main cupola;        There standing fierce beneath, he stamped his foot,        And from the basement deep to the high towers        Jarr\'d his own golden region; and before        The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas\'d,        His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,        To this result        Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge        Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone,        Their wisdom long since fled.- Two wings this orb        Possess\'d for glory, two fair argent wings,        Ever exalted at the God\'s approach- No, though a primeval God       \\"Of these new-form\'d art thou, oh brightest child!       \\"Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!       \\"There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion       \\"Of son against his sire. I saw him fall,       \\"I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!       \\"To me his arms were spread, to me his voice       \\"Found way from forth the thunders round his head!       \\"Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.       \\"Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is       \\"Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;       \\"Actions of rage and passion; even as       \\"I see them, on the mortal world beneath,       \\"In men who die.- This is the grief, O Son!       \\"Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!       \\"Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,       \\"As thou canst move about, an evident God;       \\"And canst oppose to each malignant hour       \\"Ethereal presence-       \\"But thou canst.- Be thou therefore in the van       \\"Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow\'s barb       \\"Before the tense string murmur.- To the earth!       \\"For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.       \\"Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,       \\"And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.\\"-        Ere half this region-whisper had come down,        Hyperion arose, and on the stars        Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide        Until it ceas\'d; and still he kept them wide        Some chain\'d in torture, and some wandering.        Coeus, and Gyges, and Briareus,        Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,        With many more, the brawniest in assault,        Were pent in regions of laborious breath;        Dungeon\'d in opaque element, to keep        Their clenched teeth still clench\'d, and all their limbs        Lock\'d up like veins of metal, crampt and screw\'d;        Without a motion, save of their big hearts        Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls\'d        With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.        Mnemosyne was straying in the world;        Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered;        And many else were free to roam abroad,        But for the main, here found they covert drear.        Scarce images of life, one here, one there,        Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque        Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,        When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,        In dull November, and their chancel vault,        The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.        Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave        Or word, or look, or action of despair.        Creus was one; his ponderous iron mace        Lay by him, and a shatter\'d rib of rock        Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.        Iapetus another; in his grasp,        A serpent\'s plashy neck; its barbed tongue        Squeez\'d from the gorge, and all its uncurl\'d length        Dead; and because the creature could not spit        Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.        Next Cottus        More thought than woe was in her dusky face,        For she was prophesying of her glory;        And in her wide imagination stood        Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,        By Oxus or in Ganges\' sacred isles.        Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,        So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk        Shed from the broadest of her elephants.        Above her, on a crag\'s uneasy shelve,        Upon his elbow rais\'d, all prostrate else,        Shadow\'d Enceladus; once tame and mild        As grazing ox unworried in the meads;        Now tiger-passion\'d, lion-thoughted, wroth,        He meditated, plotted, and even now        Was hurling mountains in that second war,        Not long delay\'d, that scar\'d the younger Gods        To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.        Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone        Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour\'d close        Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap        Sobb\'d Clymene among her tangled hair.        In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet        Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;        No shape distinguishable, more than when        Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds        Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms        Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,        And sidelong fix\'d her eye on Saturn\'s face so that Thea,        Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass        First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.          As with us mortal men, the laden heart        Is persecuted more, and fever\'d more,        When it is nighing to the mournful house        Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;        So Saturn, as he walk\'d into the midst,        Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,        But that he met Enceladus\'s eye,        Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once        Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,       \\"Titans, behold your God!\\" at which some groan\'d;        Some started on their feet; some also shouted;        Some wept, some wail\'d, all bow\'d with reverence;        And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,        Show\'d her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,        Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.        There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines        When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise        Among immortals when a God gives sign,        With hushing finger, how he means to load        His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought,        With thunder, and with music, and with pomp        Which, when it ceases in this mountain\'d world,        No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,        Among these fallen, Saturn\'s voice therefrom        Grew up like organ, that begins anew        Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,        Leave the dinn\'d air vibrating silverly.        Thus grew it up- \\"Not in my own sad breast,       \\"Which is its own great judge and searcher out,       \\"Can I find reason why ye should be thus- Ah, infirm!       \\"Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent       \\"Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,-       \\"At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling       \\"One against one, or two, or three, or all       \\"Each several one against the other three,       \\"As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods       \\"Drown both, and press them both against earth\'s face,       \\"Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath       \\"Unhinges the poor world;- not in that strife,       \\"Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,       \\"Can I find reason why ye should be thus       \\"Shall I say \'Crouch!\'- Ye groan. What can I then?       \\"O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!       \\"What can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,       \\"How we can war, how engine our great wrath!       \\"O speak your counsel now, for Saturn\'s ear       \\"Is all a-hunger\'d. Thou, Oceanus,       \\"Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face       \\"I see, astonied, that severe content       \\"Which comes of thought and musing       \\"And in the proof much comfort will I give,       \\"If ye will take that comfort in its truth.       \\"We fall by course of Nature\'s law, not force       \\"Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou       \\"Hast sifted well the atom-universe;       \\"But for this reason, that thou art the King,       \\"And only blind from sheer supremacy,       \\"One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,       \\"Through which I wandered to eternal truth.       \\"And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,       \\"So art thou not the last; it cannot be       \\"Then thou first born, and we the giant race,       \\"Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.       \\"Now comes the pain of truth, to whom \'tis pain;       \\"O folly! for to bear all naked truths,       \\"And to envisage circumstance, all calm,       \\"That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!       \\"As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far       \\"Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;       \\"And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth       \\"In form and shape compact and beautiful,       \\"In will, in action free, companionship,       \\"And thousand other signs of purer life;       \\"So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,       \\"A power more strong in beauty, born of us       \\"And fated to excel us, as we pass       \\"In glory that old Darkness       \\"Yea, by that law, another race may drive       \\"Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.       \\"Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas,       \\"My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?       \\"Have ye beheld his chariot, foam\'d along       \\"By noble winged creatures he hath made?       \\"I saw him on the calmed waters scud,       \\"With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,       \\"That it enforc\'d me to bid sad farewell       \\"To all my empire       \\"O Father, I am here the simplest voice,       \\"And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,       \\"And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,       \\"There to remain for ever, as I fear       \\"And then another, then another strain,       \\"Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,       \\"With music wing\'d instead of silent plumes,       \\"To hover round my head, and make me sick       \\"Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,       \\"And I was stopping up my frantic ears,       \\"When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,       \\"A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,       \\"And still it cried, \'Apollo! young Apollo!\'       \\"\'The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!\'       \\"I fled, it follow\'d me, and cried \'Apollo!\'       \\"O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt       \\"Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,       \\"Ye would not call this too indulged tongue       \\"Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard.\\"          So far her voice flow\'d on, like timorous brook        That, lingering along a pebbled coast,        Doth fear to meet the sea        The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves        In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,        Came booming thus, while still upon his arm        He lean\'d; not rising, from supreme contempt.       \\"Or shall we listen to the over-wise,       \\"Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?       \\"Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all       \\"That rebel Jove\'s whole armoury were spent,       \\"Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,       \\"Could agonize me more than baby-words       \\"In midst of this dethronement horrible.       \\"Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.       \\"Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?       \\"Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?       \\"Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the Waves,       \\"Thy scalding in the seas?

It was Hyperion        Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon\'s harp        He utter\'d, while his hands contemplative        He press\'d together, and in silence stood.        Despondence seiz\'d again the fallen Gods        At sight of the dejected King of Day,        And many hid their faces from the light        A solitary sorrow best befits        Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.        Leave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find        Many a fallen old Divinity        Wandering in vain about bewildered shores.        Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp,        And not a wind of heaven but will breathe        In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;        For lo! \'tis for the Father of all verse.        Flush every thing that hath a vermeil hue,        Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,        And let the clouds of even and of morn        Float in voluptuous fleeces o\'er the hills;        Let the red wine within the goblet boil,        Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp\'d shells,        On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn        Through all their labyrinths; and let the maid        Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris\'d.        Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades,        Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,        And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,        In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,        And hazels thick, dark-stemm\'d beneath the shade       \\"How cam\'st thou over the unfooted sea?       \\"Or hath that antique mien and robed form       \\"Mov\'d in these vales invisible till now?       \\"Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o\'er       \\"The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone       \\"In cool mid-forest.

STORY OF RIMINI.        I stood tip-toe upon a little hill,        The air was cooling, and so very still,        That the sweet buds which with a modest pride        Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,        Their scantly leav\'d, and finely tapering stems,        Had not yet lost those starry diadems        Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.        The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,        And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept        On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept        A little noiseless noise among the leaves,        Born of the very sigh that silence heaves I was light-hearted,        And many pleasures to my vision started;        So I straightway began to pluck a posey        Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy.        A bush of May flowers with the bees about them;        Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;        And let a lush laburnum oversweep them,        And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them        Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets,        That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.        A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined,        And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind        Upon their summer thrones; there too should be        The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,        That with a score of light green brethren shoots        From the quaint mossiness of aged roots it may haply mourn        That such fair clusters should be rudely torn        From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly        By infant hands, left on the path to die.        Open afresh your round of starry folds,        Ye ardent marigolds!        Dry up the moisture from your golden lids,        For great Apollo bids        That in these days your praises should be sung        On many harps, which he has lately strung;        And when again your dewiness he kisses,        Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses        With wings of gentle flush o\'er delicate white,        And taper fingers catching at all things,        To bind them all about with tiny rings.        Linger awhile upon some bending planks        That lean against a streamlet\'s rushy banks,        And watch intently Nature\'s gentle doings blades of grass        Slowly across the chequer\'d shadows pass.        Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach        To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach        A natural sermon o\'er their pebbly beds;        Where swarms of minnows show their little heads,        Staying their wavy bodies \'gainst the streams,        To taste the luxury of sunny beams        Temper\'d with coolness. How they ever wrestle        With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle        Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand.        If you but scantily hold out the hand,        That very instant not one will remain;        But turn your eye, and they are there again.        The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,        And cool themselves among the em\'rald tresses;        The while they cool themselves, they freshness give,        And moisture, that the bowery green may live        Or perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings,        Pausing upon their yellow flutterings.        Were I in such a place, I sure should pray        That naught less sweet, might call my thoughts away,        Than the soft rustle of a maiden\'s gown        Fanning away the dandelion\'s down;        Than the light music of her nimble toes        Patting against the sorrel as she goes.        How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught        Playing in all her innocence of thought.        O let me lead her gently o\'er the brook,        Watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look;        O let me for one moment touch her wrist;        Let me one moment to her breathing list;        And as she leaves me may she often turn        Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne.        What next? A tuft of evening primroses,        O\'er which the mind may hover till it dozes;        O\'er which it well might take a pleasant sleep,        But that \'tis ever startled by the leap        Of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting        Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;        Or by the moon lifting her silver rim        Above a cloud, and with a gradual swim        Coming into the blue with all her light.        O Maker of sweet poets, dear delight        Of this fair world, and all its gentle livers;        Spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,        Mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,        Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams,        Lover of loneliness, and wandering,        Of upcast eye, and tender pondering!        Thee must I praise above all other glories        That smile us on to tell delightful stories.        For what has made the sage or poet write        But the fair paradise of Nature\'s light?        In the calm grandeur of a sober line,        We see the waving of the mountain pine;        And when a tale is beautifully staid,        We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade        Fair dewy roses brush against our faces,        And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases;        O\'er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar,        And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire;        While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles        Charms us at once away from all our troubles        The silver lamp,- the ravishment,- the wonder-        The darkness,- loneliness,- the fearful thunder;        Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,        To bow for gratitude before Jove\'s throne.        So did he feel, who pull\'d the boughs aside,        That we might look into a forest wide,        To catch a glimpse of Fauns, and Dryades        Coming with softest rustle through the trees;        And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,        Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet        Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;        But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love.        So while the poet stood in this sweet spot,        Some fainter gleamings o\'er his fancy shot;        Nor was it long ere he had told the tale        Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo\'s bale.        Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew        That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,        That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,        Coming ever to bless        The wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing        Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing        From out the middle air, from flowery nests,        And from the pillowy silkiness that rests        Full in the speculation of the stars.        Ah! surely he had burst our mortal bars;        Into some wond\'rous region he had gone,        To search for thee, divine Endymion!        He was a Poet, sure a lover too,        Who stood on Latmus\' top, what time there blew        Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below;        And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow        A hymn from Dian\'s temple; while upswelling,        The incense went to her own starry dwelling.        But though her face was clear as infant\'s eyes,        Though she stood smiling o\'er the sacrifice,        The Poet wept at her so piteous fate,        Wept that such beauty should be desolate        And lovely women were as fair and warm,        As Venus looking sideways in alarm.        The breezes were ethereal, and pure,        And crept through half-closed lattices to cure        The languid sick; it cool\'d their fever\'d sleep,        And soothed them into slumbers full and deep.        Soon they awoke clear eyed        And springing up, they met the wond\'ring sight        Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;        Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,        And on their placid foreheads part the hair.        Young men, and maidens at each other gaz\'d        With hands held back, and motionless, amaz\'d        To see the brightness in each other\'s eyes;        And so they stood, fill\'d with a sweet surprise,        Until their tongues were loos\'d in poesy.        Therefore no lover did of anguish die        Was there a poet born?- but now no more,        My wand\'ring spirit must no further soar.-                        THE END.","source":"@site/learn/I STOOD TIP-TOE UPON A LITTLE HILL.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/I STOOD TIP-TOE UPON A LITTLE HILL","permalink":"/learn/I STOOD TIP-TOE UPON A LITTLE HILL","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/I STOOD TIP-TOE UPON A LITTLE HILL.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"I SAY NO","permalink":"/learn/I SAY NO"},"next":{"title":"I and My Chimney","permalink":"/learn/I and My Chimney"}},{"id":"IB AND LITTLE CHRISTINA","title":"IB AND LITTLE CHRISTINA","description":"1872                     FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                            IB AND LITTLE CHRISTINA                           by Hans Christian Andersen    IN the forest that extends from the banks of the Gudenau, in NorthJutland, a long way into the country, and not far from the clearstream, rises a great ridge of land, which stretches through thewood like a wall. Westward of this ridge, and not far from theriver, stands a farmhouse, surrounded by such poor land that the sandysoil shows itself between the scanty ears of rye and wheat whichgrow in it. Some years have passed since the people who lived herecultivated these fields; they kept three sheep, a pig, and two oxen;in fact they maintained themselves very well, they had quite enough tolive upon, as people generally have who are content with their lot.They even could have afforded to keep two horses, but it was asaying among the farmers in those parts, \\"The horse eats himselfup;\\" that is to say, he eats as much as he earns. Jeppe Janscultivated his fields in summer, and in the winter he made woodenshoes. He also had an assistant, a lad who understood as well as hehimself did how to make wooden shoes strong, but light, and in thefashion. They carved shoes and spoons, which paid well; therefore noone could justly call Jeppe Jans and his family poor people. LittleIb, a boy of seven years old and the only child, would sit by,watching the workmen, or cutting a stick, and sometimes his fingerinstead of the stick. But one day Ib succeeded so well in hiscarving that he made two pieces of wood look really like two littlewooden shoes, and he determined to give them as a present to LittleChristina.    \\"And who was Little Christina?\\" She was the boatman\'s daughter,graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman; had she beendressed differently, no one would have believed that she lived in ahut on the neighboring heath with her father. He was a widower, andearned his living by carrying firewood in his large boat from theforest to the eel-pond and eel-weir, on the estate of Silkborg, andsometimes even to the distant town of Randers. There was no oneunder whose care he could leave Little Christina; so she was almostalways with him in his boat, or playing in the wood among theblossoming heath, or picking the ripe wild berries. Sometimes, whenher father had to go as far as the town, he would take LittleChristina, who was a year younger than Ib, across the heath to thecottage of Jeppe Jans, and leave her there. Ib and Christina agreedtogether in everything; they divided their bread and berries when theywere hungry; they were partners in digging their little gardens;they ran, and crept, and played about everywhere. Once they wandered along way into the forest, and even ventured together to climb the highridge. Another time they found a few snipes\' eggs in the wood, whichwas a great event. Ib had never been on the heath where Christina\'sfather lived, nor on the river; but at last came an opportunity.Christina\'s father invited him to go for a sail in his boat; and theevening before, he accompanied the boatman across the heath to hishouse. The next morning early, the two children were placed on the topof a high pile of firewood in the boat, and sat eating bread andwild strawberries, while Christina\'s father and his man drove the boatforward with poles. They floated on swiftly, for the tide was in theirfavor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its course;sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and water-plants, yetthere was always room for them to pass out, although the old treesoverhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches,as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show theirknotty, naked arms. Old alder-trees, whose roots were loosened fromthe banks, clung with their fibres to the bottom of the stream, andthe tops of the branches above the water looked like little woodyislands. The water-lilies waved themselves to and fro on the river,everything made the excursion beautiful, and at last they came tothe great eel-weir, where the water rushed through the flood-gates;and the children thought this a beautiful sight. In those days therewas no factory nor any town house, nothing but the great farm, withits scanty-bearing fields, in which could be seen a few herd ofcattle, and one or two farm laborers. The rushing of the water throughthe sluices, and the scream of the wild ducks, were almost the onlysigns of active life at Silkborg. After the firewood had beenunloaded, Christina\'s father bought a whole bundle of eels and asucking-pig, which were all placed in a basket in the stern of theboat. Then they returned again up the stream; and as the wind wasfavorable, two sails were hoisted, which carried the boat on as wellas if two horses had been harnessed to it. As they sailed on, theycame by chance to the place where the boatman\'s assistant lived, ata little distance from the bank of the river. The boat was moored; andthe two men, after desiring the children to sit still, both went onshore. they obeyed this order for a very short time, and then forgotit altogether. First they peeped into the basket containing the eelsand the sucking-pig; then they must needs pull out the pig and take itin their hands, and feel it, and touch it; and as they both wantedto hold it at the same time, the consequence was that they let it fallinto the water, and the pig sailed away with the stream.    Here was a terrible disaster. Ib jumped ashore, and ran a littledistance from the boat.    \\"Oh, take me with you,\\" cried Christina; and she sprang after him.In a few minutes they found themselves deep in a thicket, and could nolonger see the boat or the shore. They ran on a little farther, andthen Christina fell down, and began to cry.    Ib helped her up, and said, \\"Never mind; follow me. Yonder isthe house.\\" But the house was not yonder; and they wandered stillfarther, over the dry rustling leaves of the last year, and treadingon fallen branches that crackled under their little feet; then theyheard a loud, piercing cry, and they stood still to listen.Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was anugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in thethickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries,in wonderful quantities. They looked so inviting that the childrencould not help stopping; and they remained there so long eating,that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice.    Presently they heard the frightful scream again, and Christinasaid, \\"We shall get into trouble about that pig.\\"    \\"Oh, never mind,\\" said Ib; \\"we will go home to my father\'shouse. It is here in the wood.\\" So they went on, but the road led themout of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the childrenwere afraid. The solemn stillness that reigned around them was now andthen broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl and otherbirds that they knew nothing of. At last they both lost themselvesin the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and,after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselvesdown on the dry leaves and fell asleep.    The sun was high in the heavens when the two children woke. Theyfelt cold; but not far from their resting-place, on a hill, the sunwas shining through the trees. They thought if they went there theyshould be warm, and Ib fancied he should be able to see his father\'shouse from such a high spot. But they were far away from home now,in quite another part of the forest. They clambered to the top ofthe rising ground, and found themselves on the edge of a declivity,which sloped down to a clear transparent lake. Great quantities offish could be seen through the clear water, sparkling in the sun\'srays; they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon suchan unexpected sight.    Close to where they stood grew a hazel-bush, covered withbeautiful nuts. They soon gathered some, cracked them, and ate thefine young kernels, which were only just ripe. But there was anothersurprise and fright in store for them. Out of the thicket stepped atall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shiningblack; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor\'s; on her back shecarried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick. She was a gypsy.The children did not at first understand what she said. She drew outof her pocket three large nuts, in which she told them were hidden themost beautiful and lovely things in the world, for they were wishingnuts. Ib looked at her, and as she spoke so kindly, he took courage,and asked her if she would give him the nuts; and the woman gavethem to him, and then gathered some more from the bushes forherself, quite a pocket full. Ib and Christina looked at the wishingnuts with wide open eyes.    \\"Is there in this nut a carriage, with a pair of horses?\\" askedIb.    \\"Yes, there is a golden carriage, with two golden horses,\\" repliedthe woman.    \\"Then give me that nut,\\" said Christina; so Ib gave it to her, andthe strange woman tied up the nut for her in her handkerchief.    Ib held up another nut. \\"Is there, in this nut, a pretty littleneckerchief like the one Christina has on her neck?\\" asked Ib.    \\"There are ten neckerchiefs in it,\\" she replied, \\"as well asbeautiful dresses, stockings, and a hat and veil.\\"    \\"Then I will have that one also,\\" said Christina; \\"and it is apretty one too. And then Ib gave her the second nut.    The third was a little black thing. \\"You may keep that one,\\"said Christina; \\"it is quite as pretty.\\"    \\"What is in it?\\" asked Ib.    \\"The best of all things for you,\\" replied the gypsy. So Ib heldthe nut very tight.    Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path,that they might find their way home had theynot even in childhood been called the betrothed? To him it seemed asif they were really engaged to each other, although not a word hadbeen spoken on the subject. They had only a few more hours to remaintogether, for Christina was obliged to return that evening to theneighboring village, to be ready for the carriage which was to startthe next morning early for Herning. Ib and her father accompaniedher to the village. It was a fine moonlight evening; and when theyarrived, Ib stood holding Christina\'s hand in his, as if he couldnot let her go. His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered camewith hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of hisheart-    \\"The letter written by you to your father I have read, and seefrom it that you are prosperous in everything, and that still betterfortune is in store for you. Ask your own heart, Christina, andthink over carefully what awaits you if you take me for yourhusband, for I possess very little in the world. Do not think of me orof my position; think only of your own welfare. You are bound to me byno promises; and if in your heart you have given me one, I release youfrom it. May every blessing and happiness be poured out upon you,Christina. Heaven will give me the heart\'s consolation.                                       Ever your sincere friend, IB.\\"    This letter was sent, and Christina received it in due time. Inthe course of the following November, her banns were published inthe church on the heath, and also in Copenhagen, where thebridegroom lived. She was taken to Copenhagen under the protectionof her future mother-in-law, because the bridegroom could not sparetime from his numerous occupations for a journey so far intoJutland. On the journey, Christina met her father at one of thevillages through which they passed, and here he took leave of her.Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer toit; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent andpensive. Thinking as he did of old times, no wonder the three nutscame into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him when a child,and of the two which he had given to Christina. These wishing nuts,after all, had proved true fortune-tellers. One had contained a gildedcarriage and noble horses, and the other beautiful clothes; all ofthese Christina would now have in her new home at Copenhagen. Her parthad come true. And for him the nut had contained only black earth. Thegypsy woman had said it was the best for him. Perhaps it was, and thisalso would be fulfilled. He understood the gypsy woman\'s meaningnow. The black earth- the dark grave- was the best thing for him now.    Again years passed away; not many, but they seemed long years toIb. The old innkeeper and his wife died one after the other; and thewhole of their property, many thousand dollars, was inherited by theirson. Christina could have the golden carriage now, and plenty offine clothes. During the two long years which followed, no letter camefrom Christina to her father; and when at last her father received onefrom her, it did not speak of prosperity or happiness. Poor Christina!Neither she nor her husband understood how to economize or save, andthe riches brought no blessing with them, because they had not askedfor it.    Years passed; and for many summers the heath was covered withbloom; in winter the snow rested upon it, and the rough winds blewacross the ridge under which stood Ib\'s sheltered home. One spring daythe sun shone brightly, and he was guiding the plough across hisfield. The ploughshare struck against something which he fancied was afirestone, and then he saw glittering in the earth a splinter ofshining metal which the plough had cut from something which gleamedbrightly in the furrow. He searched, and found a large golden armletof superior workmanship, and it was evident that the plough haddisturbed a Hun\'s grave. He searched further, and found morevaluable treasures, which Ib showed to the clergyman, who explainedtheir value to him. Then he went to the magistrate, who informed thepresident of the museum of the discovery, and advised Ib to take thetreasures himself to the president.    \\"You have found in the earth the best thing you could find,\\"said the magistrate.    \\"The best thing,\\" thought Ib; \\"the very best thing for me,- andfound in the earth! Well, if it really is so, then the gypsy woman wasright in her prophecy.\\"    So Ib went in the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen. To him whohad only sailed once or twice on the river near his own home, thisseemed like a voyage on the ocean; and at length he arrived atCopenhagen. The value of the gold he had found was paid to him; it wasa large sum- six hundred dollars. Then Ib of the heath went out, andwandered about in the great city.    On the evening before the day he had settled to return with thecaptain of the passage-boat, Ib lost himself in the streets, andtook quite a different turning to the one he wished to follow. Hewandered on till he found himself in a poor street of the suburbcalled Christian\'s Haven. Not a creature could be seen. At last a verylittle girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ibasked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked uptimidly at him, and began to cry bitterly. He asked her what was thematter; but what she said he could not understand. So he went alongthe street with her; and as they passed under a lamp, the light fellon the little girl\'s face. A strange sensation came over Ib, as hecaught sight of it. The living, breathing embodiment of LittleChristina stood before him, just as he remembered her in the days ofher childhood. He followed the child to the wretched house, andascended the narrow, crazy staircase which led to a little garret inthe roof. The air in the room was heavy and stifling, no light wasburning, and from one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing. Itwas the mother of the child who lay there on a miserable bed. With thehelp of a match, Ib struck a light, and approached her.    \\"Can I be of any service to you?\\" he asked. \\"This little girlbrought me up here; but I am a stranger in this city. Are there noneighbors or any one whom I can call?\\"    Then he raised the head of the sick woman, and smoothed herpillow. He started as he did so. It was Christina of the heath! No onehad mentioned her name to Ib for years; it would have disturbed hispeace of mind, especially as the reports respecting her were not good.The wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had madehim proud and arrogant. He had given up his certain appointment, andtravelled for six months in foreign lands, and, on his return, hadlived in great style, and got into terrible debt. For a time he hadtrembled on the high pedestal on which he had placed himself, tillat last he toppled over, and ruin came. His numerous merry companions,and the visitors at his table, said it served him right, for he hadkept house like a madman. One morning his corpse was found in thecanal. The cold hand of death had already touched the heart ofChristina. Her youngest child, looked for in the midst ofprosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; andat last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsakenand dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne inher younger days, but which was now more painful to her from theluxuries to which she had lately been accustomed. It was her eldestchild, also a Little Christina, whom Ib had followed to her home,where she suffered hunger and poverty with her mother.    It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poorchild,\\" sighed she. \\"Oh, what will become of her?\\" She could say nomore.    Then Ib brought out another match, and lighted a piece of candlewhich he found in the room, and it threw a glimmering light over thewretched dwelling. Ib looked at the little girl, and thought ofChristina in her young days. For her sake, could he not love thischild, who was a stranger to him? As he thus reflected, the dyingwoman opened her eyes, and gazed at him. Did she recognize him? Henever knew; for not another word escaped her lips.                                                        *    In the forest by the river Gudenau, not far from the heath, andbeneath the ridge of land, stood the little farm, newly painted andwhitewashed. The air was heavy and dark; there were no blossoms on theheath; the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves towards theboatman\'s hut, in which strangers dwelt; but the little farm stoodsafely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high ridge. The turfblazed brightly on the hearth, and within was sunlight, thesparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child; the birdlike tonesfrom the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark in spring. Allwas life and joy. Little Christina sat on Ib\'s knee. Ib was to herboth father and mother; her own parents had vanished from hermemory, as a dream-picture vanishes alike from childhood and age. Ib\'shouse was well and prettily furnished; for he was a prosperous mannow, while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard atCopenhagen, where she had died in poverty. Ib had money now- moneywhich had come to him out of the black earth; and he had Christina forhis own, after all.

The young inhabitants of America willbecome visitors of old Europe. They will come over to see themonuments and the great cities, which will then be in ruins, just aswe in our time make pilgrimages to the tottering splendors of SouthernAsia. In a thousand years they will come!    The Thames, the Danube, and the Rhine still roll their course,Mont Blanc stands firm with its snow-capped summit, and the NorthernLights gleam over the land of the North; but generation aftergeneration has become dust, whole rows of the mighty of the moment areforgotten, like those who already slumber under the hill on whichthe rich trader, whose ground it is, has built a bench, on which hecan sit and look out across his waving corn fields.    \\"To Europe!\\" cry the young sons of America; \\"to the land of ourancestors, the glorious land of monuments and fancy- to Europe!\\"    The ship of the air comes. It is crowded with passengers, forthe transit is quicker than by sea. The electro-magnetic wire underthe ocean has already telegraphed the number of the aerial caravan.Europe is in sight. It is the coast of Ireland that they see, butthe passengers are still asleep; they will not be called till they areexactly over England. There they will first step on European shore, inthe land of Shakespeare, as the educated call it; in the land ofpolitics, the land of machines, as it is called by others.    Here they stay a whole day. That is all the time the busy race candevote to the whole of England and Scotland. Then the journey iscontinued through the tunnel under the English Channel, to France, theland of Charlemagne and Napoleon. Moliere is named, the learned mentalk of the classic school of remote antiquity. There is rejoicing andshouting for the names of heroes, poets, and men of science, whomour time does not know, but who will be born after our time inParis, the centre of Europe, and elsewhere.    The air steamboat flies over the country whence Columbus wentforth, where Cortez was born, and where Calderon sang dramas insounding verse. Beautiful black-eyed women live still in theblooming valleys, and the oldest songs speak of the Cid and theAlhambra.    Then through the air, over the sea, to Italy, where once layold, everlasting Rome. It has vanished! The Campagna lies desert. Asingle ruined wall is shown as the remains of St. Peter\'s, but thereis a doubt if this ruin be genuine.    Next to Greece, to sleep a night in the grand hotel at the topof Mount Olympus, to say that they have been there; and the journey iscontinued to the Bosphorus, to rest there a few hours, and see theplace where Byzantium lay; and where the legend tells that the haremstood in the time of the Turks, poor fishermen are now spreading theirnets.    Over the remains of mighty cities on the broad Danube, citieswhich we in our time know not, the travellers pass; but here andthere, on the rich sites of those that time shall bring forth, thecaravan sometimes descends, and departs thence again.    Down below lies Germany, that was once covered with a close net ofrailway and canals, the region where Luther spoke, where Goethesang, and Mozart once held the sceptre of harmony. Great names shinethere, in science and in art, names that are unknown to us. One daydevoted to seeing Germany, and one for the North, the country ofOersted and Linnaeus, and for Norway, the land of the old heroes andthe young Normans. Iceland is visited on the journey home. The geysersburn no more, Hecla is an extinct volcano, but the rocky island isstill fixed in the midst of the foaming sea, a continual monument oflegend and poetry.    \\"There is really a great deal to be seen in Europe,\\" says theyoung American, \\"and we have seen it in a week, according to thedirections of the great traveller\\" (and here he mentions the name ofone of his contemporaries) \\"in his celebrated work, \'How to See AllEurope in a Week.\'\\"                            THE END.","source":"@site/learn/IN A THOUSAND YEARS.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/IN A THOUSAND YEARS","permalink":"/learn/IN A THOUSAND YEARS","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/IN A THOUSAND YEARS.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"IB AND LITTLE CHRISTINA","permalink":"/learn/IB AND LITTLE CHRISTINA"},"next":{"title":"IN THE NURSERY","permalink":"/learn/IN THE NURSERY"}},{"id":"In Darkest England and The Way Out","title":"In Darkest England and The Way Out","description":"\\"In Darkest England and The Way Out\\"","source":"@site/learn/In Darkest England and The Way Out.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/In Darkest England and The Way Out","permalink":"/learn/In Darkest England and The Way Out","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/In Darkest England and The Way Out.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Idylls of the King","permalink":"/learn/Idylls of the King"},"next":{"title":"In Defence of Harriet Shelley","permalink":"/learn/In Defence of Harriet Shelley"}},{"id":"In Defence of Harriet Shelley","title":"In Defence of Harriet Shelley","description":"In Defence of Harriet Shelley","source":"@site/learn/In Defence of Harriet Shelley.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/In Defence of Harriet Shelley","permalink":"/learn/In Defence of Harriet Shelley","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/In Defence of Harriet Shelley.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"In Darkest England and The Way Out","permalink":"/learn/In Darkest England and The Way Out"},"next":{"title":"In Flanders Fields And Other Poems","permalink":"/learn/In Flanders Fields And Other Poems"}},{"id":"In Flanders Fields And Other Poems","title":"In Flanders Fields And Other Poems","description":"In Flanders Fields And Other Poems","source":"@site/learn/In Flanders Fields And Other Poems.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/In Flanders Fields And Other Poems","permalink":"/learn/In Flanders Fields And Other Poems","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/In Flanders Fields And Other Poems.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"In Defence of Harriet Shelley","permalink":"/learn/In Defence of Harriet Shelley"},"next":{"title":"In The Bishop\'s Carriage","permalink":"/learn/In The Bishop\'s Carriage"}},{"id":"In The Bishop\'s Carriage","title":"In The Bishop\'s Carriage","description":"In The Bishop\'s Carriage","source":"@site/learn/In The Bishop\'s Carriage.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/In The Bishop\'s Carriage","permalink":"/learn/In The Bishop\'s Carriage","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/In The Bishop\'s Carriage.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"In Flanders Fields And Other Poems","permalink":"/learn/In Flanders Fields And Other Poems"},"next":{"title":"In a German Pension","permalink":"/learn/In a German Pension"}},{"id":"In the Days When the World Was Wide","title":"In the Days When the World Was Wide","description":"In the Days When the World Was Wide and Other Verses by Henry Lawson","source":"@site/learn/In the Days When the World Was Wide.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/In the Days When the World Was Wide","permalink":"/learn/In the Days When the World Was Wide","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/In the Days When the World Was Wide.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"In a German Pension","permalink":"/learn/In a German Pension"},"next":{"title":"Indian Boyhood","permalink":"/learn/Indian Boyhood"}},{"id":"IN THE NURSERY","title":"IN THE NURSERY","description":"1872                     FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                                 IN THE NURSERY                           by Hans Christian Andersen    FATHER, and mother, and brothers, and sisters, were gone to theplay; only little Anna and her grandpapa were left at home.    \\"We\'ll have a play too,\\" he said, \\"and it may begin immediately.\\"    \\"But we have no theatre,\\" cried little Anna, \\"and we have no oneto act for us; my old doll cannot, for she is a fright, and my new onecannot, for she must not rumple her new clothes.\\"    \\"One can always get actors if one makes use of what one has,\\"observed grandpapa.    \\"Now we\'ll go into the theatre. Here we will put up a book,there another, and there a third, in a sloping row. Now three on theother side; so, now we have the side scenes. The old box that liesyonder may be the back stairs; and we\'ll lay the flooring on top ofit. The stage represents a room, as every one may see. Now we want theactors. Let us see what we can find in the plaything-box. First thepersonages, and then we will get the play ready. One after theother; that will be capital! Here\'s a pipe-head, and yonder an oddglove; they will do very well for father and daughter.\\"    \\"But those are only two characters,\\" said little Anna. \\"Here\'smy brother\'s old waistcoat- could not that play in our piece, too?\\"    \\"It\'s big enough, certainly,\\" replied grandpapa. \\"It shall bethe lover. There\'s nothing in the pockets, and that\'s veryinteresting, for that\'s half of an unfortunate attachment. And here wehave the nut-cracker\'s boots, with spurs to them. Row, dow, dow! howthey can stamp and strut! They shall represent the unwelcome wooer,whom the lady does not like. What kind of a play will you have now?Shall it be a tragedy, or a domestic drama?\\"    \\"A domestic drama, please,\\" said little Anna, \\"for the othersare so fond of that. Do you know one?\\"    \\"I know a hundred,\\" said grandpapa. \\"Those that are most infavor are from the French, but they are not good for little girls.In the meantime, we may take one of the prettiest, for insidethey\'re all very much alike.

For more than a year one of these shipshad been pushing its way northward, amid snow and ice, and the sailorshad endured many hardships; till at length winter set in, and thesun entirely disappeared; for many weeks there would be constantnight. All around, as far as the eye could reach, nothing could beseen but fields of ice, in which the ship remained stuck fast. Thesnow lay piled up in great heaps, and of these the sailors madehuts, in the form of bee-hives, some of them as large and spaciousas one of the \\"Huns\' graves,\\" and others only containing room enoughto hold three or four men. It was not quite dark; the northernlights shot forth red and blue flames, like continuous fireworks,and the snow glittered, and reflected back the light, so that thenight here was one long twilight. When the moon was brightest, thenatives came in crowds to see the sailors. They had a very singularappearance in their rough, hairy dresses of fur, and riding in sledgesover the ice. They brought with them furs and skins in greatabundance, so that the snow-houses were soon provided with warmcarpets, and the furs also served for the sailors to wrap themselvesin, when they slept under the roofs of snow, while outside it wasfreezing with a cold far more severe than in the winter with us. Inour country it was still autumn, though late in the season; and theythought of that in their distant exile, and often pictured tothemselves the yellow leaves on the trees at home. Their watchespointed to the hours of evening, and time to go to sleep, althoughin these regions it was now always night.    In one of the huts, two of the men laid themselves down to rest.The younger of these men had brought with him from home his best,his dearest treasure- a Bible, which his grandmother had given himon his departure. Every night the sacred volume rested under his head,and he had known from his childhood what was written in it. Everyday he read in the book, and while stretched on his cold couch, theholy words he had learnt would come into his mind \\"Inthe uttermost parts of the sea, Thy right hand shall uphold me.\\" Andas the angel spread his wings like a veil over the sleeper, therewas the sound of beautiful music and a hymn. Then the vision fled.It was dark again in the snow-hut: but the Bible still restedbeneath his head, and faith and hope dwelt in his heart. God waswith him, and he carried home in his heart, even \\"in the uttermostparts of the sea.

Ion. To Homer only; he is in himself quite enough.  Soc. Are there any things about which Homer and Hesiod agree?  Ion. Yes; in my opinion there are a good many.  Soc. And can you interpret better what Homer says, or what Hesiodsays, about these matters in which they agree?  Ion. I can interpret them equally well, Socrates, where they agree.  Soc. But what about matters in which they do not agree?- forexample, about divination, of which both Homer and Hesiod havesomething to say-  Ion. Very true for Ilove to hear you wise men talk.  Soc. O that we were wise, Ion, and that you could truly call usso; but you rhapsodes and actors, and the poets whose verses you sing,are wise; whereas I am a common man, who only speak the truth. Forconsider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this which Ihave said- a thing which any man might say and all of them derive their power of suspension fromthe original stone. In like manner the Muse first of all inspiresmen herself; and from these inspired persons a chain of otherpersons is suspended, who take the inspiration. For all good poets,epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful poems not by art, butbecause they are inspired and possessed. And as the Corybantianrevellers when they dance are not in their right mind, so the lyricpoets are not in their right mind when they are composing theirbeautiful strains when he has not attained to this state, he is powerlessand is unable to utter his oracles.  Many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the actionsof men; but like yourself when speaking about Homer, they do not speakof them by any rules of art for not by art does the poet sing,but by power divine. Had he learned by rules of art, he would haveknown how to speak not of one theme only, but of all; and thereforeGod takes away the minds of poets, and uses them as his ministers,as he also uses diviners and holy prophets, in order that we whohear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utterthese priceless words in a state of unconsciousness, but that Godhimself is the speaker, and that through them he is conversing withus. And Tynnichus the Chalcidian affords a striking instance of what Iam saying When you produce the greatest effect upon the audience inthe recitation of some striking passage, such as the apparition ofOdysseus leaping forth on the floor, recognized by the suitors andcasting his arrows at his feet, or the description of Achilles rushingat Hector, or the sorrows of Andromache, Hecuba, or Priam,- are you inyour right mind? Are you not carried out of yourself, and does notyour soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places ofwhich you are speaking, whether they are in Ithaca or in Troy orwhatever may be the scene of the poem?  Ion. That proof strikes home to me, Socrates. For I must franklyconfess that at the tale of pity, my eyes are filled with tears, andwhen I speak of horrors, my hair stands on end and my heart throbs.  Soc. Well, Ion, and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrificeor festival, when he is dressed in holiday attire and has goldencrowns upon his head, of which nobody has robbed him, appears sweepingor panic-stricken in the presence of more than twenty thousandfriendly faces, when there is no one despoiling or wronging him;- ishe in his right mind or is he not?  Ion. No indeed, Socrates, I must say that, strictly speaking, heis not in his right mind.  Soc. And are you aware that you produce similar effects on mostspectators?  Ion. Only too well; for I look down upon them from the stage, andbehold the various emotions of pity, wonder, sternness, stamped upontheir countenances when I am speaking  Bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them, and urgethe horse on the right hand with whip and voice; and slacken the rein.And when you are at the goal, let the left horse draw near, yet sothat the nave of the well-wrought wheel may not even seem to touch theextremity; and avoid catching the stone.  Soc. Enough. Now, Ion, will the charioteer or the physician be thebetter judge of the propriety of these lines?  Ion. The charioteer, clearly.  Soc. And will the reason be that this is his art, or will there beany other reason?  Ion. No, that will be the reason.  Soc. And every art is appointed by God to have knowledge of acertain work; for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do notknow by the art of medicine?  Ion. Certainly not.  Soc. Nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we knowby the art of medicine?  Ion. Certainly not.  Soc. And this is true of all the arts;- that which we know withone art we do not know with the other? But let me ask a priorquestion \\"Since you,Socrates, are able to assign different passages in Homer to theircorresponding arts, I wish that you would tell me what are thepassages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet andprophetic art\\"; and you will see how readily and truly I shallanswer you. For there are many such passages, particularly in theOdyssey; as, for example, the passage in which Theoclymenus theprophet of the house of Melampus says to the suitors-  As they were eager to pass the ditch, there came to them an omen and then you wouldknow when horses were well or ill managed. But suppose I were to askyou and there is Phanosthenes of Andros, andHeraclides of Clazomenae, whom they have also appointed to the commandof their armies and to other offices, although aliens, after theyhad shown their merit. And will they not choose Ion the Ephesian to betheir general, and honour him, if he prove himself worthy? Were notthe Ephesians originally Athenians, and Ephesus is no mean city?But, indeed, Ion, if you are correct in saying that by art andknowledge you are able to praise Homer, you do not deal fairly withme, and after all your professions of knowing many, glorious thingsabout Homer, and promises that you would exhibit them, you are onlya deceiver, and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are amaster, will not, even after my repeated entreaties, explain to me thenature of it. You have literally as many forms as Proteus; and now yougo all manner of ways, twisting and turning, and, like Proteus, becomeall manner of people at once, and at last slip away from me in thedisguise of a general, in order that you may escape exhibiting yourHomeric lore. And if you have art, then, as I was saying, infalsifying your promise that you would exhibit Homer, you are notdealing fairly with me. But if, as I believe, you have no art, butspeak all these beautiful words about Homer unconsciously under hisinspiring influence, then I acquit you of dishonesty, and shall onlysay that you are inspired. Which do you prefer to be thought,dishonest or inspired?  Ion. There is a great difference, Socrates, between the twoalternatives; and inspiration is by far the nobler.  Soc. Then, Ion, I shall assume the nobler alternative; and attributeto you in your praises of Homer inspiration, and not art.                          -THE END-.","source":"@site/learn/Ion.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/Ion","permalink":"/learn/Ion","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/Ion.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Introduction to The Compleat Angler","permalink":"/learn/Introduction to The Compleat Angler"},"next":{"title":"Iphigenia in Tauris","permalink":"/learn/Iphigenia in Tauris"}},{"id":"Iphigenia in Tauris","title":"Iphigenia in Tauris","description":"410 BC","source":"@site/learn/Iphigenia in Tauris.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/Iphigenia in Tauris","permalink":"/learn/Iphigenia in Tauris","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/Iphigenia in Tauris.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Ion","permalink":"/learn/Ion"},"next":{"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","permalink":"/learn/Irish Fairy Tales"}},{"id":"Irish Fairy Tales","title":"Irish Fairy Tales","description":"Irish Fairy Tales","source":"@site/learn/Irish Fairy Tales.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/Irish Fairy Tales","permalink":"/learn/Irish Fairy Tales","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/Irish Fairy Tales.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Iphigenia in Tauris","permalink":"/learn/Iphigenia in Tauris"},"next":{"title":"Is Shakespeare Dead","permalink":"/learn/Is Shakespeare Dead"}},{"id":"Is Shakespeare Dead","title":"Is Shakespeare Dead","description":"Is Shakespeare Dead?","source":"@site/learn/Is Shakespeare Dead.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/Is Shakespeare Dead","permalink":"/learn/Is Shakespeare Dead","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/Is Shakespeare Dead.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","permalink":"/learn/Irish Fairy Tales"},"next":{"title":"Isaac Bickerstaff","permalink":"/learn/Isaac Bickerstaff"}},{"id":"IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD1","title":"IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD1","description":"IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD?","source":"@site/learn/IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD1.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD1","permalink":"/learn/IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD1","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD1.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE SEA","permalink":"/learn/IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE SEA"},"next":{"title":"ISABELLA, OR, THE POT OF BASIL","permalink":"/learn/ISABELLA, OR, THE POT OF BASIL"}},{"id":"Isaac Bickerstaff","title":"Isaac Bickerstaff","description":"Isaac Bickerstaff, Physician and Astrologer","source":"@site/learn/Isaac Bickerstaff.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/Isaac Bickerstaff","permalink":"/learn/Isaac Bickerstaff","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/masterpiece/edit/main/website/learn/Isaac Bickerstaff.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Is Shakespeare Dead","permalink":"/learn/Is Shakespeare Dead"},"next":{"title":"Island Nights\' Entertainments","permalink":"/learn/Island Nights\' Entertainments"}},{"id":"ISABELLA, OR, THE POT OF BASIL","title":"ISABELLA, OR, THE POT OF BASIL","description":"1816                         ISABELLA; OR, THE POT OF BASIL                                 by John KeatsISABELLA               A Story from Boccaccio                        I.        Fair Isabel, poor simple Isabel!          Lorenzo, a young palmer in Love\'s eye!        They could not in the self-same mansion dwell          Without some stir of heart, some malady;        They could not sit at meals but feel how well          It soothed each to be the other by;        They could not, sure, beneath the same roof sleep        But to each other dream, and nightly weep.                       II.        With every morn their love grew tenderer,          With every eve deeper and tenderer still;        He might not in house, field, or garden stir,          But her full shape would all his seeing fill;        And his continual voice was pleasanter          To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;        Her lute-string gave an echo of his name,        She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.                      III.        He knew whose gentle hand was at the latch          Before the door had given her to his eyes;        And from her chamber-window he would catch          Her beauty farther than the falcon spies;        And constant as her vespers would he watch,          Because her face was turn\'d to the same skies;        And with sick longing all the night outwear,        To hear her morning-step upon the stair.                       IV.        A whole long month of May in this sad plight          Made their cheeks paler by the break of June       \\"How ill she is,\\" said he, \\"I may not speak,          \\"And yet I will, and tell my love all plain        Alas! when passion is both meek and wild!                      VII.        So once more he had wak\'d and anguished          A dreary night of love and misery,        If Isabel\'s quick eye had not been wed          To every symbol on his forehead high;        She saw it waxing very pale and dead,          And straight all flush\'d; so, lisped tenderly,       \\"Lorenzo!\\"- here she ceas\'d her timid quest,        But in her tone and look he read the rest.                     VIII.       \\"O Isabella, I can half perceive          \\"That I may speak my grief into thine ear;       \\"If thou didst ever anything believe,          \\"Believe how I love thee, believe how near       \\"My soul is to its doom        Great bliss was with them, and great happiness        Grew, like a lusty flower in June\'s caress.                        X.        Parting they seem\'d to tread upon the air,          Twin roses by the zephyr blown apart        Only to meet again more close, and share          The inward fragrance of each other\'s heart.        She, to her chamber gone, a ditty fair          Sang, of delicious love and honey\'d dart;        He with light steps went up a western hill,        And bade the sun farewell, and joy\'d his fill.                       XI.        All close they met again, before the dusk          Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil,        All close they met, all eves, before the dusk          Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil,        Close in a bower of hyacinth and musk,          Unknown of any, free from whispering tale.        Ah! better had it been for ever so,        Than idle ears should pleasure in their woe.                      XII.        Were they unhappy then?- It cannot be-          Too many tears for lovers have been shed,        Too many sighs give we to them in fee,          Too much of pity after they are dead,        Too many doleful stories do we see,          Whose matter in bright gold were best be read;        Except in such a page where Theseus\' spouse        Over the pathless waves towards him bows.                     XIII.        But, for the general award of love,          The little sweet doth kill much bitterness;        Though Dido silent is in under-grove,          And Isabella\'s was a great distress,        Though young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove          Was not embalm\'d, this truth is not the less-        Even bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers,        Know there is richest juice in poison-flowers.                      XIV.        With her two brothers this fair lady dwelt,          Enriched from ancestral merchandize,        And for them many a weary hand did swelt          In torched mines and noisy factories,        And many once proud-quiver\'d loins did melt          In blood from stinging whip;- with hollow eyes        Many all day in dazzling river stood,        To take the rich-ored driftings of the flood.                       XV.        For them the Ceylon diver held his breath,          And went all naked to the hungry shark;        For them his ears gush\'d blood; for them in death          The seal on the cold ice with piteous bark        Lay full of darts; for them alone did seethe          A thousand men in troubles wide and dark        But it is done- succeed the verse or fail-          To honour thee, and thy gone spirit greet;        To stead thee as a verse in English tongue,        An echo of thee in the north-wind sung.                      XXI.        These brethren having found by many signs          What love Lorenzo for their sister had,        And how she lov\'d him too, each unconfines          His bitter thoughts to other, well nigh mad        That he, the servant of their trade designs,          Should in their sister\'s love be blithe and glad,        When \'twas their plan to coax her by degrees        To some high noble and his olive-trees.                     XXII.        And many a jealous conference had they,          And many times they bit their lips alone,        Before they fix\'d upon a surest way          To make the youngster for his crime atone;        And at the last, these men of cruel clay          Cut Mercy with a sharp knife to the bone;        For they resolved in some forest dim        To kill Lorenzo, and there bury him.                    XXIII.        So on a pleasant morning, as he leant          Into the sun-rise, o\'er the balustrade        Of the garden-terrace, towards him they bent          Their footing through the dews; and to him said,       \\"You seem there in the quiet of content,          \\"Lorenzo, and we are most loth to invade       \\"Calm speculation; but if you are wise,       \\"Bestride your steed while cold is in the skies.                     XXIV.       \\"To-day we purpose, aye, this hour we mount          \\"To spur three leagues towards the Apennine;       \\"Come down, we pray thee, ere the hot sun count          \\"His dewy rosary on the eglantine.\\"        Lorenzo, courteously as he was wont,          Bow\'d a fair greeting to these serpents\' whine;        And went in haste, to get in readiness,        With belt, and spur, and bracing huntsman\'s dress.                      XXV.        And as he to the court-yard pass\'d along,          Each third step did he pause, and listen\'d oft        If he could hear his lady\'s matin-song,          Or the light whisper of her footstep soft;        And as he thus over his passion hung,          He heard a laugh full musical aloft;        When, looking up, he saw her features bright        Smile through an in-door lattice, all delight.                     XXVI.       \\"Love, Isabel!\\" said he, \\"I was in pain          \\"Lest I should miss to bid thee a good morrow-          And as he went she chanted merrily.                    XXVII.        So the two brothers and their murder\'d man          Rode past fair Florence, to where Arno\'s stream        Gurgles through straiten\'d banks, and still doth fan          Itself with dancing bulrush, and the bream        Keeps head against the freshets. Sick and wan          The brothers\' faces in the ford did seem,        Lorenzo\'s flush with love.- They pass\'d the water        Into a forest quiet for the slaughter.                   XXVIII.        There was Lorenzo slain and buried in,          There in that forest did his great love cease;        Ah! when a soul doth thus its freedom win,          It aches in loneliness- is ill at peace        As the break-covert blood-hounds of such sin        His image in the dusk she seem\'d to see,          And to the silence made a gentle moan,        Spreading her perfect arms upon the air,        And on her couch low murmuring \\"Where? O where?\\"                     XXXI.        But Selfishness, Love\'s cousin, held not long          Its fiery vigil in her single breast;        She fretted for the golden hour, and hung          Upon the time with feverish unrest-        Not long- for soon into her heart a throng          Of higher occupants, a richer zest,        Came tragic; passion not to be subdued,        And sorrow for her love in travels rude.                    XXXII.        In the mid days of autumn, on their eves          The breath of Winter comes from far away,        And the sick west continually bereaves          Of some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay        Of death among the bushes and the leaves,          To make all bare before he dares to stray        From his north cavern. So sweet Isabel        By gradual decay from beauty fell,                   XXXIII.        Because Lorenzo came not. Oftentimes          She ask\'d her brothers, with an eye all pale,        Striving to be itself, what dungeon climes          Could keep him off so long? They spake a tale        Time after time, to quiet her. Their crimes          Came on them, like a smoke from Hinnom\'s vale;        And every night in dreams they groan\'d aloud,        To see their sister in her snowy shroud.                    XXXIV.        And she had died in drowsy ignorance,          But for a thing more deadly dark than all;        It came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance,          Which saves a sick man from the feather\'d pall        For some few gasping moments; like a lance,          Waking an Indian from his cloudy hall        With cruel pierce, and bringing him again        Sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.                     XXXV.        It was a vision.- In the drowsy gloom,          The dull of midnight, at her couch\'s foot        Lorenzo stood, and wept        Languor there was in it, and tremulous shake,          As in a palsied Druid\'s harp unstrung;        And through it moan\'d a ghostly under-song,        Like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among.                   XXXVII.        Its eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright          With love, and kept all phantom fear aloof        From the poor girl by magic of their light,          The while it did unthread the horrid woof        Of the late darken\'d time,- the murderous spite          Of pride and avarice,- the dark pine roof        In the forest,- and the sodden turfed dell,        Where, without any word, from stabs he fell.                  XXXVIII.        Saying moreover, \\"Isabel, my sweet!          \\"Red whortle-berries droop above my head,       \\"And a large flint-stone weighs upon my feet;          \\"Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed       \\"Their leaves and prickly nuts; a sheep-fold bleat          \\"Comes from beyond the river to my bed I chant alone the holy mass,          \\"While little sounds of life are round me knelling,       \\"And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass,          \\"And many a chapel bell the hour is telling,       \\"Paining me through thy paleness makes me glad;       \\"Thy beauty grows upon me, and I feel       \\"A greater love through all my essence steal.\\"                      XLI.        The Spirit mourn\'d \\"Adieu!\\"- dissolv\'d and left          The atom darkness in a slow turmoil;        As when of healthful midnight sleep bereft,          Thinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil,        We put our eyes into a pillowy cleft,          And see the spangly gloom froth up and boil       \\"I\'ll visit thee for this, and kiss thine eyes,       \\"And greet thee morn and even in the skies.\\"                    XLIII.        When the full morning came, she had devised          How she might secret to the forest hie;        How she might find the day, so dearly prized,          And sing to it one latest lullaby;        How her short absence might be unsurmised,          While she the inmost of the dream would try.        Resolv\'d, she took with her an aged nurse,        And went into that dismal forest-hearse.                     XLIV.        See, as they creep along the river side,          How she doth whisper to that aged Dame,        And, after looking round the champaign wide,          Shows her a knife.- \\"What feverous hectic flame       \\"Burns in thee, child?- What good can thee betide,          \\"That thou should\'st smile again?\\"- The evening came,        And they had found Lorenzo\'s earthy bed;        The flint was there, the berries at his head.                      XLV.        Who hath not loiter\'d in a green church-yard,          And let his spirit, like a demon-mole,        Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard,          To see scull, coffin\'d bones, and funeral stole;        Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marr\'d          And filling it once more with human soul?        Ah! this is holiday to what was felt        When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt.                     XLVI.        She gaz\'d into the fresh-thrown mould, as though          One glance did fully all its secrets tell;        Clearly she saw, as other eyes would know          Pale limbs at bottom of a crystal well;        Upon the murderous spot she seem\'d to grow,          Like to a native lilly of the dell        Then \'gan she work again; nor stay\'d her care,        But to throw back at times her veiling hair.                   XLVIII.        That old nurse stood beside her wondering,          Until her heart felt pity to the core        At sight of such a dismal labouring,          And so she kneeled, with her locks all hoar,        And put her lean hands to the horrid thing- O turn thee to the very tale,        And taste the music of that vision pale.                        L.        With duller steel than the Persean sword          They cut away no formless monster\'s head,        But one, whose gentleness did well accord          With death, as life. The ancient harps have said,        Love never dies, but lives, immortal Lord        She calm\'d its wild hair with a golden comb,          And all around each eye\'s sepulchral cell        Pointed each fringed lash; the smeared loam          With tears, as chilly as a dripping well,        She drench\'d away but in peace        Hung over her sweet Basil evermore,        And moisten\'d it with tears unto the core.                      LIV.        And so she ever fed it with thin tears,          Whence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew,        So that it smelt more balmy than its peers          Of Basil-tufts in Florence; for it drew        Nurture besides, and life, from human fears,          From the fast mouldering head there shut from view She withers, like a palm        Cut by an Indian for its juicy balm.                     LVII.        O leave the palm to wither by itself;          Let not quick Winter chill its dying hour!-        It may not be- those Baalites of pelf,          Her brethren, noted the continual shower        From her dead eyes; and many a curious elf,          Among her kindred, wonder\'d that such dower        Of youth and beauty should be thrown aside        By one mark\'d out to be a Noble\'s bride.                    LVIII.        And, furthermore, her brethren wonder\'d much          Why she sat drooping by the Basil green,        And why it flourish\'d, as by magic touch;          Greatly they wonder\'d what the thing might mean        The guerdon of their murder they had got,          And so left Florence in a moment\'s space,        Never to turn again.- Away they went,        With blood upon their heads, to banishment.                      LXI.        O Melancholy, turn thine eyes away!          O Music, Music, breathe despondingly!        O Echo, Echo, on some other day,          From isles Lethean, sigh to us- O sigh!        Spirits of grief, sing not your \\"Well-a-way!\\"          For Isabel, sweet Isabel, will die;        Will die a death too lone and incomplete,        Now they have ta\'en away her Basil sweet.                     LXII.        Piteous she look\'d on dead and senseless things,          Asking for her lost Basil amorously;        And with melodious chuckle in the strings          Of her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry        After the Pilgrim in his wanderings,          To ask him where her Basil was; and why        \'Twas hid from her        Still is the burthen sung- \\"O cruelty,       \\"To steal my Basil-pot away from me!\\"","source":"@site/learn/ISABELLA, OR, THE POT OF BASIL.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/ISABELLA, OR, THE POT OF BASIL","permalink":"/learn/ISABELLA, OR, THE POT OF
