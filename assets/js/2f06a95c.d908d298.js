In our passionate desire for the new era,\r\nit is difficult to refrain oneself from the commonplace practice\r\nof speculating on the effects of warfare and of prophesying all manner\r\nof novel rebirths.  But it may be well for us to remember that the era\r\nwhich has recently closed was itself marked by a mad idealisation\r\nof all novelties.  In the literary movements of the last decade --\r\nwhen, indeed, any movement at all has been perceptible -- we have witnessed\r\na bewildering rise and fall of methods and ideals.  We were captivated\r\nfor a time by the quest of the golden phrase and the accompanying cultivation\r\nof exotic emotions; and then, wearying of the pretty and the temperamental,\r\nwe plunged into the bloodshot brutalities of naturalism.\r\nFrom the smooth-flowing imitations of Tennyson and Swinburne,\r\nwe passed into a false freedom that had at its heart a repudiation\r\nof all law and standards, for a parallel to which one turns instinctively\r\nto certain recent developments in the political world.  We may hope\r\nthat the eager search for novelty of form and subject may have its influence\r\nin releasing us from our old bondage to the commonplace and in broadening\r\nthe scope of poetry; but we cannot blind ourselves to the fact\r\nthat it has at the same time completed that estrangement\r\nbetween the poet and the general public which has been developing\r\nfor half a century.  The great mass of the reading world,\r\nto whom the arts should minister, have now forgotten that poetry\r\nis a consolation in times of doubt and peril, a beacon,\r\nand "an ever-fixed mark" in a crazed and shifting world.
