Those who had been asleep woke up, and\r\nevery one rose as if just surprised at his work.\r\nThe head-master made a sign to us to sit down. Then, turning to\r\nthe class-master, he said to him in a low voice--\r\n"Monsieur Roger, here is a pupil whom I recommend to your care;\r\nhe\'ll be in the second. If his work and conduct are satisfactory,\r\nhe will go into one of the upper classes, as becomes his age."\r\nThe "new fellow," standing in the corner behind the door so that\r\nhe could hardly be seen, was a country lad of about fifteen, and\r\ntaller than any of us. His hair was cut square on his forehead\r\nlike a village chorister\'s; he looked reliable, but very ill at\r\nease. Although he was not broad-shouldered, his short school\r\njacket of green cloth with black buttons must have been tight\r\nabout the arm-holes, and showed at the opening of the cuffs red\r\nwrists accustomed to being bare. His legs, in blue stockings,\r\nlooked out from beneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by braces,\r\nHe wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.\r\nWe began repeating the lesson. He listened with all his ears, as\r\nattentive as if at a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or\r\nlean on his elbow; and when at two o\'clock the bell rang, the\r\nmaster was obliged to tell him to fall into line with the rest of\r\nus.\r\nWhen we came back to work, we were in the habit of throwing our\r\ncaps on the ground so as to have our hands more free; we used\r\nfrom the door to toss them under the form, so that they hit\r\nagainst the wall and made a lot of dust: it was "the thing."\r\nBut, whether he had not noticed the trick, or did not dare to\r\nattempt it, the "new fellow," was still holding his cap on his\r\nknees even after prayers were over. It was one of those\r\nhead-gears of composite order, in which we can find traces of the\r\nbearskin, shako, billycock hat, sealskin cap, and cotton\r\nnight-cap; one of those poor things, in fine, whose dumb ugliness\r\nhas depths of expression, like an imbecile\'s face. Oval,\r\nstiffened with whalebone, it began with three round knobs; then\r\ncame in succession lozenges of velvet and rabbit-skin separated\r\nby a red band; after that a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard\r\npolygon covered with complicated braiding, from which hung, at\r\nthe end of a long thin cord, small twisted gold threads in the\r\nmanner of a tassel. The cap was new; its peak shone.\r\n"Rise," said the master.\r\nHe stood up; his cap fell. The whole class began to laugh. He\r\nstooped to pick it up. A neighbor knocked it down again with his\r\nelbow; he picked it up once more.\r\n"Get rid of your helmet," said the master, who was a bit of a\r\nwag.\r\nThere was a burst of laughter from the boys, which so thoroughly\r\nput the poor lad out of countenance that he did not know whether\r\nto keep his cap in his hand, leave it on the ground, or put it on\r\nhis head. He sat down again and placed it on his knee.\r\n"Rise," repeated the master, "and tell me your name."\r\nThe new boy articulated in a stammering voice an unintelligible\r\nname.\r\n"Again!"\r\nThe same sputtering of syllables was heard, drowned by the\r\ntittering of the class.\r\n"Louder!" cried the master; "louder!"\r\nThe "new fellow" then took a supreme resolution, opened an\r\ninordinately large mouth, and shouted at the top of his voice as\r\nif calling someone in the word "Charbovari."\r\nA hubbub broke out, rose in crescendo with bursts of shrill\r\nvoices (they yelled, barked, stamped, repeated "Charbovari!\r\nCharbovari"), then died away into single notes, growing quieter\r\nonly with great difficulty, and now and again suddenly\r\nrecommencing along the line of a form whence rose here and there,\r\nlike a damp cracker going off, a stifled laugh.\r\nHowever, amid a rain of impositions, order was gradually\r\nre-established in the class; and the master having succeeded in\r\ncatching the name of "Charles Bovary," having had it dictated to\r\nhim, spelt out, and re-read, at once ordered the poor devil to go\r\nand sit down on the punishment form at the foot of the master\'s\r\ndesk. He got up, but before going hesitated.\r\n"What are you looking for?" asked the master.\r\n"My c-a-p," timidly said the "new fellow," casting troubled looks\r\nround him.\r\n"Five hundred lines for all the class!" shouted in a furious\r\nvoice stopped, like the Quos ego*, a fresh outburst. "Silence!"\r\ncontinued the master indignantly, wiping his brow with his\r\nhandkerchief, which he had just taken from his cap. "As to you,\r\n\'new boy,\' you will conjugate \'ridiculus sum\'** twenty times."\r\nThen, in a gentler tone, "Come, you\'ll find your cap again; it\r\nhasn\'t been stolen."\r\n*A quotation from the Aeneid signifying a threat.\r\n*',(0,a.jsx)(n.em,{children:'I am ridiculous.\r\nQuiet was restored. Heads bent over desks, and the "new fellow"\r\nremained for two hours in an exemplary attitude, although from\r\ntime to time some paper pellet flipped from the tip of a pen came\r\nbang in his face. But he wiped his face with one hand and\r\ncontinued motionless, his eyes lowered.\r\nIn the evening, at preparation, he pulled out his pens from his\r\ndesk, arranged his small belongings, and carefully ruled his\r\npaper. We saw him working conscientiously, looking up every word\r\nin the dictionary, and taking the greatest pains. Thanks, no\r\ndoubt, to the willingness he showed, he had not to go down to the\r\nclass below. But though he knew his rules passably, he had little\r\nfinish in composition. It was the cure of his village who had\r\ntaught him his first Latin; his parents, from motives of economy,\r\nhaving sent him to school as late as possible.\r\nHis father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, retired\r\nassistant-surgeon-major, compromised about 1812 in certain\r\nconscription scandals, and forced at this time to leave the\r\nservice, had taken advantage of his fine figure to get hold of a\r\ndowry of sixty thousand francs that offered in the person of a\r\nhosier\'s daughter who had fallen in love with his good looks.  A\r\nfine man, a great talker, making his spurs ring as he walked,\r\nwearing whiskers that ran into his moustache, his fingers always\r\ngarnished with rings and dressed in loud colours, he had the dash\r\nof a military man with the easy go of a commercial traveller.\r\nOnce married, he lived for three or four years on his wife\'s\r\nfortune, dining well, rising late, smoking long porcelain pipes,\r\nnot coming in at night till after the theatre, and haunting\r\ncafes. The father-in-law died, leaving little; he was indignant\r\nat this, "went in for the business," lost some money in it, then\r\nretired to the country, where he thought he would make money.\r\nBut, as he knew no more about farming than calico, as he rode his\r\nhorses instead of sending them to plough, drank his cider in\r\nbottle instead of selling it in cask, ate the finest poultry in\r\nhis farmyard, and greased his hunting-boots with the fat of his\r\npigs, he was not long in finding out that he would do better to\r\ngive up all speculation.\r\nFor two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of\r\nthe provinces of Caux and Picardy, in a kind of place half farm,\r\nhalf private house; and here, soured, eaten up with regrets,\r\ncursing his luck, jealous of everyone, he shut himself up at the\r\nage of forty-five, sick of men, he said, and determined to live\r\nat peace.\r\nHis wife had adored him once on a time; she had bored him with a\r\nthousand servilities that had only estranged him the more. Lively\r\nonce, expansive and affectionate, in growing older she had become\r\n(after the fashion of wine that, exposed to air, turns to\r\nvinegar) ill-tempered, grumbling, irritable. She had suffered so\r\nmuch without complaint at first, until she had seem him going\r\nafter all the village drabs, and until a score of bad houses sent\r\nhim back to her at night, weary, stinking drunk. Then her pride\r\nrevolted. After that she was silent, burying her anger in a dumb\r\nstoicism that she maintained till her death. She was constantly\r\ngoing about looking after business matters. She called on the\r\nlawyers, the president, remembered when bills fell due, got them\r\nrenewed, and at home ironed, sewed, washed, looked after the\r\nworkmen, paid the accounts, while he, troubling himself about\r\nnothing, eternally besotted in sleepy sulkiness, whence he only\r\nroused himself to say disagreeable things to her, sat smoking by\r\nthe fire and spitting into the cinders.\r\nWhen she had a child, it had to be sent out to nurse. When he\r\ncame home, the lad was spoilt as if he were a prince. His mother\r\nstuffed him with jam; his father let him run about barefoot, and,\r\nplaying the philosopher, even said he might as well go about\r\nquite naked like the young of animals. As opposed to the maternal\r\nideas, he had a certain virile idea of childhood on which he\r\nsought to mould his son, wishing him to be brought up hardily,\r\nlike a Spartan, to give him a strong constitution. He sent him to\r\nbed without any fire, taught him to drink off large draughts of\r\nrum and to jeer at religious processions. But, peaceable by\r\nnature, the lad answered only poorly to his notions. His mother\r\nalways kept him near her; she cut out cardboard for him, told him\r\ntales, entertained him with endless monologues full of melancholy\r\ngaiety and charming nonsense. In her life\'s isolation she\r\ncentered on the child\'s head all her shattered, broken little\r\nvanities. She dreamed of high station; she already saw him, tall,\r\nhandsome, clever, settled as an engineer or in the law. She\r\ntaught him to read, and even, on an old piano, she had taught him\r\ntwo or three little songs. But to all this Monsieur Bovary,\r\ncaring little for letters, said, "It was not worth while. Would\r\nthey ever have the means to send him to a public school, to buy\r\nhim a practice, or start him in business? Besides, with cheek a\r\nman always gets on in the world." Madame Bovary bit her lips, and\r\nthe child knocked about the village.\r\nHe went after the labourers, drove away with clods of earth the\r\nravens that were flying about. He ate blackberries along the\r\nhedges, minded the geese with a long switch, went haymaking\r\nduring harvest, ran about in the woods, played hop-scotch under\r\nthe church porch on rainy days, and at great fetes begged the\r\nbeadle to let him toll the bells, that he might hang all his\r\nweight on the long rope and feel himself borne upward by it in\r\nits swing. Meanwhile he grew like an oak; he was strong on hand,\r\nfresh of colour.\r\nWhen he was twelve years old his mother had her own way; he began\r\nlessons. The cure took him in hand; but the lessons were so short\r\nand irregular that they could not be of much use. They were given\r\nat spare moments in the sacristy, standing up, hurriedly, between\r\na baptism and a burial; or else the cure, if he had not to go\r\nout, sent for his pupil after the Angelus'}),'. They went up to his\r\nroom and settled down; the flies and moths fluttered round the\r\ncandle. It was close, the child fell asleep, and the good man,\r\nbeginning to doze with his hands on his stomach, was soon snoring\r\nwith his mouth wide open. On other occasions, when Monsieur le\r\nCure, on his way back after administering the viaticum to some\r\nsick person in the neighbourhood, caught sight of Charles playing\r\nabout the fields, he called him, lectured him for a quarter of an\r\nhour and took advantage of the occasion to make him conjugate his\r\nverb at the foot of a tree. The rain interrupted them or an\r\nacquaintance passed. All the same he was always pleased with him,\r\nand even said the "young man" had a very good memory.\r\n',(0,a.jsx)(n.em,{children:"A devotion said at morning, noon, and evening, at the sound of a\r\nbell. Here, the evening prayer.\r\nCharles could not go on like this. Madame Bovary took strong\r\nsteps. Ashamed, or rather tired out, Monsieur Bovary gave in\r\nwithout a struggle, and they waited one year longer, so that the\r\nlad should take his first communion.\r\nSix months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally\r\nsent to school at Rouen, where his father took him towards the\r\nend of October, at the time of the St. Romain fair.\r\nIt would now be impossible for any of us to remember anything\r\nabout him. He was a youth of even temperament, who played in\r\nplaytime, worked in school-hours, was attentive in class, slept\r\nwell in the dormitory, and ate well in the refectory. He had in\r\nloco parentis"})," a wholesale ironmonger in the Rue Ganterie, who\r\ntook him out once a month on Sundays after his shop was shut,\r\nsent him for a walk on the quay to look at the boats, and then\r\nbrought him back to college at seven o'clock before supper. Every\r\nThursday evening he wrote a long letter to his mother with red\r\nink and three wafers; then he went over his history note-books,\r\nor read an old volume of \"Anarchasis\" that was knocking about the\r\nstudy. When he went for walks he talked to the servant, who, like\r\nhimself, came from the country.\r\n*In place of a parent.\r\nBy dint of hard work he kept always about the middle of the\r\nclass; once even he got a certificate in natural history. But at\r\nthe end of his third year his parents withdrew him from the\r\nschool to make him study medicine, convinced that he could even\r\ntake his degree by himself.\r\nHis mother chose a room for him on the fourth floor of a dyer's\r\nshe knew, overlooking the Eau-de-Robec. She made arrangements for\r\nhis board, got him furniture, table and two chairs, sent home for\r\nan old cherry-tree bedstead, and bought besides a small cast-iron\r\nstove with the supply of wood that was to warm the poor child.\r\nThen at the end of a week she departed, after a thousand\r\ninjunctions to be good now that he was going to be left to\r\nhimself.\r\nThe syllabus that he read on the notice-board stunned him;\r\nlectures on anatomy, lectures on pathology, lectures on\r\nphysiology, lectures on pharmacy, lectures on botany and clinical\r\nmedicine, and therapeutics, without counting hygiene and materia\r\nmedica--all names of whose etymologies he was ignorant, and that\r\nwere to him as so many doors to sanctuaries filled with\r\nmagnificent darkness.\r\nHe understood nothing of it all; it was all very well to listen--\r\nhe did not follow. Still he worked; he had bound note-books, he\r\nattended all the courses, never missed a single lecture. He did\r\nhis little daily task like a mill-horse, who goes round and round\r\nwith his eyes bandaged, not knowing what work he is doing.\r\nTo spare him expense his mother sent him every week by the\r\ncarrier a piece of veal baked in the oven, with which he lunched\r\nwhen he came back from the hospital, while he sat kicking his\r\nfeet against the wall. After this he had to run off to lectures,\r\nto the operation-room, to the hospital, and return to his home at\r\nthe other end of the town. In the evening, after the poor dinner\r\nof his landlord, he went back to his room and set to work again\r\nin his wet clothes, which smoked as he sat in front of the hot\r\nstove.\r\nOn the fine summer evenings, at the time when the close streets\r\nare empty, when the servants are playing shuttle-cock at the\r\ndoors, he opened his window and leaned out. The river, that makes\r\nof this quarter of Rouen a wretched little Venice, flowed beneath\r\nhim, between the bridges and the railings, yellow, violet, or\r\nblue. Working men, kneeling on the banks, washed their bare arms\r\nin the water. On poles projecting from the attics, skeins of\r\ncotton were drying in the air. Opposite, beyond the roots spread\r\nthe pure heaven with the red sun setting. How pleasant it must be\r\nat home! How fresh under the beech-tree! And he expanded his\r\nnostrils to breathe in the sweet odours of the country which did\r\nnot reach him.\r\nHe grew thin, his figure became taller, his face took a saddened\r\nlook that made it nearly interesting. Naturally, through\r\nindifference, he abandoned all the resolutions he had made. Once\r\nhe missed a lecture; the next day all the lectures; and, enjoying\r\nhis idleness, little by little, he gave up work altogether. He\r\ngot into the habit of going to the public-house, and had a\r\npassion for dominoes. To shut himself up every evening in the\r\ndirty public room, to push about on marble tables the small sheep\r\nbones with black dots, seemed to him a fine proof of his freedom,\r\nwhich raised him in his own esteem. It was beginning to see life,\r\nthe sweetness of stolen pleasures; and when he entered, he put\r\nhis hand on the door-handle with a joy almost sensual. Then many\r\nthings hidden within him came out; he learnt couplets by heart\r\nand sang them to his boon companions, became enthusiastic about\r\nBeranger, learnt how to make punch, and, finally, how to make\r\nlove.\r\nThanks to these preparatory labours, he failed completely in his\r\nexamination for an ordinary degree. He was expected home the same\r\nnight to celebrate his success. He started on foot, stopped at\r\nthe beginning of the village, sent for his mother, and told her\r\nall. She excused him, threw the blame of his failure on the\r\ninjustice of the examiners, encouraged him a little, and took\r\nupon herself to set matters straight. It was only five years\r\nlater that Monsieur Bovary knew the truth; it was old then, and\r\nhe accepted it. Moreover, he could not believe that a man born of\r\nhim could be a fool.\r\nSo Charles set to work again and crammed for his examination,\r\nceaselessly learning all the old questions by heart. He passed\r\npretty well. What a happy day for his mother! They gave a grand\r\ndinner.\r\nWhere should he go to practice? To Tostes, where there was only\r\none old doctor. For a long time Madame Bovary had been on the\r\nlook-out for his death, and the old fellow had barely been packed\r\noff when Charles was installed, opposite his place, as his\r\nsuccessor.\r\nBut it was not everything to have brought up a son, to have had\r\nhim taught medicine, and discovered Tostes, where he could\r\npractice it; he must have a wife. She found him one--the widow of\r\na bailiff at Dieppe--who was forty-five and had an income of\r\ntwelve hundred francs. Though she was ugly, as dry as a bone, her\r\nface with as many pimples as the spring has buds, Madame Dubuc\r\nhad no lack of suitors. To attain her ends Madame Bovary had to\r\noust them all, and she even succeeded in very cleverly baffling\r\nthe intrigues of a port-butcher backed up by the priests.\r\nCharles had seen in marriage the advent of an easier life,\r\nthinking he would be more free to do as he liked with himself and\r\nhis money. But his wife was master; he had to say this and not\r\nsay that in company, to fast every Friday, dress as she liked,\r\nharass at her bidding those patients who did not pay. She opened\r\nhis letter, watched his comings and goings, and listened at the\r\npartition-wall when women came to consult him in his surgery.\r\nShe must have her chocolate every morning, attentions without\r\nend. She constantly complained of her nerves, her chest, her\r\nliver. The noise of footsteps made her ill; when people left her,\r\nsolitude became odious to her; if they came back, it was\r\ndoubtless to see her die. When Charles returned in the evening,\r\nshe stretched forth two long thin arms from beneath the sheets,\r\nput them round his neck, and having made him sit down on the edge\r\nof the bed, began to talk to him of her troubles: he was\r\nneglecting her, he loved another. She had been warned she would\r\nbe unhappy; and she ended by asking him for a dose of medicine\r\nand a little more love."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Two\r\nOne night towards eleven o\'clock they were awakened by the noise\r\nof a horse pulling up outside their door. The servant opened the\r\ngarret-window and parleyed for some time with a man in the street\r\nbelow. He came for the doctor, had a letter for him. Natasie came\r\ndownstairs shivering and undid the bars and bolts one after the\r\nother. The man left his horse, and, following the servant,\r\nsuddenly came in behind her. He pulled out from his wool cap with\r\ngrey top-knots a letter wrapped up in a rag and presented it\r\ngingerly to Charles, who rested on his elbow on the pillow to\r\nread it. Natasie, standing near the bed, held the light. Madame\r\nin modesty had turned to the wall and showed only her back.\r\nThis letter, sealed with a small seal in blue wax, begged\r\nMonsieur Bovary to come immediately to the farm of the Bertaux to\r\nset a broken leg. Now from Tostes to the Bertaux was a good\r\neighteen miles across country by way of Longueville and\r\nSaint-Victor. It was a dark night; Madame Bovary junior was\r\nafraid of accidents for her husband. So it was decided the\r\nstable-boy should go on first; Charles would start three hours\r\nlater when the moon rose. A boy was to be sent to meet him, and\r\nshow him the way to the farm, and open the gates for him.\r\nTowards four o\'clock in the morning, Charles, well wrapped up in\r\nhis cloak, set out for the Bertaux. Still sleepy from the warmth\r\nof his bed, he let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his\r\nhorse. When it stopped of its own accord in front of those holes\r\nsurrounded with thorns that are dug on the margin of furrows,\r\nCharles awoke with a start, suddenly remembered the broken leg,\r\nand tried to call to mind all the fractures he knew. The rain had\r\nstopped, day was breaking, and on the branches of the leafless\r\ntrees birds roosted motionless, their little feathers bristling\r\nin the cold morning wind. The flat country stretched as far as\r\neye could see, and the tufts of trees round the farms at long\r\nintervals seemed like dark violet stains on the cast grey\r\nsurface, that on the horizon faded into the gloom of the sky.\r\nCharles from time to time opened his eyes, his mind grew weary,\r\nand, sleep coming upon him, he soon fell into a doze wherein, his\r\nrecent sensations blending with memories, he became conscious of\r\na double self, at once student and married man, lying in his bed\r\nas but now, and crossing the operation theatre as of old. The\r\nwarm smell of poultices mingled in his brain with the fresh odour\r\nof dew; he heard the iron rings rattling along the curtain-rods\r\nof the bed and saw his wife sleeping. As he passed Vassonville he\r\ncame upon a boy sitting on the grass at the edge of a ditch.\r\n"Are you the doctor?" asked the child.\r\nAnd on Charles\'s answer he took his wooden shoes in his hands and\r\nran on in front of him.\r\nThe general practitioner, riding along, gathered from his guide\'s\r\ntalk that Monsieur Rouault must be one of the well-to-do farmers.\r\nHe had broken his leg the evening before on his way home from a\r\nTwelfth-night feast at a neighbour\'s. His wife had been dead for\r\ntwo years. There was with him only his daughter, who helped him\r\nto keep house.\r\nThe ruts were becoming deeper; they were approaching the Bertaux.\r\nThe little lad, slipping through a hole in the hedge,\r\ndisappeared; then he came back to the end of a courtyard to open\r\nthe gate. The horse slipped on the wet grass; Charles had to\r\nstoop to pass under the branches. The watchdogs in their kennels\r\nbarked, dragging at their chains. As he entered the Bertaux, the\r\nhorse took fright and stumbled.\r\nIt was a substantial-looking farm. In the stables, over the top\r\nof the open doors, one could see great cart-horses quietly\r\nfeeding from new racks. Right along the outbuildings extended a\r\nlarge dunghill, from which manure liquid oozed, while amidst\r\nfowls and turkeys, five or six peacocks, a luxury in Chauchois\r\nfarmyards, were foraging on the top of it. The sheepfold was\r\nlong, the barn high, with walls smooth as your hand. Under the\r\ncart-shed were two large carts and four ploughs, with their\r\nwhips, shafts and harnesses complete, whose fleeces of blue wool\r\nwere getting soiled by the fine dust that fell from the\r\ngranaries. The courtyard sloped upwards, planted with trees set\r\nout symmetrically, and the chattering noise of a flock of geese\r\nwas heard near the pond.\r\nA young woman in a blue merino dress with three flounces came to\r\nthe threshold of the door to receive Monsieur Bovary, whom she\r\nled to the kitchen, where a large fire was blazing. The servant\'s\r\nbreakfast was boiling beside it in small pots of all sizes. Some\r\ndamp clothes were drying inside the chimney-corner. The shovel,\r\ntongs, and the nozzle of the bellows, all of colossal size, shone\r\nlike polished steel, while along the walls hung many pots and\r\npans in which the clear flame of the hearth, mingling with the\r\nfirst rays of the sun coming in through the window, was mirrored\r\nfitfully.\r\nCharles went up the first floor to see the patient. He found him\r\nin his bed, sweating under his bed-clothes, having thrown his\r\ncotton nightcap right away from him. He was a fat little man of\r\nfifty, with white skin and blue eyes, the forepart of his head\r\nbald, and he wore earrings. By his side on a chair stood a large\r\ndecanter of brandy, whence he poured himself a little from time\r\nto time to keep up his spirits; but as soon as he caught sight of\r\nthe doctor his elation subsided, and instead of swearing, as he\r\nhad been doing for the last twelve hours, began to groan freely.\r\nThe fracture was a simple one, without any kind of complication.\r\nCharles could not have hoped for an easier case. Then calling to\r\nmind the devices of his masters at the bedsides of patients, he\r\ncomforted the sufferer with all sorts of kindly remarks, those\r\nCaresses of the surgeon that are like the oil they put on\r\nbistouries. In order to make some splints a bundle of laths was\r\nbrought up from the cart-house. Charles selected one, cut it into\r\ntwo pieces and planed it with a fragment of windowpane, while the\r\nservant tore up sheets to make bandages, and Mademoiselle Emma\r\ntried to sew some pads. As she was a long time before she found\r\nher work-case, her father grew impatient; she did not answer, but\r\nas she sewed she pricked her fingers, which she then put to her\r\nmouth to suck them. Charles was surprised at the whiteness of her\r\nnails. They were shiny, delicate at the tips, more polished than\r\nthe ivory of Dieppe, and almond-shaped. Yet her hand was not\r\nbeautiful, perhaps not white enough, and a little hard at the\r\nknuckles; besides, it was too long, with no soft inflections in\r\nthe outlines. Her real beauty was in her eyes. Although brown,\r\nthey seemed black because of the lashes, and her look came at you\r\nfrankly, with a candid boldness.\r\nThe bandaging over, the doctor was invited by Monsieur Rouault\r\nhimself to "pick a bit" before he left.\r\nCharles went down into the room on the ground floor. Knives and\r\nforks and silver goblets were laid for two on a little table at\r\nthe foot of a huge bed that had a canopy of printed cotton with\r\nfigures representing Turks. There was an odour of iris-root and\r\ndamp sheets that escaped from a large oak chest opposite the\r\nwindow. On the floor in corners were sacks of flour stuck upright\r\nin rows. These were the overflow from the neighbouring granary,\r\nto which three stone steps led. By way of decoration for the\r\napartment, hanging to a nail in the middle of the wall, whose\r\ngreen paint scaled off from the effects of the saltpetre, was a\r\ncrayon head of Minerva in gold frame, underneath which was\r\nwritten in Gothic letters "To dear Papa."\r\nFirst they spoke of the patient, then of the weather, of the\r\ngreat cold, of the wolves that infested the fields at night.\r\nMademoiselle Rouault did not at all like the country, especially\r\nnow that she had to look after the farm almost alone. As the room\r\nwas chilly, she shivered as she ate. This showed something of her\r\nfull lips, that she had a habit of biting when silent.\r\nHer neck stood out from a white turned-down collar. Her hair,\r\nwhose two black folds seemed each of a single piece, so smooth\r\nwere they, was parted in the middle by a delicate lie that curved\r\nslightly with the curve of the head; and, just showing the tip of\r\nthe ear, it was joined behind in a thick chignon, with a wavy\r\nmovement at the temples that the country doctor saw now for the\r\nfirst time in his life. The upper part of her cheek was\r\nrose-coloured. She had, like a man, thrust in between two buttons\r\nof her bodice a tortoise-shell eyeglass.\r\nWhen Charles, after bidding farewell to old Rouault, returned to\r\nthe room before leaving, he found her standing, her forehead\r\nagainst the window, looking into the garden, where the bean props\r\nhad been knocked down by the wind. She turned round. "Are you\r\nlooking for anything?" she asked.\r\n"My whip, if you please," he answered.\r\nHe began rummaging on the bed, behind the doors, under the\r\nchairs. It had fallen to the floor, between the sacks and the\r\nwall. Mademoiselle Emma saw it, and bent over the flour sacks.\r\nCharles out of politeness made a dash also, and as he stretched\r\nout his arm, at the same moment felt his breast brush against the\r\nback of the young girl bending beneath him. She drew herself up,\r\nscarlet, and looked at him over her shoulder as she handed him\r\nhis whip.\r\nInstead of returning to the Bertaux in three days as he had\r\npromised, he went back the very next day, then regularly twice a\r\nweek, without counting the visits he paid now and then as if by\r\naccident.\r\nEverything, moreover, went well; the patient progressed\r\nfavourably; and when, at the end of forty-six days, old Rouault\r\nwas seen trying to walk alone in his "den," Monsieur Bovary began\r\nto be looked upon as a man of great capacity. Old Rouault said\r\nthat he could not have been cured better by the first doctor of\r\nYvetot, or even of Rouen.\r\nAs to Charles, he did not stop to ask himself why it was a\r\npleasure to him to go to the Bertaux. Had he done so, he would,\r\nno doubt, have attributed his zeal to the importance of the case,\r\nor perhaps to the money he hoped to make by it. Was it for this,\r\nhowever, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful\r\nexception to the meagre occupations of his life? On these days he\r\nrose early, set off at a gallop, urging on his horse, then got\r\ndown to wipe his boots in the grass and put on black gloves\r\nbefore entering. He liked going into the courtyard, and noticing\r\nthe gate turn against his shoulder, the cock crow on the wall,\r\nthe lads run to meet him. He liked the granary and the stables;\r\nhe liked old Rouault, who pressed his hand and called him his\r\nsaviour; he like the small wooden shoes of Mademoiselle Emma on\r\nthe scoured flags of the kitchen--her high heels made her a\r\nlittle taller; and when she walked in front of him, the wooden\r\nsoles springing up quickly struck with a sharp sound against the\r\nleather of her boots.\r\nShe always accompanied him to the first step of the stairs. When\r\nhis horse had not yet been brought round she stayed there. They\r\nhad said "Good-bye"; there was no more talking. The open air\r\nwrapped her round, playing with the soft down on the back of her\r\nneck, or blew to and fro on her hips the apron-strings, that\r\nfluttered like streamers. Once, during a thaw the bark of the\r\ntrees in the yard was oozing, the snow on the roofs of the\r\noutbuildings was melting; she stood on the threshold, and went to\r\nfetch her sunshade and opened it. The sunshade of silk of the\r\ncolour of pigeons\' breasts, through which the sun shone, lighted\r\nup with shifting hues the white skin of her face. She smiled\r\nunder the tender warmth, and drops of water could be heard\r\nfalling one by one on the stretched silk.\r\nDuring the first period of Charles\'s visits to the Bertaux,\r\nMadame Bovary junior never failed to inquire after the invalid,\r\nand she had even chosen in the book that she kept on a system of\r\ndouble entry a clean blank page for Monsieur Rouault. But when\r\nshe heard he had a daughter, she began to make inquiries, and she\r\nlearnt the Mademoiselle Rouault, brought up at the Ursuline\r\nConvent, had received what is called "a good education"; and so\r\nknew dancing, geography, drawing, how to embroider and play the\r\npiano. That was the last straw.\r\n"So it is for this," she said to herself, "that his face beams\r\nwhen he goes to see her, and that he puts on his new waistcoat at\r\nthe risk of spoiling it with the rain. Ah! that woman! That\r\nwoman!"\r\nAnd she detested her instinctively. At first she solaced herself\r\nby allusions that Charles did not understand, then by casual\r\nobservations that he let pass for fear of a storm, finally by\r\nopen apostrophes to which he knew not what to answer. "Why did he\r\ngo back to the Bertaux now that Monsieur Rouault was cured and\r\nthat these folks hadn\'t paid yet? Ah! it was because a young lady\r\nwas there, some one who know how to talk, to embroider, to be\r\nwitty. That was what he cared about; he wanted town misses." And\r\nshe went on--\r\n"The daughter of old Rouault a town miss! Get out! Their\r\ngrandfather was a shepherd, and they have a cousin who was almost\r\nhad up at the assizes for a nasty blow in a quarrel. It is not\r\nworth while making such a fuss, or showing herself at church on\r\nSundays in a silk gown like a countess. Besides, the poor old\r\nchap, if it hadn\'t been for the colza last year, would have had\r\nmuch ado to pay up his arrears."\r\nFor very weariness Charles left off going to the Bertaux. Heloise\r\nmade him swear, his hand on the prayer-book, that he would go\r\nthere no more after much sobbing and many kisses, in a great\r\noutburst of love. He obeyed then, but the strength of his desire\r\nprotested against the servility of his conduct; and he thought,\r\nwith a kind of naive hypocrisy, that his interdict to see her\r\ngave him a sort of right to love her. And then the widow was\r\nthin; she had long teeth; wore in all weathers a little black\r\nshawl, the edge of which hung down between her shoulder-blades;\r\nher bony figure was sheathed in her clothes as if they were a\r\nscabbard; they were too short, and displayed her ankles with the\r\nlaces of her large boots crossed over grey stockings.\r\nCharles\'s mother came to see them from time to time, but after a\r\nfew days the daughter-in-law seemed to put her own edge on her,\r\nand then, like two knives, they scarified him with their\r\nreflections and observations. It was wrong of him to eat so much.\r\nWhy did he always offer a glass of something to everyone who\r\ncame? What obstinacy not to wear flannels! In the spring it came\r\nabout that a notary at Ingouville, the holder of the widow\r\nDubuc\'s property, one fine day went off, taking with him all the\r\nmoney in his office. Heloise, it is true, still possessed,\r\nbesides a share in a boat valued at six thousand francs, her\r\nhouse in the Rue St. Francois; and yet, with all this fortune\r\nthat had been so trumpeted abroad, nothing, excepting perhaps a\r\nlittle furniture and a few clothes, had appeared in the\r\nhousehold. The matter had to be gone into. The house at Dieppe\r\nwas found to be eaten up with mortgages to its foundations; what\r\nshe had placed with the notary God only knew, and her share in\r\nthe boat did not exceed one thousand crowns. She had lied, the\r\ngood lady! In his exasperation, Monsieur Bovary the elder,\r\nsmashing a chair on the flags, accused his wife of having caused\r\nmisfortune to the son by harnessing him to such a harridan, whose\r\nharness wasn\'t worth her hide. They came to Tostes. Explanations\r\nfollowed. There were scenes. Heloise in tears, throwing her arms\r\nabout her husband, implored him to defend her from his parents.\r\nCharles tried to speak up for her. They grew angry and left the\r\nhouse.\r\nBut "the blow had struck home." A week after, as she was hanging\r\nup some washing in her yard, she was seized with a spitting of\r\nblood, and the next day, while Charles had his back turned to her\r\ndrawing the window-curtain, she said, "O God!" gave a sigh and\r\nfainted. She was dead! What a surprise! When all was over at the\r\ncemetery Charles went home. He found no one downstairs; he went\r\nup to the first floor to their room; say her dress still hanging\r\nat the foot of the alcove; then, leaning against the\r\nwriting-table, he stayed until the evening, buried in a sorrowful\r\nreverie. She had loved him after all!'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Three\r\nOne morning old Rouault brought Charles the money for setting his\r\nleg--seventy-five francs in forty-sou pieces, and a turkey. He\r\nhad heard of his loss, and consoled him as well as he could.\r\n"I know what it is," said he, clapping him on the shoulder; "I\'ve\r\nbeen through it. When I lost my dear departed, I went into the\r\nfields to be quite alone. I fell at the foot of a tree; I cried;\r\nI called on God; I talked nonsense to Him. I wanted to be like\r\nthe moles that I saw on the branches, their insides swarming with\r\nworms, dead, and an end of it. And when I thought that there were\r\nothers at that very moment with their nice little wives holding\r\nthem in their embrace, I struck great blows on the earth with my\r\nstick. I was pretty well mad with not eating; the very idea of\r\ngoing to a cafe disgusted me--you wouldn\'t believe it. Well,\r\nquite softly, one day following another, a spring on a winter,\r\nand an autumn after a summer, this wore away, piece by piece,\r\ncrumb by crumb; it passed away, it is gone, I should say it has\r\nsunk; for something always remains at the bottom as one would\r\nsay--a weight here, at one\'s heart. But since it is the lot of\r\nall of us, one must not give way altogether, and, because others\r\nhave died, want to die too. You must pull yourself together,\r\nMonsieur Bovary. It will pass away. Come to see us; my daughter\r\nthinks of you now and again, d\'ye know, and she says you are\r\nforgetting her. Spring will soon be here. We\'ll have some\r\nrabbit-shooting in the warrens to amuse you a bit."\r\nCharles followed his advice. He went back to the Bertaux. He\r\nfound all as he had left it, that is to say, as it was five\r\nmonths ago. The pear trees were already in blossom, and Farmer\r\nRouault, on his legs again, came and went, making the farm more\r\nfull of life.\r\nThinking it his duty to heap the greatest attention upon the\r\ndoctor because of his sad position, he begged him not to take his\r\nhat off, spoke to him in an undertone as if he had been ill, and\r\neven pretended to be angry because nothing rather lighter had\r\nbeen prepared for him than for the others, such as a little\r\nclotted cream or stewed pears. He told stories. Charles found\r\nhimself laughing, but the remembrance of his wife suddenly coming\r\nback to him depressed him. Coffee was brought in; he thought no\r\nmore about her.\r\nHe thought less of her as he grew accustomed to living alone. The\r\nnew delight of independence soon made his loneliness bearable. He\r\ncould now change his meal-times, go in or out without\r\nexplanation, and when he was very tired stretch himself at full\r\nlength on his bed. So he nursed and coddled himself and accepted\r\nthe consolations that were offered him. On the other hand, the\r\ndeath of his wife had not served him ill in his business, since\r\nfor a month people had been saying, "The poor young man! what a\r\nloss!" His name had been talked about, his practice had\r\nincreased; and moreover, he could go to the Bertaux just as he\r\nliked. He had an aimless hope, and was vaguely happy; he thought\r\nhimself better looking as he brushed his whiskers before the\r\nlooking-glass.\r\nOne day he got there about three o\'clock. Everybody was in the\r\nfields. He went into the kitchen, but did not at once catch sight\r\nof Emma; the outside shutters were closed. Through the chinks of\r\nthe wood the sun sent across the flooring long fine rays that\r\nwere broken at the corners of the furniture and trembled along\r\nthe ceiling. Some flies on the table were crawling up the glasses\r\nthat had been used, and buzzing as they drowned themselves in the\r\ndregs of the cider. The daylight that came in by the chimney made\r\nvelvet of the soot at the back of the fireplace, and touched with\r\nblue the cold cinders. Between the window and the hearth Emma was\r\nsewing; she wore no fichu; he could see small drops of\r\nperspiration on her bare shoulders.\r\nAfter the fashion of country folks she asked him to have\r\nsomething to drink. He said no; she insisted, and at last\r\nlaughingly offered to have a glass of liqueur with him. So she\r\nwent to fetch a bottle of curacao from the cupboard, reached down\r\ntwo small glasses, filled one to the brim, poured scarcely\r\nanything into the other, and, after having clinked glasses,\r\ncarried hers to her mouth. As it was almost empty she bent back\r\nto drink, her head thrown back, her lips pouting, her neck on the\r\nstrain. She laughed at getting none of it, while with the tip of\r\nher tongue passing between her small teeth she licked drop by\r\ndrop the bottom of her glass.\r\nShe sat down again and took up her work, a white cotton stocking\r\nshe was darning. She worked with her head bent down; she did not\r\nspeak, nor did Charles. The air coming in under the door blew a\r\nlittle dust over the flags; he watched it drift along, and heard\r\nnothing but the throbbing in his head and the faint clucking of a\r\nhen that had laid an egg in the yard. Emma from time to time\r\ncooled her cheeks with the palms of her hands, and cooled these\r\nagain on the knobs of the huge fire-dogs.\r\nShe complained of suffering since the beginning of the season\r\nfrom giddiness; she asked if sea-baths would do her any good; she\r\nbegan talking of her convent, Charles of his school; words came\r\nto them. They went up into her bedroom. She showed him her old\r\nmusic-books, the little prizes she had won, and the oak-leaf\r\ncrowns, left at the bottom of a cupboard. She spoke to him, too,\r\nof her mother, of the country, and even showed him the bed in the\r\ngarden where, on the first Friday of every month, she gathered\r\nflowers to put on her mother\'s tomb. But the gardener they had\r\nnever knew anything about it; servants are so stupid! She would\r\nhave dearly liked, if only for the winter, to live in town,\r\nalthough the length of the fine days made the country perhaps\r\neven more wearisome in the summer. And, according to what she was\r\nsaying, her voice was clear, sharp, or, on a sudden all languor,\r\ndrawn out in modulations that ended almost in murmurs as she\r\nspoke to herself, now joyous, opening big naive eyes, then with\r\nher eyelids half closed, her look full of boredom, her thoughts\r\nwandering.\r\nGoing home at night, Charles went over her words one by one,\r\ntrying to recall them, to fill out their sense, that he might\r\npiece out the life she had lived before he knew her. But he never\r\nsaw her in his thoughts other than he had seen her the first\r\ntime, or as he had just left her. Then he asked himself what\r\nwould become of her--if she would be married, and to whom! Alas!\r\nOld Rouault was rich, and she!--so beautiful! But Emma\'s face\r\nalways rose before his eyes, and a monotone, like the humming of\r\na top, sounded in his ears, "If you should marry after all! If\r\nyou should marry!" At night he could not sleep; his throat was\r\nparched; he was athirst. He got up to drink from the water-bottle\r\nand opened the window. The night was covered with stars, a warm\r\nwind blowing in the distance; the dogs were barking. He turned\r\nhis head towards the Bertaux.\r\nThinking that, after all, he should lose nothing, Charles\r\npromised himself to ask her in marriage as soon as occasion\r\noffered, but each time such occasion did offer the fear of not\r\nfinding the right words sealed his lips.\r\nOld Rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his daughter,\r\nwho was of no use to him in the house. In his heart he excused\r\nher, thinking her too clever for farming, a calling under the ban\r\nof Heaven, since one never saw a millionaire in it. Far from\r\nhaving made a fortune by it, the good man was losing every year;\r\nfor if he was good in bargaining, in which he enjoyed the dodges\r\nof the trade, on the other hand, agriculture properly so called,\r\nand the internal management of the farm, suited him less than\r\nmost people. He did not willingly take his hands out of his\r\npockets, and did not spare expense in all that concerned himself,\r\nliking to eat well, to have good fires, and to sleep well. He\r\nliked old cider, underdone legs of mutton, glorias* well beaten\r\nup. He took his meals in the kitchen alone, opposite the fire, on\r\na little table brought to him all ready laid as on the stage.\r\n*A mixture of coffee and spirits.\r\nWhen, therefore, he perceived that Charles\'s cheeks grew red if\r\nnear his daughter, which meant that he would propose for her one\r\nof these days, he chewed the cud of the matter beforehand. He\r\ncertainly thought him a little meagre, and not quite the\r\nson-in-law he would have liked, but he was said to be well\r\nbrought-up, economical, very learned, and no doubt would not make\r\ntoo many difficulties about the dowry. Now, as old Rouault would\r\nsoon be forced to sell twenty-two acres of "his property,"\r\nas he owed a good deal to the mason, to the harness-maker, and as\r\nthe shaft of the cider-press wanted renewing, "If he asks for\r\nher," he said to himself, "I\'ll give her to him."\r\nAt Michaelmas Charles went to spend three days at the Bertaux.\r\nThe last had passed like the others in procrastinating from hour\r\nto hour. Old Rouault was seeing him off; they were walking along\r\nthe road full of ruts; they were about to part. This was the\r\ntime. Charles gave himself as far as to the corner of the hedge,\r\nand at last, when past it--\r\n"Monsieur Rouault," he murmured, "I should like to say something\r\nto you."\r\nThey stopped. Charles was silent.\r\n"Well, tell me your story. Don\'t I know all about it?" said old\r\nRouault, laughing softly.\r\n"Monsieur Rouault--Monsieur Rouault," stammered Charles.\r\n"I ask nothing better", the farmer went on. "Although, no doubt,\r\nthe little one is of my mind, still we must ask her opinion. So\r\nyou get off--I\'ll go back home. If it is "yes", you needn\'t\r\nreturn because of all the people about, and besides it would\r\nupset her too much. But so that you mayn\'t be eating your heart,\r\nI\'ll open wide the outer shutter of the window against the wall;\r\nyou can see it from the back by leaning over the hedge."\r\nAnd he went off.\r\nCharles fastened his horse to a tree; he ran into the road and\r\nwaited. Half an hour passed, then he counted nineteen minutes by\r\nhis watch. Suddenly a noise was heard against the wall; the\r\nshutter had been thrown back; the hook was still swinging.\r\nThe next day by nine o\'clock he was at the farm. Emma blushed as\r\nhe entered, and she gave a little forced laugh to keep herself in\r\ncountenance. Old Rouault embraced his future son-in-law. The\r\ndiscussion of money matters was put off; moreover, there was\r\nplenty of time before them, as the marriage could not decently\r\ntake place till Charles was out of mourning, that is to say,\r\nabout the spring of the next year.\r\nThe winter passed waiting for this. Mademoiselle Rouault was busy\r\nwith her trousseau. Part of it was ordered at Rouen, and she made\r\nherself chemises and nightcaps after fashion-plates that she\r\nborrowed. When Charles visited the farmer, the preparations for\r\nthe wedding were talked over; they wondered in what room they\r\nshould have dinner; they dreamed of the number of dishes that\r\nwould be wanted, and what should be entrees.\r\nEmma would, on the contrary, have preferred to have a midnight\r\nwedding with torches, but old Rouault could not understand such\r\nan idea. So there was a wedding at which forty-three persons were\r\npresent, at which they remained sixteen hours at table, began\r\nagain the next day, and to some extent on the days following.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter Four\r\nThe guests arrived early in carriages, in one-horse chaises,\r\ntwo-wheeled cars, old open gigs, waggonettes with leather hoods,\r\nand the young people from the nearer villages in carts, in which\r\nthey stood up in rows, holding on to the sides so as not to fall,\r\ngoing at a trot and well shaken up. Some came from a distance of\r\nthirty miles, from Goderville, from Normanville, and from Cany.\r\nAll the relatives of both families had been invited, quarrels\r\nbetween friends arranged, acquaintances long since lost sight of\r\nwritten to."}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["From time to time one heard the crack of a whip behind the hedge;\r\nthen the gates opened, a chaise entered. Galloping up to the foot\r\nof the steps, it stopped short and emptied its load. They got\r\ndown from all sides, rubbing knees and stretching arms. The\r\nladies, wearing bonnets, had on dresses in the town fashion, gold\r\nwatch chains, pelerines with the ends tucked into belts, or\r\nlittle coloured fichus fastened down behind with a pin, and that\r\nleft the back of the neck bare. The lads, dressed like their\r\npapas, seemed uncomfortable in their new clothes (many that day\r\nhand-sewed their first pair of boots), and by their sides,\r\nspeaking never a work, wearing the white dress of their first\r\ncommunion lengthened for the occasion were some big girls of\r\nfourteen or sixteen, cousins or elder sisters no doubt, rubicund,\r\nbewildered, their hair greasy with rose pomade, and very much\r\nafraid of dirtying their gloves. As there were not enough\r\nstable-boys to unharness all the carriages, the gentlemen turned\r\nup their sleeves and set about it themselves. According to their\r\ndifferent social positions they wore tail-coats, overcoats,\r\nshooting jackets, cutaway-coats; fine tail-coats, redolent of\r\nfamily respectability, that only came out of the wardrobe on\r\nstate occasions; overcoats with long tails flapping in the wind\r\nand round capes and pockets like sacks; shooting jackets of\r\ncoarse cloth, generally worn with a cap with a brass-bound peak;\r\nvery short cutaway-coats with two small buttons in the back,\r\nclose together like a pair of eyes, and the tails of which seemed\r\ncut out of one piece by a carpenter's hatchet. Some, too (but\r\nthese, you may be sure, would sit at the bottom of the table),\r\nwore their best blouses--that is to say, with collars turned down\r\nto the shoulders, the back gathered into small plaits and the\r\nwaist fastened very low down with a worked belt.\r\nAnd the shirts stood out from the chests like cuirasses! Everyone\r\nhad just had his hair cut; ears stood out from the heads; they\r\nhad been close-shaved; a few, even, who had had to get up before\r\ndaybreak, and not been able to see to shave, had diagonal gashes\r\nunder their noses or cuts the size of a three-franc piece along\r\nthe jaws, which the fresh air en route had enflamed, so that the\r\ngreat white beaming faces were mottled here and there with red\r\ndabs.\r\nThe mairie was a mile and a half from the farm, and they went\r\nthither on foot, returning in the same way after the ceremony in\r\nthe church. The procession, first united like one long coloured\r\nscarf that undulated across the fields, along the narrow path\r\nwinding amid the green corn, soon lengthened out, and broke up\r\ninto different groups that loitered to talk. The fiddler walked\r\nin front with his violin, gay with ribbons at its pegs. Then came\r\nthe married pair, the relations, the friends, all following\r\npell-mell; the children stayed behind amusing themselves plucking\r\nthe bell-flowers from oat-ears, or playing amongst themselves\r\nunseen. Emma's dress, too long, trailed a little on the ground;\r\nfrom time to time she stopped to pull it up, and then delicately,\r\nwith her gloved hands, she picked off the coarse grass and the\r\nthistledowns, while Charles, empty handed, waited till she had\r\nfinished. Old Rouault, with a new silk hat and the cuffs of his\r\nblack coat covering his hands up to the nails, gave his arm to\r\nMadame Bovary senior. As to Monsieur Bovary senior, who, heartily\r\ndespising all these folk, had come simply in a frock-coat of\r\nmilitary cut with one row of buttons--he was passing compliments\r\nof the bar to a fair young peasant. She bowed, blushed, and did\r\nnot know what to say. The other wedding guests talked of their\r\nbusiness or played tricks behind each other's backs, egging one\r\nanother on in advance to be jolly. Those who listened could\r\nalways catch the squeaking of the fiddler, who went on playing\r\nacross the fields. When he saw that the rest were far behind he\r\nstopped to take breath, slowly rosined his bow, so that the\r\nstrings should sound more shrilly, then set off again, by turns\r\nlowering and raising his neck, the better to mark time for\r\nhimself. The noise of the instrument drove away the little birds\r\nfrom afar.\r\nThe table was laid under the cart-shed. On it were four sirloins,\r\nsix chicken fricassees, stewed veal, three legs of mutton, and in\r\nthe middle a fine roast suckling pig, flanked by four\r\nchitterlings with sorrel. At the corners were decanters of\r\nbrandy. Sweet bottled-cider frothed round the corks, and all the\r\nglasses had been filled to the brim with wine beforehand. Large\r\ndishes of yellow cream, that trembled with the least shake of the\r\ntable, had designed on their smooth surface the initials of the\r\nnewly wedded pair in nonpareil arabesques. A confectioner of\r\nYvetot had been intrusted with the tarts and sweets. As he had\r\nonly just set up on the place, he had taken a lot of trouble, and\r\nat dessert he himself brought in a set dish that evoked loud\r\ncries of wonderment. To begin with, at its base there was a\r\nsquare of blue cardboard, representing a temple with porticoes,\r\ncolonnades, and stucco statuettes all round, and in the niches\r\nconstellations of gilt paper stars; then on the second stage was\r\na dungeon of Savoy cake, surrounded by many fortifications in\r\ncandied angelica, almonds, raisins, and quarters of oranges; and\r\nfinally, on the upper platform a green field with rocks set in\r\nlakes of jam, nutshell boats, and a small Cupid balancing himself\r\nin a chocolate swing whose two uprights ended in real roses for\r\nballs at the top.\r\nUntil night they ate. When any of them were too tired of sitting,\r\nthey went out for a stroll in the yard, or for a game with corks\r\nin the granary, and then returned to table. Some towards the\r\nfinish went to sleep and snored. But with the coffee everyone\r\nwoke up. Then they began songs, showed off tricks, raised heavy\r\nweights, performed feats with their fingers, then tried lifting\r\ncarts on their shoulders, made broad jokes, kissed the women. At\r\nnight when they left, the horses, stuffed up to the nostrils with\r\noats, could hardly be got into the shafts; they kicked, reared,\r\nthe harness broke, their masters laughed or swore; and all night\r\nin the light of the moon along country roads there were runaway\r\ncarts at full gallop plunging into the ditches, jumping over yard\r\nafter yard of stones, clambering up the hills, with women leaning\r\nout from the tilt to catch hold of the reins.\r\nThose who stayed at the Bertaux spent the night drinking in the\r\nkitchen. The children had fallen asleep under the seats.\r\nThe bride had begged her father to be spared the usual marriage\r\npleasantries. However, a fishmonger, one of their cousins (who\r\nhad even brought a pair of soles for his wedding present), began\r\nto squirt water from his mouth through the keyhole, when old\r\nRouault came up just in time to stop him, and explain to him that\r\nthe distinguished position of his son-in-law would not allow of\r\nsuch liberties. The cousin all the same did not give in to these\r\nreasons readily. In his heart he accused old Rouault of being\r\nproud, and he joined four or five other guests in a corner, who\r\nhaving, through mere chance, been several times running served\r\nwith the worst helps of meat, also were of opinion they had been\r\nbadly used, and were whispering about their host, and with\r\ncovered hints hoping he would ruin himself.\r\nMadame Bovary, senior, had not opened her mouth all day. She had\r\nbeen consulted neither as to the dress of her daughter-in-law nor\r\nas to the arrangement of the feast; she went to bed early. Her\r\nhusband, instead of following her, sent to Saint-Victor for some\r\ncigars, and smoked till daybreak, drinking kirsch-punch, a\r\nmixture unknown to the company. This added greatly to the\r\nconsideration in which he was held.\r\nCharles, who was not of a facetious turn, did not shine at the\r\nwedding. He answered feebly to the puns, doubles entendres*,\r\ncompliments, and chaff that it was felt a duty to let off at him\r\nas soon as the soup appeared.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.em,{children:'Double meanings.\r\nThe next day, on the other hand, he seemed another man. It was he\r\nwho might rather have been taken for the virgin of the evening\r\nbefore, whilst the bride gave no sign that revealed anything. The\r\nshrewdest did not know what to make of it, and they looked at her\r\nwhen she passed near them with an unbounded concentration of\r\nmind. But Charles concealed nothing. He called her "my wife",\r\ntutoyed'})," her, asked for her of everyone, looked for her\r\neverywhere, and often he dragged her into the yards, where he\r\ncould be seen from far between the trees, putting his arm around\r\nher waist, and walking half-bending over her, ruffling the\r\nchemisette of her bodice with his head.\r\n*Used the familiar form of address.\r\nTwo days after the wedding the married pair left. Charles, on\r\naccount of his patients, could not be away longer. Old Rouault\r\nhad them driven back in his cart, and himself accompanied them as\r\nfar as Vassonville. Here he embraced his daughter for the last\r\ntime, got down, and went his way. When he had gone about a\r\nhundred paces he stopped, and as he saw the cart disappearing,\r\nits wheels turning in the dust, he gave a deep sigh. Then he\r\nremembered his wedding, the old times, the first pregnancy of his\r\nwife; he, too, had been very happy the day when he had taken her\r\nfrom her father to his home, and had carried her off on a\r\npillion, trotting through the snow, for it was near\r\nChristmas-time, and the country was all white. She held him by\r\none arm, her basket hanging from the other; the wind blew the\r\nlong lace of her Cauchois headdress so that it sometimes flapped\r\nacross his mouth, and when he turned his head he saw near him, on\r\nhis shoulder, her little rosy face, smiling silently under the\r\ngold bands of her cap. To warm her hands she put them from time\r\nto time in his breast. How long ago it all was! Their son would\r\nhave been thirty by now. Then he looked back and saw nothing on\r\nthe road. He felt dreary as an empty house; and tender memories\r\nmingling with the sad thoughts in his brain, addled by the fumes\r\nof the feast, he felt inclined for a moment to take a turn\r\ntowards the church. As he was afraid, however, that this sight\r\nwould make him yet more sad, he went right away home.\r\nMonsieur and Madame Charles arrived at Tostes about six o'clock.\r\nThe neighbors came to the windows to see their doctor's new wife.\r\nThe old servant presented herself, curtsied to her, apologised\r\nfor not having dinner ready, and suggested that madame, in the\r\nmeantime, should look over her house."]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter Five\r\nThe brick front was just in a line with the street, or rather the\r\nroad. Behind the door hung a cloak with a small collar, a bridle,\r\nand a black leather cap, and on the floor, in a corner, were a\r\npair of leggings, still covered with dry mud. On the right was\r\nthe one apartment, that was both dining and sitting room. A\r\ncanary yellow paper, relieved at the top by a garland of pale\r\nflowers, was puckered everywhere over the badly stretched canvas;\r\nwhite calico curtains with a red border hung crossways at the\r\nlength of the window; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with\r\na head of Hippocrates shone resplendent between two plate\r\ncandlesticks under oval shades. On the other side of the passage\r\nwas Charles's consulting room, a little room about six paces\r\nwide, with a table, three chairs, and an office chair. Volumes of\r\nthe \"Dictionary of Medical Science,\" uncut, but the binding\r\nrather the worse for the successive sales through which they had\r\ngone, occupied almost along the six shelves of a deal bookcase.\r\nThe smell of melted butter penetrated through the walls when he\r\nsaw patients, just as in the kitchen one could hear the people\r\ncoughing in the consulting room and recounting their histories.\r\nThen, opening on the yard, where the stable was, came a large\r\ndilapidated room with a stove, now used as a wood-house, cellar,\r\nand pantry, full of old rubbish, of empty casks, agricultural\r\nimplements past service, and a mass of dusty things whose use it\r\nwas impossible to guess.\r\nThe garden, longer than wide, ran between two mud walls with\r\nespaliered apricots, to a hawthorn hedge that separated it from\r\nthe field. In the middle was a slate sundial on a brick pedestal;\r\nfour flower beds with eglantines surrounded symmetrically the\r\nmore useful kitchen garden bed. Right at the bottom, under the\r\nspruce bushes, was a cure in plaster reading his breviary.\r\nEmma went upstairs. The first room was not furnished, but in the\r\nsecond, which was their bedroom, was a mahogany bedstead in an\r\nalcove with red drapery. A shell box adorned the chest of\r\ndrawers, and on the secretary near the window a bouquet of orange\r\nblossoms tied with white satin ribbons stood in a bottle. It was\r\na bride's bouquet; it was the other one's. She looked at it.\r\nCharles noticed it; he took it and carried it up to the attic,\r\nwhile Emma seated in an arm-chair (they were putting her things\r\ndown around her) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in a\r\nbandbox, and wondered, dreaming, what would be done with them if\r\nshe were to die.\r\nDuring the first days she occupied herself in thinking about\r\nchanges in the house. She took the shades off the candlesticks,\r\nhad new wallpaper put up, the staircase repainted, and seats made\r\nin the garden round the sundial; she even inquired how she could\r\nget a basin with a jet fountain and fishes. Finally her husband,\r\nknowing that she liked to drive out, picked up a second-hand\r\ndogcart, which, with new lamps and splashboard in striped\r\nleather, looked almost like a tilbury.\r\nHe was happy then, and without a care in the world. A meal\r\ntogether, a walk in the evening on the highroad, a gesture of her\r\nhands over her hair, the sight of her straw hat hanging from the\r\nwindow-fastener, and many another thing in which Charles had\r\nnever dreamed of pleasure, now made up the endless round of his\r\nhappiness. In bed, in the morning, by her side, on the pillow, he\r\nwatched the sunlight sinking into the down on her fair cheek,\r\nhalf hidden by the lappets of her night-cap. Seen thus closely,\r\nher eyes looked to him enlarged, especially when, on waking up,\r\nshe opened and shut them rapidly many times. Black in the shade,\r\ndark blue in broad daylight, they had, as it were, depths of\r\ndifferent colours, that, darker in the centre, grew paler towards\r\nthe surface of the eye. His own eyes lost themselves in these\r\ndepths; he saw himself in miniature down to the shoulders, with\r\nhis handkerchief round his head and the top of his shirt open. He\r\nrose. She came to the window to see him off, and stayed leaning\r\non the sill between two pots of geranium, clad in her dressing\r\ngown hanging loosely about her. Charles, in the street buckled\r\nhis spurs, his foot on the mounting stone, while she talked to\r\nhim from above, picking with her mouth some scrap of flower or\r\nleaf that she blew out at him. Then this, eddying, floating,\r\ndescribed semicircles in the air like a bird, and was caught\r\nbefore it reached the ground in the ill-groomed mane of the old\r\nwhite mare standing motionless at the door. Charles from\r\nhorseback threw her a kiss; she answered with a nod; she shut the\r\nwindow, and he set off. And then along the highroad, spreading\r\nout its long ribbon of dust, along the deep lanes that the trees\r\nbent over as in arbours, along paths where the corn reached to\r\nthe knees, with the sun on his back and the morning air in his\r\nnostrils, his heart full of the joys of the past night, his mind\r\nat rest, his flesh at ease, he went on, re-chewing his happiness,\r\nlike those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they\r\nare digesting.\r\nUntil now what good had he had of his life? His time at school,\r\nwhen he remained shut up within the high walls, alone, in the\r\nmidst of companions richer than he or cleverer at their work, who\r\nlaughed at his accent, who jeered at his clothes, and whose\r\nmothers came to the school with cakes in their muffs? Later on,\r\nwhen he studied medicine, and never had his purse full enough to\r\ntreat some little work-girl who would have become his mistress?\r\nAfterwards, he had lived fourteen months with the widow, whose\r\nfeet in bed were cold as icicles. But now he had for life this\r\nbeautiful woman whom he adored. For him the universe did not\r\nextend beyond the circumference of her petticoat, and he\r\nreproached himself with not loving her. He wanted to see her\r\nagain; he turned back quickly, ran up the stairs with a beating\r\nheart. Emma, in her room, was dressing; he came up on tiptoe,\r\nkissed her back; she gave a cry.\r\nHe could not keep from constantly touching her comb, her ring,\r\nher fichu; sometimes he gave her great sounding kisses with all\r\nhis mouth on her cheeks, or else little kisses in a row all along\r\nher bare arm from the tip of her fingers up to her shoulder, and\r\nshe put him away half-smiling, half-vexed, as you do a child who\r\nhangs about you.\r\nBefore marriage she thought herself in love; but the happiness\r\nthat should have followed this love not having come, she must,\r\nshe thought, have been mistaken. And Emma tried to find out what\r\none meant exactly in life by the words felicity, passion,\r\nrapture, that had seemed to her so beautiful in books."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Six\r\nShe had read "Paul and Virginia," and she had dreamed of the\r\nlittle bamboo-house, the nigger Domingo, the dog Fiddle, but\r\nabove all of the sweet friendship of some dear little brother,\r\nwho seeks red fruit for you on trees taller than steeples, or who\r\nruns barefoot over the sand, bringing you a bird\'s nest.\r\nWhen she was thirteen, her father himself took her to town to\r\nplace her in the convent. They stopped at an inn in the St.\r\nGervais quarter, where, at their supper, they used painted plates\r\nthat set forth the story of Mademoiselle de la Valliere. The\r\nexplanatory legends, chipped here and there by the scratching of\r\nknives, all glorified religion, the tendernesses of the heart,\r\nand the pomps of court.\r\nFar from being bored at first at the convent, she took pleasure\r\nin the society of the good sisters, who, to amuse her, took her\r\nto the chapel, which one entered from the refectory by a long\r\ncorridor. She played very little during recreation hours, knew\r\nher catechism well, and it was she who always answered Monsieur\r\nle Vicaire\'s difficult questions. Living thus, without every\r\nleaving the warm atmosphere of the classrooms, and amid these\r\npale-faced women wearing rosaries with brass crosses, she was\r\nsoftly lulled by the mystic languor exhaled in the perfumes of\r\nthe altar, the freshness of the holy water, and the lights of the\r\ntapers. Instead of attending to mass, she looked at the pious\r\nvignettes with their azure borders in her book, and she loved the\r\nsick lamb, the sacred heart pierced with sharp arrows, or the\r\npoor Jesus sinking beneath the cross he carries. She tried, by\r\nway of mortification, to eat nothing a whole day. She puzzled her\r\nhead to find some vow to fulfil.\r\nWhen she went to confession, she invented little sins in order\r\nthat she might stay there longer, kneeling in the shadow, her\r\nhands joined, her face against the grating beneath the whispering\r\nof the priest. The comparisons of betrothed, husband, celestial\r\nlover, and eternal marriage, that recur in sermons, stirred\r\nwithin her soul depths of unexpected sweetness.\r\nIn the evening, before prayers, there was some religious reading\r\nin the study. On week-nights it was some abstract of sacred\r\nhistory or the Lectures of the Abbe Frayssinous, and on Sundays\r\npassages from the "Genie du Christianisme," as a recreation. How\r\nshe listened at first to the sonorous lamentations of its\r\nromantic melancholies reechoing through the world and eternity!\r\nIf her childhood had been spent in the shop-parlour of some\r\nbusiness quarter, she might perhaps have opened her heart to\r\nthose lyrical invasions of Nature, which usually come to us only\r\nthrough translation in books. But she knew the country too well;\r\nshe knew the lowing of cattle, the milking, the ploughs.\r\nAccustomed to calm aspects of life, she turned, on the contrary,\r\nto those of excitement. She loved the sea only for the sake of\r\nits storms, and the green fields only when broken up by ruins.\r\nShe wanted to get some personal profit out of things, and she\r\nrejected as useless all that did not contribute to the immediate\r\ndesires of her heart, being of a temperament more sentimental\r\nthan artistic, looking for emotions, not landscapes.\r\nAt the convent there was an old maid who came for a week each\r\nmonth to mend the linen. Patronized by the clergy, because she\r\nbelonged to an ancient family of noblemen ruined by the\r\nRevolution, she dined in the refectory at the table of the good\r\nsisters, and after the meal had a bit of chat with them before\r\ngoing back to her work. The girls often slipped out from the\r\nstudy to go and see her. She knew by heart the love songs of the\r\nlast century, and sang them in a low voice as she stitched away.\r\nShe told stories, gave them news, went errands in the town, and\r\non the sly lent the big girls some novel, that she always carried\r\nin the pockets of her apron, and of which the good lady herself\r\nswallowed long chapters in the intervals of her work. They were\r\nall love, lovers, sweethearts, persecuted ladies fainting in\r\nlonely pavilions, postilions killed at every stage, horses ridden\r\nto death on every page, sombre forests, heartaches, vows, sobs,\r\ntears and kisses, little skiffs by moonlight, nightingales in\r\nshady groves, "gentlemen" brave as lions, gentle as lambs,\r\nvirtuous as no one ever was, always well dressed, and weeping\r\nlike fountains. For six months, then, Emma, at fifteen years of\r\nage, made her hands dirty with books from old lending libraries.\r\nThrough Walter Scott, later on, she fell in love with historical\r\nevents, dreamed of old chests, guard-rooms and minstrels. She\r\nwould have liked to live in some old manor-house, like those\r\nlong-waisted chatelaines who, in the shade of pointed arches,\r\nspent their days leaning on the stone, chin in hand, watching a\r\ncavalier with white plume galloping on his black horse from the\r\ndistant fields. At this time she had a cult for Mary Stuart and\r\nenthusiastic veneration for illustrious or unhappy women. Joan of\r\nArc, Heloise, Agnes Sorel, the beautiful Ferroniere, and Clemence\r\nIsaure stood out to her like comets in the dark immensity of\r\nheaven, where also were seen, lost in shadow, and all\r\nunconnected, St. Louis with his oak, the dying Bayard, some\r\ncruelties of Louis XI, a little of St. Bartholomew\'s Day, the\r\nplume of the Bearnais, and always the remembrance of the plates\r\npainted in honour of Louis XIV.\r\nIn the music class, in the ballads she sang, there was nothing\r\nbut little angels with golden wings, madonnas, lagunes,\r\ngondoliers;-mild compositions that allowed her to catch a glimpse\r\nathwart the obscurity of style and the weakness of the music of\r\nthe attractive phantasmagoria of sentimental realities. Some of\r\nher companions brought "keepsakes" given them as new year\'s gifts\r\nto the convent. These had to be hidden; it was quite an\r\nundertaking; they were read in the dormitory. Delicately handling\r\nthe beautiful satin bindings, Emma looked with dazzled eyes at\r\nthe names of the unknown authors, who had signed their verses for\r\nthe most part as counts or viscounts.\r\nShe trembled as she blew back the tissue paper over the engraving\r\nand saw it folded in two and fall gently against the page. Here\r\nbehind the balustrade of a balcony was a young man in a short\r\ncloak, holding in his arms a young girl in a white dress wearing\r\nan alms-bag at her belt; or there were nameless portraits of\r\nEnglish ladies with fair curls, who looked at you from under\r\ntheir round straw hats with their large clear eyes. Some there\r\nwere lounging in their carriages, gliding through parks, a\r\ngreyhound bounding along in front of the equipage driven at a\r\ntrot by two midget postilions in white breeches. Others, dreaming\r\non sofas with an open letter, gazed at the moon through a\r\nslightly open window half draped by a black curtain. The naive\r\nones, a tear on their cheeks, were kissing doves through the bars\r\nof a Gothic cage, or, smiling, their heads on one side, were\r\nplucking the leaves of a marguerite with their taper fingers,\r\nthat curved at the tips like peaked shoes. And you, too, were\r\nthere, Sultans with long pipes reclining beneath arbours in the\r\narms of Bayaderes; Djiaours, Turkish sabres, Greek caps; and you\r\nespecially, pale landscapes of dithyrambic lands, that often show\r\nus at once palm trees and firs, tigers on the right, a lion to\r\nthe left, Tartar minarets on the horizon; the whole framed by a\r\nvery neat virgin forest, and with a great perpendicular sunbeam\r\ntrembling in the water, where, standing out in relief like white\r\nexcoriations on a steel-grey ground, swans are swimming about.\r\nAnd the shade of the argand lamp fastened to the wall above\r\nEmma\'s head lighted up all these pictures of the world, that\r\npassed before her one by one in the silence of the dormitory, and\r\nto the distant noise of some belated carriage rolling over the\r\nBoulevards.\r\nWhen her mother died she cried much the first few days. She had a\r\nfuneral picture made with the hair of the deceased, and, in a\r\nletter sent to the Bertaux full of sad reflections on life, she\r\nasked to be buried later on in the same grave. The goodman\r\nthought she must be ill, and came to see her. Emma was secretly\r\npleased that she had reached at a first attempt the rare ideal of\r\npale lives, never attained by mediocre hearts. She let herself\r\nglide along with Lamartine meanderings, listened to harps on\r\nlakes, to all the songs of dying swans, to the falling of the\r\nleaves, the pure virgins ascending to heaven, and the voice of\r\nthe Eternal discoursing down the valleys. She wearied of it,\r\nwould not confess it, continued from habit, and at last was\r\nsurprised to feel herself soothed, and with no more sadness at\r\nheart than wrinkles on her brow.\r\nThe good nuns, who had been so sure of her vocation, perceived\r\nwith great astonishment that Mademoiselle Rouault seemed to be\r\nslipping from them. They had indeed been so lavish to her of\r\nprayers, retreats, novenas, and sermons, they had so often\r\npreached the respect due to saints and martyrs, and given so much\r\ngood advice as to the modesty of the body and the salvation of\r\nher soul, that she did as tightly reined horses; she pulled up\r\nshort and the bit slipped from her teeth. This nature, positive\r\nin the midst of its enthusiasms, that had loved the church for\r\nthe sake of the flowers, and music for the words of the songs,\r\nand literature for its passional stimulus, rebelled against the\r\nmysteries of faith as it grew irritated by discipline, a thing\r\nantipathetic to her constitution. When her father took her from\r\nschool, no one was sorry to see her go. The Lady Superior even\r\nthought that she had latterly been somewhat irreverent to the\r\ncommunity.\r\nEmma, at home once more, first took pleasure in looking after the\r\nservants, then grew disgusted with the country and missed her\r\nconvent. When Charles came to the Bertaux for the first time, she\r\nthought herself quite disillusioned, with nothing more to learn,\r\nand nothing more to feel.\r\nBut the uneasiness of her new position, or perhaps the\r\ndisturbance caused by the presence of this man, had sufficed to\r\nmake her believe that she at last felt that wondrous passion\r\nwhich, till then, like a great bird with rose-coloured wings,\r\nhung in the splendour of the skies of poesy; and now she could\r\nnot think that the calm in which she lived was the happiness she\r\nhad dreamed.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Seven\r\nShe thought, sometimes, that, after all, this was the happiest\r\ntime of her life--the honeymoon, as people called it. To taste\r\nthe full sweetness of it, it would have been necessary doubtless\r\nto fly to those lands with sonorous names where the days after\r\nmarriage are full of laziness most suave. In post chaises behind\r\nblue silken curtains to ride slowly up steep road, listening to\r\nthe song of the postilion re-echoed by the mountains, along with\r\nthe bells of goats and the muffled sound of a waterfall; at\r\nsunset on the shores of gulfs to breathe in the perfume of lemon\r\ntrees; then in the evening on the villa-terraces above, hand in\r\nhand to look at the stars, making plans for the future. It seemed\r\nto her that certain places on earth must bring happiness, as a\r\nplant peculiar to the soil, and that cannot thrive elsewhere. Why\r\ncould not she lean over balconies in Swiss chalets, or enshrine\r\nher melancholy in a Scotch cottage, with a husband dressed in a\r\nblack velvet coat with long tails, and thin shoes, a pointed hat\r\nand frills? Perhaps she would have liked to confide all these\r\nthings to someone. But how tell an undefinable uneasiness,\r\nvariable as the clouds, unstable as the winds? Words failed\r\nher--the opportunity, the courage.\r\nIf Charles had but wished it, if he had guessed it, if his look\r\nhad but once met her thought, it seemed to her that a sudden\r\nplenty would have gone out from her heart, as the fruit falls\r\nfrom a tree when shaken by a hand. But as the intimacy of their\r\nlife became deeper, the greater became the gulf that separated\r\nher from him.\r\nCharles\'s conversation was commonplace as a street pavement, and\r\neveryone\'s ideas trooped through it in their everyday garb,\r\nwithout exciting emotion, laughter, or thought. He had never had\r\nthe curiosity, he said, while he lived at Rouen, to go to the\r\ntheatre to see the actors from Paris. He could neither swim, nor\r\nfence, nor shoot, and one day he could not explain some term of\r\nhorsemanship to her that she had come across in a novel.\r\nA man, on the contrary, should he not know everything, excel in\r\nmanifold activities, initiate you into the energies of passion,\r\nthe refinements of life, all mysteries? But this one taught\r\nnothing, knew nothing, wished nothing. He thought her happy; and\r\nshe resented this easy calm, this serene heaviness, the very\r\nhappiness she gave him.\r\nSometimes she would draw; and it was great amusement to Charles\r\nto stand there bolt upright and watch her bend over her\r\ncardboard, with eyes half-closed the better to see her work, or\r\nrolling, between her fingers, little bread-pellets. As to the\r\npiano, the more quickly her fingers glided over it the more he\r\nwondered. She struck the notes with aplomb, and ran from top to\r\nbottom of the keyboard without a break. Thus shaken up, the old\r\ninstrument, whose strings buzzed, could be heard at the other end\r\nof the village when the window was open, and often the bailiff\'s\r\nclerk, passing along the highroad bare-headed and in list\r\nslippers, stopped to listen, his sheet of paper in his hand.\r\nEmma, on the other hand, knew how to look after her house. She\r\nsent the patients\' accounts in well-phrased letters that had no\r\nsuggestion of a bill. When they had a neighbour to dinner on\r\nSundays, she managed to have some tasty dish--piled up pyramids\r\nof greengages on vine leaves, served up preserves turned out into\r\nplates--and even spoke of buying finger-glasses for dessert. From\r\nall this much consideration was extended to Bovary.\r\nCharles finished by rising in his own esteem for possessing such\r\na wife. He showed with pride in the sitting room two small pencil\r\nsketched by her that he had had framed in very large frames, and\r\nhung up against the wallpaper by long green cords. People\r\nreturning from mass saw him at his door in his wool-work\r\nslippers.\r\nHe came home late--at ten o\'clock, at midnight sometimes. Then he\r\nasked for something to eat, and as the servant had gone to bed,\r\nEmma waited on him. He took off his coat to dine more at his\r\nease. He told her, one after the other, the people he had met,\r\nthe villages where he had been, the prescriptions ha had written,\r\nand, well  pleased with himself, he finished the remainder of the\r\nboiled beef and onions, picked pieces off the cheese, munched an\r\napple, emptied his water-bottle, and then went to bed, and lay on\r\nhis back and snored.\r\nAs he had been for a time accustomed to wear nightcaps, his\r\nhandkerchief would not keep down over his ears, so that his hair\r\nin the morning was all tumbled pell-mell about his face and\r\nwhitened with the feathers of the pillow, whose strings came\r\nuntied during the night. He always wore thick boots that had two\r\nlong creases over the instep running obliquely towards the ankle,\r\nwhile the rest of the upper continued in a straight line as if\r\nstretched on a wooden foot. He said that "was quite good enough\r\nfor the country."\r\nHis mother approved of his economy, for she came to see him as\r\nformerly when there had been some violent row at her place; and\r\nyet Madame Bovary senior seemed prejudiced against her\r\ndaughter-in-law. She thought "her ways too fine for their\r\nposition"; the wood, the sugar, and the candles disappeared as\r\n"at a grand establishment," and the amount of firing in the\r\nkitchen would have been enough for twenty-five courses. She put\r\nher linen in order for her in the presses, and taught her to keep\r\nan eye on the butcher when he brought the meat. Emma put up with\r\nthese lessons. Madame Bovary was lavish of them; and the words\r\n"daughter" and "mother" were exchanged all day long, accompanied\r\nby little quiverings of the lips, each one uttering gentle words\r\nin a voice trembling with anger.\r\nIn Madame Dubuc\'s time the old woman felt that she was still the\r\nfavorite; but now the love of Charles for Emma seemed to her a\r\ndesertion from her tenderness, an encroachment upon what was\r\nhers, and she watched her son\'s happiness in sad silence, as a\r\nruined man looks through the windows at people dining in his old\r\nhouse. She recalled to him as remembrances her troubles and her\r\nsacrifices, and, comparing these with Emma\'s negligence, came to\r\nthe conclusion that it was not reasonable to adore her so\r\nexclusively.\r\nCharles knew not what to answer: he respected his mother, and he\r\nloved his wife infinitely; he considered the judgment of the one\r\ninfallible, and yet he thought the conduct of the other\r\nirreproachable. When Madam Bovary had gone, he tried timidly and\r\nin the same terms to hazard one or two of the more anodyne\r\nobservations he had heard from his mamma. Emma proved to him with\r\na word that he was mistaken, and sent him off to his patients.\r\nAnd yet, in accord with theories she believed right, she wanted\r\nto make herself in love with him. By moonlight in the garden she\r\nrecited all the passionate rhymes she knew by heart, and,\r\nsighing, sang to him many melancholy adagios; but she found\r\nherself as calm after as before, and Charles seemed no more\r\namorous and no more moved.\r\nWhen she had thus for a while struck the flint on her heart\r\nwithout getting a spark, incapable, moreover, of understanding\r\nwhat she did not experience as of believing anything that did not\r\npresent itself in conventional forms, she persuaded herself\r\nwithout difficulty that Charles\'s passion was nothing very\r\nexorbitant. His outbursts became regular; he embraced her at\r\ncertain fixed times. It was one habit among other habits, and,\r\nlike a dessert, looked forward to after the monotony of dinner.\r\nA gamekeeper, cured by the doctor of inflammation of the lungs,\r\nhad given madame a little Italian greyhound; she took her out\r\nwalking, for she went out sometimes in order to be alone for a\r\nmoment, and not to see before her eyes the eternal garden and the\r\ndusty road. She went as far as the beeches of Banneville, near\r\nthe deserted pavilion which forms an angle of the wall on the\r\nside of the country. Amidst the vegetation of the ditch there are\r\nlong reeds with leaves that cut you.\r\nShe began by looking round her to see if nothing had changed\r\nsince last she had been there. She found again in the same places\r\nthe foxgloves and wallflowers, the beds of nettles growing round\r\nthe big stones, and the patches of lichen along the three\r\nwindows, whose shutters, always closed, were rotting away on\r\ntheir rusty iron bars. Her thoughts, aimless at first, wandered\r\nat random, like her greyhound, who ran round and round in the\r\nfields, yelping after the yellow butterflies, chasing the\r\nshrew-mice, or nibbling the poppies on the edge of a cornfield.\r\nThen gradually her ideas took definite shape, and, sitting on the\r\ngrass that she dug up with little prods of her sunshade, Emma\r\nrepeated to herself, "Good heavens! Why did I marry?"\r\nShe asked herself if by some other chance combination it would\r\nhave not been possible to meet another man; and she tried to\r\nimagine what would have been these unrealised events, this\r\ndifferent life, this unknown husband. All, surely, could not be\r\nlike this one. He might have been handsome, witty, distinguished,\r\nattractive, such as, no doubt, her old companions of the convent\r\nhad married. What were they doing now? In town, with the noise of\r\nthe streets, the buzz of the theatres and the lights of the\r\nballroom, they were living lives where the heart expands, the\r\nsenses bourgeon out. But she--her life was cold as a garret whose\r\ndormer window looks on the north, and ennui, the silent spider,\r\nwas weaving its web in the darkness in every corner of her heart.\r\nShe recalled the prize days, when she mounted the platform to\r\nreceive her little crowns, with her hair in long plaits. In her\r\nwhite frock and open prunella shoes she had a pretty way, and\r\nwhen she went back to her seat, the gentlemen bent over her to\r\ncongratulate her; the courtyard was full of carriages; farewells\r\nwere called to her through their windows; the music master with\r\nhis violin case bowed in passing by. How far all of this! How far\r\naway! She called Djali, took her between her knees, and smoothed\r\nthe long delicate head, saying, "Come, kiss mistress; you have no\r\ntroubles."\r\nThen noting the melancholy face of the graceful animal, who\r\nyawned slowly, she softened, and comparing her to herself, spoke\r\nto her aloud as to somebody in trouble whom one is consoling.\r\nOccasionally there came gusts of winds, breezes from the sea\r\nrolling in one sweep over the whole plateau of the Caux country,\r\nwhich brought even to these fields a salt freshness. The rushes,\r\nclose to the ground, whistled; the branches trembled in a swift\r\nrustling, while their summits, ceaselessly swaying, kept up a\r\ndeep murmur. Emma drew her shawl round her shoulders and rose.\r\nIn the avenue a green light dimmed by the leaves lit up the short\r\nmoss that crackled softly beneath her feet. The sun was setting;\r\nthe sky showed red between the branches, and the trunks of the\r\ntrees, uniform, and planted in a straight line, seemed a brown\r\ncolonnade standing out against a background of gold. A fear took\r\nhold of her; she called Djali, and hurriedly returned to Tostes\r\nby the high road, threw herself into an armchair, and for the\r\nrest of the evening did not speak.\r\nBut towards the end of September something extraordinary fell\r\nupon her life; she was invited by the Marquis d\'Andervilliers to\r\nVaubyessard.\r\nSecretary of State under the Restoration, the Marquis, anxious to\r\nre-enter political life, set about preparing for his candidature\r\nto the Chamber of Deputies long beforehand. In the winter he\r\ndistributed a great deal of wood, and in the Conseil General\r\nalways enthusiastically demanded new roads for his\r\narrondissement. During the dog-days he had suffered from an\r\nabscess, which Charles had cured as if by miracle by giving a\r\ntimely little touch with the lancet. The steward sent to Tostes\r\nto pay for the operation reported in the evening that he had seen\r\nsome superb cherries in the doctor\'s little garden. Now cherry\r\ntrees did not thrive at Vaubyessard; the Marquis asked Bovary for\r\nsome slips; made it his business to thank his personally; saw\r\nEmma; thought she had a pretty figure, and that she did not bow\r\nlike a peasant; so that he did not think he was going beyond the\r\nbounds of condescension, nor, on the other hand, making a\r\nmistake, in inviting the young couple.\r\nOn Wednesday at three o\'clock, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, seated\r\nin their dog-cart, set out for Vaubyessard, with a great trunk\r\nstrapped on behind and a bonnet-box in front of the apron.\r\nBesides these Charles held a bandbox between his knees.\r\nThey arrived at nightfall, just as the lamps in the park were\r\nbeing lit to show the way for the carriages.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Eight\r\nThe chateau, a modern building in Italian style, with two\r\nprojecting wings and three flights of steps, lay at the foot of\r\nan immense green-sward, on which some cows were grazing among\r\ngroups of large trees set out at regular intervals, while large\r\nbeds of arbutus, rhododendron, syringas, and guelder roses bulged\r\nout their irregular clusters of green along the curve of the\r\ngravel path. A river flowed under a bridge; through the mist one\r\ncould distinguish buildings with thatched roofs scattered over\r\nthe field bordered by two gently sloping, well timbered hillocks,\r\nand in the background amid the trees rose in two parallel lines\r\nthe coach houses and stables, all that was left of the ruined old\r\nchateau.\r\nCharles\'s dog-cart pulled up before the middle flight of steps;\r\nservants appeared; the Marquis came forward, and, offering his\r\narm to the doctor\'s wife, conducted her to the vestibule.\r\nIt was paved with marble slabs, was very lofty, and the sound of\r\nfootsteps and that of voices re-echoed through it as in a church.\r\nOpposite rose a straight staircase, and on the left a gallery\r\noverlooking the garden led to the billiard room, through whose\r\ndoor one could hear the click of the ivory balls. As she crossed\r\nit to go to the drawing room, Emma saw standing round the table\r\nmen with grave faces, their chins resting on high cravats. They\r\nall wore orders, and smiled silently as they made their strokes.\r\nOn the dark wainscoting of the walls large gold frames bore at\r\nthe bottom names written in black letters. She read:\r\n"Jean-Antoine d\'Andervilliers d\'Yvervonbille, Count de la\r\nVaubyessard and Baron de la Fresnay, killed at the battle of\r\nCoutras on the 20th of October, 1857." And on another:\r\n"Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy d\'Andervilliers de la Vaubyessard,\r\nAdmiral of France and Chevalier of the Order of St. Michael,\r\nwounded at the battle of the Hougue-Saint-Vaast on the 29th of\r\nMay, 1692; died at Vaubyessard on the 23rd of January 1693." One\r\ncould hardly make out those that followed, for the light of the\r\nlamps lowered over the green cloth threw a dim shadow round the\r\nroom. Burnishing the horizontal pictures, it broke up against\r\nthese in delicate lines where there were cracks in the varnish,\r\nand from all these great black squares framed in with gold stood\r\nout here and there some lighter portion of the painting--a pale\r\nbrow, two eyes that looked at you, perukes flowing over and\r\npowdering red-coated shoulders, or the buckle of a garter above a\r\nwell-rounded calf.\r\nThe Marquis opened the drawing room door; one of the ladies (the\r\nMarchioness herself) came to meet Emma. She made her sit down by\r\nher on an ottoman, and began talking to her as amicably as if she\r\nhad known her a long time. She was a woman of about forty, with\r\nfine shoulders, a hook nose, a drawling voice, and on this\r\nevening she wore over her brown hair a simple guipure fichu that\r\nfell in a point at the back. A fair young woman sat in a\r\nhigh-backed chair in a corner; and gentlemen with flowers in\r\ntheir buttonholes were talking to ladies round the fire.\r\nAt seven dinner was served. The men, who were in the majority,\r\nsat down at the first table in the vestibule; the ladies at the\r\nsecond in the dining room with the Marquis and Marchioness.\r\nEmma, on entering, felt herself wrapped round by the warm air, a\r\nblending of the perfume of flowers and of the fine linen, of the\r\nfumes of the viands, and the odour of the truffles. The silver\r\ndish covers reflected the lighted wax candles in the candelabra,\r\nthe cut crystal covered with light steam reflected from one to\r\nthe other pale rays; bouquets were placed in a row the whole\r\nlength of the table; and in the large-bordered plates each\r\nnapkin, arranged after the fashion of a bishop\'s mitre, held\r\nbetween its two gaping folds a small oval shaped roll. The red\r\nclaws of lobsters hung over the dishes; rich fruit in open\r\nbaskets was piled up on moss; there were quails in their plumage;\r\nsmoke was rising; and in silk stockings, knee-breeches, white\r\ncravat, and frilled shirt, the steward, grave as a judge,\r\noffering ready carved dishes between the shoulders of the guests,\r\nwith a touch of the spoon gave you the piece chosen. On the large\r\nstove of porcelain inlaid with copper baguettes the statue of a\r\nwoman, draped to the chin, gazed motionless on the room full of\r\nlife.\r\nMadame Bovary noticed that many ladies had not put their gloves\r\nin their glasses.\r\nBut at the upper end of the table, alone amongst all these women,\r\nbent over his full plate, and his napkin tied round his neck like\r\na child, an old man sat eating, letting drops of gravy drip from\r\nhis mouth. His eyes were bloodshot, and he wore a little queue\r\ntied with black ribbon. He was the Marquis\'s father-in-law, the\r\nold Duke de Laverdiere, once on a time favourite of the Count\r\nd\'Artois, in the days of the Vaudreuil hunting-parties at the\r\nMarquis de Conflans\', and had been, it was said, the lover of\r\nQueen Marie Antoinette, between Monsieur de Coigny and Monsieur\r\nde Lauzun. He had lived a life of noisy debauch, full of duels,\r\nbets, elopements; he had squandered his fortune and frightened\r\nall his family. A servant behind his chair named aloud to him in\r\nhis ear the dishes that he pointed to stammering, and constantly\r\nEmma\'s eyes turned involuntarily to this old man with hanging\r\nlips, as to something extraordinary. He had lived at court and\r\nslept in the bed of queens! Iced champagne was poured out. Emma\r\nshivered all over as she felt it cold in her mouth. She had never\r\nseen pomegranates nor tasted pineapples. The powdered sugar even\r\nseemed to her whiter and finer than elsewhere.\r\nThe ladies afterwards went to their rooms to prepare for the\r\nball.\r\nEmma made her toilet with the fastidious care of an actress on\r\nher debut. She did her hair according to the directions of the\r\nhairdresser, and put on the barege dress spread out upon the bed.\r\nCharles\'s trousers were tight across the belly.\r\n"My trouser-straps will be rather awkward for dancing," he said.\r\n"Dancing?" repeated Emma.\r\n"Yes!"\r\n"Why, you must be mad! They would make fun of you; keep your\r\nplace. Besides, it is more becoming for a doctor," she added.\r\nCharles was silent. He walked up and down waiting for Emma to\r\nfinish dressing.\r\nHe saw her from behind in the glass between two lights. Her black\r\neyes seemed blacker than ever. Her hair, undulating towards the\r\nears, shone with a blue lustre; a rose in her chignon trembled on\r\nits mobile stalk, with artificial dewdrops on the tip of the\r\nleaves. She wore a gown of pale saffron trimmed with three\r\nbouquets of pompon roses mixed with green.\r\nCharles came and kissed her on her shoulder.\r\n"Let me alone!" she said; "you are tumbling me."\r\nOne could hear the flourish of the violin and the notes of a\r\nhorn. She went downstairs restraining herself from running.\r\nDancing had begun. Guests were arriving. There was some crushing.\r\nShe sat down on a form near the door.\r\nThe quadrille over, the floor was occupied by groups of men\r\nstanding up and talking and servants in livery bearing large\r\ntrays. Along the line of seated women painted fans were\r\nfluttering, bouquets half hid smiling faces, and gold stoppered\r\nscent-bottles were turned in partly-closed hands, whose white\r\ngloves outlined the nails and tightened on the flesh at the\r\nwrists. Lace trimmings, diamond brooches, medallion bracelets\r\ntrembled on bodices, gleamed on breasts, clinked on bare arms.\r\nThe hair, well-smoothed over the temples and knotted at the nape,\r\nbore crowns, or bunches, or sprays of mytosotis, jasmine,\r\npomegranate blossoms, ears of corn, and corn-flowers. Calmly\r\nseated in their places, mothers with forbidding countenances were\r\nwearing red turbans.\r\nEmma\'s heart beat rather faster when, her partner holding her by\r\nthe tips of the fingers, she took her place in a line with the\r\ndancers, and waited for the first note to start. But her emotion\r\nsoon vanished, and, swaying to the rhythm of the orchestra, she\r\nglided forward with slight movements of the neck. A smile rose to\r\nher lips at certain delicate phrases of the violin, that\r\nsometimes played alone while the other instruments were silent;\r\none could hear the clear clink of the louis d\'or that were being\r\nthrown down upon the card tables in the next room; then all\r\nstruck again, the cornet-a-piston uttered its sonorous note, feet\r\nmarked time, skirts swelled and rustled, hands touched and\r\nparted; the same eyes falling before you met yours again.\r\nA few men (some fifteen or so), of twenty-five to forty,\r\nscattered here and there among the dancers or talking at the\r\ndoorways, distinguished themselves from the crowd by a certain\r\nair of breeding, whatever their differences in age, dress, or\r\nface.\r\nTheir clothes, better made, seemed of finer cloth, and their\r\nhair, brought forward in curls towards the temples, glossy with\r\nmore delicate pomades. They had the complexion of wealth--that\r\nclear complexion that is heightened by the pallor of porcelain,\r\nthe shimmer of satin, the veneer of old furniture, and that an\r\nordered regimen of exquisite nurture maintains at its best. Their\r\nnecks moved easily in their low cravats, their long whiskers fell\r\nover their turned-down collars, they wiped their lips upon\r\nhandkerchiefs with embroidered initials that gave forth a subtle\r\nperfume. Those who were beginning to grow old had an air of\r\nyouth, while there was something mature in the faces of the\r\nyoung. In their unconcerned looks was the calm of passions daily\r\nsatiated, and through all their gentleness of manner pierced that\r\npeculiar brutality, the result of a command of half-easy things,\r\nin which force is exercised and vanity amused--the management of\r\nthoroughbred horses and the society of loose women.\r\nA few steps from Emma a gentleman in a blue coat was talking of\r\nItaly with a pale young woman wearing a parure of pearls.\r\nThey were praising the breadth of the columns of St. Peter\'s,\r\nTivoly, Vesuvius, Castellamare, and Cassines, the roses of Genoa,\r\nthe Coliseum by moonlight. With her other ear Emma was listening\r\nto a conversation full of words she did not understand. A circle\r\ngathered round a very young man who the week before had beaten\r\n"Miss Arabella" and "Romolus," and won two thousand louis jumping\r\na ditch in England. One complained that his racehorses were\r\ngrowing fat; another of the printers\' errors that had disfigured\r\nthe name of his horse.\r\nThe atmosphere of the ball was heavy; the lamps were growing dim.\r\nGuests were flocking to the billiard room. A servant got upon a\r\nchair and broke the window-panes. At the crash of the glass\r\nMadame Bovary turned her head and saw in the garden the faces of\r\npeasants pressed against the window looking in at them. Then the\r\nmemory of the Bertaux came back to her. She saw the farm again,\r\nthe muddy pond, her father in a blouse under the apple trees, and\r\nshe saw herself again as formerly, skimming with her finger the\r\ncream off the milk-pans in the dairy. But in the refulgence of\r\nthe present hour her past life, so distinct until then, faded\r\naway completely, and she almost doubted having lived it. She was\r\nthere; beyond the ball was only shadow overspreading all the\r\nrest. She was just eating a maraschino ice that she held with her\r\nleft hand in a silver-gilt cup, her eyes half-closed, and the\r\nspoon between her teeth.\r\nA lady near her dropped her fan. A gentlemen was passing.\r\n"Would you be so good," said the lady, "as to pick up my fan that\r\nhas fallen behind the sofa?"\r\nThe gentleman bowed, and as he moved to stretch out his arm, Emma\r\nsaw the hand of a young woman throw something white, folded in a\r\ntriangle, into his hat. The gentleman, picking up the fan,\r\noffered it to the lady respectfully; she thanked him with an\r\ninclination of the head, and began smelling her bouquet.\r\nAfter supper, where were plenty of Spanish and Rhine wines, soups\r\na la bisque and au lait d\'amandes*, puddings a la Trafalgar, and\r\nall sorts of cold meats with jellies that trembled in the dishes,\r\nthe carriages one after the other began to drive off. Raising the\r\ncorners of the muslin curtain, one could see the light of their\r\nlanterns glimmering through the darkness. The seats began to\r\nempty, some card-players were still left; the musicians were\r\ncooling the tips of their fingers on their tongues. Charles was\r\nhalf asleep, his back propped against a door.\r\n*With almond milk20\r\nAt three o\'clock the cotillion began. Emma did not know how to waltz.\r\nEveryone was waltzing, Mademoiselle d\'Andervilliers herself and the Marquis;\r\nonly the guests staying at the castle were still there, about a\r\ndozen persons.\r\nOne of the waltzers, however, who was familiarly called Viscount,\r\nand whose low cut waistcoat seemed moulded to his chest, came a\r\nsecond time to ask Madame Bovary to dance, assuring her that he\r\nwould guide her, and that she would get through it very well.\r\nThey began slowly, then went more rapidly. They turned; all\r\naround them was turning--the lamps, the furniture, the\r\nwainscoting, the floor, like a disc on a pivot. On passing near\r\nthe doors the bottom of Emma\'s dress caught against his trousers.\r\nTheir legs commingled; he looked down at her; she raised her eyes\r\nto his. A torpor seized her; she stopped. They started again, and\r\nwith a more rapid movement; the Viscount, dragging her along\r\ndisappeared with her to the end of the gallery, where panting,\r\nshe almost fell, and for a moment rested her head upon his\r\nbreast. And then, still turning, but more slowly, he guided her\r\nback to her seat. She leaned back against the wall and covered\r\nher eyes with her hands.\r\nWhen she opened them again, in the middle of the drawing room\r\nthree waltzers were kneeling before a lady sitting on a stool.\r\nShe chose the Viscount, and the violin struck up once more.\r\nEveryone looked at them. They passed and re-passed, she with\r\nrigid body, her chin bent down, and he always in the same pose,\r\nhis figure curved, his elbow rounded, his chin thrown forward.\r\nThat woman knew how to waltz! They kept up a long time, and tired\r\nout all the others.\r\nThen they talked a few moments longer, and after the goodnights,\r\nor rather good mornings, the guests of the chateau retired to\r\nbed.\r\nCharles dragged himself up by the balusters. His "knees were\r\ngoing up into his body." He had spent five consecutive hours\r\nstanding bolt upright at the card tables, watching them play\r\nwhist, without understanding anything about it, and it was with a\r\ndeep sigh of relief that he pulled off his boots.\r\nEmma threw a shawl over her shoulders, opened the window, and\r\nleant out.\r\nThe night was dark; some drops of rain were falling. She breathed\r\nin the damp wind that refreshed her eyelids. The music of the\r\nball was still murmuring in her ears. And she tried to keep\r\nherself awake in order to prolong the illusion that this\r\nluxurious life that she would soon have to give up.\r\nDay began to break. She looked long at the windows of the\r\nchateau, trying to guess which were the rooms of all those she\r\nhad noticed the evening before. She would fain have known their\r\nlives, have penetrated, blended with them. But she was shivering\r\nwith cold. She undressed, and cowered down between the sheets\r\nagainst Charles, who was asleep.\r\nThere were a great many people to luncheon. The repast lasted ten\r\nminutes; no liqueurs were served, which astonished the doctor.\r\nNext, Mademoiselle d"Andervilliers collected some pieces of roll\r\nin a small basket to take them to the swans on the ornamental\r\nwaters, and they went to walk in the hot-houses, where strange\r\nplants, bristling with hairs, rose in pyramids under hanging\r\nvases, whence, as from over-filled nests of serpents, fell long\r\ngreen cords interlacing. The orangery, which was at the other\r\nend, led by a covered way to the outhouses of the chateau. The\r\nMarquis, to amuse the young woman, took her to see the stables.\r\nAbove the basket-shaped racks porcelain slabs bore the names of\r\nthe horses in black letters. Each animal in its stall whisked its\r\ntail when anyone went near and said "Tchk! tchk!" The boards of\r\nthe harness room shone like the flooring of a drawing room. The\r\ncarriage harness was piled up in the middle against two twisted\r\ncolumns, and the bits, the whips, the spurs, the curbs, were\r\nranged in a line all along the wall.\r\nCharles, meanwhile, went to ask a groom to put his horse to. The\r\ndog-cart was brought to the foot of the steps, and, all the\r\nparcels being crammed in, the Bovarys paid their respects to the\r\nMarquis and Marchioness and set out again for Tostes.\r\nEmma watched the turning wheels in silence. Charles, on the\r\nextreme edge of the seat, held the reins with his two arms wide\r\napart, and the little horse ambled along in the shafts that were\r\ntoo big for him. The loose reins hanging over his crupper were\r\nwet with foam, and the box fastened on behind the chaise gave\r\ngreat regular bumps against it.\r\nThey were on the heights of Thibourville when suddenly some\r\nhorsemen with cigars between their lips passed laughing. Emma\r\nthought she recognized the Viscount, turned back, and caught on\r\nthe horizon only the movement of the heads rising or falling with\r\nthe unequal cadence of the trot or gallop.\r\nA mile farther on they had to stop to mend with some string the\r\ntraces that had broken.\r\nBut Charles, giving a last look to the harness, saw something on\r\nthe ground between his horse\'s legs, and he picked up a\r\ncigar-case with a green silk border and beblazoned in the centre\r\nlike the door of a carriage.\r\n"There are even two cigars in it," said he; "they\'ll do for this\r\nevening after dinner."\r\n"Why, do you smoke?" she asked.\r\n"Sometimes, when I get a chance."\r\nHe put his find in his pocket and whipped up the nag.\r\nWhen they reached home the dinner was not ready. Madame lost her\r\ntemper. Nastasie answered rudely.\r\n"Leave the room!" said Emma. "You are forgetting yourself. I give\r\nyou warning."\r\nFor dinner there was onion soup and a piece of veal with sorrel.\r\nCharles, seated opposite Emma, rubbed his hands gleefully.\r\n"How good it is to be at home again!"\r\nNastasie could be heard crying. He was rather fond of the poor\r\ngirl. She had formerly, during the wearisome time of his\r\nwidowhood, kept him company many an evening. She had been his\r\nfirst patient, his oldest acquaintance in the place.\r\n"Have you given her warning for good?" he asked at last.\r\n"Yes. Who is to prevent me?" she replied.\r\nThen they warmed themselves in the kitchen while their room was\r\nbeing made ready. Charles began to smoke. He smoked with lips\r\nprotruding, spitting every moment, recoiling at every puff.\r\n"You\'ll make yourself ill," she said scornfully.\r\nHe put down his cigar and ran to swallow a glass of cold water at\r\nthe pump. Emma seizing hold of the cigar case threw it quickly to\r\nthe back of the cupboard.\r\nThe next day was a long one. She walked about her little garden,\r\nup and down the same walks, stopping before the beds, before the\r\nespalier, before the plaster curate, looking with amazement at\r\nall these things of once-on-a-time that she knew so well. How far\r\noff the ball seemed already! What was it that thus set so far\r\nasunder the morning of the day before yesterday and the evening\r\nof to-day? Her journey to Vaubyessard had made a hole in her\r\nlife, like one of those great crevices that a storm will\r\nsometimes make in one night in mountains. Still she was resigned.\r\nShe devoutly put away in her drawers her beautiful dress, down to\r\nthe satin shoes whose soles were yellowed with the slippery wax\r\nof the dancing floor. Her heart was like these. In its friction\r\nagainst wealth something had come over it that could not be\r\neffaced.\r\nThe memory of this ball, then, became an occupation for Emma.\r\nWhenever the Wednesday came round she said to herself as she\r\nawoke, "Ah! I was there a week--a fortnight--three weeks ago."\r\nAnd little by little the faces grew confused in her remembrance.\r\nShe forgot the tune of the quadrilles; she no longer saw the\r\nliveries and appointments so distinctly; some details escaped\r\nher, but the regret remained with her.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Nine\r\nOften when Charles was out she took from the cupboard, between\r\nthe folds of the linen where she had left it, the green silk\r\ncigar case. She looked at it, opened it, and even smelt the odour\r\nof the lining--a mixture of verbena and tobacco. Whose was it?\r\nThe Viscount\'s? Perhaps it was a present from his mistress. It\r\nhad been embroidered on some rosewood frame, a pretty little\r\nthing, hidden from all eyes, that had occupied many hours, and\r\nover which had fallen the soft curls of the pensive worker. A\r\nbreath of love had passed over the stitches on the canvas; each\r\nprick of the needle had fixed there a hope or a memory, and all\r\nthose interwoven threads of silk were but the continuity of the\r\nsame silent passion. And then one morning the Viscount had taken\r\nit away with him. Of what had they spoken when it lay upon the\r\nwide-mantelled chimneys between flower-vases and Pompadour\r\nclocks? She was at Tostes; he was at Paris now, far away! What\r\nwas this Paris like? What a vague name! She repeated it in a low\r\nvoice, for the mere pleasure of it; it rang in her ears like a\r\ngreat cathedral bell; it shone before her eyes, even on the\r\nlabels of her pomade-pots.\r\nAt night, when the carriers passed under her windows in their\r\ncarts singing the "Marjolaine," she awoke, and listened to the\r\nnoise of the iron-bound wheels, which, as they gained the country\r\nroad, was soon deadened by the soil. "They will be there\r\nto-morrow!" she said to herself.\r\nAnd she followed them in thought up and down the hills,\r\ntraversing villages, gliding along the highroads by the light of\r\nthe stars. At the end of some indefinite distance there was\r\nalways a confused spot, into which her dream died.\r\nShe bought a plan of Paris, and with the tip of her finger on the\r\nmap she walked about the capital. She went up the boulevards,\r\nstopping at every turning, between the lines of the streets, in\r\nfront of the white squares that represented the houses. At last\r\nshe would close the lids of her weary eyes, and see in the\r\ndarkness the gas jets flaring in the wind and the steps of\r\ncarriages lowered with much noise before the peristyles of\r\ntheatres.\r\nShe took in "La Corbeille," a lady\'s journal, and the "Sylphe des\r\nSalons." She devoured, without skipping a work, all the accounts\r\nof first nights, races, and soirees, took interest in the debut\r\nof a singer, in the opening of a new shop. She knew the latest\r\nfashions, the addresses of the best tailors, the days of the Bois\r\nand the Opera. In Eugene Sue she studied descriptions of\r\nfurniture; she read Balzac and George Sand, seeking in them\r\nimaginary satisfaction for her own desires. Even at table she had\r\nher book by her, and turned over the pages while Charles ate and\r\ntalked to her. The memory of the Viscount always returned as she\r\nread. Between him and the imaginary personages she made\r\ncomparisons. But the circle of which he was the centre gradually\r\nwidened round him, and the aureole that he bore, fading from his\r\nform, broadened out beyond, lighting up her other dreams.\r\nParis, more vague than the ocean, glimmered before Emma\'s eyes in\r\nan atmosphere of vermilion. The many lives that stirred amid this\r\ntumult were, however, divided into parts, classed as distinct\r\npictures. Emma perceived only two or three that hid from her all\r\nthe rest, and in themselves represented all humanity. The world\r\nof ambassadors moved over polished floors in drawing rooms lined\r\nwith mirrors, round oval tables covered with velvet and\r\ngold-fringed cloths. There were dresses with trains, deep\r\nmysteries, anguish hidden beneath smiles. Then came the society\r\nof the duchesses; all were pale; all got up at four o\'clock; the\r\nwomen, poor angels, wore English point on their petticoats; and\r\nthe men, unappreciated geniuses under a frivolous outward\r\nseeming, rode horses to death at pleasure parties, spent the\r\nsummer season at Baden, and towards the forties married\r\nheiresses. In the private rooms of restaurants, where one sups\r\nafter midnight by the light of wax candles, laughed the motley\r\ncrowd of men of letters and actresses. They were prodigal as\r\nkings, full of ideal, ambitious, fantastic frenzy. This was an\r\nexistence outside that of all others, between heaven and earth,\r\nin the midst of storms, having something of the sublime. For the\r\nrest of the world it was lost, with no particular place and as if\r\nnon-existent. The nearer things were, moreover, the more her\r\nthoughts turned away from them. All her immediate surroundings,\r\nthe wearisome country, the middle-class imbeciles, the mediocrity\r\nof existence, seemed to her exceptional, a peculiar chance that\r\nhad caught hold of her, while beyond stretched, as far as eye\r\ncould see, an immense land of joys and passions. She confused in\r\nher desire the sensualities of luxury with the delights of the\r\nheart, elegance of manners with delicacy of sentiment. Did not\r\nlove, like Indian plants, need a special soil, a particular\r\ntemperature? Signs by moonlight, long embraces, tears flowing\r\nover yielded hands, all the fevers of the flesh and the languors\r\nof tenderness could not be separated from the balconies of great\r\ncastles full of indolence, from boudoirs with silken curtains and\r\nthick carpets, well-filled flower-stands, a bed on a raised dias,\r\nnor from the flashing of precious stones and the shoulder-knots\r\nof liveries.\r\nThe lad from the posting house who came to groom the mare every\r\nmorning passed through the passage with his heavy wooden shoes;\r\nthere were holes in his blouse; his feet were bare in list\r\nslippers. And this was the groom in knee-britches with whom she\r\nhad to be content! His work done, he did not come back again all\r\nday, for Charles on his return put up his horse himself,\r\nunsaddled him and put on the halter, while the servant-girl\r\nbrought a bundle of straw and threw it as best she could into the\r\nmanger.\r\nTo replace Nastasie (who left Tostes shedding torrents of tears)\r\nEmma took into her service a young girl of fourteen, an orphan\r\nwith a sweet face. She forbade her wearing cotton caps, taught\r\nher to address her in the third person, to bring a glass of water\r\non a plate, to knock before coming into a room, to iron, starch,\r\nand to dress her--wanted to make a lady\'s-maid of her. The new\r\nservant obeyed without a murmur, so as not to be sent away; and\r\nas madame usually left the key in the sideboard, Felicite every\r\nevening took a small supply of sugar that she ate alone in her\r\nbed after she had said her prayers.\r\nSometimes in the afternoon she went to chat with the postilions.\r\nMadame was in her room upstairs. She wore an open dressing gown\r\nthat showed between the shawl facings of her bodice a pleated\r\nchamisette with three gold buttons. Her belt was a corded girdle\r\nwith great tassels, and her small garnet coloured slippers had a\r\nlarge knot of ribbon that fell over her instep. She had bought\r\nherself a blotting book, writing case, pen-holder, and envelopes,\r\nalthough she had no one to write to; she dusted her what-not,\r\nlooked at herself in the glass, picked up a book, and then,\r\ndreaming between the lines, let it drop on her knees. She longed\r\nto travel or to go back to her convent. She wished at the same\r\ntime to die and to live in Paris.\r\nCharles in snow and rain trotted across country. He ate omelettes\r\non farmhouse tables, poked his arm into damp beds, received the\r\ntepid spurt of blood-lettings in his face, listened to\r\ndeath-rattles, examined basins, turned over a good deal of dirty\r\nlinen; but every evening he found a blazing fire, his dinner\r\nready, easy-chairs, and a well-dressed woman, charming with an\r\nodour of freshness, though no one could say whence the perfume\r\ncame, or if it were not her skin that made odorous her chemise.\r\nShe charmed him by numerous attentions; now it was some new way\r\nof arranging paper sconces for the candles, a flounce that she\r\naltered on her gown, or an extraordinary name for some very\r\nsimple dish that the servant had spoilt, but that Charles\r\nswallowed with pleasure to the last mouthful. At Rouen she saw\r\nsome ladies who wore a bunch of charms on the watch-chains; she\r\nbought some charms. She wanted for her mantelpiece two large blue\r\nglass vases, and some time after an ivory necessaire with a\r\nsilver-gilt thimble. The less Charles understood these\r\nrefinements the more they seduced him. They added something to\r\nthe pleasure of the senses and to the comfort of his fireside. It\r\nwas like a golden dust sanding all along the narrow path of his\r\nlife.\r\nHe was well, looked well; his reputation was firmly established.\r\nThe country-folk loved him because he was not proud. He petted\r\nthe children, never went to the public house, and, moreover, his\r\nmorals inspired confidence. He was specially successful with\r\ncatarrhs and chest complaints. Being much afraid of killing his\r\npatients, Charles, in fact only prescribed sedatives, from time\r\nto time and emetic, a footbath, or leeches. It was not that he\r\nwas afraid of surgery; he bled people copiously like horses, and\r\nfor the taking out of teeth he had the "devil\'s own wrist."\r\nFinally, to keep up with the times, he took in "La Ruche\r\nMedicale," a new journal whose prospectus had been sent him. He\r\nread it a little after dinner, but in about five minutes the\r\nwarmth of the room added to the effect of his dinner sent him to\r\nsleep; and he sat there, his chin on his two hands and his hair\r\nspreading like a mane to the foot of the lamp. Emma looked at him\r\nand shrugged her shoulders. Why, at least, was not her husband\r\none of those men of taciturn passions who work at their books all\r\nnight, and at last, when about sixty, the age of rheumatism sets\r\nin, wear a string of orders on their ill-fitting black coat? She\r\ncould have wished this name of Bovary, which was hers, had been\r\nillustrious, to see it displayed at the booksellers\', repeated in\r\nthe newspapers, known to all France. But Charles had no ambition.\r\nAn Yvetot doctor whom he had lately met in consultation had\r\nsomewhat humiliated him at the very bedside of the patient,\r\nbefore the assembled relatives. When, in the evening, Charles\r\ntold her this anecdote, Emma inveighed loudly against his\r\ncolleague. Charles was much touched. He kissed her forehead with\r\na tear in his eyes. But she was angered with shame; she felt a\r\nwild desire to strike him; she went to open the window in the\r\npassage and breathed in the fresh air to calm herself.\r\n"What a man! What a man!" she said in a low voice, biting her\r\nlips.\r\nBesides, she was becoming more irritated with him. As he grew\r\nolder his manner grew heavier; at dessert he cut the corks of the\r\nempty bottles; after eating he cleaned his teeth with his tongue;\r\nin taking soup he made a gurgling noise with every spoonful; and,\r\nas he was getting fatter, the puffed-out cheeks seemed to push\r\nthe eyes, always small, up to the temples.\r\nSometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his\r\nwaistcoat, rearranged his cravat, and threw away the dirty gloves\r\nhe was going to put on; and this was not, as he fancied, for\r\nhimself; it was for herself, by a diffusion of egotism, of\r\nnervous irritation. Sometimes, too, she told him of what she had\r\nread, such as a passage in a novel, of a new play, or an anecdote\r\nof the "upper ten" that she had seen in a feuilleton; for, after\r\nall, Charles was something, an ever-open ear, and ever-ready\r\napprobation. She confided many a thing to her greyhound. She\r\nwould have done so to the logs in the fireplace or to the\r\npendulum of the clock.\r\nAt the bottom of her heart, however, she was waiting for\r\nsomething to happen. Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned\r\ndespairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off\r\nsome white sail in the mists of the horizon. She did not know\r\nwhat this chance would be, what wind would bring it her, towards\r\nwhat shore it would drive her, if it would be a shallop or a\r\nthree-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to the\r\nportholes. But each morning, as she awoke, she hoped it would\r\ncome that day; she listened to every sound, sprang up with a\r\nstart, wondered that it did not come; then at sunset, always more\r\nsaddened, she longed for the morrow.\r\nSpring came round. With the first warm weather, when the pear\r\ntrees began to blossom, she suffered from dyspnoea.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"From the beginning of July she counted how many weeks there were\r\nto October, thinking that perhaps the Marquis d'Andervilliers\r\nwould give another ball at Vaubyessard. But all September passed\r\nwithout letters or visits.\r\nAfter the ennui of this disappointment her heart once more\r\nremained empty, and then the same series of days recommenced. So\r\nnow they would thus follow one another, always the same,\r\nimmovable, and bringing nothing. Other lives, however flat, had\r\nat least the chance of some event. One adventure sometimes\r\nbrought with it infinite consequences and the scene changed. But\r\nnothing happened to her; God had willed it so! The future was a\r\ndark corridor, with its door at the end shut fast.\r\nShe gave up music. What was the good of playing? Who would hear\r\nher? Since she could never, in a velvet gown with short sleeves,\r\nstriking with her light fingers the ivory keys of an Erard at a\r\nconcert, feel the murmur of ecstasy envelop her like a breeze, it\r\nwas not worth while boring herself with practicing. Her drawing\r\ncardboard and her embroidery she left in the cupboard. What was\r\nthe good? What was the good? Sewing irritated her. \"I have read\r\neverything,\" she said to herself. And she sat there making the\r\ntongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling.\r\nHow sad she was on Sundays when vespers sounded! She listened\r\nwith dull attention to each stroke of the cracked bell. A cat\r\nslowly walking over some roof put up his back in the pale rays of\r\nthe sum. The wind on the highroad blew up clouds of dust. Afar\r\noff a dog sometimes howled; and the bell, keeping time, continued\r\nits monotonous ringing that died away over the fields.\r\nBut the people came out from church. The women in waxed clogs,\r\nthe peasants in new blouses, the little bare-headed children\r\nskipping along in front of them, all were going home. And till\r\nnightfall, five or six men, always the same, stayed playing at\r\ncorks in front of the large door of the inn.\r\nThe winter was severe. The windows every morning were covered\r\nwith rime, and the light shining through them, dim as through\r\nground-glass, sometimes did not change the whole day long. At\r\nfour o'clock the lamp had to be lighted.\r\nOn fine days she went down into the garden. The dew had left on\r\nthe cabbages a silver lace with long transparent threads\r\nspreading from one to the other. No birds were to be heard;\r\neverything seemed asleep, the espalier covered with straw, and\r\nthe vine, like a great sick serpent under the coping of the wall,\r\nalong which, on drawing hear, one saw the many-footed woodlice\r\ncrawling. Under the spruce by the hedgerow, the curie in the\r\nthree-cornered hat reading his breviary had lost his right foot,\r\nand the very plaster, scaling off with the frost, had left white\r\nscabs on his face.\r\nThen she went up again, shut her door, put on coals, and fainting\r\nwith the heat of the hearth, felt her boredom weigh more heavily\r\nthan ever. She would have like to go down and talk to the\r\nservant, but a sense of shame restrained her.\r\nEvery day at the same time the schoolmaster in a black skullcap\r\nopened the shutters of his house, and the rural policeman,\r\nwearing his sabre over his blouse, passed by. Night and morning\r\nthe post-horses, three by three, crossed the street to water at\r\nthe pond. From time to time the bell of a public house door rang,\r\nand when it was windy one could hear the little brass basins that\r\nserved as signs for the hairdresser's shop creaking on their two\r\nrods. This shop had as decoration an old engraving of a\r\nfashion-plate stuck against a windowpane and the wax bust of a\r\nwoman with yellow hair. He, too, the hairdresser, lamented his\r\nwasted calling, his hopeless future, and dreaming of some shop in\r\na big town--at Rouen, for example, overlooking the harbour, near\r\nthe theatre--he walked up and down all day from the mairie to the\r\nchurch, sombre and waiting for customers. When Madame Bovary\r\nlooked up, she always saw him there, like a sentinel on duty,\r\nwith his skullcap over his ears and his vest of lasting.\r\nSometimes in the afternoon outside the window of her room, the\r\nhead of a man appeared, a swarthy head with black whiskers,\r\nsmiling slowly, with a broad, gentle smile that showed his white\r\nteeth. A waltz immediately began and on the organ, in a little\r\ndrawing room, dancers the size of a finger, women in pink\r\nturbans, Tyrolians in jackets, monkeys in frock coats, gentlemen\r\nin knee-breeches, turned and turned between the sofas, the\r\nconsoles, multiplied in the bits of looking glass held together\r\nat their corners by a piece of gold paper. The man turned his\r\nhandle, looking to the right and left, and up at the windows. Now\r\nand again, while he shot out a long squirt of brown saliva\r\nagainst the milestone, with his knee raised his instrument, whose\r\nhard straps tired his shoulder; and now, doleful and drawling, or\r\ngay and hurried, the music escaped from the box, droning through\r\na curtain of pink taffeta under a brass claw in arabesque. They\r\nwere airs played in other places at the theatres, sung in drawing\r\nrooms, danced to at night under lighted lustres, echoes of the\r\nworld that reached even to Emma. Endless sarabands ran through\r\nher head, and, like an Indian dancing girl on the flowers of a\r\ncarpet, her thoughts leapt with the notes, swung from dream to\r\ndream, from sadness to sadness. When the man had caught some\r\ncoppers in his cap, he drew down an old cover of blue cloth,\r\nhitched his organ on to his back, and went off with a heavy\r\ntread. She watched him going.\r\nBut it was above all the meal-times that were unbearable to her,\r\nin this small room on the ground floor, with its smoking stove,\r\nits creaking door, the walls that sweated, the damp flags; all\r\nthe bitterness in life seemed served up on her plate, and with\r\nsmoke of the boiled beef there rose from her secret soul whiffs\r\nof sickliness. Charles was a slow eater; she played with a few\r\nnuts, or, leaning on her elbow, amused herself with drawing lines\r\nalong the oilcloth table cover with the point of her knife.\r\nShe now let everything in her household take care of itself, and\r\nMadame Bovary senior, when she came to spend part of Lent at\r\nTostes, was much surprised at the change. She who was formerly so\r\ncareful, so dainty, now passed whole days without dressing, wore\r\ngrey cotton stockings, and burnt tallow candles. She kept saying\r\nthey must be economical since they were not rich, adding that she\r\nwas very contented, very happy, that Tostes pleased her very\r\nmuch, with other speeches that closed the mouth of her\r\nmother-in-law. Besides, Emma no longer seemed inclined to follow\r\nher advice; once even, Madame Bovary having thought fit to\r\nmaintain that mistresses ought to keep an eye on the religion of\r\ntheir servants, she had answered with so angry a look and so cold\r\na smile that the good woman did not interfere again.\r\nEmma was growing difficult, capricious. She ordered dishes for\r\nherself, then she did not touch them; one day drank only pure\r\nmilk, the next cups of tea by the dozen. Often she persisted in\r\nnot going out, then, stifling, threw open the windows and put on\r\nlight dresses. After she had well scolded her servant she gave\r\nher presents or sent her out to see neighbours, just as she\r\nsometimes threw beggars all the silver in her purse, although she\r\nwas by no means tender-hearted or easily accessible to the\r\nfeelings of others, like most country-bred people, who always\r\nretain in their souls something of the horny hardness of the\r\npaternal hands.\r\nTowards the end of February old Rouault, in memory of his cure,\r\nhimself brought his son-in-law a superb turkey, and stayed three\r\ndays at Tostes. Charles being with his patients, Emma kept him\r\ncompany. He smoked in the room, spat on the firedogs, talked\r\nfarming, calves, cows, poultry, and municipal council, so that\r\nwhen he left she closed the door on him with a feeling of\r\nsatisfaction that surprised even herself. Moreover she no longer\r\nconcealed her contempt for anything or anybody, and at times she\r\nset herself to express singular opinions, finding fault with that\r\nwhich others approved, and approving things perverse and immoral,\r\nall of which made her husband open his eyes widely.\r\nWould this misery last for ever? Would she never issue from it?\r\nYet she was as good as all the women who were living happily. She\r\nhad seen duchesses at Vaubyessard with clumsier waists and\r\ncommoner ways, and she execrated the injustice of God. She leant\r\nher head against the walls to weep; she envied lives of stir;\r\nlonged for masked balls, for violent pleasures, with all the\r\nwildness that she did not know, but that these must surely yield.\r\nShe grew pale and suffered from palpitations of the heart.\r\nCharles prescribed valerian and camphor baths. Everything that\r\nwas tried only seemed to irritate her the more.\r\nOn certain days she chatted with feverish rapidity, and this\r\nover-excitement was suddenly followed by a state of torpor, in\r\nwhich she remained without speaking, without moving. What then\r\nrevived her was pouring a bottle of eau-de-cologne over her arms.\r\nAs she was constantly complaining about Tostes, Charles fancied\r\nthat her illness was no doubt due to some local cause, and fixing\r\non this idea, began to think seriously of setting up elsewhere.\r\nFrom that moment she drank vinegar, contracted a sharp little\r\ncough, and completely lost her appetite.\r\nIt cost Charles much to give up Tostes after living there four\r\nyears and \"when he was beginning to get on there.\" Yet if it must\r\nbe! He took her to Rouen to see his old master. It was a nervous\r\ncomplaint: change of air was needed.\r\nAfter looking about him on this side and on that, Charles learnt\r\nthat in the Neufchatel arrondissement there was a considerable\r\nmarket town called Yonville-l'Abbaye, whose doctor, a Polish\r\nrefugee, had decamped a week before. Then he wrote to the chemist\r\nof the place to ask the number of the population, the distance\r\nfrom the nearest doctor, what his predecessor had made a year,\r\nand so forth; and the answer being satisfactory, he made up his\r\nmind to move towards the spring, if Emma's health did not\r\nimprove.\r\nOne day when, in view of her departure, she was tidying a drawer,\r\nsomething pricked her finger. It was a wire of her wedding\r\nbouquet. The orange blossoms were yellow with dust and the silver\r\nbordered satin ribbons frayed at the edges. She threw it into the\r\nfire. It flared up more quickly than dry straw. Then it was, like\r\na red bush in the cinders, slowly devoured. She watched it burn.\r\nThe little pasteboard berries burst, the wire twisted, the gold\r\nlace melted; and the shriveled paper corollas, fluttering like\r\nblack butterflies at the back of the stove, at least flew up the\r\nchimney.\r\nWhen they left Tostes at the month of March, Madame Bovary was\r\npregnant."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Part II\r\nChapter One\r\nYonville-l\'Abbaye (so called from an old Capuchin abbey of which\r\nnot even the ruins remain) is a market-town twenty-four miles\r\nfrom Rouen, between the Abbeville and Beauvais roads, at the foot\r\nof a valley watered by the Rieule, a little river that runs into\r\nthe Andelle after turning three water-mills near its mouth, where\r\nthere are a few trout that the lads amuse themselves by fishing\r\nfor on Sundays.\r\nWe leave the highroad at La Boissiere and keep straight on to the\r\ntop of the Leux hill, whence the valley is seen. The river that\r\nruns through it makes of it, as it were, two regions with\r\ndistinct physiognomies--all on the left is pasture land, all of\r\nthe right arable. The meadow stretches under a bulge of low hills\r\nto join at the back with the pasture land of the Bray country,\r\nwhile on the eastern side, the plain, gently rising, broadens\r\nout, showing as far as eye can follow its blond cornfields. The\r\nwater, flowing by the grass, divides with a white line the colour\r\nof the roads and of the plains, and the country is like a great\r\nunfolded mantle with a green velvet cape bordered with a fringe\r\nof silver.\r\nBefore us, on the verge of the horizon, lie the oaks of the\r\nforest of Argueil, with the steeps of the Saint-Jean hills\r\nscarred from top to bottom with red irregular lines; they are\r\nrain tracks, and these brick-tones standing out in narrow streaks\r\nagainst the grey colour of the mountain are due to the quantity\r\nof iron springs that flow beyond in the neighboring country.\r\nHere we are on the confines of Normandy, Picardy, and the\r\nIle-de-France, a bastard land whose language is without accent\r\nand its landscape is without character. It is there that they\r\nmake the worst Neufchatel cheeses of all the arrondissement; and,\r\non the other hand, farming is costly because so much manure is\r\nneeded to enrich this friable soil full of sand and flints.\r\nUp to 1835 there was no practicable road for getting to Yonville,\r\nbut about this time a cross-road was made which joins that of\r\nAbbeville to that of Amiens, and is occasionally used by the\r\nRouen wagoners on their way to Flanders. Yonville-l\'Abbaye has\r\nremained stationary in spite of its "new outlet." Instead of\r\nimproving the soil, they persist in keeping up the pasture lands,\r\nhowever depreciated they may be in value, and the lazy borough,\r\ngrowing away from the plain, has naturally spread riverwards. It\r\nis seem from afar sprawling along the banks like a cowherd taking\r\na siesta by the water-side.\r\nAt the foot of the hill beyond the bridge begins a roadway,\r\nplanted with young aspens, that leads in a straight line to the\r\nfirst houses in the place. These, fenced in by hedges, are in the\r\nmiddle of courtyards full of straggling buildings, wine-presses,\r\ncart-sheds and distilleries scattered under thick trees, with\r\nladders, poles, or scythes hung on to the branches. The thatched\r\nroofs, like fur caps drawn over eyes, reach down over about a\r\nthird of the low windows, whose coarse convex glasses have knots\r\nin the middle like the bottoms of bottles. Against the plaster\r\nwall diagonally crossed by black joists, a meagre pear-tree\r\nsometimes leans and the ground-floors have at their door a small\r\nswing-gate to keep out the chicks that come pilfering crumbs of\r\nbread steeped in cider on the threshold. But the courtyards grow\r\nnarrower, the houses closer together, and the fences disappear; a\r\nbundle of ferns swings under a window from the end of a\r\nbroomstick; there is a blacksmith\'s forge and then a\r\nwheelwright\'s, with two or three new carts outside that partly\r\nblock the way. Then across an open space appears a white house\r\nbeyond a grass mound ornamented by a Cupid, his finger on his\r\nlips; two brass vases are at each end of a flight of steps;\r\nscutcheons* blaze upon the door. It is the notary\'s house, and\r\nthe finest in the place.\r\n*The panonceaux that have to be hung over the doors of notaries.\r\nThe Church is on the other side of the street, twenty paces\r\nfarther down, at the entrance of the square. The little cemetery\r\nthat surrounds it, closed in by a wall breast high, is so full of\r\ngraves that the old stones, level with the ground, form a\r\ncontinuous pavement, on which the grass of itself has marked out\r\nregular green squares. The church was rebuilt during the last\r\nyears of the reign of Charles X. The wooden roof is beginning to\r\nrot from the top, and here and there has black hollows in its\r\nblue colour. Over the door, where the organ should be, is a loft\r\nfor the men, with a spiral staircase that reverberates under\r\ntheir wooden shoes.\r\nThe daylight coming through the plain glass windows falls\r\nobliquely upon the pews ranged along the walls, which are adorned\r\nhere and there with a straw mat bearing beneath it the words in\r\nlarge letters, "Mr. So-and-so\'s pew." Farther on, at a spot where\r\nthe building narrows, the confessional forms a pendant to a\r\nstatuette of the Virgin, clothed in a satin robe, coifed with a\r\ntulle veil sprinkled with silver stars, and with red cheeks, like\r\nan idol of the Sandwich Islands; and, finally, a copy of the\r\n"Holy Family, presented by the Minister of the Interior,"\r\noverlooking the high altar, between four candlesticks, closes in\r\nthe perspective. The choir stalls, of deal wood, have been left\r\nunpainted.\r\nThe market, that is to say, a tiled roof supported by some twenty\r\nposts, occupies of itself about half the public square of\r\nYonville. The town hall, constructed "from the designs of a Paris\r\narchitect," is a sort of Greek temple that forms the corner next\r\nto the chemist\'s shop. On the ground-floor are three Ionic\r\ncolumns and on the first floor a semicircular gallery, while the\r\ndome that crowns it is occupied by a Gallic cock, resting one\r\nfoot upon the "Charte" and holding in the other the scales of\r\nJustice.\r\nBut that which most attracts the eye is opposite the Lion d\'Or\r\ninn, the chemist\'s shop of Monsieur Homais. In the evening\r\nespecially its argand lamp is lit up and the red and green jars\r\nthat embellish his shop-front throw far across the street their\r\ntwo streams of colour; then across them as if in Bengal lights is\r\nseen the shadow of the chemist leaning over his desk. His house\r\nfrom top to bottom is placarded with inscriptions written in\r\nlarge hand, round hand, printed hand: "Vichy, Seltzer, Barege\r\nwaters, blood purifiers, Raspail patent medicine, Arabian\r\nracahout, Darcet lozenges, Regnault paste, trusses, baths,\r\nhygienic chocolate," etc. And the signboard, which takes up all\r\nthe breadth of the shop, bears in gold letters, "Homais,\r\nChemist." Then at the back of the shop, behind the great scales\r\nfixed to the counter, the word "Laboratory" appears on a scroll\r\nabove a glass door, which about half-way up once more repeats\r\n"Homais" in gold letters on a black ground.\r\nBeyond this there is nothing to see at Yonville. The street (the\r\nonly one) a gunshot in length and flanked by a few shops on\r\neither side stops short at the turn of the highroad. If it is\r\nleft on the right hand and the foot of the Saint-Jean hills\r\nfollowed the cemetery is soon reached.\r\nAt the time of the cholera, in order to enlarge this, a piece of\r\nwall was pulled down, and three acres of land by its side\r\npurchased; but all the new portion is almost tenantless; the\r\ntombs, as heretofore, continue to crowd together towards the\r\ngate. The keeper, who is at once gravedigger and church beadle\r\n(thus making a double profit out of the parish corpses), has\r\ntaken advantage of the unused plot of ground to plant potatoes\r\nthere. From year to year, however, his small field grows smaller,\r\nand when there is an epidemic, he does not know whether to\r\nrejoice at the deaths or regret the burials.\r\n"You live on the dead, Lestiboudois!" the curie at last said to\r\nhim one day. This grim remark made him reflect; it checked him\r\nfor some time; but to this day he carries on the cultivation of\r\nhis little tubers, and even maintains stoutly that they grow\r\nnaturally.\r\nSince the events about to be narrated, nothing in fact has\r\nchanged at Yonville. The tin tricolour flag still swings at the\r\ntop of the church-steeple; the two chintz streamers still flutter\r\nin the wind from the linen-draper\'s; the chemist\'s fetuses, like\r\nlumps of white amadou, rot more and more in their turbid alcohol,\r\nand above the big door of the inn the old golden lion, faded by\r\nrain, still shows passers-by its poodle mane.\r\nOn the evening when the Bovarys were to arrive at Yonville, Widow\r\nLefrancois, the landlady of this inn, was so very busy that she\r\nsweated great drops as she moved her saucepans. To-morrow was\r\nmarket-day. The meat had to be cut beforehand, the fowls drawn,\r\nthe soup and coffee made. Moreover, she had the boarders\' meal to\r\nsee to, and that of the doctor, his wife, and their servant; the\r\nbilliard-room was echoing with bursts of laughter; three millers\r\nin a small parlour were calling for brandy; the wood was blazing,\r\nthe brazen pan was hissing, and on the long kitchen table, amid\r\nthe quarters of raw mutton, rose piles of plates that rattled\r\nwith the shaking of the block on which spinach was being chopped.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'From the poultry-yard was heard the screaming of the fowls whom\r\nthe servant was chasing in order to wring their necks.\r\nA man slightly marked with small-pox, in green leather slippers,\r\nand wearing a velvet cap with a gold tassel, was warming his back\r\nat the chimney. His face expressed nothing but self-satisfaction,\r\nand he appeared to take life as calmly as the goldfinch suspended\r\nover his head in its wicker cage: this was the chemist.\r\n"Artemise!" shouted the landlady, "chop some wood, fill the water\r\nbottles, bring some brandy, look sharp! If only I knew what\r\ndessert to offer the guests you are expecting! Good heavens!\r\nThose furniture-movers are beginning their racket in the\r\nbilliard-room again; and their van has been left before the front\r\ndoor! The \'Hirondelle\' might run into it when it draws up. Call\r\nPolyte and tell him to put it up. Only think, Monsieur Homais,\r\nthat since morning they have had about fifteen games, and drunk\r\neight jars of cider! Why, they\'ll tear my cloth for me," she went\r\non, looking at them from a distance, her strainer in her hand.\r\n"That wouldn\'t be much of a loss," replied Monsieur Homais. "You\r\nwould buy another."\r\n"Another billiard-table!" exclaimed the widow.\r\n"Since that one is coming to pieces, Madame Lefrancois. I tell\r\nyou again you are doing yourself harm, much harm! And besides,\r\nplayers now want narrow pockets and heavy cues. Hazards aren\'t\r\nplayed now; everything is changed! One must keep pace with the\r\ntimes! Just look at Tellier!"\r\nThe hostess reddened with vexation. The chemist went on--\r\n"You may say what you like; his table is better than yours; and\r\nif one were to think, for example, of getting up a patriotic pool\r\nfor Poland or the sufferers from the Lyons floods--"\r\n"It isn\'t beggars like him that\'ll frighten us," interrupted the\r\nlandlady, shrugging her fat shoulders. "Come, come, Monsieur\r\nHomais; as long as the \'Lion d\'Or\' exists people will come to it.\r\nWe\'ve feathered our nest; while one of these days you\'ll find the\r\n\'Cafe Francais\' closed with a big placard on the shutters. Change\r\nmy billiard-table!" she went on, speaking to herself, "the table\r\nthat comes in so handy for folding the washing, and on which, in\r\nthe hunting season, I have slept six visitors! But that dawdler,\r\nHivert, doesn\'t come!"\r\n"Are you waiting for him for your gentlemen\'s dinner?"\r\n"Wait for him! And what about Monsieur Binet? As the clock\r\nstrikes six you\'ll see him come in, for he hasn\'t his equal under\r\nthe sun for punctuality. He must always have his seat in the\r\nsmall parlour. He\'d rather die than dine anywhere else. And so\r\nsqueamish as he is, and so particular about the cider! Not like\r\nMonsieur Leon; he sometimes comes at seven, or even half-past,\r\nand he doesn\'t so much as look at what he eats. Such a nice young\r\nman! Never speaks a rough word!"\r\n"Well, you see, there\'s a great difference between an educated\r\nman and an old carabineer who is now a tax-collector."\r\nSix o\'clock struck. Binet came in.\r\nHe wore a blue frock-coat falling in a straight line round his\r\nthin body, and his leather cap, with its lappets knotted over the\r\ntop of his head with string, showed under the turned-up peak a\r\nbald forehead, flattened by the constant wearing of a helmet. He\r\nwore a black cloth waistcoat, a hair collar, grey trousers, and,\r\nall the year round, well-blacked boots, that had two parallel\r\nswellings due to the sticking out of his big-toes. Not a hair\r\nstood out from the regular line of fair whiskers, which,\r\nencircling his jaws, framed, after the fashion of a garden\r\nborder, his long, wan face, whose eyes were small and the nose\r\nhooked. Clever at all games of cards, a good hunter, and writing\r\na fine hand, he had at home a lathe, and amused himself by\r\nturning napkin rings, with which he filled up his house, with the\r\njealousy of an artist and the egotism of a bourgeois.\r\nHe went to the small parlour, but the three millers had to be got\r\nout first, and during the whole time necessary for laying the\r\ncloth, Binet remained silent in his place near the stove. Then he\r\nshut the door and took off his cap in his usual way.\r\n"It isn\'t with saying civil things that he\'ll wear out his\r\ntongue," said the chemist, as soon as he was along with the\r\nlandlady.\r\n"He never talks more," she replied. "Last week two travelers in\r\nthe cloth line were here--such clever chaps who told such jokes\r\nin the evening, that I fairly cried with laughing; and he stood\r\nthere like a dab fish and never said a word."\r\n"Yes," observed the chemist; "no imagination, no sallies, nothing\r\nthat makes the society-man."\r\n"Yet they say he has parts," objected the landlady.\r\n"Parts!" replied Monsieur Homais; "he, parts! In his own line it\r\nis possible," he added in a calmer tone. And he went on--\r\n"Ah! That a merchant, who has large connections, a jurisconsult,\r\na doctor, a chemist, should be thus absent-minded, that the\r\nshould become whimsical or even peevish, I can understand; such\r\ncases are cited in history. But at least it is because they are\r\nthinking of something. Myself, for example, how often has it\r\nhappened to me to look on the bureau for my pen to write a label,\r\nand to find, after all, that I had put it behind my ear!"\r\nMadame Lefrancois just then went to the door to see if the\r\n"Hirondelle" were not coming. She started. A man dressed in black\r\nsuddenly came into the kitchen. By the last gleam of the twilight\r\none could see that his face was rubicund and his form athletic.\r\n"What can I do for you, Monsieur le Curie?" asked the landlady,\r\nas she reached down from the chimney one of the copper\r\ncandlesticks placed with their candles in a row. "Will you take\r\nsomething? A thimbleful of Cassis*? A glass of wine?"\r\n*Black currant liqueur.\r\nThe priest declined very politely. He had come for his umbrella,\r\nthat he had forgotten the other day at the Ernemont convent, and\r\nafter asking Madame Lefrancois to have it sent to him at the\r\npresbytery in the evening, he left for the church, from which the\r\nAngelus was ringing.\r\nWhen the chemist no longer heard the noise of his boots along the\r\nsquare, he thought the priest\'s behaviour just now very\r\nunbecoming. This refusal to take any refreshment seemed to him\r\nthe most odious hypocrisy; all priests tippled on the sly, and\r\nwere trying to bring back the days of the tithe.\r\nThe landlady took up the defence of her curie.\r\n"Besides, he could double up four men like you over his knee.\r\nLast year he helped our people to bring in the straw; he carried\r\nas many as six trusses at once, he is so strong."\r\n"Bravo!" said the chemist. "Now just send your daughters to\r\nconfess to fellows which such a temperament! I, if I were the\r\nGovernment, I\'d have the priests bled once a month. Yes, Madame\r\nLefrancois, every month--a good phlebotomy, in the interests of\r\nthe police and morals."\r\n"Be quiet, Monsieur Homais. You are an infidel; you\'ve no\r\nreligion."\r\nThe chemist answered: "I have a religion, my religion, and I even\r\nhave more than all these others with their mummeries and their\r\njuggling. I adore God, on the contrary. I believe in the Supreme\r\nBeing, in a Creator, whatever he may be. I care little who has\r\nplaced us here below to fulfil our duties as citizens and fathers\r\nof families; but I don\'t need to go to church to kiss silver\r\nplates, and fatten, out of my pocket, a lot of good-for-nothings\r\nwho live better than we do. For one can know Him as well in a\r\nwood, in a field, or even contemplating the eternal vault like\r\nthe ancients. My God! Mine is the God of Socrates, of Franklin,\r\nof Voltaire, and of Beranger! I am for the profession of faith of\r\nthe \'Savoyard Vicar,\' and the immortal principles of \'89! And I\r\ncan\'t admit of an old boy of a God who takes walks in his garden\r\nwith a cane in his hand, who lodges his friends in the belly of\r\nwhales, dies uttering a cry, and rises again at the end of three\r\ndays; things absurd in themselves, and completely opposed,\r\nmoreover, to all physical laws, which prove to us, by the way,\r\nthat priests have always wallowed in turpid ignorance, in which\r\nthey would fain engulf the people with them."\r\nHe ceased, looking round for an audience, for in his bubbling\r\nover the chemist had for a moment fancied himself in the midst of\r\nthe town council. But the landlady no longer heeded him; she was\r\nlistening to a distant rolling. One could distinguish the noise\r\nof a carriage mingled with the clattering of loose horseshoes\r\nthat beat against the ground, and at last the "Hirondelle"\r\nstopped at the door.\r\nIt was a yellow box on two large wheels, that, reaching to the\r\ntilt, prevented travelers from seeing the road and dirtied their\r\nshoulders. The small panes of the narrow windows rattled in their\r\nsashes when the coach was closed, and retained here and there\r\npatches of mud amid the old layers of dust, that not even storms\r\nof rain had altogether washed away. It was drawn by three horses,\r\nthe first a leader, and when it came down-hill its bottom jolted\r\nagainst the ground.\r\nSome of the inhabitants of Yonville came out into the square;\r\nthey all spoke at once, asking for news, for explanations, for\r\nhampers. Hivert did not know whom to answer. It was he who did\r\nthe errands of the place in town. He went to the shops and\r\nbrought back rolls of leather for the shoemaker, old iron for the\r\nfarrier, a barrel of herrings for his mistress, caps from the\r\nmilliner\'s,l locks from the hair-dresser\'s and all along the road\r\non his return journey he distributed his parcels, which he threw,\r\nstanding upright on his seat and shouting at the top of his\r\nvoice, over the enclosures of the yards.\r\nAn accident had delayed him. Madame Bovary\'s greyhound had run\r\nacross the field. They had whistled for him a quarter of an hour;\r\nHivert had even gone back a mile and a half expecting every\r\nmoment to catch sight of her; but it had been necessary to go on.\r\nEmma had wept, grown angry; she had accused Charles of this\r\nmisfortune. Monsieur Lheureux, a draper, who happened to be in\r\nthe coach with her, had tried to console her by a number of\r\nexamples of lost dogs recognizing their masters at the end of\r\nlong years. One, he said had been told of, who had come back to\r\nParis from Constantinople. Another had gone one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles in a straight line, and swum four rivers; and his own\r\nfather had possessed a poodle, which, after twelve years of\r\nabsence, had all of a sudden jumped on his back in the street as\r\nhe was going to dine in town.'}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Two\r\nEmma got out first, then Felicite, Monsieur Lheureux, and a\r\nnurse, and they had to wake up Charles in his corner, where he\r\nhad slept soundly since night set in.\r\nHomais introduced himself; he offered his homages to madame and\r\nhis respects to monsieur; said he was charmed to have been able\r\nto render them some slight service, and added with a cordial air\r\nthat he had ventured to invite himself, his wife being away.\r\nWhen Madame Bovary was in the kitchen she went up to the chimney.\r\nWith the tips of her fingers she caught her dress at the knee,\r\nand having thus pulled it up to her ankle, held out her foot in\r\nits black boot to the fire above the revolving leg of mutton. The\r\nflame lit up the whole of her, penetrating with a crude light the\r\nwoof of her gowns, the fine pores of her fair skin, and even her\r\neyelids, which she blinked now and again. A great red glow passed\r\nover her with the blowing of the wind through the half-open door.\r\nOn the other side of the chimney a young man with fair hair\r\nwatched her silently.\r\nAs he was a good deal bored at Yonville, where he was a clerk at\r\nthe notary\'s, Monsieur Guillaumin, Monsieur Leon Dupuis (it was\r\nhe who was the second habitue of the "Lion d\'Or") frequently put\r\nback his dinner-hour in hope that some traveler might come to the\r\ninn, with whom he could chat in the evening. On the days when his\r\nwork was done early, he had, for want of something else to do, to\r\ncome punctually, and endure from soup to cheese a tete-a-tete\r\nwith Binet. It was therefore with delight that he accepted the\r\nlandlady\'s suggestion that he should dine in company with the\r\nnewcomers, and they passed into the large parlour where Madame\r\nLefrancois, for the purpose of showing off, had had the table\r\nlaid for four.\r\nHomais asked to be allowed to keep on his skull-cap, for fear of\r\ncoryza; then, turning to his neighbour--\r\n"Madame is no doubt a little fatigued; one gets jolted so\r\nabominably in our \'Hirondelle.\'"\r\n"That is true," replied Emma; "but moving about always amuses me.\r\nI like change of place."\r\n"It is so tedious," sighed the clerk, "to be always riveted to\r\nthe same places."\r\n"If you were like me," said Charles, "constantly obliged to be in\r\nthe saddle"--\r\n"But," Leon went on, addressing himself to Madame Bovary,\r\n"nothing, it seems to me, is more pleasant--when one can," he\r\nadded.\r\n"Moreover," said the druggist, "the practice of medicine is not\r\nvery hard work in our part of the world, for the state of our\r\nroads allows us the use of gigs, and generally, as the farmers\r\nare prosperous, they pay pretty well. We have, medically\r\nspeaking, besides the ordinary cases of enteritis, bronchitis,\r\nbilious affections, etc., now and then a few intermittent fevers\r\nat harvest-time; but on the whole, little of a serious nature,\r\nnothing special to note, unless it be a great deal of scrofula,\r\ndue, no doubt, to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our\r\npeasant dwellings. Ah! you will find many prejudices to combat,\r\nMonsieur Bovary, much obstinacy of routine, with which all the\r\nefforts of your science will daily come into collision; for\r\npeople still have recourse to novenas, to relics, to the priest,\r\nrather than come straight to the doctor of the chemist. The\r\nclimate, however, is not, truth to tell, bad, and we even have a\r\nfew nonagenarians in our parish. The thermometer (I have made\r\nsome observations) falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade at the\r\noutside, which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum, or\r\notherwise 54 degrees Fahrenheit (English scale), not more. And,\r\nas a matter of fact, we are sheltered from the north winds by the\r\nforest of Argueil on the one side, from the west winds by the St.\r\nJean range on the other; and this heat, moreover, which, on\r\naccount of the aqueous vapours given off by the river and the\r\nconsiderable number of cattle in the fields, which, as you know,\r\nexhale much ammonia, that is to say, nitrogen, hydrogen and\r\noxygen (no, nitrogen and hydrogen alone), and which sucking up\r\ninto itself the humus from the ground, mixing together all those\r\ndifferent emanations, unites them into a stack, so to say, and\r\ncombining with the electricity diffused through the atmosphere,\r\nwhen there is any, might in the long run, as in tropical\r\ncountries, engender insalubrious miasmata--this heat, I say,\r\nfinds itself perfectly tempered on the side whence it comes, or\r\nrather whence it should come--that is to say, the southern side--\r\nby the south-eastern winds, which, having cooled themselves\r\npassing over the Seine, reach us sometimes all at once like\r\nbreezes from Russia."\r\n"At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?"\r\ncontinued Madame Bovary, speaking to the young man.\r\n"Oh, very few," he answered. "There is a place they call La\r\nPature, on the top of the hill, on the edge of the forest.\r\nSometimes, on Sundays, I go and stay there with a book, watching\r\nthe sunset."\r\n"I think there is nothing so admirable as sunsets," she resumed;\r\n"but especially by the side of the sea."\r\n"Oh, I adore the sea!" said Monsieur Leon.\r\n"And then, does it not seem to you," continued Madame Bovary,\r\n"that the mind travels more freely on this limitless expanse, the\r\ncontemplation of which elevates the soul, gives ideas of the\r\ninfinite, the ideal?"\r\n"It is the same with mountainous landscapes," continued Leon. "A\r\ncousin of mine who travelled in Switzerland last year told me\r\nthat one could not picture to oneself the poetry of the lakes,\r\nthe charm of the waterfalls, the gigantic effect of the glaciers.\r\nOne sees pines of incredible size across torrents, cottages\r\nsuspended over precipices, and, a thousand feet below one, whole\r\nvalleys when the clouds open. Such spectacles must stir to\r\nenthusiasm, incline to prayer, to ecstasy; and I no longer marvel\r\nat that celebrated musician who, the better to inspire his\r\nimagination, was in the habit of playing the piano before some\r\nimposing site."\r\n"You play?" she asked.\r\n"No, but I am very fond of music," he replied.\r\n"Ah! don\'t you listen to him, Madame Bovary," interrupted Homais,\r\nbending over his plate. "That\'s sheer modesty. Why, my dear\r\nfellow, the other day in your room you were singing \'L\'Ange\r\nGardien\' ravishingly. I heard you from the laboratory. You gave\r\nit like an actor."\r\nLeon, in fact, lodged at the chemist\'s where he had a small room\r\non the second floor, overlooking the Place. He blushed at the\r\ncompliment of his landlord, who had already turned to the doctor,\r\nand was enumerating to him, one after the other, all the\r\nprincipal inhabitants of Yonville. He was telling anecdotes,\r\ngiving information; the fortune of the notary was not known\r\nexactly, and "there was the Tuvache household," who made a good\r\ndeal of show.\r\nEmma continued, "And what music do you prefer?"\r\n"Oh, German music; that which makes you dream."\r\n"Have you been to the opera?"\r\n"Not yet; but I shall go next year, when I am living at Paris to\r\nfinish reading for the bar."\r\n"As I had the honour of putting it to your husband," said the\r\nchemist, "with regard to this poor Yanoda who has run away, you\r\nwill find yourself, thanks to his extravagance, in the possession\r\nof one of the most comfortable houses of Yonville. Its greatest\r\nconvenience for a doctor is a door giving on the Walk, where one\r\ncan go in and out unseen. Moreover, it contains everything that\r\nis agreeable in a household--a laundry, kitchen with offices,\r\nsitting-room, fruit-room, and so on. He was a gay dog, who didn\'t\r\ncare what he spent. At the end of the garden, by the side of the\r\nwater, he had an arbour built just for the purpose of drinking\r\nbeer in summer; and if madame is fond of gardening she will be\r\nable--"\r\n"My wife doesn\'t care about it," said Charles; "although she has\r\nbeen advised to take exercise, she prefers always sitting in her\r\nroom reading."\r\n"Like me," replied Leon. "And indeed, what is better than to sit\r\nby one\'s fireside in the evening with a book, while the wind\r\nbeats against the window and the lamp is burning?"\r\n"What, indeed?" she said, fixing her large black eyes wide open\r\nupon him.\r\n"One thinks of nothing," he continued; "the hours slip by.\r\nMotionless we traverse countries we fancy we see, and your\r\nthought, blinding with the fiction, playing with the details,\r\nfollows the outline of the adventures. It mingles with the\r\ncharacters, and it seems as if it were yourself palpitating\r\nbeneath their costumes."\r\n"That is true! That is true?" she said.\r\n"Has it ever happened to you," Leon went on, "to come across some\r\nvague idea of one\'s own in a book, some dim image that comes back\r\nto you from afar, and as the completest expression of your own\r\nslightest sentiment?"\r\n"I have experienced it," she replied.\r\n"That is why," he said, "I especially love the poets. I think\r\nverse more tender than prose, and that it moves far more easily\r\nto tears."\r\n"Still in the long run it is tiring," continued Emma. Now I, on\r\nthe contrary, adore stories that rush breathlessly along, that\r\nfrighten one. I detest commonplace heroes and moderate\r\nsentiments, such as there are in nature."\r\n"In fact," observed the clerk, "these works, not touching the\r\nheart, miss, it seems to me, the true end of art. It is so sweet,\r\namid all the disenchantments of life, to be able to dwell in\r\nthought upon noble characters, pure affections, and pictures of\r\nhappiness. For myself, living here far from the world, this is my\r\none distraction; but Yonville affords so few resources."\r\n"Like Tostes, no doubt," replied Emma; "and so I always\r\nsubscribed to a lending library."\r\n"If madame will do me the honour of making use of it", said the\r\nchemist, who had just caught the last words, "I have at her\r\ndisposal a library composed of the best authors, Voltaire,\r\nRousseau, Delille, Walter Scott, the \'Echo des Feuilletons\'; and\r\nin addition I receive various periodicals, among them the \'Fanal\r\nde Rouen\' daily, having the advantage to be its correspondent for\r\nthe districts of Buchy, Forges, Neufchatel, Yonville, and\r\nvicinity."\r\nFor two hours and a half they had been at table; for the servant\r\nArtemis, carelessly dragging her old list slippers over the\r\nflags, brought one plate after the other, forgot everything, and\r\nconstantly left the door of the billiard-room half open, so that\r\nit beat against the wall with its hooks.\r\nUnconsciously, Leon, while talking, had placed his foot on one of\r\nthe bars of the chair on which Madame Bovary was sitting. She\r\nwore a small blue silk necktie, that kept up like a ruff a\r\ngauffered cambric collar, and with the movements of her head the\r\nlower part of her face gently sunk into the linen or came out\r\nfrom it. Thus side by side, while Charles and the chemist\r\nchatted, they entered into one of those vague conversations where\r\nthe hazard of all that is said brings you back to the fixed\r\ncentre of a common sympathy. The Paris theatres, titles of\r\nnovels, new quadrilles, and the world they did not know; Tostes,\r\nwhere she had lived, and Yonville, where they were; they examined\r\nall, talked of everything till to the end of dinner.\r\nWhen coffee was served Felicite went away to get ready the room\r\nin the new house, and the guests soon raised the siege. Madame\r\nLefrancois was asleep near the cinders, while the stable-boy,\r\nlantern in hand, was waiting to show Monsieur and Madame Bovary\r\nthe way home. Bits of straw stuck in his red hair, and he limped\r\nwith his left leg. When he had taken in his other hand the cure\'s\r\numbrella, they started.\r\nThe town was asleep; the pillars of the market threw great\r\nshadows; the earth was all grey as on a summer\'s night. But as\r\nthe doctor\'s house was only some fifty paces from the inn, they\r\nhad to say good-night almost immediately, and the company\r\ndispersed.\r\nAs soon as she entered the passage, Emma felt the cold of the\r\nplaster fall about her shoulders like damp linen. The walls were\r\nnew and the wooden stairs creaked. In their bedroom, on the first\r\nfloor, a whitish light passed through the curtainless windows.\r\nShe could catch glimpses of tree tops, and beyond, the fields,\r\nhalf-drowned in the fog that lay reeking in the moonlight along\r\nthe course of the river. In the middle of the room, pell-mell,\r\nwere scattered drawers, bottles, curtain-rods, gilt poles, with\r\nmattresses on the chairs and basins on the ground--the two men\r\nwho had brought the furniture had left everything about\r\ncarelessly.\r\nThis was the fourth time that she had slept in a strange place.\r\nThe first was the day of her going to the convent; the second, of\r\nher arrival at Tostes; the third, at Vaubyessard; and this was\r\nthe fourth. And each one had marked, as it were, the inauguration\r\nof a new phase in her life. She did not believe that things could\r\npresent themselves in the same way in different places, and since\r\nthe portion of  her life lived had been bad, no doubt that which\r\nremained to be lived would be better.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Three\r\nThe next day, as she was getting up, she saw the clerk on the\r\nPlace. She had on a dressing-gown. He looked up and bowed. She\r\nnodded quickly and reclosed the window.\r\nLeon waited all day for six o\'clock in the evening to come, but\r\non going to the inn, he found no one but Monsieur Binet, already\r\nat table. The dinner of the evening before had been a\r\nconsiderable event for him; he had never till then talked for two\r\nhours consecutively to a "lady." How then had he been able to\r\nexplain, and in such language, the number of things that he could\r\nnot have said so well before? He was usually shy, and maintained\r\nthat reserve which partakes at once of modesty and dissimulation.\r\nAt Yonville he was considered "well-bred." He listened to the\r\narguments of the older people, and did not seem hot about\r\npolitics--a remarkable thing for a young man. Then he had some\r\naccomplishments; he painted in water-colours, could read the key\r\nof G, and readily talked literature after dinner when he did not\r\nplay cards. Monsieur Homais respected him for his education;\r\nMadame Homais liked him for his good-nature, for he often took\r\nthe little Homais into the garden--little brats who were always\r\ndirty, very much spoilt, and somewhat lymphatic, like their\r\nmother. Besides the servant to look after them, they had Justin,\r\nthe chemist\'s apprentice, a second cousin of Monsieur Homais, who\r\nhad been taken into the house from charity, and who was useful at\r\nthe same time as a servant.\r\nThe druggist proved the best of neighbours. He gave Madame Bovary\r\ninformation as to the trades-people, sent expressly for his own\r\ncider merchant, tasted the drink himself, and saw that the casks\r\nwere properly placed in the cellar; he explained how to set about\r\ngetting in a supply of butter cheap, and made an arrangement with\r\nLestiboudois, the sacristan, who, besides his sacerdotal and\r\nfuneral functions, looked after the principal gardens at Yonville\r\nby the hour or the year, according to the taste of the customers.\r\nThe need of looking after others was not the only thing that\r\nurged the chemist to such obsequious cordiality; there was a plan\r\nunderneath it all.\r\nHe had infringed the law of the 19th Ventose, year xi., article\r\nI, which forbade all persons not having a diploma to practise\r\nmedicine; so that, after certain anonymous denunciations, Homais\r\nhad been summoned to Rouen to see the procurer of the king in his\r\nown private room; the magistrate receiving him standing up,\r\nermine on shoulder and cap on head. It was in the morning, before\r\nthe court opened. In the corridors one heard the heavy boots of\r\nthe gendarmes walking past, and like a far-off noise great locks\r\nthat were shut. The druggist\'s ears tingled as if he were about\r\nto have an apoplectic stroke; he saw the depths of dungeons, his\r\nfamily in tears, his shop sold, all the jars dispersed; and he\r\nwas obliged to enter a cafe and take a glass of rum and seltzer\r\nto recover his spirits.\r\nLittle by little the memory of this reprimand grew fainter, and\r\nhe continued, as heretofore, to give anodyne consultations in his\r\nback-parlour. But the mayor resented it, his colleagues were\r\njealous, everything was to be feared; gaining over Monsieur\r\nBovary by his attentions was to earn his gratitude, and prevent\r\nhis speaking out later on, should he notice anything. So every\r\nmorning Homais brought him "the paper," and often in the\r\nafternoon left his shop for a few moments to have a chat with the\r\nDoctor.\r\nCharles was dull: patients did not come. He remained seated for\r\nhours without speaking, went into his consulting room to sleep,\r\nor watched his wife sewing. Then for diversion he employed\r\nhimself at home as a workman; he even tried to do up the attic\r\nwith some paint which had been left behind by the painters. But\r\nmoney matters worried him. He had spent so much for repairs at\r\nTostes, for madame\'s toilette, and for the moving, that the whole\r\ndowry, over three thousand crowns, had slipped away in two years.\r\nThen how many things had been spoilt or lost during their\r\ncarriage from Tostes to Yonville, without counting the plaster\r\ncure, who falling out of the coach at an over-severe jolt, had\r\nbeen dashed into a thousand fragments on the pavements of\r\nQuincampoix! A pleasanter trouble came to distract him, namely,\r\nthe pregnancy of his wife. As the time of her confinement\r\napproached he cherished her the more. It was another bond of the\r\nflesh establishing itself, and, as it were, a continued sentiment\r\nof a more complex union. When from afar he saw her languid walk,\r\nand her figure without stays turning softly on her hips; when\r\nopposite one another he looked at her at his ease, while she took\r\ntired poses in her armchair, then his happiness knew no bounds;\r\nhe got up, embraced her, passed his hands over her face, called\r\nher little mamma, wanted to make her dance, and half-laughing,\r\nhalf-crying, uttered all kinds of caressing pleasantries that\r\ncame into his head. The idea of having begotten a child delighted\r\nhim. Now he wanted nothing. He knew human life from end to end,\r\nand he sat down to it with serenity.\r\nEmma at first felt a great astonishment; then was anxious to be\r\ndelivered that she might know what it was to be a mother. But not\r\nbeing able to spend as much as she would have liked, to have a\r\nswing-bassinette with rose silk curtains, and embroidered caps,\r\nin a fit of bitterness she gave up looking after the trousseau,\r\nand ordered the whole of it from a village needlewoman, without\r\nchoosing or discussing anything. Thus she did not amuse herself\r\nwith those preparations that stimulate the tenderness of mothers,\r\nand so her affection was from the very outset, perhaps, to some\r\nextent attenuated.\r\nAs Charles, however, spoke of the boy at every meal, she soon\r\nbegan to think of him more consecutively.\r\nShe hoped for a son; he would be strong and dark; she would call\r\nhim George; and this idea of having a male child was like an\r\nexpected revenge for all her impotence in the past. A man, at\r\nleast, is free; he may travel over passions and over countries,\r\novercome obstacles, taste of the most far-away pleasures. But a\r\nwoman is always hampered. At once inert and flexible, she has\r\nagainst her the weakness of the flesh and legal dependence. Her\r\nwill, like the veil of her bonnet, held by a string, flutters in\r\nevery wind; there is always some desire that draws her, some\r\nconventionality that restrains.\r\nShe was confined on a Sunday at about six o\'clock, as the sun was\r\nrising.\r\n"It is a girl!" said Charles.\r\nShe turned her head away and fainted.\r\nMadame Homais, as well as Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d\'Or,\r\nalmost immediately came running in to embrace her. The chemist,\r\nas man of discretion, only offered a few provincial felicitations\r\nthrough the half-opened door. He wished to see the child and\r\nthought it well made.\r\nWhilst she was getting well she occupied herself much in seeking\r\na name for her daughter. First she went over all those that have\r\nItalian endings, such as Clara, Louisa, Amanda, Atala; she liked\r\nGalsuinde pretty well, and Yseult or Leocadie still better.\r\nCharles wanted the child to be called after her mother; Emma\r\nopposed this. They ran over the calendar from end to end, and\r\nthen consulted outsiders.\r\n"Monsieur Leon," said the chemist, "with whom I was talking about\r\nit the other day, wonders you do not chose Madeleine. It is very\r\nmuch in fashion just now."\r\nBut Madame Bovary, senior, cried out loudly against this name of\r\na sinner. As to Monsieur Homais, he had a preference for all\r\nthose that recalled some great man, an illustrious fact, or a\r\ngenerous idea, and it was on this system that he had baptized his\r\nfour children. Thus Napoleon represented glory and Franklin\r\nliberty; Irma was perhaps a concession to romanticism, but\r\nAthalie was a homage to the greatest masterpiece of the French\r\nstage. For his philosophical convictions did not interfere with\r\nhis artistic tastes; in him the thinker did not stifle the man of\r\nsentiment; he could make distinctions, make allowances for\r\nimagination and fanaticism. In this tragedy, for example, he\r\nfound fault with the ideas, but admired the style; he detested\r\nthe conception, but applauded all the details, and loathed the\r\ncharacters while he grew enthusiastic over their dialogue. When\r\nhe read the fine passages he was transported, but when he thought\r\nthat mummers would get something out of them for their show, he\r\nwas disconsolate; and in this confusion of sentiments in which he\r\nwas involved he would have like at once to crown Racine with both\r\nhis hands and discuss with him for a good quarter of an hour.\r\nAt last Emma remembered that at the chateau of Vaubyessard she\r\nhad heard the Marchioness call a young lady Berthe; from that\r\nmoment this name was chosen; and as old Rouault could not come,\r\nMonsieur Homais was requested to stand godfather. His gifts were\r\nall products from his establishment, to wit: six boxes of\r\njujubes, a whole jar of racahout, three cakes of marshmallow\r\npaste, and six sticks of sugar-candy into the bargain that he had\r\ncome across in a cupboard. On the evening of the ceremony there\r\nwas a grand dinner; the cure was present; there was much\r\nexcitement. Monsieur Homais towards liqueur-time began singing\r\n"Le Dieu des bonnes gens." Monsieur Leon sang a barcarolle, and\r\nMadame Bovary, senior, who was godmother, a romance of the time\r\nof the Empire; finally, M. Bovary, senior, insisted on having the\r\nchild brought down, and began baptizing it with a glass of\r\nchampagne that he poured over its head. This mockery of the first\r\nof the sacraments made the Abbe Bournisien angry; old Bovary\r\nreplied by a quotation from "La Guerre des Dieux"; the cure\r\nwanted to leave; the ladies implored, Homais interfered; and they\r\nsucceeded in making the priest sit down again, and he quietly\r\nwent on with the half-finished coffee in his saucer.\r\nMonsieur Bovary, senior, stayed at Yonville a month, dazzling the\r\nnative by a superb policeman\'s cap with silver tassels that he\r\nwore in the morning when he smoked his pipe in the square. Being\r\nalso in the habit of drinking a good deal of brandy, he often\r\nsent the servant to the Lion d\'Or to buy him a bottle, which was\r\nput down to his son\'s account, and to perfume his handkerchiefs\r\nhe used up his daughter-in-law\'s whole supply of eau-de-cologne.\r\nThe latter did not at all dislike his company. He had knocked\r\nabout the world, he talked about Berlin, Vienna, and Strasbourg,\r\nof his soldier times, of the mistresses he had had, the grand\r\nluncheons of which he had partaken; then he was amiable, and\r\nsometimes even, either on the stairs, or in the garden, would\r\nseize hold of her waist, crying, "Charles, look out for\r\nyourself."\r\nThen Madame Bovary, senior, became alarmed for her son\'s\r\nhappiness, and fearing that her husband might in the long-run\r\nhave an immoral influence upon the ideas of the young woman, took\r\ncare to hurry their departure. Perhaps she had more serious\r\nreasons for uneasiness. Monsieur Bovary was not the man to\r\nrespect anything.\r\nOne day Emma was suddenly seized with the desire to see her\r\nlittle girl, who had been put to nurse with the carpenter\'s wife,\r\nand, without looking at the calendar to see whether the six weeks\r\nof the Virgin were yet passed, she set out for the Rollets\'\r\nhouse, situated at the extreme end of the village, between the\r\nhighroad and the fields.\r\nIt was mid-day, the shutters of the houses were closed and the\r\nslate roofs that glittered beneath the fierce light of the blue\r\nsky seemed to strike sparks from the crest of the gables. A heavy\r\nwind was blowing; Emma felt weak as she walked; the stones of the\r\npavement hurt her; she was doubtful whether she would not go home\r\nagain, or go in somewhere to rest.\r\nAt this moment Monsieur Leon came out from a neighbouring door\r\nwith a bundle of papers under his arm. He came to greet her, and\r\nstood in the shade in front of the Lheureux\'s shop under the\r\nprojecting grey awning.\r\nMadame Bovary said she was going to see her baby, but that she\r\nwas beginning to grow tired.\r\n"If--" said Leon, not daring to go on.\r\n"Have you any business to attend to?" she asked.\r\nAnd on the clerk\'s answer, she begged him to accompany her. That\r\nsame evening this was known in Yonville, and Madame Tuvache, the\r\nmayor\'s wife, declared in the presence of her servant that\r\n"Madame Bovary was compromising herself."\r\nTo get to the nurse\'s it was necessary to turn to the left on\r\nleaving the street, as if making for the cemetery, and to follow\r\nbetween little houses and yards a small path bordered with privet\r\nhedges. They were in bloom, and so were the speedwells,\r\neglantines, thistles, and the sweetbriar that sprang up from the\r\nthickets. Through openings in the hedges one could see into the\r\nhuts, some pigs on a dung-heap, or tethered cows rubbing their\r\nhorns against the trunk of trees. The two, side by side walked\r\nslowly, she leaning upon him, and he restraining his pace, which\r\nhe regulated by hers; in front of them a swarm of midges\r\nfluttered, buzzing in the warm air.\r\nThe recognized the house by an old walnut-tree which shaded it.\r\nLow and covered with brown tiles, there hung outside it, beneath\r\nthe dormer-window of the garret, a string of onions. Faggots\r\nupright against a thorn fence surrounded a bed of lettuce, a few\r\nsquare feet of lavender, and sweet peas stung on sticks. Dirty\r\nwater was running here and there on the grass, and all round were\r\nseveral indefinite rags, knitted stockings, a red calico jacket,\r\nand a large sheet of coarse linen spread over the hedge. At the\r\nnoise of the gate the nurse appeared with a baby she was suckling\r\non one arm. With her other hand she was pulling along a poor puny\r\nlittle fellow, his face covered with scrofula, the son of a Rouen\r\nhosier, whom his parents, too taken up with their business, left\r\nin the country.\r\n"Go in," she said; "your little one is there asleep."\r\nThe room on the ground-floor, the only one in the dwelling, had\r\nat its farther end, against the wall, a large bed without\r\ncurtains, while a kneading-trough took up the side by the window,\r\none pane of which was mended with a piece of blue paper. In the\r\ncorner behind the door, shining hob-nailed shoes stood in a row\r\nunder the slab of the washstand, near a bottle of oil with a\r\nfeather stuck in its mouth; a Matthieu Laensberg lay on the dusty\r\nmantelpiece amid gunflints, candle-ends, and bits of amadou.\r\nFinally, the last luxury in the apartment was a "Fame" blowing\r\nher trumpets, a picture cut out, no doubt, from some perfumer\'s\r\nprospectus and nailed to the wall with six wooden shoe-pegs.\r\nEmma\'s child was asleep in a wicker-cradle. She took it up in the\r\nwrapping that enveloped it and began singing softly as she rocked\r\nherself to and fro.\r\nLeon walked up and down the room; it seemed strange to him to see\r\nthis beautiful woman in her nankeen dress in the midst of all\r\nthis poverty. Madam Bovary reddened; he turned away, thinking\r\nperhaps there had been an impertinent look in his eyes. Then she\r\nput back the little girl, who had just been sick over her collar.\r\nThe nurse at once came to dry her, protesting that it wouldn\'t\r\nshow.\r\n"She gives me other doses," she said: "I am always a-washing of\r\nher. If you would have the goodness to order Camus, the grocer,\r\nto let me have a little soap, it would really be more convenient\r\nfor you, as I needn\'t trouble you then."\r\n"Very well! very well!" said Emma. "Good morning, Madame Rollet,"\r\nand she went out, wiping her shoes at the door.\r\nThe good woman accompanied her to the end of the garden, talking\r\nall the time of the trouble she had getting up of nights.\r\n"I\'m that worn out sometimes as I drop asleep on my chair. I\'m\r\nsure you might at least give me just a pound of ground coffee;\r\nthat\'d last me a month, and I\'d take it of a morning with some\r\nmilk."\r\nAfter having submitted to her thanks, Madam Bovary left. She had\r\ngone a little way down the path when, at the sound of wooden\r\nshoes, she turned round. It was the nurse.\r\n"What is it?"\r\nThen the peasant woman, taking her aside behind an elm tree,\r\nbegan talking to her of her husband, who with his trade and six\r\nfrancs a year that the captain--\r\n"Oh, be quick!" said Emma.\r\n"Well," the nurse went on, heaving sighs between each word, "I\'m\r\nafraid he\'ll be put out seeing me have coffee along, you know\r\nmen--"\r\n"But you are to have some," Emma repeated; "I will give you some.\r\nYou bother me!"\r\n"Oh, dear! my poor, dear lady! you see in consequence of his\r\nwounds he has terrible cramps in the chest. He even says that\r\ncider weakens him."\r\n"Do make haste, Mere Rollet!"\r\n"Well," the latter continued, making a curtsey, "if it weren\'t\r\nasking too much," and she curtsied once more, "if you would"--and\r\nher eyes begged--"a jar of brandy," she said at last, "and I\'d\r\nrub your little one\'s feet with it; they\'re as tender as one\'s\r\ntongue."\r\nOnce rid of the nurse, Emma again took Monsieur Leon\'s arm. She\r\nwalked fast for some time, then more slowly, and looking straight\r\nin front of her, her eyes rested on the shoulder of the young\r\nman, whose frock-coat had a black-velvety collar. His brown hair\r\nfell over it, straight and carefully arranged. She noticed his\r\nnails which were longer than one wore them at Yonville. It was\r\none of the clerk\'s chief occupations to trim them, and for this\r\npurpose he kept a special knife in his writing desk.\r\nThey returned to Yonville by the water-side. In the warm season\r\nthe bank, wider than at other times, showed to their foot the\r\ngarden walls whence a few steps led to the river. It flowed\r\nnoiselessly, swift, and cold to the eye; long, thin grasses\r\nhuddled together in it as the current drove them, and spread\r\nthemselves upon the limpid water like streaming hair; sometimes\r\nat the tip of the reeds or on the leaf of a water-lily an insect\r\nwith fine legs crawled or rested. The sun pierced with a ray the\r\nsmall blue bubbles of the waves that, breaking, followed each\r\nother; branchless old willows mirrored their grey backs in the\r\nwater; beyond, all around, the meadows seemed empty. It was the\r\ndinner-hour at the farms, and the young woman and her companion\r\nheard nothing as they walked but the fall of their steps on the\r\nearth of the path, the words they spoke, and the sound of Emma\'s\r\ndress rustling round her.\r\nThe walls of the gardens with pieces of bottle on their coping\r\nwere hot as the glass windows of a conservatory. Wallflowers had\r\nsprung up between the bricks, and with the tip of her open\r\nsunshade Madame Bovary, as she passed, made some of their faded\r\nflowers crumble into a yellow dust, or a spray of overhanging\r\nhoneysuckle and clematis caught in its fringe and dangled for a\r\nmoment over the silk.\r\nThey were talking of a troupe of Spanish dancers who were\r\nexpected shortly at the Rouen theatre.\r\n"Are you going?" she asked.\r\n"If I can," he answered.\r\nHad they nothing else to say to one another? Yet their eyes were\r\nfull of more serious speech, and while they forced themselves to\r\nfind trivial phrases, they felt the same languor stealing over\r\nthem both. It was the whisper of the soul, deep, continuous,\r\ndominating that of their voices. Surprised with wonder at this\r\nstrange sweetness, they did not think of speaking of the\r\nsensation or of seeking its cause. Coming joys, like tropical\r\nshores, throw over the immensity before them their inborn\r\nsoftness, an odorous wind, and we are lulled by this intoxication\r\nwithout a thought of the horizon that we do not even know.\r\nIn one place the ground had been trodden down by the cattle; they\r\nhad to step on large green stones put here and there in the mud.\r\nShe often stopped a moment to look where to place her foot, and\r\ntottering on a stone that shook, her arms outspread, her form\r\nbent forward with a look of indecision, she would laugh, afraid\r\nof falling into the puddles of water.\r\nWhen they arrived in front of her garden, Madame Bovary opened\r\nthe little gate, ran up the steps and disappeared.\r\nLeon returned to his office. His chief was away; he just glanced\r\nat the briefs, then cut himself a pen, and at last took up his\r\nhat and went out.\r\nHe went to La Pature at the top of the Argueil hills at the\r\nbeginning of the forest; he threw himself upon the ground under\r\nthe pines and watched the sky through his fingers.\r\n"How bored I am!" he said to himself, "how bored I am!"\r\nHe thought he was to be pitied for living in this village, with\r\nHomais for a friend and Monsieru Guillaumin for master. The\r\nlatter, entirely absorbed by his business, wearing gold-rimmed\r\nspectacles and red whiskers over a white cravat, understood\r\nnothing of mental refinements, although he affected a stiff\r\nEnglish manner, which in the beginning had impressed the clerk.\r\nAs to the chemist\'s spouse, she was the best wife in Normandy,\r\ngentle as a sheep, loving her children, her father, her mother,\r\nher cousins, weeping for other\'s woes, letting everything go in\r\nher household, and detesting corsets; but so slow of movement,\r\nsuch a bore to listen to, so common in appearance, and of such\r\nrestricted conversation, that although she was thirty, he only\r\ntwenty, although they slept in rooms next each other and he spoke\r\nto her daily, he never thought that she might be a woman for\r\nanother, or that she possessed anything else of her sex than the\r\ngown.\r\nAnd what else was there? Binet, a few shopkeepers, two or three\r\npublicans, the cure, and finally, Monsieur Tuvache, the mayor,\r\nwith his two sons, rich, crabbed, obtuse persons, who farmed\r\ntheir own lands and had feasts among themselves, bigoted to boot,\r\nand quite unbearable companions.\r\nBut from the general background of all these human faces Emma\'s\r\nstood out isolated and yet farthest off; for between her and him\r\nhe seemed to see a vague abyss.\r\nIn the beginning he had called on her several times along with\r\nthe druggist. Charles had not appeared particularly anxious to\r\nsee him again, and Leon did not know what to do between his fear\r\nof being indiscreet and the desire for an intimacy that seemed\r\nalmost impossible.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter Four\r\nWhen the first cold days set in Emma left her bedroom for the\r\nsitting-room, a long apartment with a low ceiling, in which there\r\nwas on the mantelpiece a large bunch of coral spread out against\r\nthe looking-glass. Seated in her arm chair near the window, she\r\ncould see the villagers pass along the pavement.\r\nTwice a day Leon went from his office to the Lion d'Or. Emma\r\ncould hear him coming from afar; she leant forward listening, and\r\nthe young man glided past the curtain, always dressed in the same\r\nway, and without turning his head. But in the twilight, when, her\r\nchin resting on her left hand, she let the embroidery she had\r\nbegun fall on her knees, she often shuddered at the apparition of\r\nthis shadow suddenly gliding past. She would get up and order the\r\ntable to be laid.\r\nMonsieur Homais called at dinner-time. Skull-cap in hand, he came\r\nin on tiptoe, in order to disturb no one, always repeating the\r\nsame phrase, \"Good evening, everybody.\" Then, when he had taken\r\nhis seat at the table between the pair, he asked the doctor about\r\nhis patients, and the latter consulted his as to the probability\r\nof their payment. Next they talked of \"what was in the paper.\"\r\nHomais by this hour knew it almost by heart, and he repeated it\r\nfrom end to end, with the reflections of the penny-a-liners, and\r\nall the stories of individual catastrophes that had occurred in\r\nFrance or abroad. But the subject becoming exhausted, he was not\r\nslow in throwing out some remarks on the dishes before him.\r\nSometimes even, half-rising, he delicately pointed out to madame\r\nthe tenderest morsel, or turning to the servant, gave her some\r\nadvice on the manipulation of stews and the hygiene of seasoning.\r\nHe talked aroma, osmazome, juices, and gelatine in a bewildering\r\nmanner. Moreover, Homais, with his head fuller of recipes than\r\nhis shop of jars, excelled in making all kinds of preserves,\r\nvinegars, and sweet liqueurs; he knew also all the latest\r\ninventions in economic stoves, together with the art of\r\npreserving cheese and of curing sick wines.\r\nAt eight o'clock Justin came to fetch him to shut up the shop.\r\nThen Monsieur Homais gave him a sly look, especially if Felicite\r\nwas there, for he half noticed that his apprentice was fond of\r\nthe doctor's house.\r\n\"The young dog,\" he said, \"is beginning to have ideas, and the\r\ndevil take me if I don't believe he's in love with your servant!\"\r\nBut a more serious fault with which he reproached Justin was his\r\nconstantly listening to conversation. On Sunday, for example, one\r\ncould not get him out of the drawing-room, whither Madame Homais\r\nhad called him to fetch the children, who were falling asleep in\r\nthe arm-chairs, and dragging down with their backs calico\r\nchair-covers that were too large.\r\nNot many people came to these soirees at the chemist's, his\r\nscandal-mongering and political opinions having successfully\r\nalienated various respectable persons from him. The clerk never\r\nfailed to be there. As soon as he heard the bell he ran to meet\r\nMadame Bovary, took her shawl, and put away under the\r\nshop-counter the thick list shoes that she wore over her boots\r\nwhen there was snow.\r\nFirst they played some hands at trente-et-un; next Monsieur\r\nHomais played ecarte with Emma; Leon behind her gave her advice.\r\nStanding up with his hands on the back of her chair he saw the\r\nteeth of her comb that bit into her chignon. With every movement\r\nthat she made to throw her cards the right side of her dress was\r\ndrawn up. From her turned-up hair a dark colour fell over her\r\nback, and growing gradually paler, lost itself little by little\r\nin the shade. Then her dress fell on both sides of her chair,\r\npuffing out full of folds, and reached the ground. When Leon\r\noccasionally felt the sole of his boot resting on it, he drew\r\nback as if he had trodden upon some one.\r\nWhen the game of cards was over, the druggist and the Doctor\r\nplayed dominoes, and Emma, changing her place, leant her elbow on\r\nthe table, turning over the leaves of L'Illustration.\" She had\r\nbrought her ladies' journal with her. Leon sat down near her;\r\nthey looked at the engravings together, and waited for one\r\nanother at the bottom of the pages. She often begged him to read\r\nher the verses; Leon declaimed them in a languid voice, to which\r\nhe carefully gave a dying fall in the love passages. But the\r\nnoise of the dominoes annoyed him. Monsieur Homais was strong at\r\nthe game; he could beat Charles and give him a double-six. Then\r\nthe three hundred finished, they both stretched themselves out in\r\nfront of the fire, and were soon asleep. The fire was dying out\r\nin the cinders; the teapot was empty, Leon was still reading.\r\nEmma listened to him, mechanically turning around the lampshade,\r\non the gauze of which were painted clowns in carriages, and\r\ntight-rope dances with their balancing-poles. Leon stopped,\r\npointing with a gesture to his sleeping audience; then they\r\ntalked in low tones, and their conversation seemed the more sweet\r\nto them because it was unheard.\r\nThus a kind of bond was established between them, a constant\r\ncommerce of books and of romances. Monsieur Bovary, little given\r\nto jealousy, did not trouble himself about it.\r\nOn his birthday he received a beautiful phrenological head, all\r\nmarked with figures to the thorax and painted blue. This was an\r\nattention of the clerk's. He showed him many others, even to\r\ndoing errands for him at Rouen; and the book of a novelist having\r\nmade the mania for cactuses fashionable, Leon bought some for\r\nMadame Bovary, bringing them back on his knees in the\r\n\"Hirondelle,\" pricking his fingers on their hard hairs.\r\nShe had a board with a balustrade fixed against her window to\r\nhold the pots. The clerk, too, had his small hanging garden; they\r\nsaw each other tending their flowers at their windows.\r\nOf the windows of the village there was one yet more often\r\noccupied; for on Sundays from morning to night, and every morning\r\nwhen the weather was bright, one could see at the dormer-window\r\nof the garret the profile of Monsieur Binet bending over his\r\nlathe, whose monotonous humming could be heard at the Lion d'Or.\r\nOne evening on coming home Leon found in his room a rug in velvet\r\nand wool with leaves on a pale ground. He called Madame Homais,\r\nMonsieur Homais, Justin, the children, the cook; he spoke of it\r\nto his chief; every one wanted to see this rug. Why did the\r\ndoctor's wife give the clerk presents? It looked queer. They\r\ndecided that she must be his lover.\r\nHe made this seem likely, so ceaselessly did he talk of her\r\ncharms and of her wit; so much so, that Binet once roughly\r\nanswered him--\r\n\"What does it matter to me since I'm not in her set?\"\r\nHe tortured himself to find out how he could make his declaration\r\nto her, and always halting between the fear of displeasing her\r\nand the shame of being such a coward, he wept with discouragement\r\nand desire. Then he took energetic resolutions, wrote letters\r\nthat he tore up, put it off to times that he again deferred.\r\nOften he set out with the determination to dare all; but this\r\nresolution soon deserted him in Emma's presence, and when\r\nCharles, dropping in, invited him to jump into his chaise to go\r\nwith him to see some patient in the neighbourhood, he at once\r\naccepted, bowed to madame, and went out. Her husband, was he not\r\nsomething belonging to her? As to Emma, she did not ask herself\r\nwhether she loved. Love, she thought, must come suddenly, with\r\ngreat outbursts and lightnings --a hurricane of the skies, which\r\nfalls upon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a\r\nleaf, and sweeps the whole heart into the abyss. She did not know\r\nthat on the terrace of houses it makes lakes when the pipes are\r\nchoked, and she would thus have remained in her security when she\r\nsuddenly discovered a rent in the wall of it."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Five\r\nIt was a Sunday in February, an afternoon when the snow was\r\nfalling.\r\nThey had all, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, Homais, and Monsieur\r\nLeon, gone to see a yarn-mill that was being built in the valley\r\na mile and a half from Yonville. The druggist had taken Napoleon\r\nand Athalie to give them some exercise, and Justin accompanied\r\nthem, carrying the umbrellas on his shoulder.\r\nNothing, however, could be less curious than this curiosity. A\r\ngreat piece of waste ground, on which pell-mell, amid a mass of\r\nsand and stones, were a few break-wheels, already rusty,\r\nsurrounded by a quadrangular building pierced by a number of\r\nlittle windows. The building was unfinished; the sky could be\r\nseen through the joists of the roofing. Attached to the\r\nstop-plank of the gable a bunch of straw mixed with corn-ears\r\nfluttered its tricoloured ribbons in the wind.\r\nHomais was talking. He explained to the company the future\r\nimportance of this establishment, computed the strength of the\r\nfloorings, the thickness of the walls, and regretted extremely\r\nnot having a yard-stick such as Monsieur Binet possessed for his\r\nown special use.\r\nEmma, who had taken his arm, bent lightly against his shoulder,\r\nand she looked at the sun\'s disc shedding afar through the mist\r\nhis pale splendour. She turned. Charles was there. His cap was\r\ndrawn down over his eyebrows, and his two thick lips were\r\ntrembling, which added a look of stupidity to his face; his very\r\nback, his calm back, was irritating to behold, and she saw\r\nwritten upon his coat all the platitude of the bearer.\r\nWhile she was considering him thus, tasting in her irritation a\r\nsort of depraved pleasure, Leon made a step forward. The cold\r\nthat made him pale seemed to add a more gentle languor to his\r\nface; between his cravat and his neck the somewhat loose collar\r\nof his shirt showed the skin; the lobe of his ear looked out from\r\nbeneath a lock of hair, and his large blue eyes, raised to the\r\nclouds, seemed to Emma more limpid and more beautiful than those\r\nmountain-lakes where the heavens are mirrored.\r\n"Wretched boy!" suddenly cried the chemist.\r\nAnd he ran to his son, who had just precipitated himself into a\r\nheap of lime in order to whiten his boots. At the reproaches with\r\nwhich he was being overwhelmed Napoleon began to roar, while\r\nJustin dried his shoes with a wisp of straw. But a knife was\r\nwanted; Charles offered his.\r\n"Ah!" she said to herself, "he carried a knife in his pocket like\r\na peasant."\r\nThe hoar-frost was falling, and they turned back to Yonville.\r\nIn the evening Madame Bovary did not go to her neighbour\'s, and\r\nwhen Charles had left and she felt herself alone, the comparison\r\nre-began with the clearness of a sensation almost actual, and\r\nwith that lengthening of perspective which memory gives to\r\nthings. Looking from her bed at the clean fire that was burning,\r\nshe still saw, as she had down there, Leon standing up with one\r\nhand behind his cane, and with the other holding Athalie, who was\r\nquietly sucking a piece of ice. She thought him charming; she\r\ncould not tear herself away from him; she recalled his other\r\nattitudes on other days, the words he had spoken, the sound of\r\nhis voice, his whole person; and she repeated, pouting out her\r\nlips as if for a kiss--\r\n"Yes, charming! charming! Is he not in love?" she asked herself;\r\n"but with whom? With me?"\r\nAll the proofs arose before her at once; her heart leapt. The\r\nflame of the fire threw a joyous light upon the ceiling; she\r\nturned on her back, stretching out her arms.\r\nThen began the eternal lamentation: "Oh, if Heaven had out willed\r\nit! And why not? What prevented it?"\r\nWhen Charles came home at midnight, she seemed to have just\r\nawakened, and as he made a noise undressing, she complained of a\r\nheadache, then asked carelessly what had happened that evening.\r\n"Monsieur Leon," he said, "went to his room early."\r\nShe could not help smiling, and she fell asleep, her soul filled\r\nwith a new delight.\r\nThe next day, at dusk, she received a visit from Monsieur\r\nLherueux, the draper. He was a man of ability, was this\r\nshopkeeper. Born a Gascon but bred a Norman, he grafted upon his\r\nsouthern volubility the cunning of the Cauchois. His fat, flabby,\r\nbeardless face seemed dyed by a decoction of liquorice, and his\r\nwhite hair made even more vivid the keen brilliance of his small\r\nblack eyes. No one knew what he had been formerly; a pedlar said\r\nsome, a banker at Routot according to others. What was certain\r\nwas that he made complex calculations in his head that would have\r\nfrightened Binet himself. Polite to obsequiousness, he always\r\nheld himself with his back bent in the position of one who bows\r\nor who invites.\r\nAfter leaving at the door his hat surrounded with crape, he put\r\ndown a green bandbox on the table, and began by complaining to\r\nmadame, with many civilities, that he should have remained till\r\nthat day without gaining her confidence. A poor shop like his was\r\nnot made to attract a "fashionable lady"; he emphasized the\r\nwords; yet she had only to command, and he would undertake to\r\nprovide her with anything she might wish, either in haberdashery\r\nor linen, millinery or fancy goods, for he went to town regularly\r\nfour times a month. He was connected with the best houses. You\r\ncould speak of him at the "Trois Freres," at the "Barbe d\'Or," or\r\nat the "Grand Sauvage"; all these gentlemen knew him as well as\r\nthe insides of their pockets. To-day, then he had come to show\r\nmadame, in passing, various articles he happened to have, thanks\r\nto the most rare opportunity. And he pulled out half-a-dozen\r\nembroidered collars from the box.\r\nMadame Bovary examined them. "I do not require anything," she\r\nsaid.\r\nThen Monsieur Lheureux delicately exhibited three Algerian\r\nscarves, several packet of English needles, a pair of straw\r\nslippers, and finally, four eggcups in cocoanut wood, carved in\r\nopen work by convicts. Then, with both hands on the table, his\r\nneck stretched out, his figure bent forward, open-mouthed, he\r\nwatched Emma\'s look, who was walking up and down undecided amid\r\nthese goods. From time to time, as if to remove some dust, he\r\nfilliped with his nail the silk of the scarves spread out at full\r\nlength, and they rustled with a little noise, making in the green\r\ntwilight the gold spangles of their tissue scintillate like\r\nlittle stars.\r\n"How much are they?"\r\n"A mere nothing," he replied, "a mere nothing. But there\'s no\r\nhurry; whenever it\'s convenient. We are not Jews."\r\nShe reflected for a few moments, and ended by again declining\r\nMonsieur Lheureux\'s offer. He replied quite unconcernedly--\r\n"Very well. We shall understand one another by and by. I have\r\nalways got on with ladies--if I didn\'t with my own!"\r\nEmma smiled.\r\n"I wanted to tell you," he went on good-naturedly, after his\r\njoke, "that it isn\'t the money I should trouble about. Why, I\r\ncould give you some, if need be."\r\nShe made a gesture of surprise.\r\n"Ah!" said he quickly and in a low voice, "I shouldn\'t have to go\r\nfar to find you some, rely on that."\r\nAnd he began asking after Pere Tellier, the proprietor of the\r\n"Cafe Francais," whom Monsieur Bovary was then attending.\r\n"What\'s the matter with Pere Tellier? He coughs so that he shakes\r\nhis whole house, and I\'m afraid he\'ll soon want a deal covering\r\nrather than a flannel vest. He was such a rake as a young man!\r\nThose sort of people, madame, have not the least regularity; he\'s\r\nburnt up with brandy. Still it\'s sad, all the same, to see an\r\nacquaintance go off."\r\nAnd while he fastened up his box he discoursed about the doctor\'s\r\npatients.\r\n"It\'s the weather, no doubt," he said, looking frowningly at the\r\nfloor, "that causes these illnesses. I, too, don\'t feel the\r\nthing. One of these days I shall even have to consult the doctor\r\nfor a pain I have in my back. Well, good-bye, Madame Bovary. At\r\nyour service; your very humble servant." And he closed the door\r\ngently.\r\nEmma had her dinner served in her bedroom on a tray by the\r\nfireside; she was a long time over it; everything was well with\r\nher.\r\n"How good I was!" she said to herself, thinking of the scarves.\r\nShe heard some steps on the stairs. It was Leon. She got up and\r\ntook from the chest of drawers the first pile of dusters to be\r\nhemmed. When he came in she seemed very busy.\r\nThe conversation languished; Madame Bovary gave it up every few\r\nminutes, whilst he himself seemed quite embarrassed. Seated on a\r\nlow chair near the fire, he turned round in his fingers the ivory\r\nthimble-case. She stitched on, or from time to time turned down\r\nthe hem of the cloth with her nail. She did not speak; he was\r\nsilent, captivated by her silence, as he would have been by her\r\nspeech.\r\n"Poor fellow!" she thought.\r\n"How have I displeased her?" he asked himself.\r\nAt last, however, Leon said that he should have, one of these\r\ndays, to go to Rouen on some office business.\r\n"Your music subscription is out; am I to renew it?"\r\n"No," she replied.\r\n"Why?"\r\n"Because--"\r\nAnd pursing her lips she slowly drew a long stitch of grey\r\nthread.\r\nThis work irritated Leon. It seemed to roughen the ends of her\r\nfingers. A gallant phrase came into his head, but he did not risk\r\nit.\r\n"Then you are giving it up?" he went on.\r\n"What?" she asked hurriedly. "Music? Ah! yes! Have I not my house\r\nto look after, my husband to attend to, a thousand things, in\r\nfact, many duties that must be considered first?"\r\nShe looked at the clock. Charles was late. Then, she affected\r\nanxiety. Two or three times she even repeated, "He is so good!"\r\nThe clerk was fond of Monsieur Bovary. But this tenderness on his\r\nbehalf astonished him unpleasantly; nevertheless he took up on\r\nhis praises, which he said everyone was singing, especially the\r\nchemist.\r\n"Ah! he is a good fellow," continued Emma.\r\n"Certainly," replied the clerk.\r\nAnd he began talking of Madame Homais, whose very untidy\r\nappearance generally made them laugh.\r\n"What does it matter?" interrupted Emma. "A good housewife does\r\nnot trouble about her appearance."\r\nThen she relapsed into silence.\r\nIt was the same on the following days; her talks, her manners,\r\neverything changed. She took interest in the housework, went to\r\nchurch regularly, and looked after her servant with more\r\nseverity.\r\nShe took Berthe from nurse. When visitors called, Felicite\r\nbrought her in, and Madame Bovary undressed her to show off her\r\nlimbs. She declared she adored children; this was her\r\nconsolation, her joy, her passion, and she accompanied her\r\ncaresses with lyrical outburst which would have reminded anyone\r\nbut the Yonville people of Sachette in "Notre Dame de Paris."\r\nWhen Charles came home he found his slippers put to warm near the\r\nfire. His waistcoat now never wanted lining, nor his shirt\r\nbuttons, and it was quite a pleasure to see in the cupboard the\r\nnight-caps arranged in piles of the same height. She no longer\r\ngrumbled as formerly at taking a turn in the garden; what he\r\nproposed was always done, although she did not understand the\r\nwishes to which she submitted without a murmur; and when Leon saw\r\nhim by his fireside after dinner, his two hands on his stomach,\r\nhis two feet on the fender, his two cheeks red with feeding, his\r\neyes moist with happiness, the child crawling along the carpet,\r\nand this woman with the slender waist who came behind his\r\narm-chair to kiss his forehead: "What madness!" he said to\r\nhimself. "And how to reach her!"\r\nAnd thus she seemed so virtuous and inaccessible to him that he\r\nlost all hope, even the faintest. But by this renunciation he\r\nplaced her on an extraordinary pinnacle. To him she stood outside\r\nthose fleshly attributes from which he had nothing to obtain, and\r\nin his heart she rose ever, and became farther removed from him\r\nafter the magnificent manner of an apotheosis that is taking\r\nwing. It was one of those pure feelings that do not interfere\r\nwith life, that are cultivated because they are rare, and whose\r\nloss would afflict more than their passion rejoices.\r\nEmma grew thinner, her cheeks paler, her face longer. With her\r\nblack hair, her large eyes, her aquiline nose, her birdlike walk,\r\nand always silent now, did she not seem to be passing through\r\nlife scarcely touching it, and to bear on her brow the vague\r\nimpress of some divine destiny? She was so sad and so calm, at\r\nonce so gentle and so reserved, that near her one felt oneself\r\nseized by an icy charm, as we shudder in churches at the perfume\r\nof the flowers mingling with the cold of the marble. The others\r\neven did not escape from this seduction. The chemist said--\r\n"She is a woman of great parts, who wouldn\'t be misplaced in a\r\nsub-prefecture."\r\nThe housewives admired her economy, the patients her politeness,\r\nthe poor her charity.\r\nBut she was eaten up with desires, with rage, with hate. That\r\ndress with the narrow folds hid a distracted fear, of whose\r\ntorment those chaste lips said nothing. She was in love with\r\nLeon, and sought solitude that she might with the more ease\r\ndelight in his image. The sight of his form troubled the\r\nvoluptuousness of this mediation. Emma thrilled at the sound of\r\nhis step; then in his presence the emotion subsided, and\r\nafterwards there remained to her only an immense astonishment\r\nthat ended in sorrow.\r\nLeon did not know that when he left her in despair she rose after\r\nhe had gone to see him in the street. She concerned herself about\r\nhis comings and goings; she watched his face; she invented quite\r\na history to find an excuse for going to his room. The chemist\'s\r\nwife seemed happy to her to sleep under the same roof, and her\r\nthoughts constantly centered upon this house, like the "Lion\r\nd\'Or" pigeons, who came there to dip their red feet and white\r\nwings in its gutters. But the more Emma recognised her love, the\r\nmore she crushed it down, that it might not be evident, that she\r\nmight make it less. She would have liked Leon to guess it, and\r\nshe imagined chances, catastrophes that should facilitate this.\r\nWhat restrained her was, no doubt, idleness and fear, and a sense\r\nof shame also. She thought she had repulsed him too much, that\r\nthe time was past, that all was lost. Then, pride, and joy of\r\nbeing able to say to herself, "I am virtuous," and to look at\r\nherself in the glass taking resigned poses, consoled her a little\r\nfor the sacrifice she believed she was making.\r\nThen the lusts of the flesh, the longing for money, and the\r\nmelancholy of passion all blended themselves into one suffering,\r\nand instead of turning her thoughts from it, she clave to it the\r\nmore, urging herself to pain, and seeking everywhere occasion for\r\nit. She was irritated by an ill-served dish or by a half-open\r\ndoor; bewailed the velvets she had not, the happiness she had\r\nmissed, her too exalted dreams, her narrow home.\r\nWhat exasperated her was that Charles did not seem to notice her\r\nanguish. His conviction that he was making her happy seemed to\r\nher an imbecile insult, and his sureness on this point\r\ningratitude. For whose sake, then was she virtuous? Was it not\r\nfor him, the obstacle to all felicity, the cause of all misery,\r\nand, as it were, the sharp clasp of that complex strap that\r\nbucked her in on all sides.\r\nOn him alone, then, she concentrated all the various hatreds that\r\nresulted from her boredom, and every effort to diminish only\r\naugmented it; for this useless trouble was added to the other\r\nreasons for despair, and contributed still more to the separation\r\nbetween them. Her own gentleness to herself made her rebel\r\nagainst him. Domestic mediocrity drove her to lewd fancies,\r\nmarriage tenderness to adulterous desires. She would have like\r\nCharles to beat her, that she might have a better right to hate\r\nhim, to revenge herself upon him. She was surprised sometimes at\r\nthe atrocious conjectures that came into her thoughts, and she\r\nhad to go on smiling, to hear repeated to her at all hours that\r\nshe was happy, to pretend to be happy, to let it be believed.\r\nYet she had loathing of this hypocrisy. She was seized with the\r\ntemptation to flee somewhere with Leon to try a new life; but at\r\nonce a vague chasm full of darkness opened within her soul.\r\n"Besides, he no longer loves me," she thought. "What is to become\r\nof me? What help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what\r\nsolace?"\r\nShe was left broken, breathless, inert, sobbing in a low voice,\r\nwith flowing tears.\r\n"Why don\'t you tell master?" the servant asked her when she came\r\nin during these crises.\r\n"It is the nerves," said Emma. "Do not speak to him of it; it\r\nwould worry him."\r\n"Ah! yes," Felicite went on, "you are just like La Guerine, Pere\r\nGuerin\'s daughter, the fisherman at Pollet, that I used to know\r\nat Dieppe before I came to you. She was so sad, so sad, to see\r\nher standing upright on the threshold of her house, she seemed to\r\nyou like a winding-sheet spread out before the door. Her illness,\r\nit appears, was a kind of fog that she had in her head, and the\r\ndoctors could not do anything, nor the priest either. When she\r\nwas taken too bad she went off quite alone to the sea-shore, so\r\nthat the customs officer, going his rounds, often found her lying\r\nflat on her face, crying on the shingle. Then, after her\r\nmarriage, it went off, they say."\r\n"But with me," replied Emma, "it was after marriage that it\r\nbegan."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Six\r\nOne evening when the window was open, and she, sitting by it, had\r\nbeen watching Lestiboudois, the beadle, trimming the box, she\r\nsuddenly heard the Angelus ringing.\r\nIt was the beginning of April, when the primroses are in bloom,\r\nand a warm wind blows over the flower-beds newly turned, and the\r\ngardens, like women, seem to be getting ready for the summer\r\nfetes. Through the bars of the arbour and away beyond, the river\r\nseen in the fields, meandering through the grass in wandering\r\ncurves. The evening vapours rose between the leafless poplars,\r\ntouching their outlines with a violet tint, paler and more\r\ntransparent than a subtle gauze caught athwart their branches. In\r\nthe distance cattle moved about; neither their steps nor their\r\nlowing could be heard; and the bell, still ringing through the\r\nair, kept up its peaceful lamentation.\r\nWith this repeated tinkling the thoughts of the young woman lost\r\nthemselves in old memories of her youth and school-days. She\r\nremembered the great candlesticks that rose above the vases full\r\nof flowers on the altar, and the tabernacle with its small\r\ncolumns. She would have liked to be once more lost in the long\r\nline of white veils, marked off here and there by the stuff black\r\nhoods of the good sisters bending over their prie-Dieu. At mass\r\non Sundays, when she looked up, she saw the gentle face of the\r\nVirgin amid the blue smoke of the rising incense. Then she was\r\nmoved; she felt herself weak and quite deserted, like the down of\r\na bird whirled by the tempest, and it was unconsciously that she\r\nwent towards the church, included to no matter what devotions, so\r\nthat her soul was absorbed and all existence lost in it.\r\nOn the Place she met Lestivoudois on his way back, for, in order\r\nnot to shorten his day\'s labour, he preferred interrupting his\r\nwork, then beginning it again, so that he rang the Angelus to\r\nsuit his own convenience. Besides, the ringing over a little\r\nearlier warned the lads of catechism hour.\r\nAlready a few who had arrived were playing marbles on the stones\r\nof the cemetery. Others, astride the wall, swung their legs,\r\nkicking with their clogs the large nettles growing between the\r\nlittle enclosure and the newest graves. This was the only green\r\nspot. All the rest was but stones, always covered with a fine\r\npowder, despite the vestry-broom.\r\nThe children in list shoes ran about there as if it were an\r\nenclosure made for them. The shouts of their voices could be\r\nheard through the humming of the bell. This grew less and less\r\nwith the swinging of the great rope that, hanging from the top of\r\nthe belfry, dragged its end on the ground. Swallows flitted to\r\nand fro uttering little cries, cut the air with the edge of their\r\nwings, and swiftly returned to their yellow nests under the tiles\r\nof the coping. At the end of the church a lamp was burning, the\r\nwick of a night-light in a glass hung up. Its light from a\r\ndistance looked like a white stain trembling in the oil. A long\r\nray of the sun fell across the nave and seemed to darken the\r\nlower sides and the corners.\r\n"Where is the cure?" asked Madame Bovary of one of the lads, who\r\nwas amusing himself by shaking a swivel in a hole too large for\r\nit.\r\n"He is just coming," he answered.\r\nAnd in fact the door of the presbytery grated; Abbe Bournisien\r\nappeared; the children, pell-mell, fled into the church.\r\n"These young scamps!" murmured the priest, "always the same!"\r\nThen, picking up a catechism all in rags that he had struck with\r\nis foot, "They respect nothing!" But as soon as he caught sight\r\nof Madame Bovary, "Excuse me," he said; "I did not recognise\r\nyou."\r\nHe thrust the catechism into his pocket, and stopped short,\r\nbalancing the heavy vestry key between his two fingers.\r\nThe light of the setting sun that fell full upon his face paled\r\nthe lasting of his cassock, shiny at the elbows, unravelled at\r\nthe hem. Grease and tobacco stains followed along his broad chest\r\nthe lines of the buttons, and grew more numerous the farther they\r\nwere from his neckcloth, in which the massive folds of his red\r\nchin rested; this was dotted with yellow spots, that disappeared\r\nbeneath the coarse hair of his greyish beard. He had just dined\r\nand was breathing noisily.\r\n"How are you?" he added.\r\n"Not well," replied Emma; "I am ill."\r\n"Well, and so am I," answered the priest. "These first warm days\r\nweaken one most remarkably, don\'t they? But, after all, we are\r\nborn to suffer, as St. Paul says. But what does Monsieur Bovary\r\nthink of it?"\r\n"He!" she said with a gesture of contempt.\r\n"What!" replied the good fellow, quite astonished, doesn\'t he\r\nprescribe something for you?"\r\n"Ah!" said Emma, "it is no earthly remedy I need."\r\nBut the cure from time to time looked into the church, where the\r\nkneeling boys were shouldering one another, and tumbling over\r\nlike packs of cards.\r\n"I should like to know--" she went on.\r\n"You look out, Riboudet," cried the priest in an angry voice;\r\n"I\'ll warm your ears, you imp!" Then turning to Emma, "He\'s\r\nBoudet the carpenter\'s son; his parents are well off, and let him\r\ndo just as he pleases. Yet he could learn quickly if he would,\r\nfor he is very sharp. And so sometimes for a joke I call him\r\nRiboudet (like the road one takes to go to Maromme) and I even\r\nsay \'Mon Riboudet.\' Ha! Ha! \'Mont Riboudet.\' The other day I\r\nrepeated that just to Monsignor, and he laughed at it; he\r\ncondescended to laugh at it. And how is Monsieur Bovary?"\r\nShe seemed not to hear him. And he went on--\r\n"Always very busy, no doubt; for he and I are certainly the\r\nbusiest people in the parish. But he is doctor of the body," he\r\nadded with a thick laugh, "and I of the soul."\r\nShe fixed her pleading eyes upon the priest. "Yes," she said,\r\n"you solace all sorrows."\r\n"Ah! don\'t talk to me of it, Madame Bovary. This morning I had to\r\ngo to Bas-Diauville for a cow that was ill; they thought it was\r\nunder a spell. All their cows, I don\'t know how it is--But pardon\r\nme! Longuemarre and Boudet! Bless me! Will you leave off?"\r\nAnd with a bound he ran into the church.\r\nThe boys were just then clustering round the large desk, climbing\r\nover the precentor\'s footstool, opening the missal; and others on\r\ntiptoe were just about to venture into the confessional. But the\r\npriest suddenly distributed a shower of cuffs among them. Seizing\r\nthem by the collars of their coats, he lifted them from the\r\nground, and deposited them on their knees on the stones of the\r\nchoir, firmly, as if he meant planting them there.\r\n"Yes," said he, when he returned to Emma, unfolding his large\r\ncotton handkerchief, one corner of which he put between his\r\nteeth, "farmers are much to be pitied."\r\n"Others, too," she replied.\r\n"Assuredly. Town-labourers, for example."\r\n"It is not they--"\r\n"Pardon! I\'ve there known poor mothers of families, virtuous\r\nwomen, I assure you, real saints, who wanted even bread."\r\n"But those," replied Emma, and the corners of her mouth twitched\r\nas she spoke, "those, Monsieur le Cure, who have bread and have\r\nno--"\r\n"Fire in the winter," said the priest.\r\n"Oh, what does that matter?"\r\n"What! What does it matter? It seems to me that when one has\r\nfiring and food--for, after all--"\r\n"My God! my God!" she sighed.\r\n"It is indigestion, no doubt? You must get home, Madame Bovary;\r\ndrink a little tea, that will strengthen you, or else a glass of\r\nfresh water with a little moist sugar."\r\n"Why?" And she looked like one awaking from a dream.\r\n"Well, you see, you were putting your hand to your forehead. I\r\nthought you felt faint." Then, bethinking himself, "But you were\r\nasking me something? What was it? I really don\'t remember."\r\n"I? Nothing! nothing!" repeated Emma.\r\nAnd the glance she cast round her slowly fell upon the old man in\r\nthe cassock. They looked at one another face to face without\r\nspeaking.\r\n"Then, Madame Bovary," he said at last, "excuse me, but duty\r\nfirst, you know; I must look after my good-for-nothings. The\r\nfirst communion will soon be upon us, and I fear we shall be\r\nbehind after all. So after Ascension Day I keep them recta* an\r\nextra hour every Wednesday. Poor children! One cannot lead them\r\ntoo soon into the path of the Lord, as, moreover, he has himself\r\nrecommended us to do by the mouth of his Divine Son. Good health\r\nto you, madame; my respects to your husband."\r\n*On the straight and narrow path.\r\nAnd he went into the church making a genuflexion as soon as he\r\nreached the door.\r\nEmma saw him disappear between the double row of forms, walking\r\nwith a heavy tread, his head a little bent over his shoulder, and\r\nwith his two hands half-open behind him.\r\nThen she turned on her heel all of one piece, like a statue on a\r\npivot, and went homewards. But the loud voice of the priest, the\r\nclear voices of the boys still reached her ears, and went on\r\nbehind her.\r\n"Are you a Christian?"\r\n"Yes, I am a Christian."\r\n"What is a Christian?"\r\n"He who, being baptized-baptized-baptized--"\r\nShe went up the steps of the staircase holding on to the\r\nbanisters, and when she was in her room threw herself into an\r\narm-chair.\r\nThe whitish light of the window-panes fell with soft undulations.\r\nThe furniture in its place seemed to have become more immobile,\r\nand to lose itself in the shadow as in an ocean of darkness. The\r\nfire was out, the clock went on ticking, and Emma vaguely\r\nmarvelled at this calm of all things while within herself was\r\nsuch tumult. But little Berthe was there, between the window and\r\nthe work-table, tottering on her knitted shoes, and trying to\r\ncome to her mother to catch hold of the ends of her\r\napron-strings.\r\n"Leave me alone," said the latter, putting her from her with her\r\nhand.\r\nThe little girl soon came up closer against her knees, and\r\nleaning on them with her arms, she looked up with her large blue\r\neyes, while a small thread of pure saliva dribbled from her lips\r\non to the silk apron.\r\n"Leave me alone," repeated the young woman quite irritably.\r\nHer face frightened the child, who began to scream.\r\n"Will you leave me alone?" she said, pushing her with her elbow.\r\nBerthe fell at the foot of the drawers against the brass handle,\r\ncutting her cheek, which began to bleed, against it. Madame\r\nBovary sprang to lift her up, broke the bell-rope, called for the\r\nservant with all her might, and she was just going to curse\r\nherself when Charles appeared. It was the dinner-hour; he had\r\ncome home.\r\n"Look, dear!" said Emma, in a calm voice, "the little one fell\r\ndown while she was playing, and has hurt herself."\r\nCharles reassured her; the case was not a serious one, and he\r\nwent for some sticking plaster.\r\nMadame Bovary did not go downstairs to the dining-room; she\r\nwished to remain alone to look after the child. Then watching her\r\nsleep, the little anxiety she felt gradually wore off, and she\r\nseemed very stupid to herself, and very good to have been so\r\nworried just now at so little. Berthe, in fact, no longer sobbed.\r\nHer breathing now imperceptibly raised the cotton covering. Big\r\ntears lay in the corner of the half-closed eyelids, through whose\r\nlashes one could see two pale sunken pupils; the plaster stuck on\r\nher cheek drew the skin obliquely.\r\n"It is very strange," thought Emma, "how ugly this child is!"\r\nWhen at eleven o\'clock Charles came back from the chemist\'s shop,\r\nwhither he had gone after dinner to return the remainder of the\r\nsticking-plaster, he found his wife standing by the cradle.\r\n"I assure you it\'s nothing." he said, kissing her on the\r\nforehead. "Don\'t worry, my poor darling; you will make yourself\r\nill."\r\nHe had stayed a long time at the chemist\'s. Although he had not\r\nseemed much moved, Homais, nevertheless, had exerted himself to\r\nbuoy him up, to "keep up his spirits." Then they had talked of\r\nthe various dangers that threaten childhood, of the carelessness\r\nof servants. Madame Homais knew something of it, having still\r\nupon her chest the marks left by a basin full of soup that a cook\r\nhad formerly dropped on her pinafore, and her good parents took\r\nno end of trouble for her. The knives were not sharpened, nor the\r\nfloors waxed; there were iron gratings to the windows and strong\r\nbars across the fireplace; the little Homais, in spite of their\r\nspirit, could not stir without someone watching them; at the\r\nslightest cold their father stuffed them with pectorals; and\r\nuntil they were turned four they all, without pity, had to wear\r\nwadded head-protectors. This, it is true, was a fancy of Madame\r\nHomais\'; her husband was inwardly afflicted at it. Fearing the\r\npossible consequences of such compression to the intellectual\r\norgans. He even went so far as to say to her, "Do you want to\r\nmake Caribs or Botocudos of them?"\r\nCharles, however, had several times tried to interrupt the\r\nconversation. "I should like to speak to you," he had whispered\r\nin the clerk\'s ear, who went upstairs in front of him.\r\n"Can he suspect anything?" Leon asked himself. His heart beat,\r\nand he racked his brain with surmises.\r\nAt last, Charles, having shut the door, asked him to see himself\r\nwhat would be the price at Rouen of a fine daguerreotypes. It was\r\na sentimental surprise he intended for his wife, a delicate\r\nattention--his portrait in a frock-coat. But he wanted first to\r\nknow "how much it would be." The inquiries would not put Monsieur\r\nLeon out, since he went to town almost every week.\r\nWhy? Monsieur Homais suspected some "young man\'s affair" at the\r\nbottom of it, an intrigue. But he was mistaken. Leon was after no\r\nlove-making. He was sadder than ever, as Madame Lefrancois saw\r\nfrom the amount of food he left on his plate. To find out more\r\nabout it she questioned the tax-collector. Binet answered roughly\r\nthat he "wasn\'t paid by the police."\r\nAll the same, his companion seemed very strange to him, for Leon\r\noften threw himself back in his chair, and stretching out his\r\narms. Complained vaguely of life.\r\n"It\'s because you don\'t take enough recreation," said the\r\ncollector.\r\n"What recreation?"\r\n"If I were you I\'d have a lathe."\r\n"But I don\'t know how to turn," answered the clerk.\r\n"Ah! that\'s true," said the other, rubbing his chin with an air\r\nof mingled contempt and satisfaction.\r\nLeon was weary of loving without any result; moreover he was\r\nbeginning to feel that depression caused by the repetition of the\r\nsame kind of life, when no interest inspires and no hope sustains\r\nit. He was so bored with Yonville and its inhabitants, that the\r\nsight of certain persons, of certain houses, irritated him beyond\r\nendurance; and the chemist, good fellow though he was, was\r\nbecoming absolutely unbearable to him. Yet the prospect of a new\r\ncondition of life frightened as much as it seduced him.\r\nThis apprehension soon changed into impatience, and then Paris\r\nfrom afar sounded its fanfare of masked balls with the laugh of\r\ngrisettes. As he was to finish reading there, why not set out at\r\nonce? What prevented him? And he began making home-preparations;\r\nhe arranged his occupations beforehand. He furnished in his head\r\nan apartment. He would lead an artist\'s life there! He would take\r\nlessons on the guitar! He would have a dressing-gown, a Basque\r\ncap, blue velvet slippers! He even already was admiring two\r\ncrossed foils over his chimney-piece, with a death\'s head on the\r\nguitar above them.\r\nThe difficulty was the consent of his mother; nothing, however,\r\nseemed more reasonable. Even his employer advised him to go to\r\nsome other chambers where he could advance more rapidly. Taking a\r\nmiddle course, then, Leon looked for some place as second clerk\r\nat Rouen; found none, and at last wrote his mother a long letter\r\nfull of details, in which he set forth the reasons for going to\r\nlive at Paris immediately. She consented.\r\nHe did not hurry. Every day for a month Hivert carried boxes,\r\nvalises, parcels for him from Yonville to Rouen and from Rouen to\r\nYonville; and when Leon had packed up his wardrobe, had his three\r\narm-chairs restuffed, bought a stock of neckties, in a word, had\r\nmade more preparations than for a voyage around the world, he put\r\nit off from week to week, until he received a second letter from\r\nhis mother urging him to leave, since he wanted to pass his\r\nexamination before the vacation.\r\nWhen the moment for the farewells had come, Madame Homais wept,\r\nJustin sobbed; Homais, as a man of nerve, concealed his emotion;\r\nhe wished to carry his friend\'s overcoat himself as far as the\r\ngate of the notary, who was taking Leon to Rouen in his carriage.\r\nThe latter had just time to bid farewell to Monsieur Bovary.\r\nWhen he reached the head of the stairs, he stopped, he was so out\r\nof breath. As he came in, Madame Bovary arose hurriedly.\r\n"It is I again!" said Leon.\r\n"I was sure of it!"\r\nShe bit her lips, and a rush of blood flowing under her skin made\r\nher red from the roots of her hair to the top of her collar. She\r\nremained standing, leaning  with her shoulder against the\r\nwainscot.\r\n"The doctor is not here?" he went on.\r\n"He is out." She repeated, "He is out."\r\nThen there was silence. They looked at one another and their\r\nthoughts, confounded in the same agony, clung close together like\r\ntwo throbbing breasts.\r\n"I should like to kiss Berthe," said Leon.\r\nEmma went down a few steps and called Felicite.\r\nHe threw one long look around him that took in the walls, the\r\ndecorations, the fireplace, as if to penetrate everything, carry\r\naway everything. But she returned, and the servant brought\r\nBerthe, who was swinging a windmill roof downwards at the end of\r\na string. Leon kissed her several times on the neck.\r\n"Good-bye, poor child! good-bye, dear little one! good-bye!" And\r\nhe gave her back to her mother.\r\n"Take her away," she said.\r\nThey remained alone--Madame Bovary, her back turned, her face\r\npressed against a window-pane; Leon held his cap in his hand,\r\nknocking it softly against his thigh.\r\n"It is going to rain," said Emma.\r\n"I have a cloak," he answered.\r\n"Ah!"\r\nShe turned around, her chin lowered, her forehead bent forward.\r\nThe light fell on it as on a piece of marble, to the curve of the\r\neyebrows, without one\'s being able to guess what Emma was seeing\r\non the horizon or what she was thinking within herself.\r\n"Well, good-bye," he sighed.\r\nShe raised her head with a quick movement.\r\n"Yes, good-bye--go!"\r\nThey advanced towards each other; he held out his hand; she\r\nhesitated.\r\n"In the English fashion, then," she said, giving her own hand\r\nwholly to him, and forcing a laugh.\r\nLeon felt it between his fingers, and the very essence of all his\r\nbeing seemed to pass down into that moist palm. Then he opened\r\nhis hand; their eyes met again, and he disappeared.\r\nWhen he reached the market-place, he stopped and hid behind a\r\npillar to look for the last time at this white house with the\r\nfour green blinds. He thought he saw a shadow behind the window\r\nin the room; but the curtain, sliding along the pole as though no\r\none were touching it, slowly opened its long oblique folds that\r\nspread out with a single movement, and thus hung straight and\r\nmotionless as a plaster wall. Leon set off running.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'From afar he saw his employer\'s gig in the road, and by it a man\r\nin a coarse apron holding the horse. Homais and Monsieur\r\nGuillaumin were talking. They were waiting for him.\r\n"Embrace me," said the druggist with tears in his eyes. "Here is\r\nyour coat, my good friend. Mind the cold; take care of yourself;\r\nlook after yourself."\r\n"Come, Leon, jump in," said the notary.\r\nHomais bend over the splash-board, and in a voice broken by sobs\r\nuttered these three sad words--\r\n"A pleasant journey!"\r\n"Good-night," said Monsieur Guillaumin. "Give him his head." They\r\nset out, and Homais went back.\r\nMadame Bovary had opened her window overlooking the garden and\r\nwatched the clouds. They gathered around the sunset on the side\r\nof Rouen and then swiftly rolled back their black columns, behind\r\nwhich the great rays of the sun looked out like the golden arrows\r\nof a suspended trophy, while the rest of the empty heavens was\r\nwhite as porcelain. But a gust of wind bowed the poplars, and\r\nsuddenly the rain fell; it pattered against the green leaves.\r\nThen the sun reappeared, the hens clucked, sparrows shook their\r\nwings in the damp thickets, and the pools of water on the gravel\r\nas they flowed away carried off the pink flowers of an acacia.\r\n"Ah! how far off he must be already!" she thought.\r\nMonsieur Homais, as usual, came at half-past six during dinner.\r\n"Well," said he, "so we\'ve sent off our young friend!"\r\n"So it seems," replied the doctor. Then turning on his chair;\r\n"Any news at home?"\r\n"Nothing much. Only my wife was a little moved this afternoon.\r\nYou know women--a nothing upsets them, especially my wife. And we\r\nshould be wrong to object to that, since their nervous\r\norganization is much more malleable than ours."\r\n"Poor Leon!" said Charles. "How will he live at Paris? Will he\r\nget used to it?"\r\nMadame Bovary sighed.\r\n"Get along!" said the chemist, smacking his lips. "The outings at\r\nrestaurants, the masked balls, the champagne--all that\'ll be\r\njolly enough, I assure you."\r\n"I don\'t think he\'ll go wrong," objected Bovary.\r\n"Nor do I," said Monsieur Homais quickly; "although he\'ll have to\r\ndo like the rest for fear of passing for a Jesuit. And you don\'t\r\nknow what a life those dogs lead in the Latin quarter with\r\nactresses. Besides, students are thought a great deal of in\r\nParis. Provided they have a few accomplishments, they are\r\nreceived in the best society; there are even ladies of the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Germain who fall in love with them, which\r\nsubsequently furnishes them opportunities for making very good\r\nmatches."\r\n"But," said the doctor, "I fear for him that down there--"\r\n"You are right," interrupted the chemist; "that is the reverse of\r\nthe medal. And one is constantly obliged to keep one\'s hand in\r\none\'s pocket there. Thus, we will suppose you are in a public\r\ngarden. An individual presents himself, well dressed, even\r\nwearing an order, and whom one would take for a diplomatist. He\r\napproaches you, he insinuates himself; offers you a pinch of\r\nsnuff, or picks up your hat. Then you become more intimate; he\r\ntakes you to a cafe, invites you to his country-house, introduces\r\nyou, between two drinks, to all sorts of people; and\r\nthree-fourths of the time it\'s only to plunder your watch or lead\r\nyou into some pernicious step.\r\n"That is true," said Charles; "but I was thinking especially of\r\nillnesses--of typhoid fever, for example, that attacks students\r\nfrom the provinces."\r\nEmma shuddered.\r\n"Because of the change of regimen," continued the chemist, "and\r\nof the perturbation that results therefrom in the whole system.\r\nAnd then the water at Paris, don\'t you know! The dishes at\r\nrestaurants, all the spiced food, end by heating the blood, and\r\nare not worth, whatever people may say of them, a good soup. For\r\nmy own part, I have always preferred plain living; it is more\r\nhealthy. So when I was studying pharmacy at Rouen, I boarded in a\r\nboarding house; I dined with the professors."\r\nAnd thus he went on, expounding his opinions generally and his\r\npersonal likings, until Justin came to fetch him for a mulled egg\r\nthat was wanted.\r\n"Not a moment\'s peace!" he cried; "always at it! I can\'t go out\r\nfor a minute! Like a plough-horse, I have always to be moiling\r\nand toiling. What drudgery!" Then, when he was at the door, "By\r\nthe way, do you know the news?"\r\n"What news?"\r\n"That it is very likely," Homais went on, raising his eyebrows\r\nand assuming one of his most serious expression, "that the\r\nagricultural meeting of the Seine-Inferieure will be held this\r\nyear at Yonville-l\'Abbaye. The rumour, at all events, is going\r\nthe round. This morning the paper alluded to it. It would be of\r\nthe utmost importance for our district. But we\'ll talk it over\r\nlater on. I can see, thank you; Justin has the lantern."'}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Seven\r\nThe next day was a dreary one for Emma. Everything seemed to her\r\nenveloped in a black atmosphere floating confusedly over the\r\nexterior of things, and sorrow was engulfed within her soul with\r\nsoft shrieks such as the winter wind makes in ruined castles. It\r\nwas that reverie which we give to things that will not return,\r\nthe lassitude that seizes you after everything was done; that\r\npain, in fine, that the interruption of every wonted movement,\r\nthe sudden cessation of any prolonged vibration, brings on.\r\nAs on the return from Vaubyessard, when the quadrilles were\r\nrunning in her head, she was full of a gloomy melancholy, of a\r\nnumb despair. Leon reappeared, taller, handsomer, more charming,\r\nmore vague. Though separated from her, he had not left her; he\r\nwas there, and the walls of the house seemed to hold his shadow.\r\nShe could not detach her eyes from the carpet where he had\r\nwalked, from those empty chairs where he had sat. The river still\r\nflowed on, and slowly drove its ripples along the slippery banks.\r\nThey had often walked there to the murmur of the waves over the\r\nmoss-covered pebbles. How bright the sun had been! What happy\r\nafternoons they had seen along in the shade at the end of the\r\ngarden! He read aloud, bareheaded, sitting on a footstool of dry\r\nsticks; the fresh wind of the meadow set trembling the leaves of\r\nthe book and the nasturtiums of the arbour. Ah! he was gone, the\r\nonly charm of her life, the only possible hope of joy. Why had\r\nshe not seized this happiness when it came to her? Why not have\r\nkept hold of it with both hands, with both knees, when it was\r\nabout to flee from her? And she cursed herself for not having\r\nloved Leon. She thirsted for his lips. The wish took possession\r\nof her to run after and rejoin him, throw herself into his arms\r\nand say to him, "It is I; I am yours." But Emma recoiled\r\nbeforehand at the difficulties of the enterprise, and her\r\ndesires, increased by regret, became only the more acute.\r\nHenceforth the memory of Leon was the centre of her boredom; it\r\nburnt there more brightly than the fire travellers have left on\r\nthe snow of a Russian steppe. She sprang towards him, she pressed\r\nagainst him, she stirred carefully the dying embers, sought all\r\naround her anything that could revive it; and the most distant\r\nreminiscences, like the most immediate occasions, what she\r\nexperienced as well as what she imagined, her voluptuous desires\r\nthat were unsatisfied, her projects of happiness that crackled in\r\nthe wind like dead boughs, her sterile virtue, her lost hopes,\r\nthe domestic tete-a-tete--she gathered it all up, took\r\neverything, and made it all serve as fuel for her melancholy.\r\nThe flames, however, subsided, either because the supply had\r\nexhausted itself, or because it had been piled up too much. Love,\r\nlittle by little, was quelled by absence; regret stifled beneath\r\nhabit; and this incendiary light that had empurpled her pale sky\r\nwas overspread and faded by degrees. In the supineness of her\r\nconscience she even took her repugnance towards her husband for\r\naspirations towards her lover, the burning of hate for the warmth\r\nof tenderness; but as the tempest still raged, and as passion\r\nburnt itself down to the very cinders, and no help came, no sun\r\nrose, there was night on all sides, and she was lost in the\r\nterrible cold that pierced her.\r\nThen the evil days of Tostes began again. She thought herself now\r\nfar more unhappy; for she had the experience of grief, with the\r\ncertainty that it would not end.\r\nA woman who had laid on herself such sacrifices could well allow\r\nherself certain whims. She bought a Gothic prie-dieu, and in a\r\nmonth spent fourteen francs on lemons for polishing her nails;\r\nshe wrote to Rouen for a blue cashmere gown; she chose one of\r\nLheureux\'s finest scarves, and wore it knotted around her waist\r\nover her dressing-gown; and, with closed blinds and a book in her\r\nhand, she lay stretched out on a couch in this garb.\r\nShe often changed her coiffure; she did her hair a la Chinoise,\r\nin flowing curls, in plaited coils; she parted in on one side and\r\nrolled it under like a man\'s.\r\nShe wanted to learn Italian; she bought dictionaries, a grammar,\r\nand a supply of white paper. She tried serious reading, history,\r\nand philosophy. Sometimes in the night Charles woke up with a\r\nstart, thinking he was being called to a patient. "I\'m coming,"\r\nhe stammered; and it was the noise of a match Emma had struck to\r\nrelight the lamp. But her reading fared like her piece of\r\nembroidery, all of which, only just begun, filled her cupboard;\r\nshe took it up, left it, passed on to other books.\r\nShe had attacks in which she could easily have been driven to\r\ncommit any folly. She maintained one day, in opposition to her\r\nhusband, that she could drink off a large glass of brandy, and,\r\nas Charles was stupid enough to dare her to, she swallowed the\r\nbrandy to the last drop.\r\nIn spite of her vapourish airs (as the housewives of Yonville\r\ncalled them), Emma, all the same, never seemed gay, and usually\r\nshe had at the corners of her mouth that immobile contraction\r\nthat puckers the faces of old maids, and those of men whose\r\nambition has failed. She was pale all over, white as a sheet; the\r\nskin of her nose was drawn at the nostrils, her eyes looked at\r\nyou vaguely. After discovering three grey hairs on her temples,\r\nshe talked much of her old age.\r\nShe often fainted. One day she even spat blood, and, as Charles\r\nfussed around her showing his anxiety--\r\n"Bah!" she answered, "what does it matter?"\r\nCharles fled to his study and wept there, both his elbows on the\r\ntable, sitting in an arm-chair at his bureau under the\r\nphrenological head.\r\nThen he wrote to his mother begging her to come, and they had\r\nmany long consultations together on the subject of Emma.\r\nWhat should they decide? What was to be done since she rejected\r\nall medical treatment? "Do you know what your wife wants?"\r\nreplied Madame Bovary senior.\r\n"She wants to be forced to occupy herself with some manual work.\r\nIf she were obliged, like so many others, to earn her living, she\r\nwouldn\'t have these vapours, that come to her from a lot of ideas\r\nshe stuffs into her head, and from the idleness in which she\r\nlives.\r\nYet she is always busy," said Charles.\r\n"Ah! always busy at what? Reading novels, bad books, works\r\nagainst religion, and in which they mock at priests in speeches\r\ntaken from Voltaire. But all that leads you far astray, my poor\r\nchild. Anyone who has no religion always ends by turning out\r\nbadly."\r\nSo it was decided to stop Emma reading novels. The enterprise did\r\nnot seem easy. The good lady undertook it. She was, when she\r\npassed through Rouen, to go herself to the lending-library and\r\nrepresent that Emma had discontinued her subscription. Would they\r\nnot have a right to apply to the police if the librarian\r\npersisted all the same in his poisonous trade? The farewells of\r\nmother and daughter-in-law were cold. During the three weeks that\r\nthey had been together they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words\r\napart from the inquiries and phrases when they met at table and\r\nin the evening before going to bed.\r\nMadame Bovary left on a Wednesday, the market-day at Yonville.\r\nThe Place since morning had been blocked by a row of carts,\r\nwhich, on end and their shafts in the air, spread all along the\r\nline of houses from the church to the inn. On the other side\r\nthere were canvas booths, where cotton checks, blankets, and\r\nwoollen stockings were sold, together with harness for horses,\r\nand packets of blue ribbon, whose ends fluttered in the wind. The\r\ncoarse hardware was spread out on the ground between pyramids of\r\neggs and hampers of cheeses, from which sticky straw stuck out.\r\nNear the corn-machines clucking hens passed their necks through\r\nthe bars of flat cages. The people, crowding in the same place\r\nand unwilling to move thence, sometimes threatened to smash the\r\nshop front of the chemist. On Wednesdays his shop was never\r\nempty, and the people pushed in less to buy drugs than for\r\nconsultations. So great was Homais\' reputation in the\r\nneighbouring villages. His robust aplomb had fascinated the\r\nrustics. They considered him a greater doctor than all the\r\ndoctors.\r\nEmma was leaning out at the window; she was often there. The\r\nwindow in the provinces replaces the theatre and the promenade,\r\nshe was amusing herself with watching the crowd of boors when she\r\nsaw a gentleman in a green velvet coat. He had on yellow gloves,\r\nalthough he wore heavy gaiters; he was coming towards the\r\ndoctor\'s house, followed by a peasant walking with a bent head\r\nand quite a thoughtful air.\r\n"Can I see the doctor?" he asked Justin, who was talking on the\r\ndoorsteps with Felicite, and, taking him for a servant of the\r\nhouse--"Tell him that Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger of La Huchette\r\nis here."\r\nIt was not from territorial vanity that the new arrival added "of\r\nLa Huchette" to his name, but to make himself the better known.\r\nLa Huchette, in fact, was an estate near Yonville, where he had\r\njust bought the chateau and two farms that he cultivated himself,\r\nwithout, however, troubling very much about them. He lived as a\r\nbachelor, and was supposed to have "at least fifteen thousand\r\nfrancs a year."\r\nCharles came into the room. Monsieur Boulanger introduced his\r\nman, who wanted to be bled because he felt "a tingling all over."\r\n"That\'ll purge me," he urged as an objection to all reasoning.\r\nSo Bovary ordered a bandage and a basin, and asked Justin to hold\r\nit. Then addressing the peasant, who was already pale--\r\n"Don\'t be afraid, my lad."\r\n"No, no, sir," said the other; "get on."\r\nAnd with an air of bravado he held out his great arm. At the\r\nprick of the lancet the blood spurted out, splashing against the\r\nlooking-glass.\r\n"Hold the basin nearer," exclaimed Charles.\r\n"Lor!" said the peasant, "one would swear it was a little\r\nfountain flowing. How red my blood is! That\'s a good sign, isn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n"Sometimes," answered the doctor, "one feels nothing at first,\r\nand then syncope sets in, and more especially with people of\r\nstrong constitution like this man."\r\nAt these words the rustic let go the lancet-case he was twisting\r\nbetween his fingers. A shudder of his shoulders made the\r\nchair-back creak. His hat fell off.\r\n"I thought as much," said Bovary, pressing his finger on the\r\nvein.\r\nThe basin was beginning to tremble in Justin\'s hands; his knees\r\nshook, he turned pale.\r\n"Emma! Emma!" called Charles.\r\nWith one bound she came down the staircase.\r\n"Some vinegar," he cried. "O dear! two at once!"\r\nAnd in his emotion he could hardly put on the compress.\r\n"It is nothing," said Monsieur Boulanger quietly, taking Justin\r\nin his arms. He seated him on the table with his back resting\r\nagainst the wall.\r\nMadame Bovary began taking off his cravat. The strings of his\r\nshirt had got into a knot, and she was for some minutes moving\r\nher light fingers about the young fellow\'s neck. Then she poured\r\nsome vinegar on her cambric handkerchief; she moistened his\r\ntemples with little dabs, and then blew upon them softly. The\r\nploughman revived, but Justin\'s syncope still lasted, and his\r\neyeballs disappeared in the pale sclerotics like blue flowers in\r\nmilk.\r\n"We must hide this from him," said Charles.\r\nMadame Bovary took the basin to put it under the table. With the\r\nmovement she made in bending down, her dress (it was a summer\r\ndress with four flounces, yellow, long in the waist and wide in\r\nthe skirt) spread out around her on the flags of the room; and as\r\nEmma stooping, staggered a little as she stretched out her arms.\r\nThe stuff here and there gave with the inflections of her bust.\r\nThen she went to fetch a bottle of water, and she was melting\r\nsome pieces of sugar when the chemist arrived. The servant had\r\nbeen to fetch him in the tumult. Seeing his pupil\'s eyes staring\r\nhe drew a long breath; then going around him he looked at him\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n"Fool!" he said, "really a little fool! A fool in four letters! A\r\nphlebotomy\'s a big affair, isn\'t it! And a fellow who isn\'t\r\nafraid of anything; a kind of squirrel, just as he is who climbs\r\nto vertiginous heights to shake down nuts. Oh, yes! you just talk\r\nto me, boast about yourself! Here\'s a fine fitness for practising\r\npharmacy later on; for under serious circumstances you may be\r\ncalled before the tribunals in order to enlighten the minds of\r\nthe magistrates, and you would have to keep your head then, to\r\nreason, show yourself a man, or else pass for an imbecile."\r\nJustin did not answer. The chemist went on--\r\n"Who asked you to come? You are always pestering the doctor and\r\nmadame. On Wednesday, moreover, your presence is indispensable to\r\nme. There are now twenty people in the shop. I left everything\r\nbecause of the interest I take in you. Come, get along! Sharp!\r\nWait for me, and keep an eye on the jars."\r\nWhen Justin, who was rearranging his dress, had gone, they talked\r\nfor a little while about fainting-fits. Madame Bovary had never\r\nfainted.\r\n"That is extraordinary for a lady," said Monsieur Boulanger; "but\r\nsome people are very susceptible. Thus in a duel, I have seen a\r\nsecond lose consciousness at the mere sound of the loading of\r\npistols."\r\n"For my part," said the chemist, "the sight of other people\'s\r\nblood doesn\'t affect me at all, but the mere thought of my own\r\nflowing would make me faint if I reflected upon it too much."\r\nMonsieur Boulanger, however, dismissed his servant, advising him\r\nto calm himself, since his fancy was over.\r\n"It procured me the advantage of making your acquaintance," he\r\nadded, and he looked at Emma as he said this. Then he put three\r\nfrancs on the corner of the table, bowed negligently, and went\r\nout.\r\nHe was soon on the other side of the river (this was his way back\r\nto La Huchette), and Emma saw him in the meadow, walking under\r\nthe poplars, slackening his pace now and then as one who\r\nreflects.\r\n"She is very pretty," he said to himself; "she is very pretty,\r\nthis doctor\'s wife. Fine teeth, black eyes, a dainty foot, a\r\nfigure like a Parisienne\'s. Where the devil does she come from?\r\nWherever did that fat fellow pick her up?"\r\nMonsieur Rodolphe Boulanger was thirty-four; he was of brutal\r\ntemperament and intelligent perspicacity, having, moreover, had\r\nmuch to do with women, and knowing them well. This one had seemed\r\npretty to him; so he was thinking about her and her husband.\r\n"I think he is very stupid. She is tired of him, no doubt. He has\r\ndirty nails, and hasn\'t shaved for three days. While he is\r\ntrotting after his patients, she sits there botching socks. And\r\nshe gets bored! She would like to live in town and dance polkas\r\nevery evening. Poor little woman! She is gaping after love like a\r\ncarp after water on a kitchen-table. With three words of\r\ngallantry she\'d adore one, I\'m sure of it. She\'d be tender,\r\ncharming. Yes; but how to get rid of her afterwards?"\r\nThen the difficulties of love-making seen in the distance made\r\nhim by contrast think of his mistress. She was an actress at\r\nRouen, whom he kept; and when he had pondered over this image,\r\nwith which, even in remembrance, he was satiated--\r\n"Ah! Madame Bovary," he thought, "is much prettier, especially\r\nfresher. Virginie is decidedly beginning to grow fat. She is so\r\nfinikin about her pleasures; and, besides, she has a mania for\r\nprawns."\r\nThe fields were empty, and around him Rodolphe only heard the\r\nregular beating of the grass striking against his boots, with a\r\ncry of the grasshopper hidden at a distance among the oats. He\r\nagain saw Emma in her room, dressed as he had seen her, and he\r\nundressed her.\r\n"Oh, I will have her," he cried, striking a blow with his stick\r\nat a clod in front of him. And he at once began to consider the\r\npolitical part of the enterprise. He asked himself--\r\n"Where shall we meet? By what means? We shall always be having\r\nthe brat on our hands, and the servant, the neighbours, and\r\nhusband, all sorts of worries. Pshaw! one would lose too much\r\ntime over it."\r\nThen he resumed, "She really has eyes that pierce one\'s heart\r\nlike a gimlet. And that pale complexion! I adore pale women!"\r\nWhen he reached the top of the Arguiel hills he had made up his\r\nmind. "It\'s only finding the opportunities. Well, I will call in\r\nnow and then. I\'ll send them venison, poultry; I\'ll have myself\r\nbled, if need be. We shall become friends; I\'ll invite them to my\r\nplace. By Jove!" added he, "there\'s the agricultural show coming\r\non. She\'ll be there. I shall see her. We\'ll begin boldly, for\r\nthat\'s the surest way."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['Chapter Eight\r\nAt last it came, the famous agricultural show. On the morning of\r\nthe solemnity all the inhabitants at their doors were chatting\r\nover the preparations. The pediment of the town hall had been\r\nhung with garlands of ivy; a tent had been erected in a meadow\r\nfor the banquet; and in the middle of the Place, in front of the\r\nchurch, a kind of bombarde was to announce the arrival of the\r\nprefect and the names of the successful farmers who had obtained\r\nprizes. The National Guard of Buchy (there was none at Yonville)\r\nhad come to join the corps of firemen, of whom Binet was captain.\r\nOn that day he wore a collar even higher than usual; and, tightly\r\nbuttoned in his tunic, his figure was so stiff and motionless\r\nthat the whole vital portion of his person seemed to have\r\ndescended into his legs, which rose in a cadence of set steps\r\nwith a single movement. As there was some rivalry between the\r\ntax-collector and the colonel, both, to show off their talents,\r\ndrilled their men separately. One saw the red epaulettes and the\r\nblack breastplates pass and re-pass alternately; there was no end\r\nto it, and it constantly began again. There had never been such a\r\ndisplay of pomp. Several citizens had scoured their houses the\r\nevening before; tri-coloured flags hung from half-open windows;\r\nall the public-houses were full; and in the lovely weather the\r\nstarched caps, the golden crosses, and the coloured neckerchiefs\r\nseemed whiter than snow, shone in the sun, and relieved with the\r\nmotley colours the sombre monotony of the frock-coats and blue\r\nsmocks. The neighbouring farmers\' wives, when they got off their\r\nhorses, pulled out the long pins that fastened around them their\r\ndresses, turned up for fear of mud; and the husbands, for their\r\npart, in order to save their hats, kept their handkerchiefs\r\naround them, holding one corner between their teeth.\r\nThe crowd came into the main street from both ends of the\r\nvillage. People poured in from the lanes, the alleys, the houses;\r\nand from time to time one heard knockers banging against doors\r\nclosing behind women with their gloves, who were going out to see\r\nthe fete. What was most admired were two long lamp-stands covered\r\nwith lanterns, that flanked a platform on which the authorities\r\nwere to sit. Besides this there were against the four columns of\r\nthe town hall four kinds of poles, each bearing a small standard\r\nof greenish cloth, embellished with inscriptions in gold letters.\r\nOn one was written, "To Commerce"; on the other, "To\r\nAgriculture"; on the third, "To Industry"; and on the fourth, "To\r\nthe Fine Arts."\r\nBut the jubilation that brightened all faces seemed to darken\r\nthat of Madame Lefrancois, the innkeeper. Standing on her\r\nkitchen-steps she muttered to herself, "What rubbish! what\r\nrubbish! With their canvas booth! Do they think the prefect will\r\nbe glad to dine down there under a tent like a gipsy? They call\r\nall this fussing doing good to the place! Then it wasn\'t worth\r\nwhile sending to Neufchatel for the keeper of a cookshop! And for\r\nwhom? For cowherds! tatterdemalions!"\r\nThe druggist was passing. He had on a frock-coat, nankeen\r\ntrousers, beaver shoes, and, for a wonder, a hat with a low\r\ncrown.\r\n"Your servant! Excuse me, I am in a hurry." And as the fat widow\r\nasked where he was going--\r\n"It seems odd to you, doesn\'t it, I who am always more cooped up\r\nin my laboratory than the man\'s rat in his cheese."\r\n"What cheese?" asked the landlady.\r\n"Oh, nothing! nothing!" Homais continued. "I merely wished to\r\nconvey to you, Madame Lefrancois, that I usually live at home\r\nlike a recluse. To-day, however, considering the circumstances,\r\nit is necessary--"\r\n"Oh, you\'re going down there!" she said contemptuously.\r\n"Yes, I am going," replied the druggist, astonished. "Am I not a\r\nmember of the consulting commission?"\r\nMere Lefrancois looked at him for a few moments, and ended by\r\nsaying with a smile--\r\n"That\'s another pair of shoes! But what does agriculture matter\r\nto you? Do you understand anything about it?"\r\n"Certainly I understand it, since I am a druggist--that is to\r\nsay, a chemist. And the object of chemistry, Madame Lefrancois,\r\nbeing the knowledge of the reciprocal and molecular action of all\r\nnatural bodies, it follows that agriculture is comprised within\r\nits domain. And, in fact, the composition of the manure, the\r\nfermentation of liquids, the analyses of gases, and the influence\r\nof miasmata, what, I ask you, is all this, if it isn\'t chemistry,\r\npure and simple?"\r\nThe landlady did not answer. Homais went on--\r\n"Do you think that to be an agriculturist it is necessary to have\r\ntilled the earth or fattened fowls oneself? It is necessary\r\nrather to know the composition of the substances in question--the\r\ngeological strata, the atmospheric actions, the quality of the\r\nsoil, the minerals, the waters, the density of the different\r\nbodies, their capillarity, and what not. And one must be master\r\nof all the principles of hygiene in order to direct, criticize\r\nthe construction of buildings, the feeding of animals, the diet\r\nof domestics. And, moreover, Madame Lefrancois, one must know\r\nbotany, be able to distinguish between plants, you understand,\r\nwhich are the wholesome and those that are deleterious, which are\r\nunproductive and which nutritive, if it is well to pull them up\r\nhere and re-sow them there, to propagate some, destroy others; in\r\nbrief, one must keep pace with science by means of pamphlets and\r\npublic papers, be always on the alert to find out improvements."\r\nThe landlady never took her eyes off the "Cafe Francois" and the\r\nchemist went on--\r\n"Would to God our agriculturists were chemists, or that at least\r\nthey would pay more attention to the counsels of science. Thus\r\nlately I myself wrote a considerable tract, a memoir of over\r\nseventy-two pages, entitled, \'Cider, its Manufacture and its\r\nEffects, together with some New Reflections on the Subject,\' that\r\nI sent to the Agricultural Society of Rouen, and which even\r\nprocured me the honour of being received among its\r\nmembers--Section, Agriculture; Class, Pomological.\r\nWell, if my work had been given to the public--" But the druggist\r\nstopped, Madame Lefrancois seemed so preoccupied.\r\n"Just look at them!" she said. "It\'s past comprehension! Such a\r\ncookshop as that!" And with a shrug of the shoulders that\r\nstretched out over her breast the stitches of her knitted bodice,\r\nshe pointed with both hands at her rival\'s inn, whence songs were\r\nheard issuing. "Well, it won\'t last long," she added. "It\'ll be\r\nover before a week."\r\nHomais drew back with stupefaction. She came down three steps and\r\nwhispered in his ear--\r\n"What! you didn\'t know it? There is to be an execution in next\r\nweek. It\'s Lheureux who is selling him out; he has killed him\r\nwith bills."\r\n"What a terrible catastrophe!" cried the druggist, who always\r\nfound expressions in harmony with all imaginable circumstances.\r\nThen the landlady began telling him the story that she had heard\r\nfrom Theodore, Monsieur Guillaumin\'s servant, and although she\r\ndetested Tellier, she blamed Lheureux. He was "a wheedler, a\r\nsneak."\r\n"There!" she said. "Look at him! he is in the market; he is\r\nbowing to Madame Bovary, who\'s got on a green bonnet. Why, she\'s\r\ntaking Monsieur Boulanger\'s arm."\r\n"Madame Bovary!" exclaimed Homais. "I must go at once and pay her\r\nmy respects. Perhaps she\'ll be very glad to have a seat in the\r\nenclosure under the peristyle." And, without heeding Madame\r\nLefrancois, who was calling him back to tell him more about it,\r\nthe druggist walked off rapidly with a smile on his lips, with\r\nstraight knees, bowing copiously to right and left, and taking up\r\nmuch room with the large tails of his frock-coat that fluttered\r\nbehind him in the wind.\r\nRodolphe, having caught sight of him from afar, hurried on, but\r\nMadame Bovary lost her breath; so he walked more slowly, and,\r\nsmiling at her, said in a rough tone--\r\n"It\'s only to get away from that fat fellow, you know, the\r\ndruggist." She pressed his elbow.\r\n"What\'s the meaning of that?" he asked himself. And he looked at\r\nher out of the corner of his eyes.\r\nHer profile was so calm that one could guess nothing from it. It\r\nstood out in the light from the oval of her bonnet, with pale\r\nribbons on it like the leaves of weeds. Her eyes with their long\r\ncurved lashes looked straight before her, and though wide open,\r\nthey seemed slightly puckered by the cheek-bones, because of the\r\nblood pulsing gently under the delicate skin. A pink line ran\r\nalong the partition between her nostrils. Her head was bent upon\r\nher shoulder, and the pearl tips of her white teeth were seen\r\nbetween her lips.\r\n"Is she making fun of me?" thought Rodolphe.\r\nEmma\'s gesture, however, had only been meant for a warning; for\r\nMonsieur Lheureux was accompanying them, and spoke now and again\r\nas if to enter into the conversation.\r\n"What a superb day! Everybody is out! The wind is east!"\r\nAnd neither Madame Bovary nor Rodolphe answered him, whilst at\r\nthe slightest movement made by them he drew near, saying, "I beg\r\nyour pardon!" and raised his hat.\r\nWhen they reached the farrier\'s house, instead of following the\r\nroad up to the fence, Rodolphe suddenly turned down a path,\r\ndrawing with him Madame Bovary. He called out--\r\n"Good evening, Monsieur Lheureux! See you again presently."\r\n"How you got rid of him!" she said, laughing.\r\n"Why," he went on, "allow oneself to be intruded upon by others?\r\nAnd as to-day I have the happiness of being with you--"\r\nEmma blushed. He did not finish his sentence. Then he talked of\r\nthe fine weather and of the pleasure of walking on the grass. A\r\nfew daisies had sprung up again.\r\n"Here are some pretty Easter daisies," he said, "and enough of\r\nthem to furnish oracles to all the amorous maids in the place."\r\nHe added, "Shall I pick some? What do you think?"\r\n"Are you in love?" she asked, coughing a little.\r\n"H\'m, h\'m! who knows?" answered Rodolphe.\r\nThe meadow began to fill, and the housewives hustled you with\r\ntheir great umbrellas, their baskets, and their babies. One had\r\noften to get out of the way of a long file of country folk,\r\nservant-maids with blue stockings, flat shoes, silver rings, and\r\nwho smelt of milk, when one passed close to them. They walked\r\nalong holding one another by the hand, and thus they spread over\r\nthe whole field from the row of open trees to the banquet tent.\r\nBut this was the examination time, and the farmers one after the\r\nother entered a kind of enclosure formed by a long cord supported\r\non sticks.\r\nThe beasts were there, their noses towards the cord, and making a\r\nconfused line with their unequal rumps. Drowsy pigs were\r\nburrowing in the earth with their snouts, calves were bleating,\r\nlambs baaing; the cows, on knees folded in, were stretching their\r\nbellies on the grass, slowly chewing the cud, and blinking their\r\nheavy eyelids at the gnats that buzzed round them. Plough-men\r\nwith bare arms were holding by the halter prancing stallions that\r\nneighed with dilated nostrils looking towards the mares. These\r\nstood quietly, stretching out their heads and flowing manes,\r\nwhile their foals rested in their shadow, or now and then came\r\nand sucked them. And above the long undulation of these crowded\r\nanimals one saw some white mane rising in the wind like a wave,\r\nor some sharp horns sticking out, and the heads of men running\r\nabout. Apart, outside the enclosure, a hundred paces off, was a\r\nlarge black bull, muzzled, with an iron ring in its nostrils, and\r\nwho moved no more than if he had been in bronze. A child in rags\r\nwas holding him by a rope.\r\nBetween the two lines the committee-men were walking with heavy\r\nsteps, examining each animal, then consulting one another in a\r\nlow voice. One who seemed of more importance now and then took\r\nnotes in a book as he walked along. This was the president of the\r\njury, Monsieur Derozerays de la Panville. As soon as he\r\nrecognised Rodolphe he came forward quickly, and smiling amiably,\r\nsaid--\r\n"What! Monsieur Boulanger, you are deserting us?"\r\nRodolphe protested that he was just coming. But when the\r\npresident had disappeared--\r\n"Ma foi!*" said he, "I shall not go. Your company is better than\r\nhis."\r\n',(0,a.jsx)(n.em,{children:'Upon my word!\r\nAnd while poking fun at the show, Rodolphe, to move about more easily,\r\nshowed the gendarme his blue card, and even stopped now and then in\r\nfront of some fine beast, which Madame Bovary did not at all admire.\r\nHe noticed this, and began jeering at the Yonville ladies and their\r\ndresses; then he apologised for the negligence of his own. He had that\r\nincongruity of common and elegant in which the habitually vulgar think\r\nthey see the revelation of an eccentric existence, of the\r\nperturbations of sentiment, the tyrannies of art, and always a\r\ncertain contempt for social conventions, that seduces or\r\nexasperates them. Thus his cambric shirt with plaited cuffs was\r\nblown out by the wind in the opening of his waistcoat of grey\r\nticking, and his broad-striped trousers disclosed at the ankle\r\nnankeen boots with patent leather gaiters.\r\nThese were so polished that they reflected the grass. He trampled\r\non horses\'s dung with them, one hand in the pocket of his jacket\r\nand his straw hat on one side.\r\n"Besides," added he, "when one lives in the country--"\r\n"It\'s waste of time," said Emma.\r\n"That is true," replied Rodolphe. "To think that not one of these\r\npeople is capable of understanding even the cut of a coat!"\r\nThen they talked about provincial mediocrity, of the lives it\r\ncrushed, the illusions lost there.\r\n"And I too," said Rodolphe, "am drifting into depression."\r\n"You!" she said in astonishment; "I thought you very\r\nlight-hearted."\r\n"Ah! yes. I seem so, because in the midst of the world I know how\r\nto wear the mask of a scoffer upon my face; and yet, how many a\r\ntime at the sight of a cemetery by moonlight have I not asked\r\nmyself whether it were not better to join those sleeping there!"\r\n"Oh! and your friends?" she said. "You do not think of them."\r\n"My friends! What friends? Have I any? Who cares for me?" And he\r\naccompanied the last words with a kind of whistling of the lips.\r\nBut they were obliged to separate from each other because of a\r\ngreat pile of chairs that a man was carrying behind them. He was\r\nso overladen with them that one could only see the tips of his\r\nwooden shoes and the ends of his two outstretched arms. It was\r\nLestiboudois, the gravedigger, who was carrying the church chairs\r\nabout amongst the people. Alive to all that concerned his\r\ninterests, he had hit upon this means of turning the show to\r\naccount; and his idea was succeeding, for he no longer knew which\r\nway to turn. In fact, the villagers, who were hot, quarreled for\r\nthese seats, whose straw smelt of incense, and they leant against\r\nthe thick backs, stained with the wax of candles, with a certain\r\nveneration.\r\nMadame Bovary again took Rodolphe\'s arm; he went on as if\r\nspeaking to himself--\r\n"Yes, I have missed so many things. Always alone! Ah! if I had\r\nsome aim in life, if I had met some love, if I had found someone!\r\nOh, how I would have spent all the energy of which I am capable,\r\nsurmounted everything, overcome everything!"\r\n"Yet it seems to me," said Emma, "that you are not to be pitied."\r\n"Ah! you think so?" said Rodolphe.\r\n"For, after all," she went on, "you are free--" she hesitated,\r\n"rich--"\r\n"Do not mock me," he replied.\r\nAnd she protested that she was not mocking him, when the report\r\nof a cannon resounded. Immediately all began hustling one another\r\npell-mell towards the village.\r\nIt was a false alarm. The prefect seemed not to be coming, and\r\nthe members of the jury felt much embarrassed, not knowing if\r\nthey ought to begin the meeting or still wait.\r\nAt last at the end of the Place a large hired landau appeared,\r\ndrawn by two thin horses, which a coachman in a white hat was\r\nwhipping lustily. Binet had only just time to shout, "Present\r\narms!" and the colonel to imitate him. All ran towards the\r\nenclosure; everyone pushed forward. A few even forgot their\r\ncollars; but the equipage of the prefect seemed to anticipate the\r\ncrowd, and the two yoked jades, trapesing in their harness, came\r\nup at a little trot in front of the peristyle of the town hall at\r\nthe very moment when the National Guard and firemen deployed,\r\nbeating drums and marking time.\r\n"Present!" shouted Binet.\r\n"Halt!" shouted the colonel. "Left about, march."\r\nAnd after presenting arms, during which the clang of the band,\r\nletting loose, rang out like a brass kettle rolling downstairs,\r\nall the guns were lowered. Then was seen stepping down from the\r\ncarriage a gentleman in a short coat with silver braiding, with\r\nbald brow, and wearing a tuft of hair at the back of his head, of\r\na sallow complexion and the most benign appearance. His eyes,\r\nvery large and covered by heavy lids, were half-closed to look at\r\nthe crowd, while at the same time he raised his sharp nose, and\r\nforced a smile upon his sunken mouth. He recognised the mayor by\r\nhis scarf, and explained to him that the prefect was not able to\r\ncome. He himself was a councillor at the prefecture; then he\r\nadded a few apologies. Monsieur Tuvache answered them with\r\ncompliments; the other confessed himself nervous; and they\r\nremained thus, face to face, their foreheads almost touching,\r\nwith the members of the jury all round, the municipal council,\r\nthe notable personages, the National Guard and the crowd. The\r\ncouncillor pressing his little cocked hat to his breast repeated\r\nhis bows, while Tuvache, bent like a bow, also smiled, stammered,\r\ntried to say something, protested his devotion to the monarchy\r\nand the honour that was being done to Yonville.\r\nHippolyte, the groom from the inn, took the head of the horses\r\nfrom the coachman, and, limping along with his club-foot, led\r\nthem to the door of the "Lion d\'Or", where a number of peasants\r\ncollected to look at the carriage. The drum beat, the howitzer\r\nthundered, and the gentlemen one by one mounted the platform,\r\nwhere they sat down in red utrecht velvet arm-chairs that had\r\nbeen lent by Madame Tuvache.\r\nAll these people looked alike. Their fair flabby faces, somewhat\r\ntanned by the sun, were the colour of sweet cider, and their\r\npuffy whiskers emerged from stiff collars, kept up by white\r\ncravats with broad bows. All the waist-coats were of velvet,\r\ndouble-breasted; all the watches had, at the end of a long\r\nribbon, an oval cornelian seal; everyone rested his two hands on\r\nhis thighs, carefully stretching the stride of their trousers,\r\nwhose unsponged glossy cloth shone more brilliantly than the\r\nleather of their heavy boots.\r\nThe ladies of the company stood at the back under the vestibule\r\nbetween the pillars while the common herd was opposite, standing\r\nup or sitting on chairs. As a matter of fact, Lestiboudois had\r\nbrought thither all those that he had moved from the field, and\r\nhe even kept running back every minute to fetch others from the\r\nchurch. He caused such confusion with this piece of business that\r\none had great difficulty in getting to the small steps of the\r\nplatform.\r\n"I think," said Monsieur Lheureux to the chemist, who was passing\r\nto his place, "that they ought to have put up two Venetian masts\r\nwith something rather severe and rich for ornaments; it would\r\nhave been a very pretty effect."\r\n"To be sure," replied Homais; "but what can you expect? The mayor\r\ntook everything on his own shoulders. He hasn\'t much taste. Poor\r\nTuvache! and he is even completely destitute of what is called\r\nthe genius of art."\r\nRodolphe, meanwhile, with Madame Bovary, had gone up to the first\r\nfloor of the town hall, to the "council-room," and, as it was\r\nempty, he declared that they could enjoy the sight there more\r\ncomfortably. He fetched three stools from the round table under\r\nthe bust of the monarch, and having carried them to one of the\r\nwindows, they sat down by each other.\r\nThere was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much\r\nparleying. At last the councillor got up. They knew now that his\r\nname was Lieuvain, and in the crowd the name was passed from one\r\nto the other. After he had collated a few pages, and bent over\r\nthem to see better, he began--\r\n"Gentlemen! May I be permitted first of all (before addressing\r\nyou on the object of our meeting to-day, and this sentiment will,\r\nI am sure, be shared by you all), may I be permitted, I say, to\r\npay a tribute to the higher administration, to the government to\r\nthe monarch, gentle men, our sovereign, to that beloved king, to\r\nwhom no branch of public or private prosperity is a matter of\r\nindifference, and who directs with a hand at once so firm and\r\nwise the chariot of the state amid the incessant perils of a\r\nstormy sea, knowing, moreover, how to make peace respected as\r\nwell as war, industry, commerce, agriculture, and the fine arts?"\r\n"I ought," said Rodolphe, "to get back a little further."\r\n"Why?" said Emma.\r\nBut at this moment the voice of the councillor rose to an\r\nextraordinary pitch. He declaimed--\r\n"This is no longer the time, gentlemen, when civil discord\r\nensanguined our public places, when the landlord, the\r\nbusiness-man, the working-man himself, falling asleep at night,\r\nlying down to peaceful sleep, trembled lest he should be awakened\r\nsuddenly by the noise of incendiary tocsins, when the most\r\nsubversive doctrines audaciously sapped foundations."\r\n"Well, someone down there might see me," Rodolphe resumed, "then\r\nI should have to invent excuses for a fortnight; and with my bad\r\nreputation--"\r\n"Oh, you are slandering yourself," said Emma.\r\n"No! It is dreadful, I assure you."\r\n"But, gentlemen," continued the councillor, "if, banishing from\r\nmy memory the remembrance of these sad pictures, I carry my eyes\r\nback to the actual situation of our dear country, what do I see\r\nthere? Everywhere commerce and the arts are flourishing;\r\neverywhere new means of communication, like so many new arteries\r\nin the body of the state, establish within it new relations. Our\r\ngreat industrial centres have recovered all their activity;\r\nreligion, more consolidated, smiles in all hearts; our ports are\r\nfull, confidence is born again, and France breathes once more!"\r\n"Besides," added Rodolphe, "perhaps from the world\'s point of\r\nview they are right."\r\n"How so?" she asked.\r\n"What!" said he. "Do you not know that there are souls constantly\r\ntormented? They need by turns to dream and to act, the purest\r\npassions and the most turbulent joys, and thus they fling\r\nthemselves into all sorts of fantasies, of follies."\r\nThen she looked at him as one looks at a traveller who has\r\nvoyaged over strange lands, and went on--\r\n"We have not even this distraction, we poor women!"\r\n"A sad distraction, for happiness isn\'t found in it."\r\n"But is it ever found?" she asked.\r\n"Yes; one day it comes," he answered.\r\n"And this is what you have understood," said the councillor.\r\n"You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a\r\nwork that belongs wholly to civilization! you, men of progress\r\nand morality, you have understood, I say, that political storms\r\nare even more redoubtable than atmospheric disturbances!"\r\n"It comes one day," repeated Rodolphe, "one day suddenly, and\r\nwhen one is despairing of it. Then the horizon expands; it is as\r\nif a voice cried, \'It is here!\' You feel the need of confiding\r\nthe whole of your life, of giving everything, sacrificing\r\neverything to this being. There is no need for explanations; they\r\nunderstand one another. They have seen each other in dreams!"\r\n(And he looked at her.) "In fine, here it is, this treasure so\r\nsought after, here before you. It glitters, it flashes; yet one\r\nstill doubts, one does not believe it; one remains dazzled, as if\r\none went out iron darkness into light."\r\nAnd as he ended Rodolphe suited the action to the word. He passed\r\nhis hand over his face, like a man seized with giddiness. Then he\r\nlet it fall on Emma\'s. She took hers away.\r\n"And who would be surprised at it, gentlemen? He only who is so\r\nblind, so plunged (I do not fear to say it), so plunged in the\r\nprejudices of another age as still to misunderstand the spirit of\r\nagricultural populations. Where, indeed, is to be found more\r\npatriotism than in the country, greater devotion to the public\r\nwelfare, more intelligence, in a word? And, gentlemen, I do not\r\nmean that superficial intelligence, vain ornament of idle minds,\r\nbut rather that profound and balanced intelligence that applies\r\nitself above all else to useful objects, thus contributing to the\r\ngood of all, to the common amelioration and to the support of the\r\nstate, born of respect for law and the practice of duty--"\r\n"Ah! again!" said Rodolphe. "Always \'duty.\' I am sick of the\r\nword. They are a lot of old blockheads in flannel vests and of\r\nold women with foot-warmers and rosaries who constantly drone\r\ninto our ears \'Duty, duty!\' Ah! by Jove! one\'s duty is to feel\r\nwhat is great, cherish the beautiful, and not accept all the\r\nconventions of society with the ignominy that it imposes upon\r\nus."\r\n"Yet--yet--" objected Madame Bovary.\r\n"No, no! Why cry out against the passions? Are they not the one\r\nbeautiful thing on the earth, the source of heroism, of\r\nenthusiasm, of poetry, music, the arts, of everything, in a\r\nword?"\r\n"But one must," said Emma, "to some extent bow to the opinion of\r\nthe world and accept its moral code."\r\n"Ah! but there are two," he replied. "The small, the\r\nconventional, that of men, that which constantly changes, that\r\nbrays out so loudly, that makes such a commotion here below, of\r\nthe earth earthly, like the mass of imbeciles you see down there.\r\nBut the other, the eternal, that is about us and above, like the\r\nlandscape that surrounds us, and the blue heavens that give us\r\nlight."\r\nMonsieur Lieuvain had just wiped his mouth with a\r\npocket-handkerchief. He continued--\r\n"And what should I do here gentlemen, pointing out to you the\r\nuses of agriculture? Who supplies our wants? Who provides our\r\nmeans of subsistence? Is it not the agriculturist? The\r\nagriculturist, gentlemen, who, sowing with laborious hand the\r\nfertile furrows of the country, brings forth the corn, which,\r\nbeing ground, is made into a powder by means of ingenious\r\nmachinery, comes out thence under the name of flour, and from\r\nthere, transported to our cities, is soon delivered at the\r\nbaker\'s, who makes it into food for poor and rich alike. Again,\r\nis it not the agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his\r\nabundant flocks in the pastures? For how should we clothe\r\nourselves, how nourish ourselves, without the agriculturist? And,\r\ngentlemen, is it even necessary to go so far for examples? Who\r\nhas not frequently reflected on all the momentous things that we\r\nget out of that modest animal, the ornament of poultry-yards,\r\nthat provides us at once with a soft pillow for our bed, with\r\nsucculent flesh for our tables, and eggs? But I should never end\r\nif I were to enumerate one after the other all the different\r\nproducts which the earth, well cultivated, like a generous\r\nmother, lavishes upon her children. Here it is the vine,\r\nelsewhere the apple tree for cider, there colza, farther on\r\ncheeses and flax. Gentlemen, let us not forget flax, which has\r\nmade such great strides of late years, and to which I will more\r\nparticularly call your attention."\r\nHe had no need to call it, for all the mouths of the multitude\r\nwere wide open, as if to drink in his words. Tuvache by his side\r\nlistened to him with staring eyes. Monsieur Derozerays from time\r\nto time softly closed his eyelids, and farther on the chemist,\r\nwith his son Napoleon between his knees, put his hand behind his\r\near in order not to lose a syllable. The chins of the other\r\nmembers of the jury went slowly up and down in their waistcoats\r\nin sign of approval. The firemen at the foot of the platform\r\nrested on their bayonets; and Binet, motionless, stood with\r\nout-turned elbows, the point of his sabre in the air. Perhaps he\r\ncould hear, but certainly he could see nothing, because of the\r\nvisor of his helmet, that fell down on his nose. His lieutenant,\r\nthe youngest son of Monsieur Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his\r\nwas enormous, and shook on his head, and from it an end of his\r\ncotton scarf peeped out. He smiled beneath it with a perfectly\r\ninfantine sweetness, and his pale little face, whence drops were\r\nrunning, wore an expression of enjoyment and sleepiness.\r\nThe square as far as the houses was crowded with people. One saw\r\nfolk leaning on their elbows at all the windows, others standing\r\nat doors, and Justin, in front of the chemist\'s shop, seemed\r\nquite transfixed by the sight of what he was looking at. In spite\r\nof the silence Monsieur Lieuvain\'s voice was lost in the air. It\r\nreached you in fragments of phrases, and interrupted here and\r\nthere by the creaking of chairs in the crowd; then you suddenly\r\nheard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the bleating of the\r\nlambs, who answered one another at street corners. In fact, the\r\ncowherds and shepherds had driven their beasts thus far, and\r\nthese lowed from time to time, while with their tongues they tore\r\ndown some scrap of foliage that hung above their mouths.\r\nRodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her in a low\r\nvoice, speaking rapidly--\r\n"Does not this conspiracy of the world revolt you? Is there a\r\nsingle sentiment it does not condemn? The noblest instincts, the\r\npurest sympathies are persecuted, slandered; and if at length two\r\npoor souls do meet, all is so organised that they cannot blend\r\ntogether. Yet they will make the attempt; they will flutter their\r\nwings; they will call upon each other. Oh! no matter. Sooner or\r\nlater, in six months, ten years, they will come together, will\r\nlove; for fate has decreed it, and they are born one for the\r\nother."\r\nHis arms were folded across his knees, and thus lifting his face\r\ntowards Emma, close by her, he looked fixedly at her. She noticed\r\nin his eyes small golden lines radiating from black pupils; she\r\neven smelt the perfume of the pomade that made his hair glossy.\r\nThen a faintness came over her; she recalled the Viscount who had\r\nwaltzed with her at Vaubyessard, and his beard exhaled like this\r\nair an odour of vanilla and citron, and mechanically she\r\nhalf-closed her eyes the better to breathe it in. But in making\r\nthis movement, as she leant back in her chair, she saw in the\r\ndistance, right on the line of the horizon, the old diligence,\r\nthe "Hirondelle," that was slowly descending the hill of Leux,\r\ndragging after it a long trail of dust. It was in this yellow\r\ncarriage that Leon had so often come back to her, and by this\r\nroute down there that he had gone for ever. She fancied she saw\r\nhim opposite at his windows; then all grew confused; clouds\r\ngathered; it seemed to her that she was again turning in the\r\nwaltz under the light of the lustres on the arm of the Viscount,\r\nand that Leon was not far away, that he was coming; and yet all\r\nthe time she was conscious of the scent of Rodolphe\'s head by her\r\nside. This sweetness of sensation pierced through her old\r\ndesires, and these, like grains of sand under a gust of wind,\r\neddied to and fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which\r\nsuffused her soul. She opened wide her nostrils several times to\r\ndrink in the freshness of the ivy round the capitals. She took\r\noff her gloves, she wiped her hands, then fanned her face with\r\nher handkerchief, while athwart the throbbing of her temples she\r\nheard the murmur of the crowd and the voice of the councillor\r\nintoning his phrases. He said--"Continue, persevere; listen\r\nneither to the suggestions of routine, nor to the over-hasty\r\ncouncils of a rash empiricism.\r\nApply yourselves, above all, to the amelioration of the soil, to\r\ngood manures, to the development of the equine, bovine, ovine,\r\nand porcine races. Let these shows be to you pacific arenas,\r\nwhere the victor in leaving it will hold forth a hand to the\r\nvanquished, and will fraternise with him in the hope of better\r\nsuccess. And you, aged servants, humble domestics, whose hard\r\nlabour no Government up to this day has taken into consideration,\r\ncome hither to receive the reward of your silent virtues, and be\r\nassured that the state henceforward has its eye upon you; that it\r\nencourages you, protects you; that it will accede to your just\r\ndemands, and alleviate as much as in it lies the burden of your\r\npainful sacrifices."\r\nMonsieur Lieuvain then sat down; Monsieur Derozerays got up,\r\nbeginning another speech. His was not perhaps so florid as that\r\nof the councillor, but it recommended itself by a more direct\r\nstyle, that is to say, by more special knowledge and more\r\nelevated considerations. Thus the praise of the Government took\r\nup less space in it; religion and agriculture more. He showed in\r\nit the relations of these two, and how they had always\r\ncontributed to civilisation. Rodolphe with Madame Bovary was\r\ntalking dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the\r\ncradle of society, the orator painted those fierce times when men\r\nlived on acorns in the heart of woods. Then they had left off the\r\nskins of beasts, had put on cloth, tilled the soil, planted the\r\nvine. Was this a good, and in this discovery was there not more\r\nof injury than of gain? Monsieur Derozerays set himself this\r\nproblem. From magnetism little by little Rodolphe had come to\r\naffinities, and while the president was citing Cincinnatus and\r\nhis plough, Diocletian, planting his cabbages, and the Emperors\r\nof China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed, the young\r\nman was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible\r\nattractions find their cause in some previous state of existence.\r\n"Thus we," he said, "why did we come to know one another? What\r\nchance willed it? It was because across the infinite, like two\r\nstreams that flow but to unite; our special bents of mind had\r\ndriven us towards each other."\r\nAnd he seized her hand; she did not withdraw it.\r\n"For good farming generally!" cried the president.\r\n"Just now, for example, when I went to your house."\r\n"To Monsieur Bizat of Quincampoix."\r\n"Did I know I should accompany you?"\r\n"Seventy francs."\r\n"A hundred times I wished to go; and I followed you--I remained."\r\n"Manures!"\r\n"And I shall remain to-night, to-morrow, all other days, all my\r\nlife!"\r\n"To Monsieur Caron of Argueil, a gold medal!"\r\n"For I have never in the society of any other person found so\r\ncomplete a charm."\r\n"To Monsieur Bain of Givry-Saint-Martin."\r\n"And I shall carry away with me the remembrance of you."\r\n"For a merino ram!"\r\n"But you will forget me; I shall pass away like a shadow."\r\n"To Monsieur Belot of Notre-Dame."\r\n"Oh, no! I shall be something in your thought, in your life,\r\nshall I not?"\r\n"Porcine race; prizes--equal, to Messrs. Leherisse and\r\nCullembourg, sixty francs!"\r\nRodolphe was pressing her hand, and he felt it all warm and\r\nquivering like a captive dove that wants to fly away; but,\r\nwhether she was trying to take it away or whether she was\r\nanswering his pressure; she made a movement with her fingers. He\r\nexclaimed--\r\n"Oh, I thank you! You do not repulse me! You are good! You\r\nunderstand that I am yours! Let me look at you; let me\r\ncontemplate you!"\r\nA gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on\r\nthe table, and in the square below all the great caps of the\r\npeasant women were uplifted by it like the wings of white\r\nbutterflies fluttering.\r\n"Use of oil-cakes," continued the president. He was hurrying on:\r\n"Flemish manure-flax-growing-drainage-long leases-domestic\r\nservice."\r\nRodolphe was no longer speaking. They looked at one another. A\r\nsupreme desire made their dry lips tremble, and wearily, without\r\nan effort, their fingers intertwined.\r\n"Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux, of Sassetot-la-Guerriere,\r\nfor fifty-four years of service at the same farm, a silver\r\nmedal--value, twenty-five francs!"\r\n"Where is Catherine Leroux?" repeated the councillor.\r\nShe did not present herself, and one could hear voices\r\nwhispering--\r\n"Go up!"\r\n"Don\'t be afraid!"\r\n"Oh, how stupid she is!"\r\n"Well, is she there?" cried Tuvache.\r\n"Yes; here she is."\r\n"Then let her come up!"\r\nThen there came forward on the platform a little old woman with\r\ntimid bearing, who seemed to shrink within her poor clothes. On\r\nher feet she wore heavy wooden clogs, and from her hips hung a\r\nlarge blue apron. Her pale face framed in a borderless cap was\r\nmore wrinkled than a withered russet apple. And from the sleeves\r\nof her red jacket looked out two large hands with knotty joints,\r\nthe dust of barns, the potash of washing the grease of wools had\r\nso encrusted, roughened, hardened these that they seemed dirty,\r\nalthough they had been rinsed in clear water; and by dint of long\r\nservice they remained half open, as if to bear humble witness for\r\nthemselves of so much suffering endured. Something of monastic\r\nrigidity dignified her face. Nothing of sadness or of emotion\r\nweakened that pale look. In her constant living with animals she\r\nhad caught their dumbness and their calm. It was the first time\r\nthat she found herself in the midst of so large a company, and\r\ninwardly scared by the flags, the drums, the gentlemen in\r\nfrock-coats, and the order of the councillor, she stood\r\nmotionless, not knowing whether to advance or run away, nor why\r\nthe crowd was pushing her and the jury were smiling at her.\r\nThus stood before these radiant bourgeois this half-century of\r\nservitude.\r\n"Approach, venerable Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux!" said\r\nthe councillor, who had taken the list of prize-winners from the\r\npresident; and, looking at the piece of paper and the old woman\r\nby turns, he repeated in a fatherly tone--"Approach! approach!"\r\n"Are you deaf?" said Tuvache, fidgeting in his armchair; and he\r\nbegan shouting in her ear, "Fifty-four years of service. A silver\r\nmedal! Twenty-five francs! For you!"\r\nThen, when she had her medal, she looked at it, and a smile of\r\nbeatitude spread over her face; and as she walked away they could\r\nhear her muttering "I\'ll give it to our cure up home, to say some\r\nmasses for me!"\r\n"What fanaticism!" exclaimed the chemist, leaning across to the\r\nnotary.\r\nThe meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the\r\nspeeches had been read, each one fell back into his place again,\r\nand everything into the old grooves; the masters bullied the\r\nservants, and these struck the animals, indolent victors, going\r\nback to the stalls, a green-crown on their horns.\r\nThe National Guards, however, had gone up to the first floor of\r\nthe town hall with buns spitted on their bayonets, and the\r\ndrummer of the battalion carried a basket with bottles. Madame\r\nBovary took Rodolphe\'s arm; he saw her home; they separated at\r\nher door; then he walked about alone in the meadow while he\r\nwaited for the time of the banquet.\r\nThe feast was long, noisy, ill served; the guests were so crowded\r\nthat they could hardly move their elbows; and the narrow planks\r\nused for forms almost broke down under their weight. They ate\r\nhugely. Each one stuffed himself on his own account. Sweat stood\r\non every brow, and a whitish steam, like the vapour of a stream\r\non an autumn morning, floated above the table between the hanging\r\nlamps. Rodolphe, leaning against the calico of the tent was\r\nthinking so earnestly of Emma that he heard nothing. Behind him\r\non the grass the servants were piling up the dirty plates, his\r\nneighbours were talking; he did not answer them; they filled his\r\nglass, and there was silence in his thoughts in spite of the\r\ngrowing noise. He was dreaming of what she had said, of the line\r\nof her lips; her face, as in a magic mirror, shone on the plates\r\nof the shakos, the folds of her gown fell along the walls, and\r\ndays of love unrolled to all infinity before him in the vistas of\r\nthe future.\r\nHe saw her again in the evening during the fireworks, but she was\r\nwith her husband, Madame Homais, and the druggist, who was\r\nworrying about the danger of stray rockets, and every moment he\r\nleft the company to go and give some advice to Binet.\r\nThe pyrotechnic pieces sent to Monsieur Tuvache had, through an\r\nexcess of caution, been shut up in his cellar, and so the damp\r\npowder would not light, and the principal set piece, that was to\r\nrepresent a dragon biting his tail, failed completely. Now and\r\nthen a meagre Roman-candle went off; then the gaping crowd sent\r\nup a shout that mingled with the cry of the women, whose waists\r\nwere being squeezed in the darkness. Emma silently nestled\r\nagainst Charles\'s shoulder; then, raising her chin, she watched\r\nthe luminous rays of the rockets against the dark sky. Rodolphe\r\ngazed at her in the light of the burning lanterns.\r\nThey went out one by one. The stars shone out. A few crops of\r\nrain began to fall. She knotted her fichu round her bare head.\r\nAt this moment the councillor\'s carriage came out from the inn.\r\nHis coachman, who was drunk, suddenly dozed off, and one could\r\nsee from the distance, above the hood, between the two lanterns,\r\nthe mass of his body, that swayed from right to left with the\r\ngiving of the traces.\r\n"Truly," said the druggist, "one ought to proceed most rigorously\r\nagainst drunkenness! I should like to see written up weekly at\r\nthe door of the town hall on a board ad hoc'}),' the names of all\r\nthose who during the week got intoxicated on alcohol. Besides,\r\nwith regard to statistics, one would thus have, as it were,\r\npublic records that one could refer to in case of need. But\r\nexcuse me!"\r\n*Specifically for that.\r\nAnd he once more ran off to the captain. The latter was going\r\nback to see his lathe again.\r\n"Perhaps you would not do ill," Homais said to him, "to send one\r\nof your men, or to go yourself--"\r\n"Leave me alone!" answered the tax-collector. "It\'s all right!"\r\n"Do not be uneasy," said the druggist, when he returned to his\r\nfriends. "Monsieur Binet has assured me that all precautions have\r\nbeen taken. No sparks have fallen; the pumps are full. Let us go\r\nto rest."\r\n"Ma foi! I want it," said Madame Homais, yawning at large. "But\r\nnever mind; we\'ve had a beautiful day for our fete."\r\nRodolphe repeated in a low voice, and with a tender look, "Oh,\r\nyes! very beautiful!"\r\nAnd having bowed to one another, they separated.\r\nTwo days later, in the "Final de Rouen," there was a long article\r\non the show. Homais had composed it with verve the very next\r\nmorning.\r\n"Why these festoons, these flowers, these garlands? Whither\r\nhurries this crowd like the waves of a furious sea under the\r\ntorrents of a tropical sun pouring its heat upon our heads?"\r\nThen he spoke of the condition of the peasants. Certainly the\r\nGovernment was doing much, but not enough. "Courage!" he cried to\r\nit; "a thousand reforms are indispensable; let us accomplish\r\nthem!" Then touching on the entry of the councillor, he did not\r\nforget "the martial air of our militia;" nor "our most merry\r\nvillage maidens;" nor the "bald-headed old men like patriarchs\r\nwho were there, and of whom some, the remnants of our phalanxes,\r\nstill felt their hearts beat at the manly sound of the drums." He\r\ncited himself among the first of the members of the jury, and he\r\neven called attention in a note to the fact that Monsieur Homais,\r\nchemist, had sent a memoir on cider to the agricultural society.\r\nWhen he came to the distribution of the prizes, he painted the\r\njoy of the prize-winners in dithyrambic strophes. "The father\r\nembraced the son, the brother the brother, the husband his\r\nconsort. More than one showed his humble medal with pride; and no\r\ndoubt when he got home to his good housewife, he hung it up\r\nweeping on the modest walls of his cot.\r\n"About six o\'clock a banquet prepared in the meadow of Monsieur\r\nLeigeard brought together the principal personages of the fete.\r\nThe greatest cordiality reigned here. Divers toasts were\r\nproposed: Monsieur Lieuvain, the King; Monsieur Tuvache, the\r\nPrefect; Monsieur Derozerays, Agriculture; Monsieur Homais,\r\nIndustry and the Fine Arts, those twin sisters; Monsieur\r\nLeplichey, Progress. In the evening some brilliant fireworks on a\r\nsudden illumined the air. One would have called it a veritable\r\nkaleidoscope, a real operatic scene; and for a moment our little\r\nlocality might have thought itself transported into the midst of\r\na dream of the \'Thousand and One Nights.\' "Let us state that no\r\nuntoward event disturbed this family meeting." And he added "Only\r\nthe absence of the clergy was remarked. No doubt the priests\r\nunderstand progress in another fashion. Just as you please,\r\nmessieurs the followers of Loyola!"']}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Nine\r\nSix weeks passed. Rodolphe did not come again. At last one\r\nevening he appeared.\r\nThe day after the show he had said to himself--"We mustn\'t go\r\nback too soon; that would be a mistake."\r\nAnd at the end of a week he had gone off hunting. After the\r\nhunting he had thought it was too late, and then he reasoned\r\nthus--\r\n"If from the first day she loved me, she must from impatience to\r\nsee me again love me more. Let\'s go on with it!"\r\nAnd he knew that his calculation had been right when, on entering\r\nthe room, he saw Emma turn pale.\r\nShe was alone. The day was drawing in. The small muslin curtain\r\nalong the windows deepened the twilight, and the gilding of the\r\nbarometer, on which the rays of the sun fell, shone in the\r\nlooking-glass between the meshes of the coral.\r\nRodolphe remained standing, and Emma hardly answered his first\r\nconventional phrases.\r\n"I," he said, "have been busy. I have been ill."\r\n"Seriously?" she cried.\r\n"Well," said Rodolphe, sitting down at her side on a footstool,\r\n"no; it was because I did not want to come back."\r\n"Why?"\r\n"Can you not guess?"\r\nHe looked at her again, but so hard that she lowered her head,\r\nblushing. He went on--\r\n"Emma!"\r\n"Sir," she said, drawing back a little.\r\n"Ah! you see," replied he in a melancholy voice, "that I was\r\nright not to come back; for this name, this name that fills my\r\nwhole soul, and that escaped me, you forbid me to use! Madame\r\nBovary! why all the world calls you thus! Besides, it is not your\r\nname; it is the name of another!"\r\nHe repeated, "of another!" And he hid his face in his hands.\r\n"Yes, I think of you constantly. The memory of you drives me to\r\ndespair. Ah! forgive me! I will leave you! Farewell! I will go\r\nfar away, so far that you will never hear of me again; and yet--\r\nto-day--I know not what force impelled me towards you. For one\r\ndoes not struggle against Heaven; one cannot resist the smile of\r\nangels; one is carried away by that which is beautiful, charming,\r\nadorable."\r\nIt was the first time that Emma had heard such words spoken to\r\nherself, and her pride, like one who reposes bathed in warmth,\r\nexpanded softly and fully at this glowing language.\r\n"But if I did not come," he continued, "if I could not see you,\r\nat least I have gazed long on all that surrounds you. At\r\nnight-every night-I arose; I came hither; I watched your house,\r\nits glimmering in the moon, the trees in the garden swaying\r\nbefore your window, and the little lamp, a gleam shining through\r\nthe window-panes in the darkness. Ah! you never knew that there,\r\nso near you, so far from you, was a poor wretch!"\r\nShe turned towards him with a sob.\r\n"Oh, you are good!" she said.\r\n"No, I love you, that is all! You do not doubt that! Tell me--one\r\nword--only one word!"\r\nAnd Rodolphe imperceptibly glided from the footstool to the\r\nground; but a sound of wooden shoes was heard in the kitchen, and\r\nhe noticed the door of the room was not closed.\r\n"How kind it would be of you," he went on, rising, "if you would\r\nhumour a whim of mine." It was to go over her house; he wanted to\r\nknow it; and Madame Bovary seeing no objection to this, they both\r\nrose, when Charles came in.\r\n"Good morning, doctor," Rodolphe said to him.\r\nThe doctor, flattered at this unexpected title, launched out into\r\nobsequious phrases. Of this the other took advantage to pull\r\nhimself together a little.\r\n"Madame was speaking to me," he then said, "about her health."\r\nCharles interrupted him; he had indeed a thousand anxieties; his\r\nwife\'s palpitations of the heart were beginning again. Then\r\nRodolphe asked if riding would not be good.\r\n"Certainly! excellent! just the thing! There\'s an idea! You ought\r\nto follow it up."\r\nAnd as she objected that she had no horse, Monsieur Rodolphe\r\noffered one. She refused his offer; he did not insist. Then to\r\nexplain his visit he said that his ploughman, the man of the\r\nblood-letting, still suffered from giddiness.\r\n"I\'ll call around," said Bovary.\r\n"No, no! I\'ll send him to you; we\'ll come; that will be more\r\nconvenient for you."\r\n"Ah! very good! I thank you."\r\nAnd as soon as they were alone, "Why don\'t you accept Monsieur\r\nBoulanger\'s kind offer?"\r\nShe assumed a sulky air, invented a thousand excuses, and finally\r\ndeclared that perhaps it would look odd.\r\n"Well, what the deuce do I care for that?" said Charles, making a\r\npirouette. "Health before everything! You are wrong."\r\n"And how do you think I can ride when I haven\'t got a habit?"\r\n"You must order one," he answered.\r\nThe riding-habit decided her.\r\nWhen the habit was ready, Charles wrote to Monsieur Boulanger\r\nthat his wife was at his command, and that they counted on his\r\ngood-nature.\r\nThe next day at noon Rodolphe appeared at Charles\'s door with two\r\nsaddle-horses. One had pink rosettes at his ears and a deerskin\r\nside-saddle.\r\nRodolphe had put on high soft boots, saying to himself that no\r\ndoubt she had never seen anything like them. In fact, Emma was\r\ncharmed with his appearance as he stood on the landing in his\r\ngreat velvet coat and white corduroy breeches. She was ready; she\r\nwas waiting for him.\r\nJustin escaped from the chemist\'s to see her start, and the\r\nchemist also came out. He was giving Monsieur Boulanger a little\r\ngood advice.\r\n"An accident happens so easily. Be careful! Your horses perhaps\r\nare mettlesome."\r\nShe heard a noise above her; it was Felicite drumming on the\r\nwindowpanes to amuse little Berthe. The child blew her a kiss;\r\nher mother answered with a wave of her whip.\r\n"A pleasant ride!" cried Monsieur Homais. "Prudence! above all,\r\nprudence!" And he flourished his newspaper as he saw them\r\ndisappear.\r\nAs soon as he felt the ground, Emma\'s horse set off at a gallop.\r\nRodolphe galloped by her side. Now and then they exchanged a\r\nword. Her figure slightly bent, her hand well up, and her right\r\narm stretched out, she gave herself up to the cadence of the\r\nmovement that rocked her in her saddle. At the bottom of the hill\r\nRodolphe gave his horse its head; they started together at a\r\nbound, then at the top suddenly the horses stopped, and her large\r\nblue veil fell about her.\r\nIt was early in October. There was fog over the land. Hazy clouds\r\nhovered on the horizon between the outlines of the hills; others,\r\nrent asunder, floated up and disappeared. Sometimes through a\r\nrift in the clouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar\r\nthe roots of Yonville, with the gardens at the water\'s edge, the\r\nyards, the walls and the church steeple. Emma half closed her\r\neyes to pick out her house, and never had this poor village where\r\nshe lived appeared so small. From the height on which they were\r\nthe whole valley seemed an immense pale lake sending off its\r\nvapour into the air. Clumps of trees here and there stood out\r\nlike black rocks, and the tall lines of the poplars that rose\r\nabove the mist were like a beach stirred by the wind.\r\nBy the side, on the turf between the pines, a brown light\r\nshimmered in the warm atmosphere. The earth, ruddy like the\r\npowder of tobacco, deadened the noise of their steps, and with\r\nthe edge of their shoes the horses as they walked kicked the\r\nfallen fir cones in front of them.\r\nRodolphe and Emma thus went along the skirt of the wood. She\r\nturned away from time to time to avoid his look, and then she saw\r\nonly the pine trunks in lines, whose monotonous succession made\r\nher a little giddy. The horses were panting; the leather of the\r\nsaddles creaked.\r\nJust as they were entering the forest the sun shone out.\r\n"God protects us!" said Rodolphe.\r\n"Do you think so?" she said.\r\n"Forward! forward!" he continued.\r\nHe "tchk\'d" with his tongue. The two beasts set off at a trot.\r\nLong ferns by the roadside caught in Emma\'s stirrup.\r\nRodolphe leant forward and removed them as they rode along. At\r\nother times, to turn aside the branches, he passed close to her,\r\nand Emma felt his knee brushing against her leg. The sky was now\r\nblue, the leaves no longer stirred. There were spaces full of\r\nheather in flower, and plots of violets alternated with the\r\nconfused patches of the trees that were grey, fawn, or golden\r\ncoloured, according to the nature of their leaves. Often in the\r\nthicket was heard the fluttering of wings, or else the hoarse,\r\nsoft cry of the ravens flying off amidst the oaks.\r\nThey dismounted. Rodolphe fastened up the horses. She walked on\r\nin front on the moss between the paths. But her long habit got in\r\nher way, although she held it up by the skirt; and Rodolphe,\r\nwalking behind her, saw between the black cloth and the black\r\nshoe the fineness of her white stocking, that seemed to him as if\r\nit were a part of her nakedness.\r\nShe stopped. "I am tired," she said.\r\n"Come, try again," he went on. "Courage!"\r\nThen some hundred paces farther on she again stopped, and through\r\nher veil, that fell sideways from her man\'s hat over her hips,\r\nher face appeared in a bluish transparency as if she were\r\nfloating under azure waves.\r\n"But where are we going?"\r\nHe did not answer. She was breathing irregularly. Rodolphe looked\r\nround him biting his moustache. They came to a larger space where\r\nthe coppice had been cut. They sat down on the trunk of a fallen\r\ntree, and Rodolphe began speaking to her of his love. He did not\r\nbegin by frightening her with compliments. He was calm, serious,\r\nmelancholy.\r\nEmma listened to him with bowed head, and stirred the bits of\r\nwood on the ground with the tip of her foot. But at the words,\r\n"Are not our destinies now one?"\r\n"Oh, no! she replied. "You know that well. It is impossible!"\r\nShe rose to go. He seized her by the wrist. She stopped. Then,\r\nhaving gazed at him for a few moments with an amorous and humid\r\nlook, she said hurriedly--\r\n"Ah! do not speak of it again! Where are the horses? Let us go\r\nback."\r\nHe made a gesture of anger and annoyance. She repeated:\r\n"Where are the horses? Where are the horses?"\r\nThen smiling a strange smile, his pupil fixed, his teeth set, he\r\nadvanced with outstretched arms. She recoiled trembling. She\r\nstammered:\r\n"Oh, you frighten me! You hurt me! Let me go!"\r\n"If it must be," he went on, his face changing; and he again\r\nbecame respectful, caressing, timid. She gave him her arm. They\r\nwent back. He said--\r\n"What was the matter with you? Why? I do not understand. You were\r\nmistaken, no doubt. In my soul you are as a Madonna on a\r\npedestal, in a place lofty, secure, immaculate. But I need you to\r\nlive! I must have your eyes, your voice, your thought! Be my\r\nfriend, my sister, my angel!"\r\nAnd he put out his arm round her waist. She feebly tried to\r\ndisengage herself. He supported her thus as they walked along.\r\nBut they heard the two horses browsing on the leaves.\r\n"Oh! one moment!" said Rodolphe. "Do not let us go! Stay!"\r\nHe drew her farther on to a small pool where duckweeds made a\r\ngreenness on the water. Faded water lilies lay motionless between\r\nthe reeds. At the noise of their steps in the grass, frogs jumped\r\naway to hide themselves.\r\n"I am wrong! I am wrong!" she said. "I am mad to listen to you!"\r\n"Why? Emma! Emma!"\r\n"Oh, Rodolphe!" said the young woman slowly, leaning on his\r\nshoulder.\r\nThe cloth of her habit caught against the velvet of his coat. She\r\nthrew back her white neck, swelling with a sigh, and faltering,\r\nin tears, with a long shudder and hiding her face, she gave\r\nherself up to him--\r\nThe shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun passing\r\nbetween the branches dazzled the eyes. Here and there around her,\r\nin the leaves or on the ground, trembled luminous patches, as it\r\nhummingbirds flying about had scattered their feathers. Silence\r\nwas everywhere; something sweet seemed to come forth from the\r\ntrees; she felt her heart, whose beating had begun again, and the\r\nblood coursing through her flesh like a stream of milk. Then far\r\naway, beyond the wood, on the other hills, she heard a vague\r\nprolonged cry, a voice which lingered, and in silence she heard\r\nit mingling like music with the last pulsations of her throbbing\r\nnerves. Rodolphe, a cigar between his lips, was mending with his\r\npenknife one of the two broken bridles.\r\nThey returned to Yonville by the same road. On the mud they saw\r\nagain the traces of their horses side by side, the same thickets,\r\nthe same stones to the grass; nothing around them seemed changed;\r\nand yet for her something had happened more stupendous than if\r\nthe mountains had moved in their places. Rodolphe now and again\r\nbent forward and took her hand to kiss it.\r\nShe was charming on horseback--upright, with her slender waist,\r\nher knee bent on the mane of her horse, her face somewhat flushed\r\nby the fresh air in the red of the evening.\r\nOn entering Yonville she made her horse prance in the road.\r\nPeople looked at her from the windows.\r\nAt dinner her husband thought she looked well, but she pretended\r\nnot to hear him when he inquired about her ride, and she remained\r\nsitting there with her elbow at the side of her plate between the\r\ntwo lighted candles.\r\n"Emma!" he said.\r\n"What?"\r\n"Well, I spent the afternoon at Monsieur Alexandre\'s. He has an\r\nold cob, still very fine, only a little brokenkneed, and that\r\ncould be bought; I am sure, for a hundred crowns." He added, "And\r\nthinking it might please you, I have bespoken it--bought it. Have\r\nI done right? Do tell me?"\r\nShe nodded her head in assent; then a quarter of an hour later--\r\n"Are you going out to-night?" she asked.\r\n"Yes. Why?"\r\n"Oh, nothing, nothing, my dear!"\r\nAnd as soon as she had got rid of Charles she went and shut\r\nherself up in her room.\r\nAt first she felt stunned; she saw the trees, the paths, the\r\nditches, Rodolphe, and she again felt the pressure of his arm,\r\nwhile the leaves rustled and the reeds whistled.\r\nBut when she saw herself in the glass she wondered at her face.\r\nNever had her eyes been so large, so black, of so profound a\r\ndepth. Something subtle about her being transfigured her. She\r\nrepeated, "I have a lover! a lover!" delighting at the idea as if\r\na second puberty had come to her. So at last she was to know\r\nthose joys of love, that fever of happiness of which she had\r\ndespairedl She was entering upon marvels where all would be\r\npassion, ecstasy, delirium. An azure infinity encompassed her,\r\nthe heights of sentiment sparkled under her thought, and ordinary\r\nexistence appeared only afar off, down below in the shade,\r\nthrough the interspaces of these heights.\r\nThen she recalled the heroines of the books that she had read,\r\nand the lyric legion of these adulterous women began to sing in\r\nher memory with the voice of sisters that charmed her. She became\r\nherself, as it were, an actual part of these imaginings, and\r\nrealised the love-dream of her youth as she saw herself in this\r\ntype of amorous women whom she had so envied. Besides, Emma felt\r\na satisfaction of revenge. Had she not suffered enough? But now\r\nshe triumphed, and the love so long pent up burst forth in full\r\njoyous bubblings. She tasted it without remorse, without anxiety,\r\nwithout trouble.\r\nThe day following passed with a new sweetness. They made vows to\r\none another She told him of her sorrows. Rodolphe interrupted her\r\nwith kisses; and she looking at him through half-closed eyes,\r\nasked him to call her again by her name--to say that he loved her\r\nThey were in the forest, as yesterday, in the shed of some\r\nwoodenshoe maker. The walls were of straw, and the roof so low\r\nthey had to stoop. They were seated side by side on a bed of dry\r\nleaves.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'From that day forth they wrote to one another regularly every\r\nevening. Emma placed her letter at the end of the garden, by the\r\nriver, in a fissure of the wall. Rodolphe came to fetch it, and\r\nput another there, that she always found fault with as too\r\nshort.\r\nOne morning, when Charles had gone out before day break, she was\r\nseized with the fancy to see Rodolphe at once. She would go\r\nquickly to La Huchette, stay there an hour, and be back again at\r\nYonville while everyone was still asleep. This idea made her pant\r\nwith desire, and she soon found herself in the middle of the\r\nfield, walking with rapid steps, without looking behind her.\r\nDay was just breaking. Emma from afar recognised her lover\'s\r\nhouse. Its two dove-tailed weathercocks stood out black against\r\nthe pale dawn.\r\nBeyond the farmyard there was a detached building that she\r\nthought must be the chateau She entered--it was if the doors at\r\nher approach had opened wide of their own accord. A large\r\nstraight staircase led up to the corridor. Emma raised the latch\r\nof a door, and suddenly at the end of the room she saw a man\r\nsleeping. It was Rodolphe. She uttered a cry.\r\n"You here? You here?" he repeated. "How did you manage to come?\r\nAh! your dress is damp."\r\n"I love you," she answered, throwing her arms about his neck.\r\nThis first piece of daring successful, now every time Charles\r\nwent out early Emma dressed quickly and slipped on tiptoe down\r\nthe steps that led to the waterside.\r\nBut when the plank for the cows was taken up, she had to go by\r\nthe walls alongside of the river; the bank was slippery; in order\r\nnot to fall she caught hold of the tufts of faded wallflowers.\r\nThen she went across ploughed fields, in which she sank,\r\nstumbling; and clogging her thin shoes. Her scarf, knotted round\r\nher head, fluttered to the wind in the meadows. She was afraid of\r\nthe oxen; she began to run; she arrived out of breath, with rosy\r\ncheeks, and breathing out from her whole person a fresh perfume\r\nof sap, of verdure, of the open air. At this hour Rodolphe still\r\nslept. It was like a spring morning coming into his room.\r\nThe yellow curtains along the windows let a heavy, whitish light\r\nenter softly. Emma felt about, opening and closing her eyes,\r\nwhile the drops of dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were,\r\na topaz aureole around her face. Rodolphe, laughing, drew her to\r\nhim, and pressed her to his breast.\r\nThen she examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the\r\ntables, combed her hair with his comb, and looked at herself in\r\nhis shaving-glass. Often she even put between her teeth the big\r\npipe that lay on the table by the bed, amongst lemons and pieces\r\nof sugar near a bottle of water.\r\nIt took them a good quarter of an hour to say goodbye. Then Emma\r\ncried. She would have wished never to leave Rodolphe. Something\r\nstronger than herself forced her to him; so much so, that one\r\nday, seeing her come unexpectedly, he frowned as one put out.\r\n"What is the matter with you?" she said. "Are you ill? Tell me!"\r\nAt last he declared with a serious air that her visits were\r\nbecoming imprudent--that she was compromising herself.'}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Ten\r\nGradually Rodolphe\'s fears took possession of her. At first, love\r\nhad intoxicated her; and she had thought of nothing beyond. But\r\nnow that he was indispensable to her life, she feared to lose\r\nanything of this, or even that it should be disturbed. When she\r\ncame back from his house she looked all about her, anxiously\r\nwatching every form that passed in the horizon, and every village\r\nwindow from which she could be seen. She listened for steps,\r\ncries, the noise of the ploughs, and she stopped short, white,\r\nand trembling more than the aspen leaves swaying overhead.\r\nOne morning as she was thus returning, she suddenly thought she\r\nsaw the long barrel of a carbine that seemed to be aimed at her.\r\nIt stuck out sideways from the end of a small tub half-buried in\r\nthe grass on the edge of a ditch. Emma, half-fainting with\r\nterror, nevertheless walked on, and a man stepped out of the tub\r\nlike a Jack-in-the-box. He had gaiters buckled up to the knees,\r\nhis cap pulled down over his eyes, trembling lips, and a red\r\nnose. It was Captain Binet lying in ambush for wild ducks.\r\n"You ought to have called out long ago!" he exclaimed; "When one\r\nsees a gun, one should always give warning."\r\nThe tax-collector was thus trying to hide the fright he had had,\r\nfor a prefectorial order having prohibited duckhunting except in\r\nboats, Monsieur Binet, despite his respect for the laws, was\r\ninfringing them, and so he every moment expected to see the rural\r\nguard turn up. But this anxiety whetted his pleasure, and, all\r\nalone in his tub, he congratulated himself on his luck and on his\r\ncuteness. At sight of Emma he seemed relieved from a great\r\nweight, and at once entered upon a conversation.\r\n"It isn\'t warm; it\'s nipping."\r\nEmma answered nothing. He went on--\r\n"And you\'re out so early?"\r\n"Yes," she said stammering; "I am just coming from the nurse\r\nwhere my child is."\r\n"Ah! very good! very good! For myself, I am here, just as you\r\nsee me, since break of day; but the weather is so muggy, that\r\nunless one had the bird at the mouth of the gun--"\r\n"Good evening, Monsieur Binet," she interrupted him, turning on\r\nher heel.\r\n"Your servant, madame," he replied drily; and he went back into\r\nhis tub.\r\nEmma regretted having left the tax-collector so abruptly. No\r\ndoubt he would form unfavourable conjectures. The story about the\r\nnurse was the worst possible excuse, everyone at Yonville knowing\r\nthat the little Bovary had been at home with her parents for a\r\nyear. Besides, no one was living in this direction; this path led\r\nonly to La Huchette. Binet, then, would guess whence she came,\r\nand he would not keep silence; he would talk, that was certain.\r\nShe remained until evening racking her brain with every\r\nconceivable lying project, and had constantly before her eyes\r\nthat imbecile with the game-bag.\r\nCharles after dinner, seeing her gloomy, proposed, by way of\r\ndistraction, to take her to the chemist\'s, and the first person\r\nshe caught sight of in the shop was the taxcollector again. He\r\nwas standing in front of the counter, lit up by the gleams of the\r\nred bottle, and was saying--\r\n"Please give me half an ounce of vitriol."\r\n"Justin," cried the druggist, "bring us the sulphuric acid." Then\r\nto Emma, who was going up to Madame Homais\' room, "No, stay here;\r\nit isn\'t worth while going up; she is just coming down. Warm\r\nyourself at the stove in the meantime. Excuse me. Good-day,\r\ndoctor," (for the chemist much enjoyed pronouncing the word\r\n"doctor," as if addressing another by it reflected on himself\r\nsome of the grandeur that he found in it). "Now, take care not to\r\nupset the mortars! You\'d better fetch some chairs from the little\r\nroom; you know very well that the arm-chairs are not to be taken\r\nout of the drawing-room."\r\nAnd to put his arm-chair back in its place he was darting away\r\nfrom the counter, when Binet asked him for half an ounce of sugar\r\nacid.\r\n"Sugar acid!" said the chemist contemptuously, "don\'t know it;\r\nI\'m ignorant of it! But perhaps you want oxalic acid. It is\r\noxalic acid, isn\'t it?"\r\nBinet explained that he wanted a corrosive to make himself some\r\ncopperwater with which to remove rust from his hunting things.\r\nEmma shuddered. The chemist began saying--\r\n"Indeed the weather is not propitious on account of the damp."\r\n"Nevertheless," replied the tax-collector, with a sly look,\r\n"there are people who like it."\r\nShe was stifling.\r\n"And give me--"\r\n"Will he never go?" thought she.\r\n"Half an ounce of resin and turpentine, four ounces of yellow\r\nwax, and three half ounces of animal charcoal, if you please, to\r\nclean the varnished leather of my togs."\r\nThe druggist was beginning to cut the wax when Madame Homais\r\nappeared, Irma in her arms, Napoleon by her side, and Athalie\r\nfollowing. She sat down on the velvet seat by the window, and the\r\nlad squatted down on a footstool, while his eldest sister hovered\r\nround the jujube box near her papa. The latter was filling\r\nfunnels and corking phials, sticking on labels, making up\r\nparcels. Around him all were silent; only from time to time, were\r\nheard the weights jingling in the balance, and a few low words\r\nfrom the chemist giving directions to his pupil.\r\n"And how\'s the little woman?" suddenly asked Madame Homais.\r\n"Silence!" exclaimed her husband, who was writing down some\r\nfigures in his waste-book.\r\n"Why didn\'t you bring her?" she went on in a low voice.\r\n"Hush! hush!" said Emma, pointing with her finger to the\r\ndruggist.\r\nBut Binet, quite absorbed in looking over his bill, had probably\r\nheard nothing. At last he went out. Then Emma, relieved, uttered\r\na deep sigh.\r\n"How hard you are breathing!" said Madame Homais.\r\n"Well, you see, it\'s rather warm," she replied.\r\nSo the next day they talked over how to arrange their rendezvous.\r\nEmma wanted to bribe her servant with a present, but it would be\r\nbetter to find some safe house at Yonville. Rodolphe promised to\r\nlook for one.\r\nAll through the winter, three or four times a week, in the dead\r\nof night he came to the garden. Emma had on purpose taken away\r\nthe key of the gate, which Charles thought lost.\r\nTo call her, Rodolphe threw a sprinkle of sand at the shutters.\r\nShe jumped up with a start; but sometimes he had to wait, for\r\nCharles had a mania for chatting by the fireside, and he would\r\nnot stop. She was wild with impatience; if her eyes could have\r\ndone it, she would have hurled him out at the window. At last she\r\nwould begin to undress, then take up a book, and go on reading\r\nvery quietly as if the book amused her. But Charles, who was in\r\nbed, called to her to come too.\r\n"Come, now, Emma," he said, "it is time."\r\n"Yes, I am coming," she answered.\r\nThen, as the candles dazzled him; he turned to the wall and fell\r\nasleep. She escaped, smiling, palpitating, undressed. Rodolphe\r\nhad a large cloak; he wrapped her in it, and putting his arm\r\nround her waist, he drew her without a word to the end of the\r\ngarden.\r\nIt was in the arbour, on the same seat of old sticks where\r\nformerly Leon had looked at her so amorously on the summer\r\nevenings. She never thought of him now.\r\nThe stars shone through the leafless jasmine branches. Behind\r\nthem they heard the river flowing, and now and again on the bank\r\nthe rustling of the dry reeds. Masses of shadow here and there\r\nloomed out in the darkness, and sometimes, vibrating with one\r\nmovement, they rose up and swayed like immense black waves\r\npressing forward to engulf them. The cold of the nights made them\r\nclasp closer; the sighs of their lips seemed to them deeper;\r\ntheir eyes that they could hardly see, larger; and in the midst\r\nof the silence low words were spoken that fell on their souls\r\nsonorous, crystalline, and that reverberated in multiplied\r\nvibrations.\r\nWhen the night was rainy, they took refuge in the consulting-room\r\nbetween the cart-shed and the stable. She lighted one of the\r\nkitchen candles that she had hidden behind the books. Rodolphe\r\nsettled down there as if at home. The sight of the library, of\r\nthe bureau, of the whole apartment, in fine, excited his\r\nmerriment, and he could not refrain from making jokes about\r\nCharles, which rather embarrassed Emma. She would have liked to\r\nsee him more serious, and even on occasions more dramatic; as,\r\nfor example, when she thought she heard a noise of approaching\r\nsteps in the alley.\r\n"Someone is coming!" she said.\r\nHe blew out the light.\r\n"Have you your pistols?"\r\n"Why?"\r\n"Why, to defend yourself," replied Emma.\r\n"From your husband? Oh, poor devil!" And Rodolphe finished his\r\nsentence with a gesture that said, "I could crush him with a\r\nflip of my finger."\r\nShe was wonder-stricken at his bravery, although she felt in it a\r\nsort of indecency and a naive coarseness that scandalised her.\r\nRodolphe reflected a good deal on the affair of the pistols. If\r\nshe had spoken seriously, it was very ridiculous, he thought,\r\neven odious; for he had no reason to hate the good Charles, not\r\nbeing what is called devoured by jealousy; and on this subject\r\nEmma had taken a great vow that he did not think in the best of\r\ntaste.\r\nBesides, she was growing very sentimental. She had insisted on\r\nexchanging miniatures; they had cut off handfuls of hair, and now\r\nshe was asking for a ring--a real wedding-ring, in sign of an\r\neternal union. She often spoke to him of the evening chimes, of\r\nthe voices of nature. Then she talked to him of her mother--hers!\r\nand of his mother--his! Rodolphe had lost his twenty years ago.\r\nEmma none the less consoled him with caressing words as one would\r\nhave done a lost child, and she sometimes even said to him,\r\ngazing at the moon\r\n"I am sure that above there together they approve of our love."\r\nBut she was so pretty. He had possessed so few women of such\r\ningenuousness. This love without debauchery was a new experience\r\nfor him, and, drawing him out of his lazy habits, caressed at\r\nonce his pride and his sensuality. Emma\'s enthusiasm, which his\r\nbourgeois good sense disdained, seemed to him in his heart of\r\nhearts charming, since it was lavished on him. Then, sure of\r\nbeing loved, he no longer kept up appearances, and insensibly his\r\nways changed.\r\nHe had no longer, as formerly, words so gentle that they made her\r\ncry, nor passionate caresses that made her mad, so that their\r\ngreat love, which engrossed her life, seemed to lessen beneath\r\nher like the water of a stream absorbed into its channel, and she\r\ncould see the bed of it. She would not believe it; she redoubled\r\nin tenderness, and Rodolphe concealed his indifference less and\r\nless.\r\nShe did not know if she regretted having yielded to him, or\r\nwhether she did not wish, on the contrary, to enjoy him the more.\r\nThe humiliation of feeling herself weak was turning to rancour,\r\ntempered by their voluptuous pleasures. It was not affection; it\r\nwas like a continual seduction. He subjugated her; she almost\r\nfeared him.\r\nAppearances, nevertheless, were calmer than ever, Rodolphe having\r\nsucceeded in carrying out the adultery after his own fancy; and\r\nat the end of six months, when the spring-time came, they were to\r\none another like a married couple, tranquilly keeping up a\r\ndomestic flame.\r\nIt was the time of year when old Rouault sent his turkey in\r\nremembrance of the setting of his leg. The present always arrived\r\nwith a letter. Emma cut the string that tied it to the basket,\r\nand read the following lines:--\r\n"My Dear Children--I hope this will find you well, and that this\r\none will be as good as the others. For it seems to me a little\r\nmore tender, if I may venture to say so, and heavier. But next\r\ntime, for a change, I\'ll give you a turkeycock, unless you have a\r\npreference for some dabs; and send me back the hamper, if you\r\nplease, with the two old ones. I have had an accident with my\r\ncart-sheds, whose covering flew off one windy night among the\r\ntrees. The harvest has not been overgood either. Finally, I don\'t\r\nknow when I shall come to see you. It is so difficult now to\r\nleave the house since I am alone, my poor Emma."\r\nHere there was a break in the lines, as if the old fellow had\r\ndropped his pen to dream a little while.\r\n"For myself, I am very well, except for a cold I caught the other\r\nday at the fair at Yvetot, where I had gone to hire a shepherd,\r\nhaving turned away mine because he was too dainty. How we are to\r\nbe pitied with such a lot of thieves! Besides, he was also rude.\r\nI heard from a pedlar, who, travelling through your part of the\r\ncountry this winter, had a tooth drawn, that Bovary was as usual\r\nworking hard. That doesn\'t surprise me; and he showed me his\r\ntooth; we had some coffee together. I asked him if he had seen\r\nyou, and he said not, but that he had seen two horses in the\r\nstables, from which I conclude that business is looking up. So\r\nmuch the better, my dear children, and may God send you every\r\nimaginable happiness! It grieves me not yet to have seen my dear\r\nlittle grand-daughter, Berthe Bovary. I have planted an Orleans\r\nplum-tree for her in the garden under your room, and I won\'t have\r\nit touched unless it is to have jam made for her by and bye, that\r\nI will keep in the cupboard for her when she comes.\r\n"Good-bye, my dear children. I kiss you, my girl, you too, my\r\nson-in-law, and the little one on both cheeks. I am, with best\r\ncompliments, your loving father.\r\n"Theodore Rouault."\r\nShe held the coarse paper in her fingers for some minutes. The\r\nspelling mistakes were interwoven one with the other, and Emma\r\nfollowed the kindly thought that cackled right through it like a\r\nhen half hidden in the hedge of thorns. The writing had been\r\ndried with ashes from the hearth, for a little grey powder\r\nslipped from the letter on to her dress, and she almost thought\r\nshe saw her father bending over the hearth to take up the tongs.\r\nHow long since she had been with him, sitting on the footstool in\r\nthe chimney-corner, where she used to burn the end of a bit of\r\nwood in the great flame of the sea-sedges! She remembered the\r\nsummer evenings all full of sunshine. The colts neighed when\r\nanyone passed by, and galloped, galloped. Under her window there\r\nwas a beehive, and sometimes the bees wheeling round in the light\r\nstruck against her window like rebounding balls of gold. What\r\nhappiness there had been at that time, what freedom, what hope!\r\nWhat an abundance of illusions! Nothing was left of them now. She\r\nhad got rid of them all in her soul\'s life, in all her successive\r\nconditions of lifemaidenhood, her marriage, and her love--thus\r\nconstantly losing them all her life through, like a traveller who\r\nleaves something of his wealth at every inn along his road.\r\nBut what then, made her so unhappy? What was the extraordinary\r\ncatastrophe that had transformed her? And she raised her head,\r\nlooking round as if to seek the cause of that which made her\r\nsuffer.\r\nAn April ray was dancing on the china of the whatnot; the fire\r\nburned; beneath her slippers she felt the softness of the carpet;\r\nthe day was bright, the air warm, and she heard her child\r\nshouting with laughter.\r\nIn fact, the little girl was just then rolling on the lawn in the\r\nmidst of the grass that was being turned. She was lying flat on\r\nher stomach at the top of a rick. The servant was holding her by\r\nher skirt. Lestiboudois was raking by her side, and every time he\r\ncame near she lent forward, beating the air with both her arms.\r\n"Bring her to me," said her mother, rushing to embrace her. "How\r\nI love you, my poor child! How I love you!"\r\nThen noticing that the tips of her ears were rather dirty, she\r\nrang at once for warm water, and washed her, changed her linen,\r\nher stockings, her shoes, asked a thousand questions about her\r\nhealth, as if on the return from a long journey, and finally,\r\nkissing her again and crying a little, she gave her back to the\r\nservant, who stood quite thunderstricken at this excess of\r\ntenderness.\r\nThat evening Rodolphe found her more serious than usual.\r\n"That will pass over," he concluded; "it\'s a whim:"\r\nAnd he missed three rendezvous running. When he did come, she\r\nshowed herself cold and almost contemptuous.\r\n"Ah! you\'re losing your time, my lady!"\r\nAnd he pretended not to notice her melancholy sighs, nor the\r\nhandkerchief she took out.\r\nThen Emma repented. She even asked herself why she detested\r\nCharles; if it had not been better to have been able to love him?\r\nBut he gave her no opportunities for such a revival of sentiment,\r\nso that she was much embarrassed by her desire for sacrifice,\r\nwhen the druggist came just in time to provide her with an\r\nopportunity.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Eleven\r\nHe had recently read a eulogy on a new method for curing\r\nclub-foot, and as he was a partisan of progress, he conceived the\r\npatriotic idea that Yonville, in order to keep to the fore, ought\r\nto have some operations for strephopody or club-foot.\r\n"For," said he to Emma, "what risk is there? See--" (and he\r\nenumerated on his fingers the advantages of the attempt),\r\n"success, almost certain relief and beautifying of the patient,\r\ncelebrity acquired by the operator. Why, for example, should not\r\nyour husband relieve poor Hippolyte of the \'Lion d\'Or\'? Note that\r\nhe would not fail to tell about his cure to all the travellers,\r\nand then" (Homais lowered his voice and looked round him) "who is\r\nto prevent me from sending a short paragraph on the subject to\r\nthe paper? Eh! goodness me! an article gets about; it is talked\r\nof; it ends by making a snowball! And who knows? who knows?"\r\nIn fact, Bovary might succeed. Nothing proved to Emma that he was\r\nnot clever; and what a satisfaction for her to have urged him to\r\na step by which his reputation and fortune would be increased!\r\nShe only wished to lean on something more solid than love.\r\nCharles, urged by the druggist and by her, allowed himself to be\r\npersuaded. He sent to Rouen for Dr. Duval\'s volume, and every\r\nevening, holding his head between both hands, plunged into the\r\nreading of it.\r\nWhile he was studying equinus, varus, and valgus, that is to say,\r\nkatastrephopody, endostrephopody, and exostrephopody (or better,\r\nthe various turnings of the foot downwards, inwards, and\r\noutwards, with the hypostrephopody and anastrephopody), otherwise\r\ntorsion downwards and upwards, Monsier Homais, with all sorts of\r\narguments, was exhorting the lad at the inn to submit to the\r\noperation.\r\n"You will scarcely feel, probably, a slight pain; it is a simple\r\nprick, like a little blood-letting, less than the extraction of\r\ncertain corns."\r\nHippolyte, reflecting, rolled his stupid eyes.\r\n"However," continued the chemist, "it doesn\'t concern me. It\'s\r\nfor your sake, for pure humanity! I should like to see you, my\r\nfriend, rid of your hideous caudication, together with that\r\nwaddling of the lumbar regions which, whatever you say, must\r\nconsiderably interfere with you in the exercise of your calling."\r\nThen Homais represented to him how much jollier and brisker he\r\nwould feel afterwards, and even gave him to understand that he\r\nwould be more likely to please the women; and the stable-boy\r\nbegan to smile heavily. Then he attacked him through his vanity:\r\n"Aren\'t you a man? Hang it! what would you have done if you had\r\nhad to go into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard?\r\nAh! Hippolyte!"\r\nAnd Homais retired, declaring that he could not understand this\r\nobstinacy, this blindness in refusing the benefactions of\r\nscience.\r\nThe poor fellow gave way, for it was like a conspiracy. Binet,\r\nwho never interfered with other people\'s business, Madame\r\nLefrancois, Artemise, the neighbours, even the mayor, Monsieur\r\nTuvache--everyone persuaded him, lectured him, shamed him; but\r\nwhat finally decided him was that it would cost him nothing.\r\nBovary even undertook to provide the machine for the operation.\r\nThis generosity was an idea of Emma\'s, and Charles consented to\r\nit, thinking in his heart of hearts that his wife was an angel.\r\nSo by the advice of the chemist, and after three fresh starts, he\r\nhad a kind of box made by the carpenter, with the aid of the\r\nlocksmith, that weighed about eight pounds, and in which iron,\r\nwood, sheer-iron, leather, screws, and nuts had not been spared.\r\nBut to know which of Hippolyte\'s tendons to cut, it was necessary\r\nfirst of all to find out what kind of club-foot he had.\r\nHe had a foot forming almost a straight line with the leg, which,\r\nhowever, did not prevent it from being turned in, so that it was\r\nan equinus together with something of a varus, or else a slight\r\nvarus with a strong tendency to equinus. But with this equinus,\r\nwide in foot like a horse\'s hoof, with rugose skin, dry tendons,\r\nand large toes, on which the black nails looked as if made of\r\niron, the clubfoot ran about like a deer from morn till night. He\r\nwas constantly to be seen on the Place, jumping round the carts,\r\nthrusting his limping foot forwards. He seemed even stronger on\r\nthat leg than the other. By dint of hard service it had acquired,\r\nas it were, moral qualities of patience and energy; and when he\r\nwas given some heavy work, he stood on it in preference to its\r\nfellow.\r\nNow, as it was an equinus, it was necessary to cut the tendon of\r\nAchilles, and, if need were, the anterior tibial muscle could be\r\nseen to afterwards for getting rid of the varus; for the doctor\r\ndid not dare to risk both operations at once; he was even\r\ntrembling already for fear of injuring some important region that\r\nhe did not know.\r\nNeither Ambrose Pare, applying for the first time since Celsus,\r\nafter an interval of fifteen centuries, a ligature to an artery,\r\nnor Dupuytren, about to open an abscess in the brain, nor Gensoul\r\nwhen he first took away the superior maxilla, had hearts that\r\ntrembled, hands that shook, minds so strained as Monsieur Bovary\r\nwhen he approached Hippolyte, his tenotome between his fingers.\r\nAnd as at hospitals, near by on a table lay a heap of lint, with\r\nwaxed thread, many bandages--a pyramid of bandages--every bandage\r\nto be found at the druggist\'s. It was Monsieur Homais who since\r\nmorning had been organising all these preparations, as much to\r\ndazzle the multitude as to keep up his illusions. Charles pierced\r\nthe skin; a dry crackling was heard. The tendon was cut, the\r\noperation over. Hippolyte could not get over his surprise, but\r\nbent over Bovary\'s hands to cover them with kisses.\r\n"Come, be calm," said the druggist; "later on you will show your\r\ngratitude to your benefactor."\r\nAnd he went down to tell the result to five or six inquirers who\r\nwere waiting in the yard, and who fancied that Hippolyte would\r\nreappear walking properly. Then Charles, having buckled his\r\npatient into the machine, went home, where Emma, all anxiety,\r\nawaited him at the door. She threw herself on his neck; they sat\r\ndown to table; he ate much, and at dessert he even wanted to take\r\na cup of coffee, a luxury he only permitted himself on Sundays\r\nwhen there was company.\r\nThe evening was charming, full of prattle, of dreams together.\r\nThey talked about their future fortune, of the improvements to be\r\nmade in their house; he saw people\'s estimation of him growing,\r\nhis comforts increasing, his wife always loving him; and she was\r\nhappy to refresh herself with a new sentiment, healthier, better,\r\nto feel at last some tenderness for this poor fellow who adored\r\nher. The thought of Rodolphe for one moment passed through her\r\nmind, but her eyes turned again to Charles; she even noticed with\r\nsurprise that he had not bad teeth.\r\nThey were in bed when Monsieur Homais, in spite of the servant,\r\nsuddenly entered the room, holding in his hand a sheet of paper\r\njust written. It was the paragraph he intended for the "Fanal de\r\nRouen." He brought it for them to read.\r\n"Read it yourself," said Bovary.\r\nHe read--\r\n" \'Despite the prejudices that still invest a part of the face of\r\nEurope like a net, the light nevertheless begins to penetrate our\r\ncountry places. Thus on Tuesday our little town of Yonville found\r\nitself the scene of a surgical operation which is at the same\r\ntime an, act of loftiest philanthropy. Monsieur Bovary, one of\r\nour, most distinguished practitioners--\'"\r\n"Oh, that is too much! too much!" said Charles, choking with\r\nemotion.\r\n"No, no! not at all! What next!"\r\n" \'--Performed an operation on a club-footed man.\' I have not\r\nused the scientific term, because you know in a newspaper\r\neveryone would not perhaps understand. The masses must--\'"\r\n"No doubt," said Bovary; "go on!"\r\n"I proceed," said the chemist. "\'Monsieur Bovary, one of our most\r\ndistinguished practitioners, performed an operation on a\r\nclub-footed man called Hippolyte Tautain, stableman for the last\r\ntwenty-five years at the hotel of the "Lion d\'Or," kept by Widow\r\nLefrancois, at the Place d\'Armes. The novelty of the attempt, and\r\nthe interest incident to the subject, had attracted such a\r\nconcourse of persons that there was a veritable obstruction on\r\nthe threshold of the establishment. The operation, moreover, was\r\nperformed as if by magic, and barely a few drops of blood\r\nappeared on the skin, as though to say that the rebellious tendon\r\nhad at last given way beneath the efforts of art. The patient,\r\nstrangely enough--we affirm it as an eye-witness--complained of\r\nno pain. His condition up to the present time leaves nothing to\r\nbe desired. Everything tends to show that his convelescence will\r\nbe brief; and who knows even if at our next village festivity we\r\nshall not see our good Hippolyte figuring in the bacchic dance in\r\nthe midst of a chorus of joyous boon-companions, and thus proving\r\nto all eyes by his verve and his capers his complete cure?\r\nHonour, then, to the generous savants! Honour to those\r\nindefatigable spirits who consecrate their vigils to the\r\namelioration or to the alleviation of their kind! Honour, thrice\r\nhonour! Is it not time to cry that the blind shall see, the deaf\r\nhear, the lame walk? But that which fanaticism formerly promised\r\nto its elect, science now accomplishes for all men. We shall keep\r\nour readers informed as to the successive phases of this\r\nremarkable cure.\' "\r\nThis did not prevent Mere Lefrancois, from coming five days\r\nafter, scared, and crying out--\r\n"Help! he is dying! I am going crazy!"\r\nCharles rushed to the "Lion d\'Or," and the chemist, who caught\r\nsight of him passing along the Place hatless, abandoned his shop.\r\nHe appeared himself breathless, red, anxious, and asking everyone\r\nwho was going up the stairs--\r\n"Why, what\'s the matter with our interesting strephopode?"\r\nThe strephopode was writhing in hideous convulsions, so that the\r\nmachine in which his leg was enclosed was knocked against the\r\nwall enough to break it.\r\nWith many precautions, in order not to disturb the position of\r\nthe limb, the box was removed, and an awful sight presented\r\nitself. The outlines of the foot disappeared in such a swelling\r\nthat the entire skin seemed about to burst, and it was covered\r\nwith ecchymosis, caused by the famous machine. Hippolyte had\r\nalready complained of suffering from it. No attention had been\r\npaid to him; they had to acknowledge that he had not been\r\naltogether wrong, and he was freed for a few hours. But, hardly\r\nhad the oedema gone down to some extent, than the two savants\r\nthought fit to put back the limb in the apparatus, strapping it\r\ntighter to hasten matters. At last, three days after, Hippolyte\r\nbeing unable to endure it any longer, they once more removed\r\nthe machine, and were much surprised at the result they saw. The\r\nlivid tumefaction spread over the leg, with blisters here and\r\nthere, whence there oozed a black liquid. Matters were taking a\r\nserious turn. Hippolyte began to worry himself, and Mere\r\nLefrancois, had him installed in the little room near the\r\nkitchen, so that he might at least have some distraction.\r\nBut the tax-collector, who dined there every day, complained\r\nbitterly of such companionship. Then Hippolyte was removed to the\r\nbilliard-room. He lay there moaning under his heavy coverings,\r\npale with long beard, sunken eyes, and from time to time turning\r\nhis perspiring head on the dirty pillow, where the flies\r\nalighted. Madame Bovary went to see him. She brought him linen\r\nfor his poultices; she comforted, and encouraged him. Besides, he\r\ndid not want for company, especially on market-days, when the\r\npeasants were knocking about the billiard-balls round him, fenced\r\nwith the cues, smoked, drank, sang, and brawled.\r\n"How are you?" they said, clapping him on the shoulder. "Ah!\r\nyou\'re not up to much, it seems, but it\'s your own fault. You\r\nshould do this! do that!" And then they told him stories of\r\npeople who had all been cured by other remedies than his. Then by\r\nway of consolation they added--\r\n"You give way too much! Get up! You coddle yourself like a king!\r\nAll the same, old chap, you don\'t smell nice!"\r\nGangrene, in fact, was spreading more and more. Bovary himself\r\nturned sick at it. He came every hour, every moment. Hippolyte\r\nlooked at him with eyes full of terror, sobbing--\r\n"When shall I get well? Oh, save me! How unfortunate I am! How\r\nunfortunate I am!"\r\nAnd the doctor left, always recommending him to diet himself.\r\n"Don\'t listen to him, my lad," said Mere Lefrancois, "Haven\'t\r\nthey tortured you enough already? You\'ll grow still weaker. Here!\r\nswallow this."\r\nAnd she gave him some good beef-tea, a slice of mutton, a piece\r\nof bacon, and sometimes small glasses of brandy, that he had not\r\nthe strength to put to his lips.\r\nAbbe Bournisien, hearing that he was growing worse, asked to see\r\nhim. He began by pitying his sufferings, declaring at the same\r\ntime that he ought to rejoice at them since it was the will of\r\nthe Lord, and take advantage of the occasion to reconcile himself\r\nto Heaven.\r\n"For," said the ecclesiastic in a paternal tone, "you rather\r\nneglected your duties; you were rarely seen at divine worship.\r\nHow many years is it since you approached the holy table? I\r\nunderstand that your work, that the whirl of the world may have\r\nkept you from care for your salvation. But now is the time to\r\nreflect. Yet don\'t despair. I have known great sinners, who,\r\nabout to appear before God (you are not yet at this point I\r\nknow), had implored His mercy, and who certainly died in the best\r\nframe of mind. Let us hope that, like them, you will set us a\r\ngood example. Thus, as a precaution, what is to prevent you from\r\nsaying morning and evening a \'Hail Mary, full of grace,\' and \'Our\r\nFather which art in heaven\'? Yes, do that, for my sake, to oblige\r\nme. That won\'t cost you anything. Will you promise me?"\r\nThe poor devil promised. The cure came back day after day. He\r\nchatted with the landlady; and even told anecdotes interspersed\r\nwith jokes and puns that Hippolyte did not understand. Then, as\r\nsoon as he could, he fell back upon matters of religion, putting\r\non an appropriate expression of face.\r\nHis zeal seemed successful, for the club-foot soon manifested a\r\ndesire to go on a pilgrimage to Bon-Secours if he were cured; to\r\nwhich Monsieur Bournisien replied that he saw no objection; two\r\nprecautions were better than one; it was no risk anyhow.\r\nThe druggist was indignant at what he called the manoeuvres of\r\nthe priest; they were prejudicial, he said, to Hippolyte\'s\r\nconvalescence, and he kept repeating to Madame Lefrancois, "Leave\r\nhim alone! leave him alone! You perturb his morals with your\r\nmysticism." But the good woman would no longer listen to him; he\r\nwas the cause of it all. From a spirit of contradiction she hung\r\nup near the bedside of the patient a basin filled with holy-water\r\nand a branch of box.\r\nReligion, however, seemed no more able to succour him than\r\nsurgery, and the invincible gangrene still spread from the\r\nextremities towards the stomach. It was all very well to vary the\r\npotions and change the poultices; the muscles each day rotted\r\nmore and more; and at last Charles replied by an affirmative nod\r\nof the head when Mere Lefrancois, asked him if she could not, as\r\na forlorn hope, send for Monsieur Canivet of Neufchatel, who was\r\na celebrity.\r\nA doctor of medicine, fifty years of age, enjoying a good\r\nposition and self-possessed, Charles\'s colleague did not refrain\r\nfrom laughing disdainfully when he had uncovered the leg,\r\nmortified to the knee. Then having flatly declared that it must\r\nbe amputated, he went off to the chemist\'s to rail at the asses\r\nwho could have reduced a poor man to such a state. Shaking\r\nMonsieur Homais by the button of his coat, he shouted out in the\r\nshop--\r\n"These are the inventions of Paris! These are the ideas of those\r\ngentry of the capital! It is like strabismus, chloroform,\r\nlithotrity, a heap of monstrosities that the Government ought to\r\nprohibit. But they want to do the clever, and they cram you with\r\nremedies without, troubling about the consequences. We are not so\r\nclever, not we! We are not savants, coxcombs, fops! We are\r\npractitioners; we cure people, and we should not dream of\r\noperating on anyone who is in perfect health. Straighten club-\r\nfeet! As if one could straighten club-feet! It is as if one\r\nwished, for example, to make a hunchback straight!"\r\nHomais suffered as he listened to this discourse, and he\r\nconcealed his discomfort beneath a courtier\'s smile; for he\r\nneeded to humour Monsier Canivet, whose prescriptions sometimes\r\ncame as far as Yonville. So he did not take up the defence of\r\nBovary; he did not even make a single remark, and, renouncing his\r\nprinciples, he sacrificed his dignity to the more serious\r\ninterests of his business.\r\nThis amputation of the thigh by Doctor Canivet was a great event\r\nin the village. On that day all the inhabitants got up earlier,\r\nand the Grande Rue, although full of people, had something\r\nlugubrious about it, as if an execution had been expected. At the\r\ngrocer\'s they discussed Hippolyte\'s illness; the shops did no\r\nbusiness, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor\'s wife, did not stir from\r\nher window, such was her impatience to see the operator arrive.\r\nHe came in his gig, which he drove himself. But the springs of\r\nthe right side having at length given way beneath the weight of\r\nhis corpulence, it happened that the carriage as it rolled along\r\nleaned over a little, and on the other cushion near him could be\r\nseen a large box covered in red sheep-leather, whose three brass\r\nclasps shone grandly.\r\nAfter he had entered like a whirlwind the porch of the "Lion\r\nd\'Or," the doctor, shouting very loud, ordered them to unharness\r\nhis horse. Then he went into the stable to see that he was eating\r\nhis oats all right; for on arriving at a patient\'s he first of\r\nall looked after his mare and his gig. People even said about\r\nthis--\r\n"Ah! Monsieur Canivet\'s a character!"\r\nAnd he was the more esteemed for this imperturbable coolness. The\r\nuniverse to the last man might have died, and he would not have\r\nmissed the smallest of his habits.\r\nHomais presented himself.\r\n"I count on you," said the doctor. "Are we ready? Come along!"\r\nBut the druggist, turning red, confessed that he was too\r\nsensitive to assist at such an operation.\r\n"When one is a simple spectator," he said, "the imagination, you\r\nknow, is impressed. And then I have such a nervous system!"\r\n"Pshaw!" interrupted Canivet; "on the contrary, you seem to me\r\ninclined to apoplexy. Besides, that doesn\'t astonish me, for you\r\nchemist fellows are always poking about your kitchens, which must\r\nend by spoiling your constitutions. Now just look at me. I get up\r\nevery day at four o\'clock; I shave with cold water (and am never\r\ncold). I don\'t wear flannels, and I never catch cold; my carcass\r\nis good enough! I live now in one way, now in another, like a\r\nphilosopher, taking pot-luck; that is why I am not squeamish like\r\nyou, and it is as indifferent to me to carve a Christian as the\r\nfirst fowl that turns up. Then, perhaps, you will say, habit!\r\nhabit!"\r\nThen, without any consideration for Hippolyte, who was sweating\r\nwith agony between his sheets, these gentlemen entered into a\r\nconversation, in which the druggist compared the coolness of a\r\nsurgeon to that of a general; and this comparison was pleasing to\r\nCanivet, who launched out on the exigencies of his art. He looked\r\nupon, it as a sacred office, although the ordinary practitioners\r\ndishonoured it. At last, coming back to the patient, he examined\r\nthe bandages brought by Homais, the same that had appeared for\r\nthe club-foot, and asked for someone to hold the limb for him.\r\nLestiboudois was sent for, and Monsieur Canivet having turned up\r\nhis sleeves, passed into the billiard-room, while the druggist\r\nstayed with Artemise and the landlady, both whiter than their\r\naprons, and with ears strained towards the door.\r\nBovary during this time did not dare to stir from his house.\r\nHe kept downstairs in the sitting-room by the side of the\r\nfireless chimney, his chin on his breast, his hands clasped, his\r\neyes staring. "What a mishap!" he thought, "what a mishap!"\r\nPerhaps, after all, he had made some slip. He thought it over,\r\nbut could hit upon nothing. But the most famous surgeons also\r\nmade mistakes; and that is what no one would ever believe!\r\nPeople, on the contrary, would laugh, jeer! It would spread as\r\nfar as Forges, as Neufchatel, as Rouen, everywhere! Who could say\r\nif his colleagues would not write against him. Polemics would\r\nensue; he would have to answer in the papers. Hippolyte might\r\neven prosecute him. He saw himself dishonoured, ruined, lost; and\r\nhis imagination, assailed by a world of hypotheses, tossed\r\namongst them like an empty cask borne by the sea and floating\r\nupon the waves.\r\nEmma, opposite, watched him; she did not share his humiliation;\r\nshe felt another--that of having supposed such a man was worth\r\nanything. As if twenty times already she had not sufficiently\r\nperceived his mediocrity.\r\nCharles was walking up and down the room; his boots creaked on\r\nthe floor.\r\n"Sit down," she said; "you fidget me."\r\nHe sat down again.\r\nHow was it that she--she, who was so intelligent--could have\r\nallowed herself to be deceived again? and through what deplorable\r\nmadness had she thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices? She\r\nrecalled all her instincts of luxury, all the privations of her\r\nsoul, the sordidness of marriage, of the household, her dream\r\nsinking into the mire like wounded swallows; all that she had\r\nlonged for, all that she had denied herself, all that she might\r\nhave had! And for what? for what?\r\nIn the midst of the silence that hung over the village a\r\nheart-rending cry rose on the air. Bovary turned white to\r\nfainting. She knit her brows with a nervous gesture, then went\r\non. And it was for him, for this creature, for this man, who\r\nunderstood nothing, who felt nothing! For he was there quite\r\nquiet, not even suspecting that the ridicule of his name would\r\nhenceforth sully hers as well as his. She had made efforts to\r\nlove him, and she had repented with tears for having yielded to\r\nanother!\r\n"But it was perhaps a valgus!" suddenly exclaimed Bovary, who was\r\nmeditating.\r\nAt the unexpected shock of this phrase falling on her thought\r\nlike a leaden bullet on a silver plate, Emma, shuddering, raised\r\nher head in order to find out what he meant to say; and they\r\nlooked at the other in silence, almost amazed to see each other,\r\nso far sundered were they by their inner thoughts. Charles gazed\r\nat her with the dull look of a drunken man, while he listened\r\nmotionless to the last cries of the sufferer, that followed each\r\nother in long-drawn modulations, broken by sharp spasms like the\r\nfar-off howling of some beast being slaughtered. Emma bit her wan\r\nlips, and rolling between her fingers a piece of coral that she\r\nhad broken, fixed on Charles the burning glance of her eyes like\r\ntwo arrows of fire about to dart forth. Everything in him\r\nirritated her now; his face, his dress, what he did not say, his\r\nwhole person, his existence, in fine. She repented of her past\r\nvirtue as of a crime, and what still remained of it rumbled away\r\nbeneath the furious blows of her pride. She revelled in all the\r\nevil ironies of triumphant adultery. The memory of her lover came\r\nback to her with dazzling attractions; she threw her whole soul\r\ninto it, borne away towards this image with a fresh enthusiasm;\r\nand Charles seemed to her as much removed from her life, as\r\nabsent forever, as impossible and annihilated, as if he had been\r\nabout to die and were passing under her eyes.\r\nThere was a sound of steps on the pavement. Charles looked up,\r\nand through the lowered blinds he saw at the corner of the market\r\nin the broad sunshine Dr. Canivet, who was wiping his brow with\r\nhis handkerchief. Homais, behind him, was carrying a large red\r\nbox in his hand, and both were going towards the chemist\'s.\r\nThen with a feeling of sudden tenderness and discouragement\r\nCharles turned to his wife saying to her--\r\n"Oh, kiss me, my own!"\r\n"Leave me!" she said, red with anger.\r\n"What is the matter?" he asked, stupefied. "Be calm; compose\r\nyourself. You know well enough that I love you. Come!"\r\n"Enough!" she cried with a terrible look.\r\nAnd escaping from the room, Emma closed the door so violently\r\nthat the barometer fell from the wall and smashed on the floor.\r\nCharles sank back into his arm-chair overwhelmed, trying to\r\ndiscover what could be wrong with her, fancying some nervous\r\nillness, weeping, and vaguely feeling something fatal and\r\nincomprehensible whirling round him.\r\nWhen Rodolphe came to the garden that evening, he found his\r\nmistress waiting for him at the foot of the steps on the lowest\r\nstair. They threw their arms round one another, and all their\r\nrancour melted like snow beneath the warmth of that kiss.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['Chapter Twelve\r\nThey began to love one another again. Often, even in the middle\r\nof the day, Emma suddenly wrote to him, then from the window made\r\na sign to Justin, who, taking his apron off, quickly ran to La\r\nHuchette. Rodolphe would come; she had sent for him to tell him\r\nthat she was bored, that her husband was odious, her life\r\nfrightful.\r\n"But what can I do?" he cried one day impatiently.\r\n"Ah! if you would--"\r\nShe was sitting on the floor between his knees, her hair loose,\r\nher look lost.\r\n"Why, what?" said Rodolphe.\r\nShe sighed.\r\n"We would go and live elsewhere--somewhere!"\r\n"You are really mad!" he said laughing. "How could that be\r\npossible?"\r\nShe returned to the subject; he pretended not to understand, and\r\nturned the conversation.\r\nWhat he did not understand was all this worry about so simple an\r\naffair as love. She had a motive, a reason, and, as it were, a\r\npendant to her affection.\r\nHer tenderness, in fact, grew each day with her repulsion to her\r\nhusband. The more she gave up herself to the one, the more she\r\nloathed the other. Never had Charles seemed to her so\r\ndisagreeable, to have such stodgy fingers, such vulgar ways, to\r\nbe so dull as when they found themselves together after her\r\nmeeting with Rodolphe. Then, while playing the spouse and virtue,\r\nshe was burning at the thought of that head whose black hair fell\r\nin a curl over the sunburnt brow, of that form at once so strong\r\nand elegant, of that man, in a word, who had such experience in\r\nhis reasoning, such passion in his desires. It was for him that\r\nshe filed her nails with the care of a chaser, and that there was\r\nnever enough cold-cream for her skin, nor of patchouli for her\r\nhandkerchiefs. She loaded herself with bracelets, rings, and\r\nnecklaces. When he was coming she filled the two large blue glass\r\nvases with roses, and prepared her room and her person like a\r\ncourtesan expecting a prince. The servant had to be constantly\r\nwashing linen, and all day Felicite did not stir from the\r\nkitchen, where little Justin, who often kept her company, watched\r\nher at work.\r\nWith his elbows on the long board on which she was ironing, he\r\ngreedily watched all these women\'s clothes spread about him, the\r\ndimity petticoats, the fichus, the collars, and the drawers with\r\nrunning strings, wide at the hips and growing narrower below.\r\n"What is that for?" asked the young fellow, passing his hand over\r\nthe crinoline or the hooks and eyes.\r\n"Why, haven\'t you ever seen anything?" Felicite answered\r\nlaughing. "As if your mistress, Madame Homais, didn\'t wear the\r\nsame."\r\n"Oh, I daresay! Madame Homais!" And he added with a meditative\r\nair, "As if she were a lady like madame!"\r\nBut Felicite grew impatient of seeing him hanging round her. She\r\nwas six years older than he, and Theodore, Monsieur Guillaumin\'s\r\nservant, was beginning to pay court to her.\r\n"Let me alone," she said, moving her pot of starch. "You\'d better\r\nbe off and pound almonds; you are always dangling about women.\r\nBefore you meddle with such things, bad boy, wait till you\'ve got\r\na beard to your chin."\r\n"Oh, don\'t be cross! I\'ll go and clean her boots."\r\nAnd he at once took down from the shelf Emma\'s boots, all coated\r\nwith mud, the mud of the rendezvous, that crumbled into powder\r\nbeneath his fingers, and that he watched as it gently rose in a\r\nray of sunlight.\r\n"How afraid you are of spoiling them!" said the servant, who\r\nwasn\'t so particular when she cleaned them herself, because as\r\nsoon as the stuff of the boots was no longer fresh madame handed\r\nthem over to her.\r\nEmma had a number in her cupboard that she squandered one after\r\nthe other, without Charles allowing himself the slightest\r\nobservation. So also he disbursed three hundred francs for a\r\nwooden leg that she thought proper to make a present of to\r\nHippolyte. Its top was covered with cork, and it had spring\r\njoints, a complicated mechanism, covered over by black trousers\r\nending in a patent-leather boot. But Hippolyte, not daring to use\r\nsuch a handsome leg every day, begged Madame Bovary to get him\r\nanother more convenient one. The doctor, of course, had again to\r\ndefray the expense of this purchase.\r\nSo little by little the stable-man took up his work again. One\r\nsaw him running about the village as before, and when Charles\r\nheard from afar the sharp noise of the wooden leg, he at once\r\nwent in another direction.\r\nIt was Monsieur Lheureux, the shopkeeper, who had undertaken the\r\norder; this provided him with an excuse for visiting Emma. He\r\nchatted with her about the new goods from Paris, about a thousand\r\nfeminine trifles, made himself very obliging, and never asked for\r\nhis money. Emma yielded to this lazy mode of satisfying all her\r\ncaprices. Thus she wanted to have a very handsome ridding-whip\r\nthat was at an umbrella-maker\'s at Rouen to give to Rodolphe. The\r\nweek after Monsieur Lheureux placed it on her table.\r\nBut the next day he called on her with a bill for two hundred and\r\nseventy francs, not counting the centimes. Emma was much\r\nembarrassed; all the drawers of the writing-table were empty;\r\nthey owed over a fortnight\'s wages to Lestiboudois, two quarters\r\nto the servant, for any quantity of other things, and Bovary was\r\nimpatiently expecting Monsieur Derozeray\'s account, which he was\r\nin the habit of paying every year about Midsummer.\r\nShe succeeded at first in putting off Lheureux. At last he lost\r\npatience; he was being sued; his capital was out, and unless he\r\ngot some in he should be forced to take back all the goods she\r\nhad received.\r\n"Oh, very well, take them!" said Emma.\r\n"I was only joking," he replied; "the only thing I regret is the\r\nwhip. My word! I\'ll ask monsieur to return it to me."\r\n"No, no!" she said.\r\n"Ah! I\'ve got you!" thought Lheureux.\r\nAnd, certain of his discovery, he went out repeating to himself\r\nin an undertone, and with his usual low whistle--\r\n"Good! we shall see! we shall see!"\r\nShe was thinking how to get out of this when the servant coming\r\nin put on the mantelpiece a small roll of blue paper "from\r\nMonsieur Derozeray\'s." Emma pounced upon and opened it. It\r\ncontained fifteen napoleons; it was the account. She heard\r\nCharles on the stairs; threw the gold to the back of her drawer,\r\nand took out the key\r\nThree days after Lheureux reappeared.\r\n"I have an arrangement to suggest to you," he said. "If, instead\r\nof the sum agreed on, you would take--"\r\n"Here it is," she said placing fourteen napoleons in his hand.\r\nThe tradesman was dumfounded. Then, to conceal his\r\ndisappointment, he was profuse in apologies and proffers of\r\nservice, all of which Emma declined; then she remained a few\r\nmoments fingering in the pocket of her apron the two five-franc\r\npieces that he had given her in change. She promised herself she\r\nwould economise in order to pay back later on. "Pshaw!" she\r\nthought, "he won\'t think about it again."\r\nBesides the riding-whip with its silver-gilt handle, Rodolphe had\r\nreceived a seal with the motto Amor nel cor* furthermore, a scarf\r\nfor a muffler, and, finally, a cigar-case exactly like the\r\nViscount\'s, that Charles had formerly picked up in the road, and\r\nthat Emma had kept. These presents, however, humiliated him; he\r\nrefused several; she insisted, and he ended by obeying, thinking\r\nher tyrannical and overexacting.\r\n',(0,a.jsx)(n.em,{children:'A loving heart.\r\nThen she had strange ideas.\r\n"When midnight strikes," she said, "you must think of me."\r\nAnd if he confessed that he had not thought of her, there were\r\nfloods of reproaches that always ended with the eternal question--\r\n"Do you love me?"\r\n"Why, of course I love you," he answered.\r\n"A great deal?"\r\n"Certainly!"\r\n"You haven\'t loved any others?"\r\n"Did you think you\'d got a virgin?" he exclaimed laughing.\r\nEmma cried, and he tried to console her, adorning his\r\nprotestations with puns.\r\n"Oh," she went on, "I love you! I love you so that I could not\r\nlive without you, do you see? There are times when I long to see\r\nyou again, when I am torn by all the anger of love. I ask myself,\r\nWhere is he? Perhaps he is talking to other women. They smile\r\nupon him; he approaches. Oh no; no one else pleases you. There\r\nare some more beautiful, but I love you best. I know how to love\r\nbest. I am your servant, your concubine! You are my king, my\r\nidol! You are good, you are beautiful, you are clever, you are\r\nstrong!"\r\nHe had so often heard these things said that they did not strike\r\nhim as original. Emma was like all his mistresses; and the charm\r\nof novelty, gradually falling away like a garment, laid bare the\r\neternal monotony of passion, that has always the same forms and\r\nthe same language. He did not distinguish, this man of so much\r\nexperience, the difference of sentiment beneath the sameness of\r\nexpression. Because lips libertine and venal had murmured such\r\nwords to him, he believed but little in the candour of hers;\r\nexaggerated speeches hiding mediocre affections must be\r\ndiscounted; as if the fullness of the soul did not sometimes\r\noverflow in the emptiest metaphors, since no one can ever give\r\nthe exact measure of his needs, nor of his conceptions, nor of\r\nhis sorrows; and since human speech is like a cracked tin kettle,\r\non which we hammer out tunes to make tears dance when we long to\r\nmove the stars.\r\nBut with that superior critical judgment that belongs to him who,\r\nin no matter what circumstance, holds back, Rodolphe saw other\r\ndelights to be got out of this love. He thought all modesty in\r\nthe way. He treated her quite sans facon.'})," He made of her\r\nsomething supple and corrupt. Hers was an idiotic sort of\r\nattachment, full of admiration for him, of voluptuousness for\r\nher, a beatitude that benumbed her; her soul sank into this\r\ndrunkenness, shrivelled up, drowned in it, like Clarence in his\r\nbutt of Malmsey.\r\n*Off-handedly."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'By the mere effect of her love Madame Bovary\'s manners changed.\r\nHer looks grew bolder, her speech more free; she even committed\r\nthe impropriety of walking out with Monsieur Rodolphe, a\r\ncigarette in her mouth, "as if to defy the people." At last,\r\nthose who still doubted doubted no longer when one day they saw\r\nher getting out of the "Hirondelle," her waist squeezed into a\r\nwaistcoat like a man; and Madame Bovary senior, who, after a\r\nfearful scene with her husband, had taken refuge at her son\'s,\r\nwas not the least scandalised of the women-folk. Many other\r\nthings displeased her. First, Charles had not attended to her\r\nadvice about the forbidding of novels; then the "ways of the\r\nhouse" annoyed her; she allowed herself to make some remarks, and\r\nthere were quarrels, especially one on account of Felicite.\r\nMadame Bovary senior, the evening before, passing along the\r\npassage, had surprised her in company of a man--a man with a\r\nbrown collar, about forty years old, who, at the sound of her\r\nstep, had quickly escaped through the kitchen. Then Emma began to\r\nlaugh, but the good lady grew angry, declaring that unless morals\r\nwere to be laughed at one ought to look after those of one\'s\r\nservants.\r\n"Where were you brought up?" asked the daughter-in-law, with so\r\nimpertinent a look that Madame Bovary asked her if she were not\r\nperhaps defending her own case.\r\n"Leave the room!" said the young woman, springing up with a\r\nbound.\r\n"Emma! Mamma!" cried Charles, trying to reconcile them.\r\nBut both had fled in their exasperation. Emma was stamping her\r\nfeet as she repeated--\r\n"Oh! what manners! What a peasant!"\r\nHe ran to his mother; she was beside herself. She stammered\r\n"She is an insolent, giddy-headed thing, or perhaps worse!"\r\nAnd she was for leaving at once if the other did not apologise.\r\nSo Charles went back again to his wife and implored her to give\r\nway; he knelt to her; she ended by saying--\r\n"Very well! I\'ll go to her."\r\nAnd in fact she held out her hand to her mother-in-law with the\r\ndignity of a marchioness as she said--\r\n"Excuse me, madame."\r\nThen, having gone up again to her room, she threw herself flat on\r\nher bed and cried there like a child, her face buried in the\r\npillow.\r\nShe and Rodolphe had agreed that in the event of anything\r\nextraordinary occurring, she should fasten a small piece of white\r\npaper to the blind, so that if by chance he happened to be in\r\nYonville, he could hurry to the lane behind the house. Emma made\r\nthe signal; she had been waiting three-quarters of an hour when\r\nshe suddenly caught sight of Rodolphe at the corner of the\r\nmarket. She felt tempted to open the window and call him, but he\r\nhad already disappeared. She fell back in despair.\r\nSoon, however, it seemed to her that someone was walking on the\r\npavement. It was he, no doubt. She went downstairs, crossed the\r\nyard. He was there outside. She threw herself into his arms.\r\n"Do take care!" he said.\r\n"Ah! if you knew!" she replied.\r\nAnd she began telling him everything, hurriedly, disjointedly,\r\nexaggerating the facts, inventing many, and so prodigal of\r\nparentheses that he understood nothing of it.\r\n"Come, my poor angel, courage! Be comforted! be patient!"\r\n"But I have been patient; I have suffered for four years. A love\r\nlike ours ought to show itself in the face of heaven. They\r\ntorture me! I can bear it no longer! Save me!"\r\nShe clung to Rodolphe. Her eyes, full of tears, flashed like\r\nflames beneath a wave; her breast heaved; he had never loved her\r\nso much, so that he lost his head and said "What is, it? What do\r\nyou wish?"\r\n"Take me away," she cried, "carry me off! Oh, I pray you!"\r\nAnd she threw herself upon his mouth, as if to seize there the\r\nunexpected consent if breathed forth in a kiss.\r\n"But--" Rodolphe resumed.\r\n"What?"'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Your little girl!"\r\nShe reflected a few moments, then replied--\r\n"We will take her! It can\'t be helped!"\r\n"What a woman!" he said to himself, watching her as she went. For\r\nshe had run into the garden. Someone was calling her.\r\nOn the following days Madame Bovary senior was much surprised at\r\nthe change in her daughter-in-law. Emma, in fact, was showing\r\nherself more docile, and even carried her deference so far as to\r\nask for a recipe for pickling gherkins.\r\nWas it the better to deceive them both? Or did she wish by a sort\r\nof voluptuous stoicism to feel the more profoundly the bitterness\r\nof the things she was about to leave?\r\nBut she paid no heed to them; on the contrary, she lived as lost\r\nin the anticipated delight of her coming happiness.\r\nIt was an eternal subject for conversation with Rodolphe. She\r\nleant on his shoulder murmuring--\r\n"Ah! when we are in the mail-coach! Do you think about it? Can it\r\nbe? It seems to me that the moment I feel the carriage start, it\r\nwill be as if we were rising in a balloon, as if we were setting\r\nout for the clouds. Do you know that I count the hours? And you?"\r\nNever had Madame Bovary been so beautiful as at this period; she\r\nhad that indefinable beauty that results from joy, from\r\nenthusiasm, from success, and that is only the harmony of\r\ntemperament with circumstances. Her desires, her sorrows, the\r\nexperience of pleasure, and her ever-young illusions, that had,\r\nas soil and rain and winds and the sun make flowers grow,\r\ngradually developed her, and she at length blossomed forth in all\r\nthe plenitude of her nature. Her eyelids seemed chiselled\r\nexpressly for her long amorous looks in which the pupil\r\ndisappeared, while a strong inspiration expanded her delicate\r\nnostrils and raised the fleshy corner of her lips, shaded in the\r\nlight by a little black down. One would have thought that an\r\nartist apt in conception had arranged the curls of hair upon her\r\nneck; they fell in a thick mass, negligently, and with the\r\nchanging chances of their adultery, that unbound them every day.\r\nHer voice now took more mellow infections, her figure also;\r\nsomething subtle and penetrating escaped even from the folds of\r\nher gown and from the line of her foot. Charles, as when they\r\nwere first married, thought her delicious and quite irresistible.\r\nWhen he came home in the middle of the night, he did not dare to\r\nwake her. The porcelain night-light threw a round trembling gleam\r\nupon the ceiling, and the drawn curtains of the little cot formed\r\nas it were a white hut standing out in the shade, and by the\r\nbedside Charles looked at them. He seemed to hear the light\r\nbreathing of his child. She would grow big now; every season\r\nwould bring rapid progress. He already saw her coming from school\r\nas the day drew in, laughing, with ink-stains on her jacket, and\r\ncarrying her basket on her arm. Then she would have to be sent to\r\nthe boarding-school; that would cost much; how was it to be done?\r\nThen he reflected. He thought of hiring a small farm in the\r\nneighbourhood, that he would superintend every morning on his way\r\nto his patients. He would save up what he brought in; he would\r\nput it in the savings-bank. Then he would buy shares somewhere,\r\nno matter where; besides, his practice would increase; he counted\r\nupon that, for he wanted Berthe to be well-educated, to be\r\naccomplished, to learn to play the piano. Ah! how pretty she\r\nwould be later on when she was fifteen, when, resembling her\r\nmother, she would, like her, wear large straw hats in the\r\nsummer-time; from a distance they would be taken for two sisters.\r\nHe pictured her to himself working in the evening by their side\r\nbeneath the light of the lamp; she would embroider him slippers;\r\nshe would look after the house; she would fill all the home with\r\nher charm and her gaiety. At last, they would think of her\r\nmarriage; they would find her some good young fellow with a\r\nsteady business; he would make her happy; this would last for\r\never.\r\nEmma was not asleep; she pretended to be; and while he dozed off\r\nby her side she awakened to other dreams.\r\nTo the gallop of four horses she was carried away for a week\r\ntowards a new land, whence they would return no more. They went\r\non and on, their arms entwined, without a word. Often from the\r\ntop of a mountain there suddenly glimpsed some splendid city with\r\ndomes, and bridges, and ships, forests of citron trees, and\r\ncathedrals of white marble, on whose pointed steeples were\r\nstorks\' nests. They went at a walking-pace because of the great\r\nflag-stones, and on the ground there were bouquets of flowers,\r\noffered you by women dressed in red bodices. They heard the\r\nchiming of bells, the neighing of mules, together with the murmur\r\nof guitars and the noise of fountains, whose rising spray\r\nrefreshed heaps of fruit arranged like a pyramid at the foot of\r\npale statues that smiled beneath playing waters. And then, one\r\nnight they came to a fishing village, where brown nets were\r\ndrying in the wind along the cliffs and in front of the huts. It\r\nwas there that they would stay; they would live in a low,\r\nflat-roofed house, shaded by a palm-tree, in the heart of a gulf,\r\nby the sea. They would row in gondolas, swing in hammocks, and\r\ntheir existence would be easy and large as their silk gowns, warm\r\nand star-spangled as the nights they would contemplate. However,\r\nin the immensity of this future that she conjured up, nothing\r\nspecial stood forth; the days, all magnificent, resembled\r\neach other like waves; and it swayed in the horizon, infinite,\r\nharmonised, azure, and bathed in sunshine. But the child began to\r\ncough in her cot or Bovary snored more loudly, and Emma did not\r\nfall asleep till morning, when the dawn whitened the windows, and\r\nwhen little Justin was already in the square taking down the\r\nshutters of the chemist\'s shop.\r\nShe had sent for Monsieur Lheureux, and had said to him--\r\n"I want a cloak--a large lined cloak with a deep collar."\r\n"You are going on a journey?" he asked.\r\n"No; but--never mind. I may count on you, may I not, and\r\nquickly?"\r\nHe bowed.\r\n"Besides, I shall want," she went on, "a trunk--not too heavy--\r\nhandy."\r\n"Yes, yes, I understand. About three feet by a foot and a half,\r\nas they are being made just now."\r\n"And a travelling bag."\r\n"Decidedly," thought Lheureux. "there\'s a row on here."\r\n"And," said Madame Bovary, taking her watch from her belt, "take\r\nthis; you can pay yourself out of it."\r\nBut the tradesman cried out that she was wrong; they knew one\r\nanother; did he doubt her? What childishness!\r\nShe insisted, however, on his taking at least the chain, and\r\nLheureux had already put it in his pocket and was going, when she\r\ncalled him back.\r\n"You will leave everything at your place. As to the cloak"--she\r\nseemed to be reflecting--"do not bring it either; you can give me\r\nthe maker\'s address, and tell him to have it ready for me."\r\nIt was the next month that they were to run away. She was to\r\nleave Yonville as if she was going on some business to Rouen.\r\nRodolphe would have booked the seats, procured the passports, and\r\neven have written to Paris in order to have the whole mail-coach\r\nreserved for them as far as Marseilles, where they would buy a\r\ncarriage, and go on thence without stopping to Genoa. She would\r\ntake care to send her luggage to Lheureux whence it would be\r\ntaken direct to the "Hirondelle," so that no one would have any\r\nsuspicion. And in all this there never was any allusion to the\r\nchild. Rodolphe avoided speaking of her; perhaps he no longer\r\nthought about it.\r\nHe wished to have two more weeks before him to arrange some\r\naffairs; then at the end of a week he wanted two more; then he\r\nsaid he was ill; next he went on a journey. The month of August\r\npassed, and, after all these delays, they decided that it was to\r\nbe irrevocably fixed for the 4th September--a Monday.\r\nAt length the Saturday before arrived.\r\nRodolphe came in the evening earlier than usual.\r\n"Everything is ready?" she asked him.\r\n"Yes."\r\nThen they walked round a garden-bed, and went to sit down near\r\nthe terrace on the kerb-stone of the wall.\r\n"You are sad," said Emma.\r\n"No; why?"\r\nAnd yet he looked at her strangely in a tender fashion.\r\n"It is because you are going away?" she went on; "because you are\r\nleaving what is dear to you--your life? Ah! I understand. I have\r\nnothing in the world! you are all to me; so shall I be to you. I\r\nwill be your people, your country; I will tend, I will love you!"\r\n"How sweet you are!" he said, seizing her in his arms.\r\n"Really!" she said with a voluptuous laugh. "Do you love me?\r\nSwear it then!"\r\n"Do I love you--love you? I adore you, my love."\r\nThe moon, full and purple-coloured, was rising right out of the\r\nearth at the end of the meadow. She rose quickly between the\r\nbranches of the poplars, that hid her here and there like a black\r\ncurtain pierced with holes. Then she appeared dazzling with\r\nwhiteness in the empty heavens that she lit up, and now sailing\r\nmore slowly along, let fall upon the river a great stain that\r\nbroke up into an infinity of stars; and the silver sheen seemed\r\nto writhe through the very depths like a heedless serpent covered\r\nwith luminous scales; it also resembled some monster candelabra\r\nall along which sparkled drops of diamonds running together. The\r\nsoft night was about them; masses of shadow filled the branches.\r\nEmma, her eyes half closed, breathed in with deep sighs the fresh\r\nwind that was blowing. They did not speak, lost as they were in\r\nthe rush of their reverie. The tenderness of the old days came\r\nback to their hearts, full and silent as the flowing river, with\r\nthe softness of the perfume of the syringas, and threw across\r\ntheir memories shadows more immense and more sombre than those of\r\nthe still willows that lengthened out over the grass. Often some\r\nnight-animal, hedgehog or weasel, setting out on the hunt,\r\ndisturbed the lovers, or sometimes they heard a ripe peach\r\nfalling all alone from the espalier.\r\n"Ah! what a lovely night!" said Rodolphe.\r\n"We shall have others," replied Emma; and, as if speaking to\r\nherself: "Yet, it will be good to travel. And yet, why should my\r\nheart be so heavy? Is it dread of the unknown? The effect of\r\nhabits left? Or rather--? No; it is the excess of happiness. How\r\nweak I am, am I not? Forgive me!"\r\n"There is still time!" he cried. "Reflect! perhaps you may\r\nrepent!"\r\n"Never!" she cried impetuously. And coming closer to him: "What\r\nill could come to me? There is no desert, no precipice, no ocean\r\nI would not traverse with you. The longer we live together the\r\nmore it will be like an embrace, every day closer, more heart to\r\nheart. There will be nothing to trouble us, no cares, no\r\nobstacle. We shall be alone, all to ourselves eternally. Oh,\r\nspeak! Answer me!"\r\nAt regular intervals he answered, "Yes--Yes--" She had passed her\r\nhands through his hair, and she repeated in a childlike voice,\r\ndespite the big tears which were falling, "Rodolphe! Rodolphe!\r\nAh! Rodolphe! dear little Rodolphe!"\r\nMidnight struck.\r\n"Midnight!" said she. "Come, it is to-morrow. One day more!"\r\nHe rose to go; and as if the movement he made had been the signal\r\nfor their flight, Emma said, suddenly assuming a gay air--\r\n"You have the passports?"\r\n"Yes."\r\n"You are forgetting nothing?"\r\n"No."\r\n"Are you sure?"\r\n"Certainly."\r\n"It is at the Hotel de Provence, is it not, that you will wait\r\nfor me at midday?"\r\nHe nodded.\r\n"Till to-morrow then!" said Emma in a last caress; and she\r\nwatched him go.\r\nHe did not turn round. She ran after him, and, leaning over the\r\nwater\'s edge between the bulrushes\r\n"To-morrow!" she cried.\r\nHe was already on the other side of the river and walking fast\r\nacross the meadow.\r\nAfter a few moments Rodolphe stopped; and when he saw her with\r\nher white gown gradually fade away in the shade like a ghost, he\r\nwas seized with such a beating of the heart that he leant against\r\na tree lest he should fall.\r\n"What an imbecile I am!" he said with a fearful oath. "No matter!\r\nShe was a pretty mistress!"\r\nAnd immediately Emma\'s beauty, with all the pleasures of their\r\nlove, came back to him. For a moment he softened; then he\r\nrebelled against her.\r\n"For, after all," he exclaimed, gesticulating, "I can\'t exile\r\nmyself--have a child on my hands."\r\nHe was saying these things to give himself firmness.\r\n"And besides, the worry, the expense! Ah! no, no, no, no! a\r\nthousand times no! That would be too stupid."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Thirteen\r\nNo sooner was Rodolphe at home than he sat down quickly at his\r\nbureau under the stag\'s head that hung as a trophy on the wall.\r\nBut when he had the pen between his fingers, he could think of\r\nnothing, so that, resting on his elbows, he began to reflect.\r\nEmma seemed to him to have receded into a far-off past, as if the\r\nresolution he had taken had suddenly placed a distance between\r\nthem.\r\nTo get back something of her, he fetched from the cupboard at the\r\nbedside an old Rheims biscuit-box, in which he usually kept his\r\nletters from women, and from it came an odour of dry dust and\r\nwithered roses. First he saw a handkerchief with pale little\r\nspots. It was a handkerchief of hers. Once when they were walking\r\nher nose had bled; he had forgotten it. Near it, chipped at all\r\nthe corners, was a miniature given him by Emma: her toilette\r\nseemed to him pretentious, and her languishing look in the worst\r\npossible taste. Then, from looking at this image and recalling\r\nthe memory of its original, Emma\'s features little by little grew\r\nconfused in his remembrance, as if the living and the painted\r\nface, rubbing one against the other, had effaced each other.\r\nFinally, he read some of her letters; they were full of\r\nexplanations relating to their journey, short, technical, and\r\nurgent, like business notes. He wanted to see the long ones\r\nagain, those of old times. In order to find them at the bottom of\r\nthe box, Rodolphe disturbed all the others, and mechanically\r\nbegan rummaging amidst this mass of papers and things, finding\r\npell-mell bouquets, garters, a black mask, pins, and hair--hair!\r\ndark and fair, some even, catching in the hinges of the box,\r\nbroke when it was opened.\r\nThus dallying with his souvenirs, he examined the writing and the\r\nstyle of the letters, as varied as their orthography. They were\r\ntender or jovial, facetious, melancholy; there were some that\r\nasked for love, others that asked for money. A word recalled\r\nfaces to him, certain gestures, the sound of a voice; sometimes,\r\nhowever, he remembered nothing at all.\r\nIn fact, these women, rushing at once into his thoughts, cramped\r\neach other and lessened, as reduced to a uniform level of love\r\nthat equalised them all. So taking handfuls of the mixed-up\r\nletters, he amused himself for some moments with letting them\r\nfall in cascades from his right into his left hand. At last,\r\nbored and weary, Rodolphe took back the box to the cupboard,\r\nsaying to himself, "What a lot of rubbish!" Which summed up his\r\nopinion; for pleasures, like schoolboys in a school courtyard,\r\nhad so trampled upon his heart that no green thing grew there,\r\nand that which passed through it, more heedless than children,\r\ndid not even, like them, leave a name carved upon the wall.\r\n"Come," said he, "let\'s begin."\r\nHe wrote--\r\n"Courage, Emma! courage! I would not bring misery into your\r\nlife."\r\n"After all, that\'s true," thought Rodolphe. "I am acting in her\r\ninterest; I am honest."\r\n"Have you carefully weighed your resolution? Do you know to what\r\nan abyss I was dragging you, poor angel? No, you do not, do you?\r\nYou were coming confident and fearless, believing in happiness in\r\nthe future. Ah! unhappy that we are--insensate!"\r\nRodolphe stopped here to think of some good excuse.\r\n"If I told her all my fortune is lost? No! Besides, that would\r\nstop nothing. It would all have to be begun over again later on.\r\nAs if one could make women like that listen to reason!" He\r\nreflected, then went on--\r\n"I shall not forget you, oh believe it; and I shall ever have a\r\nprofound devotion for you; but some day, sooner or later, this\r\nardour (such is the fate of human things) would have grown less,\r\nno doubt. Lassitude would have come to us, and who knows if I\r\nshould not even have had the atrocious pain of witnessing your\r\nremorse, of sharing it myself, since I should have been its\r\ncause? The mere idea of the grief that would come to you tortures\r\nme, Emma. Forget me! Why did I ever know you? Why were you so\r\nbeautiful? Is it my fault? O my God! No, no! Accuse only fate."\r\n"That\'s a word that always tells," he said to himself.\r\n"Ah, if you had been one of those frivolous women that one sees,\r\ncertainly I might, through egotism, have tried an experiment, in\r\nthat case without danger for you. But that delicious exaltation,\r\nat once your charm and your torment, has prevented you from\r\nunderstanding, adorable woman that you are, the falseness of our\r\nfuture position. Nor had I reflected upon this at first, and I\r\nrested in the shade of that ideal happiness as beneath that of\r\nthe manchineel tree, without foreseeing the consequences."\r\n"Perhaps she\'ll think I\'m giving it up from avarice. Ah, well! so\r\nmuch the worse; it must be stopped!"\r\n"The world is cruel, Emma. Wherever we might have gone, it would\r\nhave persecuted us. You would have had to put up with indiscreet\r\nquestions, calumny, contempt, insult perhaps. Insult to you! Oh!\r\nAnd I, who would place you on a throne! I who bear with me your\r\nmemory as a talisman! For I am going to punish myself by exile\r\nfor all the ill I have done you. I am going away. Whither I know\r\nnot. I am mad. Adieu! Be good always. Preserve the memory of the\r\nunfortunate who has lost you. Teach my name to your child; let\r\nher repeat it in her prayers."\r\nThe wicks of the candles flickered. Rodolphe got up to, shut the\r\nwindow, and when he had sat down again--\r\n"I think it\'s all right. Ah! and this for fear she should come\r\nand hunt me up."\r\n"I shall be far away when you read these sad lines, for I have\r\nwished to flee as quickly as possible to shun the temptation of\r\nseeing you again. No weakness! I shall return, and perhaps later\r\non we shall talk together very coldly of our old love. Adieu!"\r\nAnd there was a last "adieu" divided into two words! "A Dieu!"\r\nwhich he thought in very excellent taste.\r\n"Now how am I to sign?" he said to himself. " \'Yours devotedly?\'\r\nNo! \'Your friend?\' Yes, that\'s it."\r\n"Your friend."\r\nHe re-read his letter. He considered it very good.\r\n"Poor little woman!" he thought with emotion. "She\'ll think me\r\nharder than a rock. There ought to have been some tears on this;\r\nbut I can\'t cry; it isn\'t my fault." Then, having emptied some\r\nwater into a glass, Rodolphe dipped his finger into it, and let a\r\nbig drop fall on the paper, that made a pale stain on the ink.\r\nThen looking for a seal, he came upon the one "Amor nel cor."\r\n"That doesn\'t at all fit in with the circumstances. Pshaw! never\r\nmind!"\r\nAfter which he smoked three pipes and went to bed.\r\nThe next day when he was up (at about two o\'clock--he had slept\r\nlate), Rodolphe had a basket of apricots picked. He put his\r\nletter at the bottom under some vine leaves, and at once ordered\r\nGirard, his ploughman, to take it with care to Madame Bovary. He\r\nmade use of this means for corresponding with her, sending\r\naccording to the season fruits or game.\r\n"If she asks after me," he said, "you will tell her that I have\r\ngone on a journey. You must give the basket to her herself, into\r\nher own hands. Get along and take care!"\r\nGirard put on his new blouse, knotted his handkerchief round the\r\napricots, and walking with great heavy steps in his thick\r\niron-bound galoshes, made his way to Yonville.\r\nMadame Bovary, when he got to her house, was arranging a bundle\r\nof linen on the kitchen-table with Felicite.\r\n"Here," said the ploughboy, "is something for you--from the\r\nmaster."\r\nShe was seized with apprehension, and as she sought in her pocket\r\nfor some coppers, she looked at the peasant with haggard eyes,\r\nwhile he himself looked at her with amazement, not understanding\r\nhow such a present could so move anyone. At last he went out.\r\nFelicite remained. She could bear it no longer; she ran into the\r\nsitting room as if to take the apricots there, overturned the\r\nbasket, tore away the leaves, found the letter, opened it, and,\r\nas if some fearful fire were behind her, Emma flew to her room\r\nterrified.\r\nCharles was there; she saw him; he spoke to her; she heard\r\nnothing, and she went on quickly up the stairs, breathless,\r\ndistraught, dumb, and ever holding this horrible piece of paper,\r\nthat crackled between her fingers like a plate of sheet-iron. On\r\nthe second floor she stopped before the attic door, which was\r\nclosed.\r\nThen she tried to calm herself; she recalled the letter; she must\r\nfinish it; she did not dare to. And where? How? She would be\r\nseen! "Ah, no! here," she thought, "I shall be all right."\r\nEmma pushed open the door and went in.\r\nThe slates threw straight down a heavy heat that gripped her\r\ntemples, stifled her; she dragged herself to the closed\r\ngarret-window. She drew back the bolt, and the dazzling light\r\nburst in with a leap.\r\nOpposite, beyond the roofs, stretched the open country till it\r\nwas lost to sight. Down below, underneath her, the village square\r\nwas empty; the stones of the pavement glittered, the weathercocks\r\non the houses were motionless. At the corner of the street, from\r\na lower storey, rose a kind of humming with strident modulations.\r\nIt was Binet turning.\r\nShe leant against the embrasure of the window, and reread the\r\nletter with angry sneers. But the more she fixed her attention\r\nupon it, the more confused were her ideas. She saw him again,\r\nheard him, encircled him with her arms, and throbs of her heart,\r\nthat beat against her breast like blows of a sledge-hammer, grew\r\nfaster and faster, with uneven intervals. She looked about her\r\nwith the wish that the earth might crumble into pieces. Why not\r\nend it all? What restrained her? She was free. She advanced,\r\nlooking at the paving-stones, saying to herself, "Come! come!"\r\nThe luminous ray that came straight up from below drew the weight\r\nof her body towards the abyss. It seemed to her that the ground\r\nof the oscillating square went up the walls and that the floor\r\ndipped on end like a tossing boat. She was right at the edge,\r\nalmost hanging, surrounded by vast space. The blue of the heavens\r\nsuffused her, the air was whirling in her hollow head; she had\r\nbut to yield, to let herself be taken; and the humming of the\r\nlathe never ceased, like an angry voice calling her.\r\n"Emma! Emma!" cried Charles.\r\nShe stopped.\r\n"Wherever are you? Come!"\r\nThe thought that she had just escaped from death almost made her\r\nfaint with terror. She closed her eyes; then she shivered at the\r\ntouch of a hand on her sleeve; it was Felicite.\r\n"Master is waiting for you, madame; the soup is on the table."\r\nAnd she had to go down to sit at table.\r\nShe tried to eat. The food choked her. Then she unfolded her\r\nnapkin as if to examine the darns, and she really thought of\r\napplying herself to this work, counting the threads in the linen.\r\nSuddenly the remembrance of the letter returned to her. How had\r\nshe lost it? Where could she find it? But she felt such weariness\r\nof spirit that she could not even invent a pretext for leaving\r\nthe table. Then she became a coward; she was afraid of Charles;\r\nhe knew all, that was certain! Indeed he pronounced these words\r\nin a strange manner:\r\n"We are not likely to see Monsieur Rodolphe soon again, it\r\nseems."\r\n"Who told you?" she said, shuddering.\r\n"Who told me!" he replied, rather astonished at her abrupt tone.\r\n"Why, Girard, whom I met just now at the door of the Cafe\r\nFrancais. He has gone on a journey, or is to go."\r\nShe gave a sob.\r\n"What surprises you in that? He absents himself like that from\r\ntime to time for a change, and, ma foi, I think he\'s right, when\r\none has a fortune and is a bachelor. Besides, he has jolly times,\r\nhas our friend. He\'s a bit of a rake. Monsieur Langlois told me--"\r\nHe stopped for propriety\'s sake because the servant came in. She\r\nput back into the basket the apricots scattered on the sideboard.\r\nCharles, without noticing his wife\'s colour, had them brought to\r\nhim, took one, and bit into it.\r\n"Ah! perfect!" said he; "just taste!"\r\nAnd he handed her the basket, which she put away from her gently.\r\n"Do just smell! What an odour!" he remarked, passing it under her\r\nnose several times.\r\n"I am choking," she cried, leaping up. But by an effort of will\r\nthe spasm passed; then--\r\n"It is nothing," she said, "it is nothing! It is nervousness. Sit\r\ndown and go on eating." For she dreaded lest he should begin\r\nquestioning her, attending to her, that she should not be left\r\nalone.\r\nCharles, to obey her, sat down again, and he spat the stones of\r\nthe apricots into his hands, afterwards putting them on his\r\nplate.\r\nSuddenly a blue tilbury passed across the square at a rapid trot.\r\nEmma uttered a cry and fell back rigid to the ground.\r\nIn fact, Rodolphe, after many reflections, had decided to set out\r\nfor Rouen. Now, as from La Huchette to Buchy there is no other\r\nway than by Yonville, he had to go through the village, and Emma\r\nhad recognised him by the rays of the lanterns, which like\r\nlightning flashed through the twilight.\r\nThe chemist, at the tumult which broke out in the house ran\r\nthither. The table with all the plates was upset; sauce, meat,\r\nknives, the salt, and cruet-stand were strewn over the room;\r\nCharles was calling for help; Berthe, scared, was crying; and\r\nFelicite, whose hands trembled, was unlacing her mistress, whose\r\nwhole body shivered convulsively.\r\n"I\'ll run to my laboratory for some aromatic vinegar," said the\r\ndruggist.\r\nThen as she opened her eyes on smelling the bottle--\r\n"I was sure of it," he remarked; "that would wake any dead person\r\nfor you!"\r\n"Speak to us," said Charles; "collect yourself; it is your\r\nCharles, who loves you. Do you know me? See! here is your little\r\ngirl! Oh, kiss her!"\r\nThe child stretched out her arms to her mother to cling to her\r\nneck. But turning away her head, Emma said in a broken voice\r\n"No, no! no one!"\r\nShe fainted again. They carried her to her bed. She lay there\r\nstretched at full length, her lips apart, her eyelids closed, her\r\nhands open, motionless, and white as a waxen image. Two streams\r\nof tears flowed from her eyes and fell slowly upon the pillow.\r\nCharles, standing up, was at the back of the alcove, and the\r\nchemist, near him, maintained that meditative silence that is\r\nbecoming on the serious occasions of life.\r\n"Do not be uneasy," he said, touching his elbow; "I think the\r\nparoxysm is past."\r\n"Yes, she is resting a little now," answered Charles, watching\r\nher sleep. "Poor girl! poor girl! She had gone off now!"\r\nThen Homais asked how the accident had come about. Charles\r\nanswered that she had been taken ill suddenly while she was\r\neating some apricots.\r\n"Extraordinary!" continued the chemist. "But it might be that the\r\napricots had brought on the syncope. Some natures are so\r\nsensitive to certain smells; and it would even be a very fine\r\nquestion to study both in its pathological and physiological\r\nrelation. The priests know the importance of it, they who have\r\nintroduced aromatics into all their ceremonies. It is to stupefy\r\nthe senses and to bring on ecstasies--a thing, moreover, very\r\neasy in persons of the weaker sex, who are more delicate than the\r\nother. Some are cited who faint at the smell of burnt hartshorn,\r\nof new bread--"\r\n"Take care; you\'ll wake her!" said Bovary in a low voice.\r\n"And not only," the druggist went on, "are human beings subject\r\nto such anomalies, but animals also. Thus you are not ignorant of\r\nthe singularly aphrodisiac effect produced by the Nepeta cataria,\r\nvulgarly called catmint, on the feline race; and, on the other\r\nhand, to quote an example whose authenticity I can answer for.\r\nBridaux (one of my old comrades, at present established in the\r\nRue Malpalu) possesses a dog that falls into convulsions as soon\r\nas you hold out a snuff-box to him. He often even makes the\r\nexperiment before his friends at his summer-house at Guillaume\r\nWood. Would anyone believe that a simple sternutation could\r\nproduce such ravages on a quadrupedal organism? It is extremely\r\ncurious, is it not?"\r\n"Yes," said Charles, who was not listening to him.\r\n"This shows us," went on the other, smiling with benign\r\nself-sufficiency, "the innumerable irregularities of the nervous\r\nsystem. With regard to madame, she has always seemed to me, I\r\nconfess, very susceptible. And so I should by no means recommend\r\nto you, my dear friend, any of those so-called remedies that,\r\nunder the pretence of attacking the symptoms, attack the\r\nconstitution. No; no useless physicking! Diet, that is all;\r\nsedatives, emollients, dulcification. Then, don\'t you think that\r\nperhaps her imagination should be worked upon?"\r\n"In what way? How?" said Bovary.\r\n"Ah! that is it. Such is indeed the question. \'That is the\r\nquestion,\' as I lately read in a newspaper."\r\nBut Emma, awaking, cried out--\r\n"The letter! the letter!"\r\nThey thought she was delirious; and she was by midnight.\r\nBrain-fever had set in.\r\nFor forty-three days Charles did not leave her. He gave up all\r\nhis patients; he no longer went to bed; he was constantly feeling\r\nher pulse, putting on sinapisms and cold-water compresses. He\r\nsent Justin as far as Neufchatel for ice; the ice melted on the\r\nway; he sent him back again. He called Monsieur Canivet into\r\nconsultation; he sent for Dr. Lariviere, his old master, from\r\nRouen; he was in despair. What alarmed him most was Emma\'s\r\nprostration, for she did not speak, did not listen, did not even\r\nseem to suffer, as if her body and soul were both resting\r\ntogether after all their troubles.\r\nAbout the middle of October she could sit up in bed supported by\r\npillows. Charles wept when he saw her eat her first\r\nbread-and-jelly. Her strength returned to her; she got up for a\r\nfew hours of an afternoon, and one day, when she felt better, he\r\ntried to take her, leaning on his arm, for a walk round the\r\ngarden. The sand of the paths was disappearing beneath the dead\r\nleaves; she walked slowly, dragging along her slippers, and\r\nleaning against Charles\'s shoulder. She smiled all the time.\r\nThey went thus to the bottom of the garden near the terrace. She\r\ndrew herself up slowly, shading her eyes with her hand to look.\r\nShe looked far off, as far as she could, but on the horizon were\r\nonly great bonfires of grass smoking on the hills.\r\n"You will tire yourself, my darling!" said Bovary. And, pushing\r\nher gently to make her go into the arbour, "Sit down on this\r\nseat; you\'ll be comfortable."\r\n"Oh! no; not there!" she said in a faltering voice.\r\nShe was seized with giddiness, and from that evening her illness\r\nrecommenced, with a more uncertain character, it is true, and\r\nmore complex symptoms. Now she suffered in her heart, then in the\r\nchest, the head, the limbs; she had vomitings, in which Charles\r\nthought he saw the first signs of cancer.\r\nAnd besides this, the poor fellow was worried about money\r\nmatters.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Chapter Fourteen\r\nTo begin with, he did not know how he could pay Monsieur Homais\r\nfor all the physic supplied by him, and though, as a medical man,\r\nhe was not obliged to pay for it, he nevertheless blushed a\r\nlittle at such an obligation. Then the expenses of the household,\r\nnow that the servant was mistress, became terrible. Bills rained\r\nin upon the house; the tradesmen grumbled; Monsieur Lheureux\r\nespecially harassed him. In fact, at the height of Emma's\r\nillness, the latter, taking advantage of the circumstances to\r\nmake his bill larger, had hurriedly brought the cloak, the\r\ntravelling-bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other\r\nthings. It was very well for Charles to say he did not want them.\r\nThe tradesman answered arrogantly that these articles had been\r\nordered, and that he would not take them back; besides, it would\r\nvex madame in her convalescence; the doctor had better think it\r\nover; in short, he was resolved to sue him rather than give up\r\nhis rights and take back his goods. Charles subsequently ordered\r\nthem to be sent back to the shop. Felicite forgot; he had other\r\nthings to attend to; then thought no more about them. Monsieur\r\nLheureux returned to the charge, and, by turns threatening and\r\nwhining, so managed that Bovary ended by signing a bill at six\r\nmonths. But hardly had he signed this bill than a bold idea\r\noccurred to him: it was to borrow a thousand francs from\r\nLheureux. So, with an embarrassed air, he asked if it were\r\npossible to get them, adding that it would be for a year, at any\r\ninterest he wished. Lheureux ran off to his shop, brought back\r\nthe money, and dictated another bill, by which Bovary undertook\r\nto pay to his order on the 1st of September next the sum of one\r\nthousand and seventy francs, which, with the hundred and eighty\r\nalready agreed to, made just twelve hundred and fifty, thus\r\nlending at six per cent in addition to one-fourth for commission:\r\nand the things bringing him in a good third at the least, this\r\nought in twelve months to give him a profit of a hundred and\r\nthirty francs. He hoped that the business would not stop there;\r\nthat the bills would not be paid; that they would be renewed; and\r\nthat his poor little money, having thriven at the doctor's as at\r\na hospital, would come back to him one day considerably more\r\nplump, and fat enough to burst his bag.\r\nEverything, moreover, succeeded with him. He was adjudicator for\r\na supply of cider to the hospital at Neufchatel; Monsieur\r\nGuillaumin promised him some shares in the turf-pits of\r\nGaumesnil, and he dreamt of establishing a new diligence service\r\nbetween Arcueil and Rouen, which no doubt would not be long in\r\nruining the ramshackle van of the \"Lion d'Or,\" and that,\r\ntravelling faster, at a cheaper rate, and carrying more luggage,\r\nwould thus put into his hands the whole commerce of Yonville.\r\nCharles several times asked himself by what means he should next\r\nyear be able to pay back so much money. He reflected, imagined\r\nexpedients, such as applying to his father or selling something.\r\nBut his father would be deaf, and he--he had nothing to sell.\r\nThen he foresaw such worries that he quickly dismissed so\r\ndisagreeable a subject of meditation from his mind. He reproached\r\nhimself with forgetting Emma, as if, all his thoughts belonging\r\nto this woman, it was robbing her of something not to be\r\nconstantly thinking of her.\r\nThe winter was severe, Madame Bovary's convalescence slow. When\r\nit was fine they wheeled her arm-chair to the window that\r\noverlooked the square, for she now had an antipathy to the\r\ngarden, and the blinds on that side were always down. She wished\r\nthe horse to be sold; what she formerly liked now displeased her.\r\nAll her ideas seemed to be limited to the care of herself. She\r\nstayed in bed taking little meals, rang for the servant to\r\ninquire about her gruel or to chat with her. The snow on the\r\nmarket-roof threw a white, still light into the room; then the\r\nrain began to fall; and Emma waited daily with a mind full of\r\neagerness for the inevitable return of some trifling events which\r\nnevertheless had no relation to her. The most important was the\r\narrival of the \"Hirondelle\" in the evening. Then the landlady\r\nshouted out, and other voices answered, while Hippolyte's\r\nlantern, as he fetched the boxes from the boot, was like a star\r\nin the darkness. At mid-day Charles came in; then he went out\r\nagain; next she took some beef-tea, and towards five o'clock, as\r\nthe day drew in, the children coming back from school, dragging\r\ntheir wooden shoes along the pavement, knocked the clapper of the\r\nshutters with their rulers one after the other.\r\nIt was at this hour that Monsieur Bournisien came to see her. He\r\ninquired after her health, gave her news, exhorted her to\r\nreligion, in a coaxing little prattle that was not without its\r\ncharm. The mere thought of his cassock comforted her.\r\nOne day, when at the height of her illness, she had thought\r\nherself dying, and had asked for the communion; and, while they\r\nwere making the preparations in her room for the sacrament, while\r\nthey were turning the night table covered with syrups into an\r\naltar, and while Felicite was strewing dahlia flowers on the\r\nfloor, Emma felt some power passing over her that freed her from\r\nher pains, from all perception, from all feeling. Her body,\r\nrelieved, no longer thought; another life was beginning; it\r\nseemed to her that her being, mounting toward God, would be\r\nannihilated in that love like a burning incense that melts into\r\nvapour. The bed-clothes were sprinkled with holy water, the\r\npriest drew from the holy pyx the white wafer; and it was\r\nfainting with a celestial joy that she put out her lips to accept\r\nthe body of the Saviour presented to her. The curtains of the\r\nalcove floated gently round her like clouds, and the rays of the\r\ntwo tapers burning on the night-table seemed to shine like\r\ndazzling halos. Then she let her head fall back, fancying she\r\nheard in space the music of seraphic harps, and perceived in an\r\nazure sky, on a golden throne in the midst of saints holding\r\ngreen palms, God the Father, resplendent with majesty, who with a\r\nsign sent to earth angels with wings of fire to carry her away in\r\ntheir arms.\r\nThis splendid vision dwelt in her memory as the most beautiful\r\nthing that it was possible to dream, so that now she strove to\r\nrecall her sensation. That still lasted, however, but in a less\r\nexclusive fashion and with a deeper sweetness. Her soul, tortured\r\nby pride, at length found rest in Christian humility, and,\r\ntasting the joy of weakness, she saw within herself the\r\ndestruction of her will, that must have left a wide entrance for\r\nthe inroads of heavenly grace. There existed, then, in the place\r\nof happiness, still greater joys--another love beyond all loves,\r\nwithout pause and without end, one that would grow eternally! She\r\nsaw amid the illusions of her hope a state of purity floating\r\nabove the earth mingling with heaven, to which she aspired. She\r\nwanted to become a saint. She bought chaplets and wore amulets;\r\nshe wished to have in her room, by the side of her bed, a\r\nreliquary set in emeralds that she might kiss it every evening.\r\nThe cure marvelled at this humour, although Emma's religion, he\r\nthought, might, from its fervour, end by touching on heresy,\r\nextravagance. But not being much versed in these matters, as soon\r\nas they went beyond a certain limit he wrote to Monsieur Boulard,\r\nbookseller to Monsignor, to send him \"something good for a lady\r\nwho was very clever.\" The bookseller, with as much indifference\r\nas if he had been sending off hardware to niggers, packed up,\r\npellmell, everything that was then the fashion in the pious book\r\ntrade. There were little manuals in questions and answers,\r\npamphlets of aggressive tone after the manner of Monsieur de\r\nMaistre, and certain novels in rose-coloured bindings and with a\r\nhonied style, manufactured by troubadour seminarists or penitent\r\nblue-stockings. There were the \"Think of it; the Man of the World\r\nat Mary's Feet, by Monsieur de **",(0,a.jsx)(n.em,{children:', decorated with many Orders";\r\n"The Errors of Voltaire, for the Use of the Young," etc.\r\nMadame Bovary\'s mind was not yet sufficiently clear to apply\r\nherself seriously to anything; moreover, she began this reading\r\nin too much hurry. She grew provoked at the doctrines of\r\nreligion; the arrogance of the polemic writings displeased her by\r\ntheir inveteracy in attacking people she did not know; and the\r\nsecular stories, relieved with religion, seemed to her written in\r\nsuch ignorance of the world, that they insensibly estranged her\r\nfrom the truths for whose proof she was looking. Nevertheless,\r\nshe persevered; and when the volume slipped from her hands, she\r\nfancied herself seized with the finest Catholic melancholy that\r\nan ethereal soul could conceive.\r\nAs for the memory of Rodolphe, she had thrust it back to the\r\nbottom of her heart, and it remained there more solemn and more\r\nmotionless than a king\'s mummy in a catacomb. An exhalation\r\nescaped from this embalmed love, that, penetrating through\r\neverything, perfumed with tenderness the immaculate atmosphere in\r\nwhich she longed to live. When she knelt on her Gothic prie-Dieu,\r\nshe addressed to the Lord the same suave words that she had\r\nmurmured formerly to her lover in the outpourings of adultery. It\r\nwas to make faith come; but no delights descended from the\r\nheavens, and she arose with tired limbs and with a vague feeling\r\nof a gigantic dupery.\r\nThis searching after faith, she thought, was only one merit the\r\nmore, and in the pride of her devoutness Emma compared herself to\r\nthose grand ladies of long ago whose glory she, had dreamed of\r\nover a portrait of La Valliere, and who, trailing with so much\r\nmajesty the lace-trimmed trains of their long gowns, retired into\r\nsolitudes to shed at the feet of Christ all the tears of hearts\r\nthat life had wounded.\r\nThen she gave herself up to excessive charity. She sewed clothes\r\nfor the poor, she sent wood to women in childbed; and Charles one\r\nday, on coming home, found three good-for-nothings in the kitchen\r\nseated at the table eating soup. She had her little girl, whom\r\nduring her illness her husband had sent back to the nurse,\r\nbrought home. She wanted to teach her to read; even when Berthe\r\ncried, she was not vexed. She had made up her mind to\r\nresignation, to universal indulgence. Her language about\r\neverything was full of ideal expressions. She said to her child,\r\n"Is your stomach-ache better, my angel?"\r\nMadame Bovary senior found nothing to censure except perhaps this\r\nmania of knitting jackets for orphans instead of mending her own\r\nhouse-linen; but, harassed with domestic quarrels, the good woman\r\ntook pleasure in this quiet house, and she even stayed there till\r\nafter Easter, to escape the sarcasms of old Bovary, who never\r\nfailed on Good Friday to order chitterlings.\r\nBesides the companionship of her mother-in-law, who strengthened\r\nher a little by the rectitude of her judgment and her grave ways,\r\nEmma almost every day had other visitors. These were Madame\r\nLanglois, Madame Caron, Madame Dubreuil, Madame Tuvache, and\r\nregularly from two to five o\'clock the excellent Madame Homais,\r\nwho, for her part, had never believed any of the tittle-tattle\r\nabout her neighbour. The little Homais also came to see her;\r\nJustin accompanied them. He went up with them to her bedroom, and\r\nremained standing near the door, motionless and mute. Often even\r\nMadame Bovary; taking no heed of him, began her toilette. She\r\nbegan by taking out her comb, shaking her head with a quick\r\nmovement, and when he for the first time saw all this mass of\r\nhair that fell to her knees unrolling in black ringlets, it was\r\nto him, poor child! like a sudden entrance into something new and\r\nstrange, whose splendour terrified him.\r\nEmma, no doubt, did not notice his silent attentions or his\r\ntimidity. She had no suspicion that the love vanished from her\r\nlife was there, palpitating by her side, beneath that coarse\r\nholland shirt, in that youthful heart open to the emanations of\r\nher beauty. Besides, she now enveloped all things with such\r\nindifference, she had words so affectionate with looks so\r\nhaughty, such contradictory ways, that one could no longer\r\ndistinguish egotism from charity, or corruption from virtue. One\r\nevening, for example, she was angry with the servant, who had\r\nasked to go out, and stammered as she tried to find some pretext.\r\nThen suddenly--\r\n"So you love him?" she said.\r\nAnd without waiting for any answer from Felicite, who was\r\nblushing, she added, "There! run along; enjoy yourself!"\r\nIn the beginning of spring she had the garden turned up from end\r\nto end, despite Bovary\'s remonstrances. However, he was glad to\r\nsee her at last manifest a wish of any kind. As she grew stronger\r\nshe displayed more wilfulness. First, she found occasion to expel\r\nMere Rollet, the nurse, who during her convalescence had\r\ncontracted the habit of coming too often to the kitchen with her\r\ntwo nurslings and her boarder, better off for teeth than a\r\ncannibal. Then she got rid of the Homais family, successively\r\ndismissed all the other visitors, and even frequented church less\r\nassiduously, to the great approval of the druggist, who said to\r\nher in a friendly way--\r\n"You were going in a bit for the cassock!"\r\nAs formerly, Monsieur Bournisien dropped in every day when he\r\ncame out after catechism class. He preferred staying out of doors\r\nto taking the air "in the grove," as he called the arbour. This\r\nwas the time when Charles came home. They were hot; some sweet\r\ncider was brought out, and they drank together to madame\'s\r\ncomplete restoration.\r\nBinet was there; that is to say, a little lower down against the\r\nterrace wall, fishing for crayfish. Bovary invited him to have a\r\ndrink, and he thoroughly understood the uncorking of the stone\r\nbottles.\r\n"You must," he said, throwing a satisfied glance all round him,\r\neven to the very extremity of the landscape, "hold the bottle\r\nperpendicularly on the table, and after the strings are cut,\r\npress up the cork with little thrusts, gently, gently, as indeed\r\nthey do seltzer-water at restaurants."\r\nBut during his demonstration the cider often spurted right into\r\ntheir faces, and then the ecclesiastic, with a thick laugh, never\r\nmissed this joke--\r\n"Its goodness strikes the eye!"\r\nHe was, in fact, a good fellow and one day he was not even\r\nscandalised at the chemist, who advised Charles to give madame\r\nsome distraction by taking her to the theatre at Rouen to hear\r\nthe illustrious tenor, Lagardy. Homais, surprised at this\r\nsilence, wanted to know his opinion, and the priest declared that\r\nhe considered music less dangerous for morals than literature.\r\nBut the chemist took up the defence of letters. The theatre, he\r\ncontended, served for railing at prejudices, and, beneath a mask\r\nof pleasure, taught virtue.\r\n"\'Castigat ridendo mores,\''})," Monsieur Bournisien! Thus consider\r\nthe greater part of Voltaire's tragedies; they are cleverly\r\nstrewn with philosophical reflections, that made them a vast\r\nschool of morals and diplomacy for the people.\"\r\n*It corrects customs through laughter."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"I," said Binet, "once saw a piece called the \'Gamin de Paris,\'\r\nin which there was the character of an old general that is really\r\nhit off to a T. He sets down a young swell who had seduced a\r\nworking girl, who at the ending--"\r\n"Certainly," continued Homais, "there is bad literature as there\r\nis bad pharmacy, but to condemn in a lump the most important of\r\nthe fine arts seems to me a stupidity, a Gothic idea, worthy of\r\nthe abominable times that imprisoned Galileo."\r\n"I know very well," objected the cure, "that there are good\r\nworks, good authors. However, if it were only those persons of\r\ndifferent sexes united in a bewitching apartment, decorated\r\nrouge, those lights, those effeminate voices, all this must, in\r\nthe long-run, engender a certain mental libertinage, give rise to\r\nimmodest thoughts and impure temptations. Such, at any rate, is\r\nthe opinion of all the Fathers. Finally," he added, suddenly\r\nassuming a mystic tone of voice while he rolled a pinch of snuff\r\nbetween his fingers, "if the Church has condemned the theatre,\r\nshe must be right; we must submit to her decrees."\r\n"Why," asked the druggist, "should she excommunicate actors? For\r\nformerly they openly took part in religious ceremonies. Yes, in\r\nthe middle of the chancel they acted; they performed a kind of\r\nfarce called \'Mysteries,\' which often offended against the laws\r\nof decency."\r\nThe ecclesiastic contented himself with uttering a groan, and the\r\nchemist went on--\r\n"It\'s like it is in the Bible; there there are, you know, more\r\nthan one piquant detail, matters really libidinous!"\r\nAnd on a gesture of irritation from Monsieur Bournisien--\r\n"Ah! you\'ll admit that it is not a book to place in the hands of\r\na young girl, and I should be sorry if Athalie--"\r\n"But it is the Protestants, and not we," cried the other\r\nimpatiently, "who recommend the Bible."\r\n"No matter," said Homais. "I am surprised that in our days, in\r\nthis century of enlightenment, anyone should still persist in\r\nproscribing an intellectual relaxation that is inoffensive,\r\nmoralising, and sometimes even hygienic; is it not, doctor?"\r\n"No doubt," replied the doctor carelessly, either because,\r\nsharing the same ideas, he wished to offend no one, or else\r\nbecause he had not any ideas.\r\nThe conversation seemed at an end when the chemist thought fit to\r\nshoot a Parthian arrow.\r\n"I\'ve known priests who put on ordinary clothes to go and see\r\ndancers kicking about."\r\n"Come, come!" said the cure.\r\n"Ah! I\'ve known some!" And separating the words of his sentence,\r\nHomais repeated, "I--have--known--some!"\r\n"Well, they were wrong," said Bournisien, resigned to anything.\r\n"By Jove! they go in for more than that," exclaimed the druggist.\r\n"Sir!" replied the ecclesiastic, with such angry eyes that the\r\ndruggist was intimidated by them.\r\n"I only mean to say," he replied in less brutal a tone, "that\r\ntoleration is the surest way to draw people to religion."\r\n"That is true! that is true!" agreed the good fellow, sitting\r\ndown again on his chair. But he stayed only a few moments.\r\nThen, as soon as he had gone, Monsieur Homais said to the doctor--\r\n"That\'s what I call a cock-fight. I beat him, did you see, in a\r\nway!--Now take my advice. Take madame to the theatre, if it were\r\nonly for once in your life, to enrage one of these ravens, hang\r\nit! If anyone could take my place, I would accompany you myself.\r\nBe quick about it. Lagardy is only going to give one performance;\r\nhe\'s engaged to go to England at a high salary. From what I hear,\r\nhe\'s a regular dog; he\'s rolling in money; he\'s taking three\r\nmistresses and a cook along with him. All these great artists\r\nburn the candle at both ends; they require a dissolute life, that\r\nsuits the imagination to some extent. But they die at the\r\nhospital, because they haven\'t the sense when young to lay by.\r\nWell, a pleasant dinner! Goodbye till to-morrow."\r\nThe idea of the theatre quickly germinated in Bovary\'s head, for\r\nhe at once communicated it to his wife, who at first refused,\r\nalleging the fatigue, the worry, the expense; but, for a wonder,\r\nCharles did not give in, so sure was he that this recreation\r\nwould be good for her. He saw nothing to prevent it: his mother\r\nhad sent them three hundred francs which he had no longer\r\nexpected; the current debts were not very large, and the falling\r\nin of Lheureux\'s bills was still so far off that there was no\r\nneed to think about them. Besides, imagining that she was\r\nrefusing from delicacy, he insisted the more; so that by dint of\r\nworrying her she at last made up her mind, and the next day at\r\neight o\'clock they set out in the "Hirondelle."\r\nThe druggist, whom nothing whatever kept at Yonville, but who\r\nthought himself bound not to budge from it, sighed as he saw them\r\ngo.\r\n"Well, a pleasant journey!" he said to them; "happy mortals that\r\nyou are!"\r\nThen addressing himself to Emma, who was wearing a blue silk gown\r\nwith four flounces--\r\n"You are as lovely as a Venus. You\'ll cut a figure at Rouen."\r\nThe diligence stopped at the "Croix-Rouge" in the Place\r\nBeauvoisine. It was the inn that is in every provincial faubourg,\r\nwith large stables and small bedrooms, where one sees in the\r\nmiddle of the court chickens pilfering the oats under the muddy\r\ngigs of the commercial travellers--a good old house, with\r\nworm-eaten balconies that creak in the wind on winter nights,\r\nalways full of people, noise, and feeding, whose black tables are\r\nsticky with coffee and brandy, the thick windows made yellow by\r\nthe flies, the damp napkins stained with cheap wine, and that\r\nalways smells of the village, like ploughboys dressed in\r\nSundayclothes, has a cafe on the street, and towards the\r\ncountryside a kitchen-garden. Charles at once set out. He muddled\r\nup the stage-boxes with the gallery, the pit with the boxes;\r\nasked for explanations, did not understand them; was sent from\r\nthe box-office to the acting-manager; came back to the inn,\r\nreturned to the theatre, and thus several times traversed the\r\nwhole length of the town from the theatre to the boulevard.\r\nMadame Bovary bought a bonnet, gloves, and a bouquet. The doctor\r\nwas much afraid of missing the beginning, and, without having had\r\ntime to swallow a plate of soup, they presented themselves at the\r\ndoors of the theatre, which were still closed.\r\nChapter Fifteen\r\nThe crowd was waiting against the wall, symmetrically enclosed\r\nbetween the balustrades. At the corner of the neighbouring\r\nstreets huge bills repeated in quaint letters "Lucie de\r\nLammermoor-Lagardy-Opera-etc." The weather was fine, the people\r\nwere hot, perspiration trickled amid the curls, and handkerchiefs\r\ntaken from pockets were mopping red foreheads; and now and then a\r\nwarm wind that blew from the river gently stirred the border of\r\nthe tick awnings hanging from the doors of the public-houses. A\r\nlittle lower down, however, one was refreshed by a current of icy\r\nair that smelt of tallow, leather, and oil. This was an\r\nexhalation from the Rue des Charrettes, full of large black\r\nwarehouses where they made casks.\r\nFor fear of seeming ridiculous, Emma before going in wished to\r\nhave a little stroll in the harbour, and Bovary prudently kept\r\nhis tickets in his hand, in the pocket of his trousers, which he\r\npressed against his stomach.\r\nHer heart began to beat as soon as she reached the vestibule. She\r\ninvoluntarily smiled with vanity on seeing the crowd rushing to\r\nthe right by the other corridor while she went up the staircase\r\nto the reserved seats. She was as pleased as a child to push with\r\nher finger the large tapestried door. She breathed in with all\r\nher might the dusty smell of the lobbies, and when she was seated\r\nin her box she bent forward with the air of a duchess.\r\nThe theatre was beginning to fill; opera-glasses were taken from\r\ntheir cases, and the subscribers, catching sight of one another,\r\nwere bowing. They came to seek relaxation in the fine arts after\r\nthe anxieties of business; but "business" was not forgotten; they\r\nstill talked cottons, spirits of wine, or indigo. The heads of\r\nold men were to be seen, inexpressive and peaceful, with their\r\nhair and complexions looking like silver medals tarnished by\r\nsteam of lead. The young beaux were strutting about in the pit,\r\nshowing in the opening of their waistcoats their pink or\r\napplegreen cravats, and Madame Bovary from above admired them\r\nleaning on their canes with golden knobs in the open palm of\r\ntheir yellow gloves.\r\nNow the lights of the orchestra were lit, the lustre, let down\r\nfrom the ceiling, throwing by the glimmering of its facets a\r\nsudden gaiety over the theatre; then the musicians came in one\r\nafter the other; and first there was the protracted hubbub of the\r\nbasses grumbling, violins squeaking, cornets trumpeting, flutes\r\nand flageolets fifing. But three knocks were heard on the stage,\r\na rolling of drums began, the brass instruments played some\r\nchords, and the curtain rising, discovered a country-scene.\r\nIt was the cross-roads of a wood, with a fountain shaded by an\r\noak to the left. Peasants and lords with plaids on their\r\nshoulders were singing a hunting-song together; then a captain\r\nsuddenly came on, who evoked the spirit of evil by lifting both\r\nhis arms to heaven. Another appeared; they went away, and the\r\nhunters started afresh. She felt herself transported to the\r\nreading of her youth, into the midst of Walter Scott. She seemed\r\nto hear through the mist the sound of the Scotch bagpipes\r\nre-echoing over the heather. Then her remembrance of the novel\r\nhelping her to understand the libretto, she followed the story\r\nphrase by phrase, while vague thoughts that came back to her\r\ndispersed at once again with the bursts of music. She gave\r\nherself up to the lullaby of the melodies, and felt all her being\r\nvibrate as if the violin bows were drawn over her nerves. She had\r\nnot eyes enough to look at the costumes, the scenery, the actors,\r\nthe painted trees that shook when anyone walked, and the velvet\r\ncaps, cloaks, swords--all those imaginary things that floated\r\namid the harmony as in the atmosphere of another world. But a\r\nyoung woman stepped forward, throwing a purse to a squire in\r\ngreen. She was left alone, and the flute was heard like the\r\nmurmur of a fountain or the warbling of birds. Lucie attacked her\r\ncavatina in G major bravely. She plained of love; she longed for\r\nwings. Emma, too, fleeing from life, would have liked to fly away\r\nin an embrace. Suddenly Edgar-Lagardy appeared.\r\nHe had that splendid pallor that gives something of the majesty\r\nof marble to the ardent races of the South. His vigorous form was\r\ntightly clad in a brown-coloured doublet; a small chiselled\r\nponiard hung against his left thigh, and he cast round laughing\r\nlooks showing his white teeth. They said that a Polish princess\r\nhaving heard him sing one night on the beach at Biarritz, where\r\nhe mended boats, had fallen in love with him. She had ruined\r\nherself for him. He had deserted her for other women, and this\r\nsentimental celebrity did not fail to enhance his artistic\r\nreputation. The diplomatic mummer took care always to slip into\r\nhis advertisements some poetic phrase on the fascination of his\r\nperson and the susceptibility of his soul. A fine organ,\r\nimperturbable coolness, more temperament than intelligence, more\r\npower of emphasis than of real singing, made up the charm of this\r\nadmirable charlatan nature, in which there was something of the\r\nhairdresser and the toreador.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'From the first scene he evoked enthusiasm. He pressed Lucy in his\r\narms, he left her, he came back, he seemed desperate; he had\r\noutbursts of rage, then elegiac gurglings of infinite sweetness,\r\nand the notes escaped from his bare neck full of sobs and kisses.\r\nEmma leant forward to see him, clutching the velvet of the box\r\nwith her nails. She was filling her heart with these melodious\r\nlamentations that were drawn out to the accompaniment of the\r\ndouble-basses, like the cries of the drowning in the tumult of a\r\ntempest. She recognised all the intoxication and the anguish that\r\nhad almost killed her. The voice of a prima donna seemed to her\r\nto be but echoes of her conscience, and this illusion that\r\ncharmed her as some very thing of her own life. But no one on\r\nearth had loved her with such love. He had not wept like Edgar\r\nthat last moonlit night when they said, "To-morrow! to-morrow!"\r\nThe theatre rang with cheers; they recommenced the entire\r\nmovement; the lovers spoke of the flowers on their tomb, of vows,\r\nexile, fate, hopes; and when they uttered the final adieu, Emma\r\ngave a sharp cry that mingled with the vibrations of the last\r\nchords.\r\n"But why," asked Bovary, "does that gentleman persecute her?"\r\n"No, no!" she answered; "he is her lover!"\r\n"Yet he vows vengeance on her family, while the other one who\r\ncame on before said, \'I love Lucie and she loves me!\' Besides, he\r\nwent off with her father arm in arm. For he certainly is her\r\nfather, isn\'t he--the ugly little man with a cock\'s feather in\r\nhis hat?"\r\nDespite Emma\'s explanations, as soon as the recitative duet began\r\nin which Gilbert lays bare his abominable machinations to his\r\nmaster Ashton, Charles, seeing the false troth-ring that is to\r\ndeceive Lucie, thought it was a love-gift sent by Edgar. He\r\nconfessed, moreover, that he did not understand the story because\r\nof the music, which interfered very much with the words.\r\n"What does it matter?" said Emma. "Do be quiet!"\r\n"Yes, but you know," he went on, leaning against her shoulder, "I\r\nlike to understand things."\r\n"Be quiet! be quiet!" she cried impatiently.\r\nLucie advanced, half supported by her women, a wreath of orange\r\nblossoms in her hair, and paler than the white satin of her gown.\r\nEmma dreamed of her marriage day; she saw herself at home again\r\namid the corn in the little path as they walked to the church.\r\nOh, why had not she, like this woman, resisted, implored? She, on\r\nthe contrary, had been joyous, without seeing the abyss into\r\nwhich she was throwing herself. Ah! if in the freshness of her\r\nbeauty, before the soiling of marriage and the disillusions of\r\nadultery, she could have anchored her life upon some great,\r\nstrong heart, then virtue, tenderness, voluptuousness, and duty\r\nblending, she would never have fallen from so high a happiness.\r\nBut that happiness, no doubt, was a lie invented for the despair\r\nof all desire. She now knew the smallness of the passions that\r\nart exaggerated. So, striving to divert her thoughts, Emma\r\ndetermined now to see in this reproduction of her sorrows only a\r\nplastic fantasy, well enough to please the eye, and she even\r\nsmiled internally with disdainful pity when at the back of the\r\nstage under the velvet hangings a man appeared in a black cloak.\r\nHis large Spanish hat fell at a gesture he made, and immediately\r\nthe instruments and the singers began the sextet. Edgar, flashing\r\nwith fury, dominated all the others with his clearer voice;\r\nAshton hurled homicidal provocations at him in deep notes; Lucie\r\nuttered her shrill plaint, Arthur at one side, his modulated\r\ntones in the middle register, and the bass of the minister pealed\r\nforth like an organ, while the voices of the women repeating his\r\nwords took them up in chorus delightfully. They were all in a row\r\ngesticulating, and anger, vengeance, jealousy, terror, and\r\nstupefaction breathed forth at once from their half-opened\r\nmouths. The outraged lover brandished his naked sword; his\r\nguipure ruffle rose with jerks to the movements of his chest, and\r\nhe walked from right to left with long strides, clanking against\r\nthe boards the silver-gilt spurs of his soft boots, widening out\r\nat the ankles. He, she thought must have an inexhaustible love\r\nto lavish it upon the crowd with such effusion. All her small\r\nfault-findings faded before the poetry of the part that absorbed\r\nher; and, drawn towards this man by the illusion of the\r\ncharacter, she tried to imagine to herself his life--that life\r\nresonant, extraordinary, splendid, and that might have been hers\r\nif fate had willed it. They would have known one another, loved\r\none another. With him, through all the kingdoms of Europe she\r\nwould have travelled from capital to capital, sharing his\r\nfatigues and his pride, picking up the flowers thrown to him,\r\nherself embroidering his costumes. Then each evening, at the back\r\nof a box, behind the golden trellis-work she would have drunk in\r\neagerly the expansions of this soul that would have sung for her\r\nalone; from the stage, even as he acted, he would have looked at\r\nher. But the mad idea seized her that he was looking at her; it\r\nwas certain. She longed to run to his arms, to take refuge in his\r\nstrength, as in the incarnation of love itself, and to say to\r\nhim, to cry out, "Take me away! carry me with you! let us go!\r\nThine, thine! all my ardour and all my dreams!"\r\nThe curtain fell.\r\nThe smell of the gas mingled with that of the breaths, the waving\r\nof the fans, made the air more suffocating. Emma wanted to go\r\nout; the crowd filled the corridors, and she fell back in her\r\narm-chair with palpitations that choked her. Charles, fearing\r\nthat she would faint, ran to the refreshment-room to get a glass\r\nof barley-water.\r\nHe had great difficulty in getting back to his seat, for his\r\nelbows were jerked at every step because of the glass he held in\r\nhis hands, and he even spilt three-fourths on the shoulders of a\r\nRouen lady in short sleeves, who feeling the cold liquid running\r\ndown to her loins, uttered cries like a peacock, as if she were\r\nbeing assassinated. Her husband, who was a millowner, railed at\r\nthe clumsy fellow, and while she was with her handkerchief wiping\r\nup the stains from her handsome cherry-coloured taffeta gown, he\r\nangrily muttered about indemnity, costs, reimbursement. At last\r\nCharles reached his wife, saying to her, quite out of breath--\r\n"Ma foi! I thought I should have had to stay there. There is such\r\na crowd--SUCH a crowd!"\r\nHe added--\r\n"Just guess whom I met up there! Monsieur Leon!"\r\n"Leon?"\r\n"Himself! He\'s coming along to pay his respects." And as he\r\nfinished these words the ex-clerk of Yonville entered the box.\r\nHe held out his hand with the ease of a gentleman; and Madame\r\nBovary extended hers, without doubt obeying the attraction of a\r\nstronger will. She had not felt it since that spring evening when\r\nthe rain fell upon the green leaves, and they had said good-bye\r\nstanding at the window. But soon recalling herself to the\r\nnecessities of the situation, with an effort she shook off the\r\ntorpor of her memories, and began stammering a few hurried words.\r\n"Ah, good-day! What! you here?"\r\n"Silence!" cried a voice from the pit, for the third act was\r\nbeginning.\r\n"So you are at Rouen?"\r\n"Yes."\r\n"And since when?"\r\n"Turn them out! turn them out!" People were looking at them. They\r\nwere silent.\r\nBut from that moment she listened no more; and the chorus of the\r\nguests, the scene between Ashton and his servant, the grand duet\r\nin D major, all were for her as far off as if the instruments had\r\ngrown less sonorous and the characters more remote. She\r\nremembered the games at cards at the druggist\'s, and the walk to\r\nthe nurse\'s, the reading in the arbour, the tete-a-tete by the\r\nfireside--all that poor love, so calm and so protracted, so\r\ndiscreet, so tender, and that she had nevertheless forgotten. And\r\nwhy had he come back? What combination of circumstances had\r\nbrought him back into her life? He was standing behind her,\r\nleaning with his shoulder against the wall of the box; now and\r\nagain she felt herself shuddering beneath the hot breath from his\r\nnostrils falling upon her hair.\r\n"Does this amuse you?" said he, bending over her so closely that\r\nthe end of his moustache brushed her cheek. She replied\r\ncarelessly--\r\n"Oh, dear me, no, not much."\r\nThen he proposed that they should leave the theatre and go and\r\ntake an ice somewhere.\r\n"Oh, not yet; let us stay," said Bovary. "Her hair\'s undone; this\r\nis going to be tragic."\r\nBut the mad scene did not at all interest Emma, and the acting of\r\nthe singer seemed to her exaggerated.\r\n"She screams too loud," said she, turning to Charles, who was\r\nlistening.\r\n"Yes--a little," he replied, undecided between the frankness of\r\nhis pleasure and his respect for his wife\'s opinion.\r\nThen with a sigh Leon said--\r\n"The heat is--"\r\n"Unbearable! Yes!"\r\n"Do you feel unwell?" asked Bovary.\r\n"Yes, I am stifling; let us go."\r\nMonsieur Leon put her long lace shawl carefully about her\r\nshoulders, and all three went off to sit down in the harbour, in\r\nthe open air, outside the windows of a cafe.\r\nFirst they spoke of her illness, although Emma interrupted\r\nCharles from time to time, for fear, she said, of boring Monsieur\r\nLeon; and the latter told them that he had come to spend two\r\nyears at Rouen in a large office, in order to get practice in his\r\nprofession, which was different in Normandy and Paris. Then he\r\ninquired after Berthe, the Homais, Mere Lefrancois, and as they\r\nhad, in the husband\'s presence, nothing more to say to one\r\nanother, the conversation soon came to an end.\r\nPeople coming out of the theatre passed along the pavement,\r\nhumming or shouting at the top of their voices, "O bel ange, ma\r\nLucie!*" Then Leon, playing the dilettante, began to talk music.\r\nHe had seen Tambourini, Rubini, Persiani, Grisi, and, compared\r\nwith them, Lagardy, despite his grand outbursts, was nowhere.\r\n*Oh beautiful angel, my Lucie.'}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Yet," interrupted Charles, who was slowly sipping his\r\nrum-sherbet, "they say that he is quite admirable in the last\r\nact. I regret leaving before the end, because it was beginning to\r\namuse me."\r\n"Why," said the clerk, "he will soon give another performance."\r\nBut Charles replied that they were going back next day. "Unless,"\r\nhe added, turning to his wife, "you would like to stay alone,\r\nkitten?"\r\nAnd changing his tactics at this unexpected opportunity that\r\npresented itself to his hopes, the young man sang the praises of\r\nLagardy in the last number. It was really superb, sublime. Then\r\nCharles insisted--\r\n"You would get back on Sunday. Come, make up your mind. You are\r\nwrong if you feel that this is doing you the least good."\r\nThe tables round them, however, were emptying; a waiter came and\r\nstood discreetly near them. Charles, who understood, took out his\r\npurse; the clerk held back his arm, and did not forget to leave\r\ntwo more pieces of silver that he made chink on the marble.\r\n"I am really sorry," said Bovary, "about the money which you\r\nare--"\r\nThe other made a careless gesture full of cordiality, and taking\r\nhis hat said--\r\n"It is settled, isn\'t it? To-morrow at six o\'clock?"\r\nCharles explained once more that he could not absent himself\r\nlonger, but that nothing prevented Emma--\r\n"But," she stammered, with a strange smile, "I am not sure--"\r\n"Well, you must think it over. We\'ll see. Night brings counsel."\r\nThen to Leon, who was walking along with them, "Now that you are\r\nin our part of the world, I hope you\'ll come and ask us for some\r\ndinner now and then."\r\nThe clerk declared he would not fail to do so, being obliged,\r\nmoreover, to go to Yonville on some business for his office. And\r\nthey parted before the Saint-Herbland Passage just as the clock\r\nin the cathedral struck half-past eleven.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Part III\r\nChapter One\r\nMonsieur Leon, while studying law, had gone pretty often to the\r\ndancing-rooms, where he was even a great success amongst the\r\ngrisettes, who thought he had a distinguished air. He was the\r\nbest-mannered of the students; he wore his hair neither too long\r\nnor too short, didn\'t spend all his quarter\'s money on the first\r\nday of the month, and kept on good terms with his professors. As\r\nfor excesses, he had always abstained from them, as much from\r\ncowardice as from refinement.\r\nOften when he stayed in his room to read, or else when sitting of\r\nan evening under the lime-trees of the Luxembourg, he let his\r\nCode fall to the ground, and the memory of Emma came back to him.\r\nBut gradually this feeling grew weaker, and other desires\r\ngathered over it, although it still persisted through them all.\r\nFor Leon did not lose all hope; there was for him, as it were, a\r\nvague promise floating in the future, like a golden fruit\r\nsuspended from some fantastic tree.\r\nThen, seeing her again after three years of absence his passion\r\nreawakened. He must, he thought, at last make up his mind to\r\npossess her. Moreover, his timidity had worn off by contact with\r\nhis gay companions, and he returned to the provinces despising\r\neveryone who had not with varnished shoes trodden the asphalt of\r\nthe boulevards. By the side of a Parisienne in her laces, in the\r\ndrawing-room of some illustrious physician, a person driving his\r\ncarriage and wearing many orders, the poor clerk would no doubt\r\nhave trembled like a child; but here, at Rouen, on the harbour,\r\nwith the wife of this small doctor he felt at his ease, sure\r\nbeforehand he would shine. Self-possession depends on its\r\nenvironment. We don\'t speak on the first floor as on the fourth;\r\nand the wealthy woman seems to have, about her, to guard her\r\nvirtue, all her banknotes, like a cuirass in the lining of her\r\ncorset.\r\nOn leaving the Bovarys the night before, Leon had followed them\r\nthrough the streets at a distance; then having seen them stop at\r\nthe "Croix-Rouge," he turned on his heel, and spent the night\r\nmeditating a plan.\r\nSo the next day about five o\'clock he walked into the kitchen of\r\nthe inn, with a choking sensation in his throat, pale cheeks, and\r\nthat resolution of cowards that stops at nothing.\r\n"The gentleman isn\'t in," answered a servant.\r\nThis seemed to him a good omen. He went upstairs.\r\nShe was not disturbed at his approach; on the contrary, she\r\napologised for having neglected to tell him where they were\r\nstaying.\r\n"Oh, I divined it!" said Leon.\r\nHe pretended he had been guided towards her by chance, by,\r\ninstinct. She began to smile; and at once, to repair his folly,\r\nLeon told her that he had spent his morning in looking for her in\r\nall the hotels in the town one after the other.\r\n"So you have made up your mind to stay?" he added.\r\n"Yes," she said, "and I am wrong. One ought not to accustom\r\noneself to impossible pleasures when there are a thousand demands\r\nupon one."\r\n"Oh, I can imagine!"\r\n"Ah! no; for you, you are a man!"\r\nBut men too had had their trials, and the conversation went off\r\ninto certain philosophical reflections. Emma expatiated much on\r\nthe misery of earthly affections, and the eternal isolation in\r\nwhich the heart remains entombed.\r\nTo show off, or from a naive imitation of this melancholy which\r\ncalled forth his, the young man declared that he had been awfully\r\nbored during the whole course of his studies. The law irritated\r\nhim, other vocations attracted him, and his mother never ceased\r\nworrying him in every one of her letters. As they talked they\r\nexplained more and more fully the motives of their sadness,\r\nworking themselves up in their progressive confidence. But they\r\nsometimes stopped short of the complete exposition of their\r\nthought, and then sought to invent a phrase that might express it\r\nall the same. She did not confess her passion for another; he did\r\nnot say that he had forgotten her.\r\nPerhaps he no longer remembered his suppers with girls after\r\nmasked balls; and no doubt she did not recollect the rendezvous\r\nof old when she ran across the fields in the morning to her\r\nlover\'s house. The noises of the town hardly reached them, and\r\nthe room seemed small, as if on purpose to hem in their solitude\r\nmore closely. Emma, in a dimity dressing-gown, leant her head\r\nagainst the back of the old arm-chair; the yellow wall-paper\r\nformed, as it were, a golden background behind her, and her bare\r\nhead was mirrored in the glass with the white parting in the\r\nmiddle, and the tip of her ears peeping out from the folds of her\r\nhair.\r\n"But pardon me!" she said. "It is wrong of me. I weary you with\r\nmy eternal complaints."\r\n"No, never, never!"\r\n"If you knew," she went on, raising to the ceiling her beautiful\r\neyes, in which a tear was trembling, "all that I had dreamed!"\r\n"And I! Oh, I too have suffered! Often I went out; I went away. I\r\ndragged myself along the quays, seeking distraction amid the din\r\nof the crowd without being able to banish the heaviness that\r\nweighed upon me. In an engraver\'s shop on the boulevard there is\r\nan Italian print of one of the Muses. She is draped in a tunic,\r\nand she is looking at the moon, with forget-me-nots in her\r\nflowing hair. Something drove me there continually; I stayed\r\nthere hours together." Then in a trembling voice, "She resembled\r\nyou a little."\r\nMadame Bovary turned away her head that he might not see the\r\nirrepressible smile she felt rising to her lips.\r\n"Often," he went on, "I wrote you letters that I tore up."\r\nShe did not answer. He continued--\r\n"I sometimes fancied that some chance would bring you. I thought\r\nI recognised you at street-corners, and I ran after all the\r\ncarriages through whose windows I saw a shawl fluttering, a veil\r\nlike yours."\r\nShe seemed resolved to let him go on speaking without\r\ninterruption. Crossing her arms and bending down her face, she\r\nlooked at the rosettes on her slippers, and at intervals made\r\nlittle movements inside the satin of them with her toes.\r\nAt last she sighed.\r\n"But the most wretched thing, is it not--is to drag out, as I do,\r\na useless existence. If our pains were only of some use to\r\nsomeone, we should find consolation in the thought of the\r\nsacrifice."\r\nHe started off in praise of virtue, duty, and silent immolation,\r\nhaving himself an incredible longing for self-sacrifice that he\r\ncould not satisfy.\r\n"I should much like," she said, "to be a nurse at a hospital."\r\n"Alas! men have none of these holy missions, and I see nowhere\r\nany calling--unless perhaps that of a doctor."\r\nWith a slight shrug of her shoulders, Emma interrupted him to\r\nspeak of her illness, which had almost killed her. What a pity!\r\nShe should not be suffering now! Leon at once envied the calm of\r\nthe tomb, and one evening he had even made his will, asking to be\r\nburied in that beautiful rug with velvet stripes he had received\r\nfrom her. For this was how they would have wished to be, each\r\nsetting up an ideal to which they were now adapting their past\r\nlife. Besides, speech is a rolling-mill that always thins out the\r\nsentiment.\r\nBut at this invention of the rug she asked, "But why?"\r\n"Why?" He hesitated. "Because I loved you so!" And congratulating\r\nhimself at having surmounted the difficulty, Leon watched her\r\nface out of the corner of his eyes.\r\nIt was like the sky when a gust of wind drives the clouds across.\r\nThe mass of sad thoughts that darkened them seemed to be lifted\r\nfrom her blue eyes; her whole face shone. He waited. At last she\r\nreplied--\r\n"I always suspected it."\r\nThen they went over all the trifling events of that far-off\r\nexistence, whose joys and sorrows they had just summed up in one\r\nword. They recalled the arbour with clematis, the dresses she had\r\nworn, the furniture of her room, the whole of her house.\r\n"And our poor cactuses, where are they?"\r\n"The cold killed them this winter."\r\n"Ah! how I have thought of them, do you know? I often saw them\r\nagain as of yore, when on the summer mornings the sun beat down\r\nupon your blinds, and I saw your two bare arms passing out\r\namongst the flowers."\r\n"Poor friend!" she said, holding out her hand to him.\r\nLeon swiftly pressed his lips to it. Then, when he had taken a\r\ndeep breath--\r\n"At that time you were to me I know not what incomprehensible\r\nforce that took captive my life. Once, for instance, I went to\r\nsee you; but you, no doubt, do not remember it."\r\n"I do," she said; "go on."\r\n"You were downstairs in the ante-room, ready to go out, standing\r\non the last stair; you were wearing a bonnet with small blue\r\nflowers; and without any invitation from you, in spite of myself,\r\nI went with you. Every moment, however, I grew more and more\r\nconscious of my folly, and I went on walking by you, not daring\r\nto follow you completely, and unwilling to leave you. When you\r\nwent into a shop, I waited in the street, and I watched you\r\nthrough the window taking off your gloves and counting the change\r\non the counter. Then you rang at Madame Tuvache\'s; you were let\r\nin, and I stood like an idiot in front of the great heavy door\r\nthat had closed after you."\r\nMadame Bovary, as she listened to him, wondered that she was so\r\nold. All these things reappearing before her seemed to widen out\r\nher life; it was like some sentimental immensity to which she\r\nreturned; and from time to time she said in a low voice, her eyes\r\nhalf closed--\r\n"Yes, it is true--true--true!"\r\nThey heard eight strike on the different clocks of the\r\nBeauvoisine quarter, which is full of schools, churches, and\r\nlarge empty hotels. They no longer spoke, but they felt as they\r\nlooked upon each other a buzzing in their heads, as if something\r\nsonorous had escaped from the fixed eyes of each of them. They\r\nwere hand in hand now, and the past, the future, reminiscences\r\nand dreams, all were confounded in the sweetness of this ecstasy.\r\nNight was darkening over the walls, on which still shone, half\r\nhidden in the shade, the coarse colours of four bills\r\nrepresenting four scenes from the "Tour de Nesle," with a motto\r\nin Spanish and French at the bottom. Through the sash-window a\r\npatch of dark sky was seen between the pointed roofs.\r\nShe rose to light two wax-candles on the drawers, then she sat\r\ndown again.\r\n"Well!" said Leon.\r\n"Well!" she replied.\r\nHe was thinking how to resume the interrupted conversation, when\r\nshe said to him--\r\n"How is it that no one until now has ever expressed such\r\nsentiments to me?"\r\nThe clerk said that ideal natures were difficult to understand.\r\nHe from the first moment had loved her, and he despaired when he\r\nthought of the happiness that would have been theirs, if thanks\r\nto fortune, meeting her earlier, they had been indissolubly bound\r\nto one another.\r\n"I have sometimes thought of it," she went on.\r\n"What a dream!" murmured Leon. And fingering gently the blue\r\nbinding of her long white sash, he added, "And who prevents us\r\nfrom beginning now?"\r\n"No, my friend," she replied; "I am too old; you are too young.\r\nForget me! Others will love you; you will love them."\r\n"Not as you!" he cried.\r\n"What a child you are! Come, let us be sensible. I wish it."\r\nShe showed him the impossibility of their love, and that they\r\nmust remain, as formerly, on the simple terms of a fraternal\r\nfriendship.\r\nWas she speaking thus seriously? No doubt Emma did not herself\r\nknow, quite absorbed as she was by the charm of the seduction,\r\nand the necessity of defending herself from it; and contemplating\r\nthe young man with a moved look, she gently repulsed the timid\r\ncaresses that his trembling hands attempted.\r\n"Ah! forgive me!" he cried, drawing back.\r\nEmma was seized with a vague fear at this shyness, more dangerous\r\nto her than the boldness of Rodolphe when he advanced to her\r\nopen-armed. No man had ever seemed to her so beautiful. An\r\nexquisite candour emanated from his being. He lowered his long\r\nfine eyelashes, that curled upwards. His cheek, with the soft\r\nskin reddened, she thought, with desire of her person, and Emma\r\nfelt an invincible longing to press her lips to it. Then, leaning\r\ntowards the clock as if to see the time--\r\n"Ah! how late it is!" she said; "how we do chatter!"\r\nHe understood the hint and took up his hat.\r\n"It has even made me forget the theatre. And poor Bovary has left\r\nme here especially for that. Monsieur Lormeaux, of the Rue\r\nGrand-Pont, was to take me and his wife."\r\nAnd the opportunity was lost, as she was to leave the next day.\r\n"Really!" said Leon.\r\n"Yes."\r\n"But I must see you again," he went on. "I wanted to tell you--"\r\n"What?"\r\n"Something--important--serious. Oh, no! Besides, you will not go;\r\nit is impossible. If you should--listen to me. Then you have not\r\nunderstood me; you have not guessed--"\r\n"Yet you speak plainly," said Emma.\r\n"Ah! you can jest. Enough! enough! Oh, for pity\'s sake, let me\r\nsee you once--only once!"\r\n"Well--"She stopped; then, as if thinking better of it, "Oh, not\r\nhere!"\r\n"Where you will."\r\n"Will you--"She seemed to reflect; then abruptly, "To-morrow at\r\neleven o\'clock in the cathedral."\r\n"I shall be there," he cried, seizing her hands, which she\r\ndisengaged.\r\nAnd as they were both standing up, he behind her, and Emma with\r\nher head bent, he stooped over her and pressed long kisses on her\r\nneck.\r\n"You are mad! Ah! you are mad!" she said, with sounding little\r\nlaughs, while the kisses multiplied.\r\nThen bending his head over her shoulder, he seemed to beg the\r\nconsent of her eyes. They fell upon him full of an icy dignity.\r\nLeon stepped back to go out. He stopped on the threshold; then he\r\nwhispered with a trembling voice, "Tomorrow!"\r\nShe answered with a nod, and disappeared like a bird into the\r\nnext room.\r\nIn the evening Emma wrote the clerk an interminable letter, in\r\nwhich she cancelled the rendezvous; all was over; they must not,\r\nfor the sake of their happiness, meet again. But when the letter\r\nwas finished, as she did not know Leon\'s address, she was\r\npuzzled.\r\n"I\'ll give it to him myself," she said; "he will come."\r\nThe next morning, at the open window, and humming on his balcony,\r\nLeon himself varnished his pumps with several coatings. He put on\r\nwhite trousers, fine socks, a green coat, emptied all the scent\r\nhe had into his handkerchief, then having had his hair curled, he\r\nuncurled it again, in order to give it a more natural elegance.\r\n"It is still too early," he thought, looking at the hairdresser\'s\r\ncuckoo-clock, that pointed to the hour of nine. He read an old\r\nfashion journal, went out, smoked a cigar, walked up three\r\nstreets, thought it was time, and went slowly towards the porch\r\nof Notre Dame.\r\nIt was a beautiful summer morning. Silver plate sparkled in the\r\njeweller\'s windows, and the light falling obliquely on the\r\ncathedral made mirrors of the corners of the grey stones; a flock\r\nof birds fluttered in the grey sky round the trefoil\r\nbell-turrets; the square, resounding with cries, was fragrant\r\nwith the flowers that bordered its pavement, roses, jasmines,\r\npinks, narcissi, and tube-roses, unevenly spaced out between\r\nmoist grasses, catmint, and chickweed for the birds; the\r\nfountains gurgled in the centre, and under large umbrellas,\r\namidst melons, piled up in heaps, flower-women, bare-headed, were\r\ntwisting paper round bunches of violets.\r\nThe young man took one. It was the first time that he had bought\r\nflowers for a woman, and his breast, as he smelt them, swelled\r\nwith pride, as if this homage that he meant for another had\r\nrecoiled upon himself.\r\nBut he was afraid of being seen; he resolutely entered the\r\nchurch. The beadle, who was just then standing on the threshold\r\nin the middle of the left doorway, under the "Dancing Marianne,"\r\nwith feather cap, and rapier dangling against his calves, came\r\nin, more majestic than a cardinal, and as shining as a saint on a\r\nholy pyx.\r\nHe came towards Leon, and, with that smile of wheedling benignity\r\nassumed by ecclesiastics when they question children--\r\n"The gentleman, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? The\r\ngentleman would like to see the curiosities of the church?"\r\n"No!" said the other.\r\nAnd he first went round the lower aisles. Then he went out to\r\nlook at the Place. Emma was not coming yet. He went up again to\r\nthe choir.\r\nThe nave was reflected in the full fonts with the beginning of\r\nthe arches and some portions of the glass windows. But the\r\nreflections of the paintings, broken by the marble rim, were\r\ncontinued farther on upon the flag-stones, like a many-coloured\r\ncarpet. The broad daylight from without streamed into the church\r\nin three enormous rays from the three opened portals. From time\r\nto time at the upper end a sacristan passed, making the oblique\r\ngenuflexion of devout persons in a hurry. The crystal lustres\r\nhung motionless. In the choir a silver lamp was burning, and from\r\nthe side chapels and dark places of the church sometimes rose\r\nsounds like sighs, with the clang of a closing grating, its echo\r\nreverberating under the lofty vault.\r\nLeon with solemn steps walked along by the walls. Life had never\r\nseemed so good to him. She would come directly, charming,\r\nagitated, looking back at the glances that followed her, and with\r\nher flounced dress, her gold eyeglass, her thin shoes, with all\r\nsorts of elegant trifles that he had never enjoyed, and with the\r\nineffable seduction of yielding virtue. The church like a huge\r\nboudoir spread around her; the arches bent down to gather in the\r\nshade the confession of her love; the windows shone resplendent\r\nto illumine her face, and the censers would burn that she might\r\nappear like an angel amid the fumes of the sweet-smelling odours.\r\nBut she did not come. He sat down on a chair, and his eyes fell\r\nupon a blue stained window representing boatmen carrying baskets.\r\nHe looked at it long, attentively, and he counted the scales of\r\nthe fishes and the button-holes of the doublets, while his\r\nthoughts wandered off towards Emma.\r\nThe beadle, standing aloof, was inwardly angry at this individual\r\nwho took the liberty of admiring the cathedral by himself. He\r\nseemed to him to be conducting himself in a monstrous fashion, to\r\nbe robbing him in a sort, and almost committing sacrilege.\r\nBut a rustle of silk on the flags, the tip of a bonnet, a lined\r\ncloak--it was she! Leon rose and ran to meet her.\r\nEmma was pale. She walked fast.\r\n"Read!" she said, holding out a paper to him. "Oh, no!"\r\nAnd she abruptly withdrew her hand to enter the chapel of the\r\nVirgin, where, kneeling on a chair, she began to pray.\r\nThe young man was irritated at this bigot fancy; then he\r\nnevertheless experienced a certain charm in seeing her, in the\r\nmiddle of a rendezvous, thus lost in her devotions, like an\r\nAndalusian marchioness; then he grew bored, for she seemed never\r\ncoming to an end.\r\nEmma prayed, or rather strove to pray, hoping that some sudden\r\nresolution might descend to her from heaven; and to draw down\r\ndivine aid she filled full her eyes with the splendours of the\r\ntabernacle. She breathed in the perfumes of the full-blown\r\nflowers in the large vases, and listened to the stillness of the\r\nchurch, that only heightened the tumult of her heart.\r\nShe rose, and they were about to leave, when the beadle came\r\nforward, hurriedly saying--\r\n"Madame, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? Madame would\r\nlike to see the curiosities of the church?"\r\n"Oh, no!" cried the clerk.\r\n"Why not?" said she. For she clung with her expiring virtue to\r\nthe Virgin, the sculptures, the tombs--anything.\r\nThen, in order to proceed "by rule," the beadle conducted them\r\nright to the entrance near the square, where, pointing out with\r\nhis cane a large circle of block-stones without inscription or\r\ncarving--\r\n"This," he said majestically, "is the circumference of the\r\nbeautiful bell of Ambroise. It weighed forty thousand pounds.\r\nThere was not its equal in all Europe. The workman who cast it\r\ndied of the joy--"\r\n"Let us go on," said Leon.\r\nThe old fellow started off again; then, having got back to the\r\nchapel of the Virgin, he stretched forth his arm with an\r\nall-embracing gesture of demonstration, and, prouder than a\r\ncountry squire showing you his espaliers, went on--\r\n"This simple stone covers Pierre de Breze, lord of Varenne and of\r\nBrissac, grand marshal of Poitou, and governor of Normandy, who\r\ndied at the battle of Montlhery on the 16th of July, 1465."\r\nLeon bit his lips, fuming.\r\n"And on the right, this gentleman all encased in iron, on the\r\nprancing horse, is his grandson, Louis de Breze, lord of Breval\r\nand of Montchauvet, Count de Maulevrier, Baron de Mauny,\r\nchamberlain to the king, Knight of the Order, and also governor\r\nof Normandy; died on the 23rd of July, 1531--a Sunday, as the\r\ninscription specifies; and below, this figure, about to descend\r\ninto the tomb, portrays the same person. It is not possible, is\r\nit, to see a more perfect representation of annihilation?"\r\nMadame Bovary put up her eyeglasses. Leon, motionless, looked at\r\nher, no longer even attempting to speak a single word, to make a\r\ngesture, so discouraged was he at this two-fold obstinacy of\r\ngossip and indifference.\r\nThe everlasting guide went on--\r\n"Near him, this kneeling woman who weeps is his spouse, Diane de\r\nPoitiers, Countess de Breze, Duchess de Valentinois, born in\r\n1499, died in 1566, and to the left, the one with the child is\r\nthe Holy Virgin. Now turn to this side; here are the tombs of the\r\nAmbroise. They were both cardinals and archbishops of Rouen. That\r\none was minister under Louis XII. He did a great deal for the\r\ncathedral. In his will he left thirty thousand gold crowns for\r\nthe poor."\r\nAnd without stopping, still talking, he pushed them into a chapel\r\nfull of balustrades, some put away, and disclosed a kind of block\r\nthat certainly might once have been an ill-made statue.\r\n"Truly," he said with a groan, "it adorned the tomb of Richard\r\nCoeur de Lion, King of England and Duke of Normandy. It was the\r\nCalvinists, sir, who reduced it to this condition. They had\r\nburied it for spite in the earth, under the episcopal seat of\r\nMonsignor. See! this is the door by which Monsignor passes to his\r\nhouse. Let us pass on quickly to see the gargoyle windows."\r\nBut Leon hastily took some silver from his pocket and seized\r\nEmma\'s arm. The beadle stood dumfounded, not able to understand\r\nthis untimely munificence when there were still so many things\r\nfor the stranger to see. So calling him back, he cried--\r\n"Sir! sir! The steeple! the steeple!"\r\n"No, thank you!" said Leon.\r\n"You are wrong, sir! It is four hundred and forty feet high, nine\r\nless than the great pyramid of Egypt. It is all cast; it--"\r\nLeon was fleeing, for it seemed to him that his love, that for\r\nnearly two hours now had become petrified in the church like the\r\nstones, would vanish like a vapour through that sort of truncated\r\nfunnel, of oblong cage, of open chimney that rises so grotesquely\r\nfrom the cathedral like the extravagant attempt of some fantastic\r\nbrazier.\r\n"But where are we going?" she said.\r\nMaking no answer, he walked on with a rapid step; and Madame\r\nBovary was already, dipping her finger in the holy water when\r\nbehind them they heard a panting breath interrupted by the\r\nregular sound of a cane. Leon turned back.\r\n"Sir!"\r\n"What is it?"\r\nAnd he recognised the beadle, holding under his arms and\r\nbalancing against his stomach some twenty large sewn volumes.\r\nThey were works "which treated of the cathedral."\r\n"Idiot!" growled Leon, rushing out of the church.\r\nA lad was playing about the close.\r\n"Go and get me a cab!"\r\nThe child bounded off like a ball by the Rue Quatre-Vents; then\r\nthey were alone a few minutes, face to face, and a little\r\nembarrassed.\r\n"Ah! Leon! Really--I don\'t know--if I ought," she whispered. Then\r\nwith a more serious air, "Do you know, it is very improper--"\r\n"How so?" replied the clerk. "It is done at Paris."\r\nAnd that, as an irresistible argument, decided her.\r\nStill the cab did not come. Leon was afraid she might go back\r\ninto the church. At last the cab appeared.\r\n"At all events, go out by the north porch," cried the beadle, who\r\nwas left alone on the threshold, "so as to see the Resurrection,\r\nthe Last Judgment, Paradise, King David, and the Condemned in\r\nHell-flames."\r\n"Where to, sir?" asked the coachman.\r\n"Where you like," said Leon, forcing Emma into the cab.\r\nAnd the lumbering machine set out. It went down the Rue\r\nGrand-Pont, crossed the Place des Arts, the Quai Napoleon, the\r\nPont Neuf, and stopped short before the statue of Pierre\r\nCorneille.\r\n"Go on," cried a voice that came from within.\r\nThe cab went on again, and as soon as it reached the Carrefour\r\nLafayette, set off down-hill, and entered the station at a\r\ngallop.\r\n"No, straight on!" cried the same voice.\r\nThe cab came out by the gate, and soon having reached the Cours,\r\ntrotted quietly beneath the elm-trees. The coachman wiped his\r\nbrow, put his leather hat between his knees, and drove his\r\ncarriage beyond the side alley by the meadow to the margin of the\r\nwaters.\r\nIt went along by the river, along the towing-path paved with\r\nsharp pebbles, and for a long while in the direction of Oyssel,\r\nbeyond the isles.\r\nBut suddenly it turned with a dash across Quatremares,\r\nSotteville, La Grande-Chaussee, the Rue d\'Elbeuf, and made its\r\nthird halt in front of the Jardin des Plantes.\r\n"Get on, will you?" cried the voice more furiously.\r\nAnd at once resuming its course, it passed by Saint-Sever, by the\r\nQuai\'des Curandiers, the Quai aux Meules, once more over the\r\nbridge, by the Place du Champ de Mars, and behind the hospital\r\ngardens, where old men in black coats were walking in the sun\r\nalong the terrace all green with ivy. It went up the Boulevard\r\nBouvreuil, along the Boulevard Cauchoise, then the whole of\r\nMont-Riboudet to the Deville hills.\r\nIt came back; and then, without any fixed plan or direction,\r\nwandered about at hazard. The cab was seen at Saint-Pol, at\r\nLescure, at Mont Gargan, at La Rougue-Marc and Place du\r\nGaillardbois; in the Rue Maladrerie, Rue Dinanderie, before\r\nSaint-Romain, Saint-Vivien, Saint-Maclou, Saint-Nicaise--in front\r\nof the Customs, at the "Vieille Tour," the "Trois Pipes," and the\r\nMonumental Cemetery. From time to time the coachman, on his box\r\ncast despairing eyes at the public-houses. He could not\r\nunderstand what furious desire for locomotion urged these\r\nindividuals never to wish to stop. He tried to now and then, and\r\nat once exclamations of anger burst forth behind him. Then he\r\nlashed his perspiring jades afresh, but indifferent to their\r\njolting, running up against things here and there, not caring if\r\nhe did, demoralised, and almost weeping with thirst, fatigue, and\r\ndepression.\r\nAnd on the harbour, in the midst of the drays and casks, and in\r\nthe streets, at the corners, the good folk opened large\r\nwonder-stricken eyes at this sight, so extraordinary in the\r\nprovinces, a cab with blinds drawn, and which appeared thus\r\nconstantly shut more closely than a tomb, and tossing about like\r\na vessel.\r\nOnce in the middle of the day, in the open country, just as the\r\nsun beat most fiercely against the old plated lanterns, a bared\r\nhand passed beneath the small blinds of yellow canvas, and threw\r\nout some scraps of paper that scattered in the wind, and farther\r\noff lighted like white butterflies on a field of red clover all\r\nin bloom.\r\nAt about six o\'clock the carriage stopped in a back street of the\r\nBeauvoisine Quarter, and a woman got out, who walked with her\r\nveil down, and without turning her head.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Two\r\nOn reaching the inn, Madame Bovary was surprised not to see the\r\ndiligence. Hivert, who had waited for her fifty-three minutes,\r\nhad at last started.\r\nYet nothing forced her to go; but she had given her word that she\r\nwould return that same evening. Moreover, Charles expected her,\r\nand in her heart she felt already that cowardly docility that is\r\nfor some women at once the chastisement and atonement of\r\nadultery.\r\nShe packed her box quickly, paid her bill, took a cab in the\r\nyard, hurrying on the driver, urging him on, every moment\r\ninquiring about the time and the miles traversed. He succeeded in\r\ncatching up the "Hirondelle" as it neared the first houses of\r\nQuincampoix.\r\nHardly was she seated in her corner than she closed her eyes, and\r\nopened them at the foot of the hill, when from afar she\r\nrecognised Felicite, who was on the lookout in front of the\r\nfarrier\'s shop. Hivert pulled in his horses and, the servant,\r\nclimbing up to the window, said mysteriously--\r\n"Madame, you must go at once to Monsieur Homais. It\'s for\r\nsomething important."\r\nThe village was silent as usual. At the corner of the streets\r\nwere small pink heaps that smoked in the air, for this was the\r\ntime for jam-making, and everyone at Yonville prepared his supply\r\non the same day. But in front of the chemist\'s shop one might\r\nadmire a far larger heap, and that surpassed the others with the\r\nsuperiority that a laboratory must have over ordinary stores, a\r\ngeneral need over individual fancy.\r\nShe went in. The large arm-chair was upset, and even the "Fanal\r\nde Rouen" lay on the ground, outspread between two pestles. She\r\npushed open the lobby door, and in the middle of the kitchen,\r\namid brown jars full of picked currants, of powdered sugar and\r\nlump sugar, of the scales on the table, and of the pans on the\r\nfire, she saw all the Homais, small and large, with aprons\r\nreaching to their chins, and with forks in their hands. Justin\r\nwas standing up with bowed head, and the chemist was screaming--\r\n"Who told you to go and fetch it in the Capharnaum."\r\n"What is it? What is the matter?"\r\n"What is it?" replied the druggist. "We are making preserves;\r\nthey are simmering; but they were about to boil over, because\r\nthere is too much juice, and I ordered another pan. Then he, from\r\nindolence, from laziness, went and took, hanging on its nail in\r\nmy laboratory, the key of the Capharnaum."\r\nIt was thus the druggist called a small room under the leads,\r\nfull of the utensils and the goods of his trade. He often spent\r\nlong hours there alone, labelling, decanting, and doing up again;\r\nand he looked upon it not as a simple store, but as a veritable\r\nsanctuary, whence there afterwards issued, elaborated by his\r\nhands, all sorts of pills, boluses, infusions, lotions, and\r\npotions, that would bear far and wide his celebrity. No one in\r\nthe world set foot there, and he respected it so, that he swept\r\nit himself. Finally, if the pharmacy, open to all comers, was the\r\nspot where he displayed his pride, the Capharnaum was the refuge\r\nwhere, egoistically concentrating himself, Homais delighted in\r\nthe exercise of his predilections, so that Justin\'s\r\nthoughtlessness seemed to him a monstrous piece of irreverence,\r\nand, redder than the currants, he repeated--\r\n"Yes, from the Capharnaum! The key that locks up the acids and\r\ncaustic alkalies! To go and get a spare pan! a pan with a lid!\r\nand that I shall perhaps never use! Everything is of importance\r\nin the delicate operations of our art! But, devil take it! one\r\nmust make distinctions, and not employ for almost domestic\r\npurposes that which is meant for pharmaceutical! It is as if one\r\nwere to carve a fowl with a scalpel; as if a magistrate--"\r\n"Now be calm," said Madame Homais.\r\nAnd Athalie, pulling at his coat, cried "Papa! papa!"\r\n"No, let me alone," went on the druggist "let me alone, hang it!\r\nMy word! One might as well set up for a grocer. That\'s it! go it!\r\nrespect nothing! break, smash, let loose the leeches, burn the\r\nmallow-paste, pickle the gherkins in the window jars, tear up the\r\nbandages!"\r\n"I thought you had--"said Emma.\r\n"Presently! Do you know to what you exposed yourself? Didn\'t you\r\nsee anything in the corner, on the left, on the third shelf?\r\nSpeak, answer, articulate something."\r\n"I--don\'t--know," stammered the young fellow.\r\n"Ah! you don\'t know! Well, then, I do know! You saw a bottle of\r\nblue glass, sealed with yellow wax, that contains a white powder,\r\non which I have even written \'Dangerous!\' And do you know what is\r\nin it? Arsenic! And you go and touch it! You take a pan that was\r\nnext to it!"\r\n"Next to it!" cried Madame Hoinais, clasping her hands. "Arsenic!\r\nYou might have poisoned us all."\r\nAnd the children began howling as if they already had frightful\r\npains in their entrails.\r\n"Or poison a patient!" continued the druggist. "Do you want to\r\nsee me in the prisoner\'s dock with criminals, in a court of\r\njustice? To see me dragged to the scaffold? Don\'t you know what\r\ncare I take in managing things, although I am so thoroughly used\r\nto it? Often I am horrified myself when I think of my\r\nresponsibility; for the Government persecutes us, and the absurd\r\nlegislation that rules us is a veritable Damocles\' sword over our\r\nheads."\r\nEmma no longer dreamed of asking what they wanted her for, and\r\nthe druggist went on in breathless phrases--\r\n"That is your return for all the kindness we have shown you! That\r\nis how you recompense me for the really paternal care that I\r\nlavish on you! For without me where would you be? What would you\r\nbe doing? Who provides you with food, education, clothes, and all\r\nthe means of figuring one day with honour in the ranks of\r\nsociety?

I\r\nshould certainly have done better to have left you to rot in your\r\npoverty and the dirt in which you were born. Oh, you\'ll never be\r\nfit for anything but to herd animals with horns! You have no\r\naptitude for science!

It is a misfortune!"\r\nShe could not finish, the druggist was thundering--"Empty it!\r\nClean it! Take it back! Be quick!"\r\nAnd seizing Justin by the collar of his blouse, he shook a book\r\nout of his pocket. The lad stooped, but Homais was the quicker,\r\nand, having picked up the volume, contemplated it with staring\r\neyes and open mouth.\r\n"CONJUGAL--LOVE!" he said, slowly separating the two words. "Ah!\r\nvery good! very good! very pretty! And illustrations! Oh, this is\r\ntoo much!"\r\nMadame Homais came forward.\r\n"No, do not touch it!"\r\nThe children wanted to look at the pictures.\r\n"Leave the room," he said imperiously; and they went out.\r\nFirst he walked up and down with the open volume in his hand,\r\nrolling his eyes, choking, tumid, apoplectic. Then he came\r\nstraight to his pupil, and, planting himself in front of him with\r\ncrossed arms--\r\n"Have you every vice, then, little wretch? Take care! you are on\r\na downward path. Did not you reflect that this infamous book\r\nmight fall in the hands of my children, kindle a spark in their\r\nminds, tarnish the purity of Athalie, corrupt Napoleon. He is\r\nalready formed like a man. Are you quite sure, anyhow, that they\r\nhave not read it? Can you certify to me--"\r\n"But really, sir," said Emma, "you wished to tell me--"\r\n"Ah, yes! madame. Your father-in-law is dead."\r\nIn fact, Monsieur Bovary senior had expired the evening before\r\nsuddenly from an attack of apoplexy as he got up from table, and\r\nby way of greater precaution, on account of Emma\'s sensibility,\r\nCharles had begged Homais to break the horrible news to her\r\ngradually. Homais had thought over his speech; he had rounded,\r\npolished it, made it rhythmical; it was a masterpiece of prudence\r\nand transitions, of subtle turns and delicacy; but anger had got\r\nthe better of rhetoric.\r\nEmma, giving up all chance of hearing any details, left the\r\npharmacy; for Monsieur Homais had taken up the thread of his\r\nvituperations. However, he was growing calmer, and was now\r\ngrumbling in a paternal tone whilst he fanned himself with his\r\nskull-cap.\r\n"It is not that I entirely disapprove of the work. Its author was\r\na doctor! There are certain scientific points in it that it is\r\nnot ill a man should know, and I would even venture to say that a\r\nman must know. But later--later! At any rate, not till you are\r\nman yourself and your temperament is formed."\r\nWhen Emma knocked at the door. Charles, who was waiting for her,\r\ncame forward with open arms and said to her with tears in his\r\nvoice--\r\n"Ah! my dear!"\r\nAnd he bent over her gently to kiss her. But at the contact of\r\nhis lips the memory of the other seized her, and she passed her\r\nhand over her face shuddering.\r\nBut she made answer, "Yes, I know, I know!"\r\nHe showed her the letter in which his mother told the event\r\nwithout any sentimental hypocrisy. She only regretted her husband\r\nhad not received the consolations of religion, as he had died at\r\nDaudeville, in the street, at the door of a cafe after a\r\npatriotic dinner with some ex-officers.\r\nEmma gave him back the letter; then at dinner, for appearance\'s\r\nsake, she affected a certain repugnance. But as he urged her to\r\ntry, she resolutely began eating, while Charles opposite her sat\r\nmotionless in a dejected attitude.\r\nNow and then he raised his head and gave her a long look full of\r\ndistress. Once he sighed, "I should have liked to see him again!"\r\nShe was silent. At last, understanding that she must say\r\nsomething, "How old was your father?" she asked.\r\n"Fifty-eight."\r\n"Ah!"\r\nAnd that was all.\r\nA quarter of an hour after he added, "My poor mother! what will\r\nbecome of her now?"\r\nShe made a gesture that signified she did not know. Seeing her so\r\ntaciturn, Charles imagined her much affected, and forced himself\r\nto say nothing, not to reawaken this sorrow which moved him. And,\r\nshaking off his own--\r\n"Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?" he asked.\r\n"Yes."\r\nWhen the cloth was removed, Bovary did not rise, nor did Emma;\r\nand as she looked at him, the monotony of the spectacle drove\r\nlittle by little all pity from her heart. He seemed to her\r\npaltry, weak, a cipher--in a word, a poor thing in every way. How\r\nto get rid of him? What an interminable evening! Something\r\nstupefying like the fumes of opium seized her.\r\nThey heard in the passage the sharp noise of a wooden leg on the\r\nboards. It was Hippolyte bringing back Emma\'s luggage. In order\r\nto put it down he described painfully a quarter of a circle with\r\nhis stump.\r\n"He doesn\'t even remember any more about it," she thought,\r\nlooking at the poor devil, whose coarse red hair was wet with\r\nperspiration.\r\nBovary was searching at the bottom of his purse for a centime,\r\nand without appearing to understand all there was of humiliation\r\nfor him in the mere presence of this man, who stood there like a\r\npersonified reproach to his incurable incapacity.\r\n"Hallo! you\'ve a pretty bouquet," he said, noticing Leon\'s\r\nviolets on the chimney.\r\n"Yes," she replied indifferently; "it\'s a bouquet I bought just\r\nnow from a beggar."\r\nCharles picked up the flowers, and freshening his eyes, red with\r\ntears, against them, smelt them delicately.\r\nShe took them quickly from his hand and put them in a glass of\r\nwater.\r\nThe next day Madame Bovary senior arrived. She and her son wept\r\nmuch. Emma, on the pretext of giving orders, disappeared. The\r\nfollowing day they had a talk over the mourning. They went and\r\nsat down with their workboxes by the waterside under the arbour.\r\nCharles was thinking of his father, and was surprised to feel so\r\nmuch affection for this man, whom till then he had thought he\r\ncared little about. Madame Bovary senior was thinking of her\r\nhusband. The worst days of the past seemed enviable to her. All\r\nwas forgotten beneath the instinctive regret of such a long\r\nhabit, and from time to time whilst she sewed, a big tear rolled\r\nalong her nose and hung suspended there a moment. Emma was\r\nthinking that it was scarcely forty-eight hours since they had\r\nbeen together, far from the world, all in a frenzy of joy, and\r\nnot having eyes enough to gaze upon each other. She tried to\r\nrecall the slightest details of that past day. But the presence\r\nof her husband and mother-in-law worried her. She would have\r\nliked to hear nothing, to see nothing, so as not to disturb the\r\nmeditation on her love, that, do what she would, became lost in\r\nexternal sensations.\r\nShe was unpicking the lining of a dress, and the strips were\r\nscattered around her. Madame Bovary senior was plying her scissor\r\nwithout looking up, and Charles, in his list slippers and his old\r\nbrown surtout that he used as a dressing-gown, sat with both\r\nhands in his pockets, and did not speak either; near them Berthe,\r\nin a little white pinafore, was raking sand in the walks with her\r\nspade. Suddenly she saw Monsieur Lheureux, the linendraper, come\r\nin through the gate.\r\nHe came to offer his services "under the sad circumstances." Emma\r\nanswered that she thought she could do without. The shopkeeper\r\nwas not to be beaten.\r\n"I beg your pardon," he said, "but I should like to have a\r\nprivate talk with you." Then in a low voice, "It\'s about that\r\naffair--you know."\r\nCharles crimsoned to his ears. "Oh, yes! certainly." And in his\r\nconfusion, turning to his wife, "Couldn\'t you, my darling?"\r\nShe seemed to understand him, for she rose; and Charles said to\r\nhis mother, "It is nothing particular. No doubt, some household\r\ntrifle." He did not want her to know the story of the bill,\r\nfearing her reproaches.\r\nAs soon as they were alone, Monsieur Lheureux in sufficiently\r\nclear terms began to congratulate Emma on the inheritance, then\r\nto talk of indifferent matters, of the espaliers, of the harvest,\r\nand of his own health, which was always so-so, always having ups\r\nand downs. In fact, he had to work devilish hard, although he\r\ndidn\'t make enough, in spite of all people said, to find butter\r\nfor his bread.\r\nEmma let him talk on. She had bored herself so prodigiously the\r\nlast two days.\r\n"And so you\'re quite well again?" he went on. "Ma foi! I saw your\r\nhusband in a sad state. He\'s a good fellow, though we did have a\r\nlittle misunderstanding."\r\nShe asked what misunderstanding, for Charles had said nothing of\r\nthe dispute about the goods supplied to her.\r\n"Why, you know well enough," cried Lheureux. "It was about your\r\nlittle fancies--the travelling trunks."\r\nHe had drawn his hat over his eyes, and, with his hands behind\r\nhis back, smiling and whistling, he looked straight at her in an\r\nunbearable manner. Did he suspect anything?\r\nShe was lost in all kinds of apprehensions. At last, however, he\r\nwent on--\r\n"We made it up, all the same, and I\'ve come again to propose\r\nanother arrangement."\r\nThis was to renew the bill Bovary had signed. The doctor, of\r\ncourse, would do as he pleased; he was not to trouble himself,\r\nespecially just now, when he would have a lot of worry. "And he\r\nwould do better to give it over to someone else--to you, for\r\nexample. With a power of attorney it could be easily managed, and\r\nthen we (you and I) would have our little business transactions\r\ntogether."\r\nShe did not understand. He was silent. Then, passing to his\r\ntrade, Lheureux declared that madame must require something. He\r\nwould send her a black barege, twelve yards, just enough to make\r\na gown.\r\n"The one you\'ve on is good enough for the house, but you want\r\nanother for calls. I saw that the very moment that I came in.\r\nI\'ve the eye of an American!"\r\nHe did not send the stuff; he brought it. Then he came again to\r\nmeasure it; he came again on other pretexts, always trying to\r\nmake himself agreeable, useful, "enfeoffing himself," as Homais\r\nwould have said, and always dropping some hint to Emma about the\r\npower of attorney. He never mentioned the bill; she did not think\r\nof it. Charles, at the beginning of her convalescence, had\r\ncertainly said something about it to her, but so many emotions\r\nhad passed through her head that she no longer remembered it.\r\nBesides, she took care not to talk of any money questions. Madame\r\nBovary seemed surprised at this, and attributed the change in her\r\nways to the religious sentiments she had contracted during her\r\nillness.\r\nBut as soon as she was gone, Emma greatly astounded Bovary by her\r\npractical good sense. It would be necessary to make inquiries, to\r\nlook into mortgages, and see if there were any occasion for a\r\nsale by auction or a liquidation. She quoted technical terms\r\ncasually, pronounced the grand words of order, the future,\r\nforesight, and constantly exaggerated the difficulties of\r\nsettling his father\'s affairs so much, that at last one day she\r\nshowed him the rough draft of a power of attorney to manage and\r\nadminister his business, arrange all loans, sign and endorse all\r\nbills, pay all sums, etc. She had profited by Lheureux\'s lessons.\r\nCharles naively asked her where this paper came from.\r\n"Monsieur Guillaumin"; and with the utmost coolness she added, "I\r\ndon\'t trust him overmuch. Notaries have such a bad reputation.\r\nPerhaps we ought to consult--we only know--no one."\r\n"Unless Leon--" replied Charles, who was reflecting. But it was\r\ndifficult to explain matters by letter. Then she offered to make\r\nthe journey, but he thanked her. She insisted. It was quite a\r\ncontest of mutual consideration. At last she cried with affected\r\nwaywardness--\r\n"No, I will go!"\r\n"How good you are!" he said, kissing her forehead.\r\nThe next morning she set out in the "Hirondelle" to go to Rouen\r\nto consult Monsieur Leon, and she stayed there three days.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Three\r\nThey were three full, exquisite days--a true honeymoon. They were\r\nat the Hotel-de-Boulogne, on the harbour; and they lived there,\r\nwith drawn blinds and closed doors, with flowers on the floor,\r\nand iced syrups were brought them early in the morning.\r\nTowards evening they took a covered boat and went to dine on one\r\nof the islands. It was the time when one hears by the side of the\r\ndockyard the caulking-mallets sounding against the hull of\r\nvessels. The smoke of the tar rose up between the trees; there\r\nwere large fatty drops on the water, undulating in the purple\r\ncolour of the sun, like floating plaques of Florentine bronze.\r\nThey rowed down in the midst of moored boats, whose long oblique\r\ncables grazed lightly against the bottom of the boat. The din of\r\nthe town gradually grew distant; the rolling of carriages, the\r\ntumult of voices, the yelping of dogs on the decks of vessels.\r\nShe took off her bonnet, and they landed on their island.\r\nThey sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern, at whose\r\ndoor hung black nets. They ate fried smelts, cream and cherries.\r\nThey lay down upon the grass; they kissed behind the poplars; and\r\nthey would fain, like two Robinsons, have lived for ever in this\r\nlittle place, which seemed to them in their beatitude the most\r\nmagnificent on earth. It was not the first time that they had\r\nseen trees, a blue sky, meadows; that they had heard the water\r\nflowing and the wind blowing in the leaves; but, no doubt, they\r\nhad never admired all this, as if Nature had not existed before,\r\nor had only begun to be beautiful since the gratification of\r\ntheir desires.\r\nAt night they returned. The boat glided along the shores of the\r\nislands. They sat at the bottom, both hidden by the shade, in\r\nsilence. The square oars rang in the iron thwarts, and, in the\r\nstillness, seemed to mark time, like the beating of a metronome,\r\nwhile at the stern the rudder that trailed behind never ceased\r\nits gentle splash against the water.\r\nOnce the moon rose; they did not fail to make fine phrases,\r\nfinding the orb melancholy and full of poetry. She even began to\r\nsing--\r\n"One night, do you remember, we were sailing," etc.\r\nHer musical but weak voice died away along the waves, and the\r\nwinds carried off the trills that Leon heard pass like the\r\nflapping of wings about him.\r\nShe was opposite him, leaning against the partition of the\r\nshallop, through one of whose raised blinds the moon streamed in.\r\nHer black dress, whose drapery spread out like a fan, made her\r\nseem more slender, taller. Her head was raised, her hands\r\nclasped, her eyes turned towards heaven. At times the shadow of\r\nthe willows hid her completely; then she reappeared suddenly,\r\nlike a vision in the moonlight.\r\nLeon, on the floor by her side, found under his hand a ribbon of\r\nscarlet silk. The boatman looked at it, and at last said--\r\n"Perhaps it belongs to the party I took out the other day. A lot\r\nof jolly folk, gentlemen and ladies, with cakes, champagne,\r\ncornets--everything in style! There was one especially, a tall\r\nhandsome man with small moustaches, who was that funny! And they\r\nall kept saying, \'Now tell us something, Adolphe--Dolpe,\' I\r\nthink."\r\nShe shivered.\r\n"You are in pain?" asked Leon, coming closer to her.\r\n"Oh, it\'s nothing! No doubt, it is only the night air."\r\n"And who doesn\'t want for women, either," softly added the\r\nsailor, thinking he was paying the stranger a compliment.\r\nThen, spitting on his hands, he took the oars again.\r\nYet they had to part. The adieux were sad. He was to send his\r\nletters to Mere Rollet, and she gave him such precise\r\ninstructions about a double envelope that he admired greatly her\r\namorous astuteness.\r\n"So you can assure me it is all right?" she said with her last\r\nkiss.\r\n"Yes, certainly."\r\n"But why," he thought afterwards as he came back through the\r\nstreets alone, "is she so very anxious to get this power of\r\nattorney?"'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Four\r\nLeon soon put on an air of superiority before his comrades,\r\navoided their company, and completely neglected his work.\r\nHe waited for her letters; he re-read them; he wrote to her. He\r\ncalled her to mind with all the strength of his desires and of\r\nhis memories. Instead of lessening with absence, this longing to\r\nsee her again grew, so that at last on Saturday morning he\r\nescaped from his office.\r\nWhen, from the summit of the hill, he saw in the valley below the\r\nchurch-spire with its tin flag swinging in the wind, he felt that\r\ndelight mingled with triumphant vanity and egoistic tenderness\r\nthat millionaires must experience when they come back to their\r\nnative village.\r\nHe went rambling round her house. A light was burning in the\r\nkitchen. He watched for her shadow behind the curtains, but\r\nnothing appeared.\r\nMere Lefrancois, when she saw him, uttered many exclamations. She\r\nthought he "had grown and was thinner," while Artemise, on the\r\ncontrary, thought him stouter and darker.\r\nHe dined in the little room as of yore, but alone, without the\r\ntax-gatherer; for Binet, tired of waiting for the "Hirondelle,"\r\nhad definitely put forward his meal one hour, and now he dined\r\npunctually at five, and yet he declared usually the rickety old\r\nconcern "was late."\r\nLeon, however, made up his mind, and knocked at the doctor\'s\r\ndoor. Madame was in her room, and did not come down for a quarter\r\nof an hour. The doctor seemed delighted to see him, but he never\r\nstirred out that evening, nor all the next day.\r\nHe saw her alone in the evening, very late, behind the garden in\r\nthe lane; in the lane, as she had the other one! It was a stormy\r\nnight, and they talked under an umbrella by lightning flashes.\r\nTheir separation was becoming intolerable. "I would rather die!"\r\nsaid Emma. She was writhing in his arms, weeping. "Adieu! adieu!\r\nWhen shall I see you again?"\r\nThey came back again to embrace once more, and it was then that\r\nshe promised him to find soon, by no matter what means, a regular\r\nopportunity for seeing one another in freedom at least once a\r\nweek. Emma never doubted she should be able to do this. Besides,\r\nshe was full of hope. Some money was coming to her.\r\nOn the strength of it she bought a pair of yellow curtains with\r\nlarge stripes for her room, whose cheapness Monsieur Lheureux had\r\ncommended; she dreamed of getting a carpet, and Lheureux,\r\ndeclaring that it wasn\'t "drinking the sea," politely undertook\r\nto supply her with one. She could no longer do without his\r\nservices. Twenty times a day she sent for him, and he at once put\r\nby his business without a murmur. People could not understand\r\neither why Mere Rollet breakfasted with her every day, and even\r\npaid her private visits.\r\nIt was about this time, that is to say, the beginning of winter,\r\nthat she seemed seized with great musical fervour.\r\nOne evening when Charles was listening to her, she began the same\r\npiece four times over, each time with much vexation, while he,\r\nnot noticing any difference, cried--\r\n"Bravo! very goodl You are wrong to stop. Go on!"\r\n"Oh, no; it is execrable! My fingers are quite rusty."\r\nThe next day he begged her to play him something again.\r\n"Very well; to please you!"\r\nAnd Charles confessed she had gone off a little. She played wrong\r\nnotes and blundered; then, stopping short--\r\n"Ah! it is no use. I ought to take some lessons; but--" She bit\r\nher lips and added, "Twenty francs a lesson, that\'s too dear!"\r\n"Yes, so it is--rather," said Charles, giggling stupidly. "But it\r\nseems to me that one might be able to do it for less; for there\r\nare artists of no reputation, and who are often better than the\r\ncelebrities."\r\n"Find them!" said Emma.\r\nThe next day when he came home he looked at her shyly, and at\r\nlast could no longer keep back the words.\r\n"How obstinate you are sometimes! I went to Barfucheres to-day.\r\nWell, Madame Liegard assured me that her three young ladies who\r\nare at La Misericorde have lessons at fifty sous apiece, and that\r\nfrom an excellent mistress!"\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders and did not open her piano again. But\r\nwhen she passed by it (if Bovary were there), she sighed--\r\n"Ah! my poor piano!"\r\nAnd when anyone came to see her, she did not fail to inform them\r\nshe had given up music, and could not begin again now for\r\nimportant reasons. Then people commiserated her--\r\n"What a pity! she had so much talent!"\r\nThey even spoke to Bovary about it. They put him to shame, and\r\nespecially the chemist.\r\n"You are wrong. One should never let any of the faculties of\r\nnature lie fallow. Besides, just think, my good friend, that by\r\ninducing madame to study; you are economising on the subsequent\r\nmusical education of your child. For my own part, I think that\r\nmothers ought themselves to instruct their children. That is an\r\nidea of Rousseau\'s, still rather new perhaps, but that will end\r\nby triumphing, I am certain of it, like mothers nursing their own\r\nchildren and vaccination."\r\nSo Charles returned once more to this question of the piano. Emma\r\nreplied bitterly that it would be better to sell it. This poor\r\npiano, that had given her vanity so much satisfaction--to see it\r\ngo was to Bovary like the indefinable suicide of a part of\r\nherself.\r\n"If you liked," he said, "a lesson from time to time, that\r\nwouldn\'t after all be very ruinous."\r\n"But lessons," she replied, "are only of use when followed up."\r\nAnd thus it was she set about obtaining her husband\'s permission\r\nto go to town once a week to see her lover. At the end of a month\r\nshe was even considered to have made considerable progress.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Five\r\nShe went on Thursdays. She got up and dressed silently, in order\r\nnot to awaken Charles, who would have made remarks about her\r\ngetting ready too early. Next she walked up and down, went to the\r\nwindows, and looked out at the Place. The early dawn was\r\nbroadening between the pillars of the market, and the chemist\'s\r\nshop, with the shutters still up, showed in the pale light of the\r\ndawn the large letters of his signboard.\r\nWhen the clock pointed to a quarter past seven, she went off to\r\nthe "Lion d\'Or," whose door Artemise opened yawning. The girl\r\nthen made up the coals covered by the cinders, and Emma remained\r\nalone in the kitchen. Now and again she went out. Hivert was\r\nleisurely harnessing his horses, listening, moreover, to Mere\r\nLefrancois, who, passing her head and nightcap through a grating,\r\nwas charging him with commissions and giving him explanations\r\nthat would have confused anyone else. Emma kept beating the soles\r\nof her boots against the pavement of the yard.\r\nAt last, when he had eaten his soup, put on his cloak, lighted\r\nhis pipe, and grasped his whip, he calmly installed himself on\r\nhis seat.\r\nThe "Hirondelle" started at a slow trot, and for about a mile\r\nstopped here and there to pick up passengers who waited for it,\r\nstanding at the border of the road, in front of their yard gates.\r\nThose who had secured seats the evening before kept it waiting;\r\nsome even were still in bed in their houses. Hivert called,\r\nshouted, swore; then he got down from his seat and went and\r\nknocked loudly at the doors. The wind blew through the cracked\r\nwindows.\r\nThe four seats, however, filled up. The carriage rolled off; rows\r\nof apple-trees followed one upon another, and the road between\r\nits two long ditches, full of yellow water, rose, constantly\r\nnarrowing towards the horizon.\r\nEmma knew it from end to end; she knew that after a meadow there\r\nwas a sign-post, next an elm, a barn, or the hut of a lime-kiln\r\ntender. Sometimes even, in the hope of getting some surprise, she\r\nshut her eyes, but she never lost the clear perception of the\r\ndistance to be traversed.\r\nAt last the brick houses began to follow one another more\r\nclosely, the earth resounded beneath the wheels, the "Hirondelle"\r\nglided between the gardens, where through an opening one saw\r\nstatues, a periwinkle plant, clipped yews, and a swing. Then on a\r\nsudden the town appeared. Sloping down like an amphitheatre, and\r\ndrowned in the fog, it widened out beyond the bridges confusedly.\r\nThen the open country spread away with a monotonous movement till\r\nit touched in the distance the vague line of the pale sky. Seen\r\nthus from above, the whole landscape looked immovable as a\r\npicture; the anchored ships were massed in one corner, the river\r\ncurved round the foot of the green hills, and the isles, oblique\r\nin shape, lay on the water, like large, motionless, black fishes.\r\nThe factory chimneys belched forth immense brown fumes that were\r\nblown away at the top. One heard the rumbling of the foundries,\r\ntogether with the clear chimes of the churches that stood out in\r\nthe mist. The leafless trees on the boulevards made violet\r\nthickets in the midst of the houses, and the roofs, all shining\r\nwith the rain, threw back unequal reflections, according to the\r\nheight of the quarters in which they were. Sometimes a gust of\r\nwind drove the clouds towards the Saint Catherine hills, like\r\naerial waves that broke silently against a cliff.\r\nA giddiness seemed to her to detach itself from this mass of\r\nexistence, and her heart swelled as if the hundred and twenty\r\nthousand souls that palpitated there had all at once sent into it\r\nthe vapour of the passions she fancied theirs. Her love grew in\r\nthe presence of this vastness, and expanded with tumult to the\r\nvague murmurings that rose towards her. She poured it out upon\r\nthe square, on the walks, on the streets, and the old Norman city\r\noutspread before her eyes as an enormous capital, as a Babylon\r\ninto which she was entering. She leant with both hands against\r\nthe window, drinking in the breeze; the three horses galloped,\r\nthe stones grated in the mud, the diligence rocked, and Hivert,\r\nfrom afar, hailed the carts on the road, while the bourgeois who\r\nhad spent the night at the Guillaume woods came quietly down the\r\nhill in their little family carriages.\r\nThey stopped at the barrier; Emma undid her overshoes, put on\r\nother gloves, rearranged her shawl, and some twenty paces farther\r\nshe got down from the "Hirondelle."\r\nThe town was then awakening. Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up\r\nthe shop-fronts, and women with baskets against their hips, at\r\nintervals uttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She\r\nwalked with downcast eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with\r\npleasure under her lowered black veil.\r\nFor fear of being seen, she did not usually take the most direct\r\nroad. She plunged into dark alleys, and, all perspiring, reached\r\nthe bottom of the Rue Nationale, near the fountain that stands\r\nthere. It, is the quarter for theatres, public-houses, and\r\nwhores. Often a cart would pass near her, bearing some shaking\r\nscenery. Waiters in aprons were sprinkling sand on the flagstones\r\nbetween green shrubs. It all smelt of absinthe, cigars, and\r\noysters.\r\nShe turned down a street; she recognised him by his curling hair\r\nthat escaped from beneath his hat.\r\nLeon walked along the pavement. She followed him to the hotel. He\r\nwent up, opened the door, entered--What an embrace!\r\nThen, after the kisses, the words gushed forth. They told each\r\nother the sorrows of the week, the presentiments, the anxiety for\r\nthe letters; but now everything was forgotten; they gazed into\r\neach other\'s faces with voluptuous laughs, and tender names.\r\nThe bed was large, of mahogany, in the shape of a boat. The\r\ncurtains were in red levantine, that hung from the ceiling and\r\nbulged out too much towards the bell-shaped bedside; and nothing\r\nin the world was so lovely as her brown head and white skin\r\nstanding out against this purple colour, when, with a movement of\r\nshame, she crossed her bare arms, hiding her face in her hands.\r\nThe warm room, with its discreet carpet, its gay ornaments, and\r\nits calm light, seemed made for the intimacies of passion. The\r\ncurtain-rods, ending in arrows, their brass pegs, and the great\r\nballs of the fire-dogs shone suddenly when the sun came in. On\r\nthe chimney between the candelabra there were two of those pink\r\nshells in which one hears the murmur of the sea if one holds them\r\nto the ear.\r\nHow they loved that dear room, so full of gaiety, despite its\r\nrather faded splendour! They always found the furniture in the\r\nsame place, and sometimes hairpins, that she had forgotten the\r\nThursday before, under the pedestal of the clock. They lunched by\r\nthe fireside on a little round table, inlaid with rosewood. Emma\r\ncarved, put bits on his plate with all sorts of coquettish ways,\r\nand she laughed with a sonorous and libertine laugh when the\r\nfroth of the champagne ran over from the glass to the rings on\r\nher fingers. They were so completely lost in the possession of\r\neach other that they thought themselves in their own house, and\r\nthat they would live there till death, like two spouses eternally\r\nyoung. They said "our room," "our carpet," she even said "my\r\nslippers," a gift of Leon\'s, a whim she had had. They were pink\r\nsatin, bordered with swansdown. When she sat on his knees, her\r\nleg, then too short, hung in the air, and the dainty shoe, that\r\nhad no back to it, was held only by the toes to her bare foot.\r\nHe for the first time enjoyed the inexpressible delicacy of\r\nfeminine refinements. He had never met this grace of language,\r\nthis reserve of clothing, these poses of the weary dove. He\r\nadmired the exaltation of her soul and the lace on her petticoat.\r\nBesides, was she not "a lady" and a married woman--a real\r\nmistress, in fine?\r\nBy the diversity of her humour, in turn mystical or mirthful,\r\ntalkative, taciturn, passionate, careless, she awakened in him a\r\nthousand desires, called up instincts or memories. She was the\r\nmistress of all the novels, the heroine of all the dramas, the\r\nvague "she" of all the volumes of verse. He found again on her\r\nshoulder the amber colouring of the "Odalisque Bathing"; she had\r\nthe long waist of feudal chatelaines, and she resembled the "Pale\r\nWoman of Barcelona." But above all she was the Angel!\r\nOften looking at her, it seemed to him that his soul, escaping\r\ntowards her, spread like a wave about the outline of her head,\r\nand descended drawn down into the whiteness of her breast. He\r\nknelt on the ground before her, and with both elbows on her knees\r\nlooked at her with a smile, his face upturned.\r\nShe bent over him, and murmured, as if choking with intoxication--\r\n"Oh, do not move! do not speak! look at me! Something so sweet\r\ncomes from your eyes that helps me so much!"\r\nShe called him "child." "Child, do you love me?"\r\nAnd she did not listen for his answer in the haste of her lips\r\nthat fastened to his mouth.\r\nOn the clock there was a bronze cupid, who smirked as he bent his\r\narm beneath a golden garland. They had laughed at it many a time,\r\nbut when they had to part everything seemed serious to them.\r\nMotionless in front of each other, they kept repeating, "Till\r\nThursday, till Thursday."\r\nSuddenly she seized his head between her hands, kissed him\r\nhurriedly on the forehead, crying, "Adieu!" and rushed down the\r\nstairs.\r\nShe went to a hairdresser\'s in the Rue de la Comedie to have her\r\nhair arranged. Night fell; the gas was lighted in the shop. She\r\nheard the bell at the theatre calling the mummers to the\r\nperformance, and she saw, passing opposite, men with white faces\r\nand women in faded gowns going in at the stage-door.\r\nIt was hot in the room, small, and too low where the stove was\r\nhissing in the midst of wigs and pomades. The smell of the tongs,\r\ntogether with the greasy hands that handled her head, soon\r\nstunned her, and she dozed a little in her wrapper. Often, as he\r\ndid her hair, the man offered her tickets for a masked ball.\r\nThen she went away. She went up the streets; reached the\r\nCroix-Rouge, put on her overshoes, that she had hidden in the\r\nmorning under the seat, and sank into her place among the\r\nimpatient passengers. Some got out at the foot of the hill. She\r\nremained alone in the carriage. At every turning all the lights\r\nof the town were seen more and more completely, making a great\r\nluminous vapour about the dim houses. Emma knelt on the cushions\r\nand her eyes wandered over the dazzling light. She sobbed; called\r\non Leon, sent him tender words and kisses lost in the wind.\r\nOn the hillside a poor devil wandered about with his stick in the\r\nmidst of the diligences. A mass of rags covered his shoulders,\r\nand an old staved-in beaver, turned out like a basin, hid his\r\nface; but when he took it off he discovered in the place of\r\neyelids empty and bloody orbits. The flesh hung in red shreds,\r\nand there flowed from it liquids that congealed into green scale\r\ndown to the nose, whose black nostrils sniffed convulsively. To\r\nspeak to you he threw back his head with an idiotic laugh; then\r\nhis bluish eyeballs, rolling constantly, at the temples beat\r\nagainst the edge of the open wound. He sang a little song as he\r\nfollowed the carriages--\r\n"Maids an the warmth of a summer day\r\nDream of love, and of love always"\r\nAnd all the rest was about birds and sunshine and green leaves.\r\nSometimes he appeared suddenly behind Emma, bareheaded, and she\r\ndrew back with a cry. Hivert made fun of him. He would advise him\r\nto get a booth at the Saint Romain fair, or else ask him,\r\nlaughing, how his young woman was.\r\nOften they had started when, with a sudden movement, his hat\r\nentered the diligence through the small window, while he clung\r\nwith his other arm to the footboard, between the wheels splashing\r\nmud. His voice, feeble at first and quavering, grew sharp; it\r\nresounded in the night like the indistinct moan of a vague\r\ndistress; and through the ringing of the bells, the murmur of the\r\ntrees, and the rumbling of the empty vehicle, it had a far-off\r\nsound that disturbed Emma. It went to the bottom of her soul,\r\nlike a whirlwind in an abyss, and carried her away into the\r\ndistances of a boundless melancholy. But Hivert, noticing a\r\nweight behind, gave the blind man sharp cuts with his whip. The\r\nthong lashed his wounds, and he fell back into the mud with a\r\nyell. Then the, passengers in the "Hirondelle" ended by falling\r\nasleep, some with open mouths, others with lowered chins, leaning\r\nagainst their neighbour\'s shoulder, or with their arm passed\r\nthrough the strap, oscillating regularly with the jolting of the\r\ncarriage; and the reflection of the lantern swinging without, on\r\nthe crupper of the wheeler; penetrating into the interior through\r\nthe chocolate calico curtains, threw sanguineous shadows over all\r\nthese motionless people. Emma, drunk with grief, shivered in her\r\nclothes, feeling her feet grow colder and colder, and death in\r\nher soul.\r\nCharles at home was waiting for her; the "Hirondelle" was always\r\nlate on Thursdays. Madame arrived at last, and scarcely kissed\r\nthe child. The dinner was not ready. No matter! She excused the\r\nservant. This girl now seemed allowed to do just as she liked.\r\nOften her husband, noting her pallor, asked if she were unwell.\r\n"No," said Emma.\r\n"But," he replied, "you seem so strange this evening."\r\n"Oh, it\'s nothing! nothing!"\r\nThere were even days when she had no sooner come in than she went\r\nup to her room; and Justin, happening to be there, moved about\r\nnoiselessly, quicker at helping her than the best of maids. He\r\nput the matches ready, the candlestick, a book, arranged her\r\nnightgown, turned back the bedclothes.\r\n"Come!" said she, "that will do. Now you can go."\r\nFor he stood there, his hands hanging down and his eyes wide\r\nopen, as if enmeshed in the innumerable threads of a sudden\r\nreverie.\r\nThe following day was frightful, and those that came after still\r\nmore unbearable, because of her impatience to once again seize\r\nher happiness; an ardent lust, inflamed by the images of past\r\nexperience, and that burst forth freely on the seventh day\r\nbeneath Leon\'s caresses. His ardours were hidden beneath\r\noutbursts of wonder and gratitude. Emma tasted this love in a\r\ndiscreet, absorbed fashion, maintained it by all the artifices of\r\nher tenderness, and trembled a little lest it should be lost\r\nlater on.\r\nShe often said to him, with her sweet, melancholy voice--\r\n"Ah! you too, you will leave me! You will marry! You will be like\r\nall the others."\r\nHe asked, "What others?"\r\n"Why, like all men," she replied. Then added, repulsing him with\r\na languid movement--\r\n"You are all evil!"\r\nOne day, as they were talking philosophically of earthly\r\ndisillusions, to experiment on his jealousy, or yielding,\r\nperhaps, to an over-strong need to pour out her heart, she told\r\nhim that formerly, before him, she had loved someone.\r\n"Not like you," she went on quickly, protesting by the head of\r\nher child that "nothing had passed between them."\r\nThe young man believed her, but none the less questioned her to\r\nfind out what he was.\r\n"He was a ship\'s captain, my dear."\r\nWas this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time,\r\nassuming a higher ground through this pretended fascination\r\nexercised over a man who must have been of warlike nature and\r\naccustomed to receive homage?\r\nThe clerk then felt the lowliness of his position; he longed for\r\nepaulettes, crosses, titles. All that would please her--he\r\ngathered that from her spendthrift habits.\r\nEmma nevertheless concealed many of these extravagant fancies,\r\nsuch as her wish to have a blue tilbury to drive into Rouen,\r\ndrawn by an English horse and driven by a groom in top-boots. It\r\nwas Justin who had inspired her with this whim, by begging her to\r\ntake him into her service as valet-de-chambre*, and if the\r\nprivation of it did not lessen the pleasure of her arrival at\r\neach rendezvous, it certainly augmented the bitterness of the\r\nreturn.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.li,{children:"Manservant."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Often, when they talked together of Paris, she ended by\r\nmurmuring, "Ah! how happy we should be there!"\r\n"Are we not happy?" gently answered the young man passing his\r\nhands over her hair.\r\n"Yes, that is true," she said. "I am mad. Kiss me!"\r\nTo her husband she was more charming than ever. She made him\r\npistachio-creams, and played him waltzes after dinner. So he\r\nthought himself the most fortunate of men and Emma was without\r\nuneasiness, when, one evening suddenly he said--\r\n"It is Mademoiselle Lempereur, isn\'t it, who gives you lessons?"\r\n"Yes."\r\n"Well, I saw her just now," Charles went on, "at Madame\r\nLiegeard\'s. I spoke to her about you, and she doesn\'t know you."\r\nThis was like a thunderclap. However, she replied quite\r\nnaturally--\r\n"Ah! no doubt she forgot my name."\r\n"But perhaps," said the doctor, "there are several Demoiselles\r\nLempereur at Rouen who are music-mistresses."\r\n"Possibly!" Then quickly--"But I have my receipts here. See!"\r\nAnd she went to the writing-table, ransacked all the drawers,\r\nrummaged the papers, and at last lost her head so completely that\r\nCharles earnestly begged her not to take so much trouble about\r\nthose wretched receipts.\r\n"Oh, I will find them," she said.\r\nAnd, in fact, on the following Friday, as Charles was putting on\r\none of his boots in the dark cabinet where his clothes were kept,\r\nhe felt a piece of paper between the leather and his sock. He\r\ntook it out and read--\r\n"Received, for three months\' lessons and several pieces of music,\r\nthe sum of sixty-three francs.--Felicie Lempereur, professor of\r\nmusic."\r\n"How the devil did it get into my boots?"\r\n"It must," she replied, "have fallen from the old box of bills\r\nthat is on the edge of the shelf."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'From that moment her existence was but one long tissue of lies,\r\nin which she enveloped her love as in veils to hide it. It was a\r\nwant, a mania, a pleasure carried to such an extent that if she\r\nsaid she had the day before walked on the right side of a road,\r\none might know she had taken the left.\r\nOne morning, when she had gone, as usual, rather lightly clothed,\r\nit suddenly began to snow, and as Charles was watching the\r\nweather from the window, he caught sight of Monsieur Bournisien\r\nin the chaise of Monsieur Tuvache, who was driving him to Rouen.\r\nThen he went down to give the priesta thick shawl that he was to\r\nhand over to Emma as soon as he reached the "Croix-Rouge." When\r\nhe got to the inn, Monsieur Bournisien asked for the wife of the\r\nYonville doctor. The landlady replied that she very rarely came\r\nto her establishment. So that evening, when he recognised Madame\r\nBovary in the "Hirondelle," the cure told her his dilemma,\r\nwithout, however, appearing to attach much importance to it, for\r\nhe began praising a preacher who was doing wonders at the\r\nCathedral, and whom all the ladies were rushing to hear.\r\nStill, if he did not ask for any explanation, others, later on,\r\nmight prove less discreet. So she thought well to get down each\r\ntime at the "Croix-Rouge," so that the good folk of her village\r\nwho saw her on the stairs should suspect nothing.\r\nOne day, however, Monsieur Lheureux met her coming out of the\r\nHotel de Boulogne on Leon\'s arm; and she was frightened, thinking\r\nhe would gossip. He was not such a fool. But three days after he\r\ncame to her room, shut the door, and said, "I must have some\r\nmoney."\r\nShe declared she could not give him any. Lheureux burst into\r\nlamentations and reminded her of all the kindnesses he had shown\r\nher.\r\nIn fact, of the two bills signed by Charles, Emma up to the\r\npresent had paid only one. As to the second, the shopkeeper, at\r\nher request, had consented to replace it by another, which again\r\nhad been renewed for a long date. Then he drew from his pocket a\r\nlist of goods not paid for; to wit, the curtains, the carpet, the\r\nmaterial for the armchairs, several dresses, and divers articles\r\nof dress, the bills for which amounted to about two thousand\r\nfrancs.\r\nShe bowed her head. He went on--\r\n"But if you haven\'t any ready money, you have an estate." And he\r\nreminded her of a miserable little hovel situated at Barneville,\r\nnear Aumale, that brought in almost nothing. It had formerly been\r\npart of a small farm sold by Monsieur Bovary senior; for Lheureux\r\nknew everything, even to the number of acres and the names of the\r\nneighbours.\r\n"If I were in your place," he said, "I should clear myself of my\r\ndebts, and have money left over."\r\nShe pointed out the difficulty of getting a purchaser. He held\r\nout the hope of finding one; but she asked him how she should\r\nmanage to sell it.\r\n"Haven\'t you your power of attorney?" he replied.\r\nThe phrase came to her like a breath of fresh air. "Leave me the\r\nbill," said Emma.\r\n"Oh, it isn\'t worth while," answered Lheureux.\r\nHe came back the following week and boasted of having, after much\r\ntrouble, at last discovered a certain Langlois, who, for a long\r\ntime, had had an eye on the property, but without mentioning his\r\nprice.\r\n"Never mind the price!" she cried.\r\nBut they would, on the contrary, have to wait, to sound the\r\nfellow. The thing was worth a journey, and, as she could not\r\nundertake it, he offered to go to the place to have an interview\r\nwith Langlois. On his return he announced that the purchaser\r\nproposed four thousand francs.\r\nEmma was radiant at this news.\r\n"Frankly," he added, "that\'s a good price."\r\nShe drew half the sum at once, and when she was about to pay her\r\naccount the shopkeeper said--\r\n"It really grieves me, on my word! to see you depriving yourself\r\nall at once of such a big sum as that."\r\nThen she looked at the bank-notes, and dreaming of the unlimited\r\nnumber of rendezvous represented by those two thousand francs,\r\nshe stammered--\r\n"What! what!"\r\n"Oh!" he went on, laughing good-naturedly, "one puts anything one\r\nlikes on receipts. Don\'t you think I know what household affairs\r\nare?" And he looked at her fixedly, while in his hand he held two\r\nlong papers that he slid between his nails. At last, opening his\r\npocket-book, he spread out on the table four bills to order, each\r\nfor a thousand francs.\r\n"Sign these," he said, "and keep it all!"\r\nShe cried out, scandalised.\r\n"But if I give you the surplus," replied Monsieur Lheureux\r\nimpudently, "is that not helping you?"\r\nAnd taking a pen he wrote at the bottom of the account, "Received\r\nof Madame Bovary four thousand francs."\r\n"Now who can trouble you, since in six months you\'ll draw the\r\narrears for your cottage, and I don\'t make the last bill due till\r\nafter you\'ve been paid?"\r\nEmma grew rather confused in her calculations, and her ears\r\ntingled as if gold pieces, bursting from their bags, rang all\r\nround her on the floor. At last Lheureux explained that he had a\r\nvery good friend, Vincart, a broker at Rouen, who would discount\r\nthese four bills. Then he himself would hand over to madame the\r\nremainder after the actual debt was paid.\r\nBut instead of two thousand francs he brought only eighteen\r\nhundred, for the friend Vincart (which was only fair) had\r\ndeducted two hundred francs for commission and discount. Then he\r\ncarelessly asked for a receipt.\r\n"You understand--in business--sometimes. And with the date, if\r\nyou please, with the date."\r\nA horizon of realisable whims opened out before Emma. She was\r\nprudent enough to lay by a thousand crowns, with which the first\r\nthree bills were paid when they fell due; but the fourth, by\r\nchance, came to the house on a Thursday, and Charles, quite\r\nupset, patiently awaited his wife\'s return for an explanation.\r\nIf she had not told him about this bill, it was only to spare him\r\nsuch domestic worries; she sat on his knees, caressed him, cooed\r\nto him, gave him a long enumeration of all the indispensable\r\nthings that had been got on credit.\r\n"Really, you must confess, considering the quantity, it isn\'t too\r\ndear."\r\nCharles, at his wit\'s end, soon had recourse to the eternal\r\nLheureux, who swore he would arrange matters if the doctor would\r\nsign him two bills, one of which was for seven hundred francs,\r\npayable in three months. In order to arrange for this he wrote\r\nhis mother a pathetic letter. Instead of sending a reply she came\r\nherself; and when Emma wanted to know whether he had got anything\r\nout of her, "Yes," he replied; "but she wants to see the\r\naccount." The next morning at daybreak Emma ran to Lheureux to\r\nbeg him to make out another account for not more than a thousand\r\nfrancs, for to show the one for four thousand it would be\r\nnecessary to say that she had paid two-thirds, and confess,\r\nconsequently, the sale of the estate--a negotiation admirably\r\ncarried out by the shopkeeper, and which, in fact, was only\r\nactually known later on.\r\nDespite the low price of each article, Madame Bovary senior, of\r\ncourse, thought the expenditure extravagant.\r\n"Couldn\'t you do without a carpet? Why have recovered the\r\narm-chairs? In my time there was a single arm-chair in a house,\r\nfor elderly persons--at any rate it was so at my mother\'s, who\r\nwas a good woman, I can tell you. Everybody can\'t be rich! No\r\nfortune can hold out against waste! I should be ashamed to coddle\r\nmyself as you do! And yet I am old. I need looking after. And\r\nthere! there! fitting up gowns! fallals! What! silk for lining at\r\ntwo francs, when you can get jaconet for ten sous, or even for\r\neight, that would do well enough!"\r\nEmma, lying on a lounge, replied as quietly as possible--"Ah!\r\nMadame, enough! enough!"\r\nThe other went on lecturing her, predicting they would end in the\r\nworkhouse. But it was Bovary\'s fault. Luckily he had promised to\r\ndestroy that power of attorney.\r\n"What?"\r\n"Ah! he swore he would," went on the good woman.\r\nEmma opened the window, called Charles, and the poor fellow was\r\nobliged to confess the promise torn from him by his mother.\r\nEmma disappeared, then came back quickly, and majestically handed\r\nher a thick piece of paper.\r\n"Thank you," said the old woman. And she threw the power of\r\nattorney into the fire.\r\nEmma began to laugh, a strident, piercing, continuous laugh; she\r\nhad an attack of hysterics.\r\n"Oh, my God!" cried Charles. "Ah! you really are wrong! You come\r\nhere and make scenes with her!"\r\nHis mother, shrugging her shoulders, declared it was "all put\r\non."\r\nBut Charles, rebelling for the first time, took his wife\'s part,\r\nso that Madame Bovary, senior, said she would leave. She went the\r\nvery next day, and on the threshold, as he was trying to detain\r\nher, she replied--\r\n"No, no! You love her better than me, and you are right. It is\r\nnatural. For the rest, so much the worse! You will see. Good\r\nday--for I am not likely to come soon again, as you say, to make\r\nscenes."\r\nCharles nevertheless was very crestfallen before Emma, who did\r\nnot hide the resentment she still felt at his want of confidence,\r\nand it needed many prayers before she would consent to have\r\nanother power of attorney. He even accompanied her to Monsieur\r\nGuillaumin to have a second one, just like the other, drawn up.\r\n"I understand," said the notary; "a man of science can\'t be\r\nworried with the practical details of life."\r\nAnd Charles felt relieved by this comfortable reflection, which\r\ngave his weakness the flattering appearance of higher\r\npre-occupation.\r\nAnd what an outburst the next Thursday at the hotel in their room\r\nwith Leon! She laughed, cried, sang, sent for sherbets, wanted to\r\nsmoke cigarettes, seemed to him wild and extravagant, but\r\nadorable, superb.\r\nHe did not know what recreation of her whole being drove her more\r\nand more to plunge into the pleasures of life. She was becoming\r\nirritable, greedy, voluptuous; and she walked about the streets\r\nwith him carrying her head high, without fear, so she said, of\r\ncompromising herself. At times, however, Emma shuddered at the\r\nsudden thought of meeting Rodolphe, for it seemed to her that,\r\nalthough they were separated forever, she was not completely free\r\nfrom her subjugation to him.\r\nOne night she did not return to Yonville at all. Charles lost his\r\nhead with anxiety, and little Berthe would not go to bed without\r\nher mamma, and sobbed enough to break her heart. Justin had gone\r\nout searching the road at random. Monsieur Homais even had left\r\nhis pharmacy.\r\nAt last, at eleven o\'clock, able to bear it no longer, Charles\r\nharnessed his chaise, jumped in, whipped up his horse, and\r\nreached the "Croix-Rouge" about two o\'clock in the morning. No\r\none there! He thought that the clerk had perhaps seen her; but\r\nwhere did he live? Happily, Charles remembered his employer\'s\r\naddress, and rushed off there.\r\nDay was breaking, and he could distinguish the escutcheons over\r\nthe door, and knocked. Someone, without opening the door, shouted\r\nout the required information, adding a few insults to those who\r\ndisturb people in the middle of the night.\r\nThe house inhabited by the clerk had neither bell, knocker, nor\r\nporter. Charles knocked loudly at the shutters with his hands. A\r\npoliceman happened to pass by. Then he was frightened, and went\r\naway.\r\n"I am mad," he said; "no doubt they kept her to dinner at\r\nMonsieur Lormeaux\'." But the Lormeaux no longer lived at Rouen.\r\n"She probably stayed to look after Madame Dubreuil. Why, Madame\r\nDubreuil has been dead these ten months! Where can she be?"\r\nAn idea occurred to him. At a cafe he asked for a Directory, and\r\nhurriedly looked for the name of Mademoiselle Lempereur, who\r\nlived at No. 74 Rue de la Renelle-des-Maroquiniers.\r\nAs he was turning into the street, Emma herself appeared at the\r\nother end of it. He threw himself upon her rather than embraced\r\nher, crying--\r\n"What kept you yesterday?"\r\n"I was not well."\r\n"What was it? Where? How?"\r\nShe passed her hand over her forehead and answered, "At\r\nMademoiselle Lempereur\'s."\r\n"I was sure of it! I was going there."\r\n"Oh, it isn\'t worth while," said Emma. "She went out just now;\r\nbut for the future don\'t worry. I do not feel free, you see, if I\r\nknow that the least delay upsets you like this."\r\nThis was a sort of permission that she gave herself, so as to get\r\nperfect freedom in her escapades. And she profited by it freely,\r\nfully. When she was seized with the desire to see Leon, she set\r\nout upon any pretext; and as he was not expecting her on that\r\nday, she went to fetch him at his office.\r\nIt was a great delight at first, but soon he no longer concealed\r\nthe truth, which was, that his master complained very much about\r\nthese interruptions.\r\n"Pshaw! come along," she said.\r\nAnd he slipped out.\r\nShe wanted him to dress all in black, and grow a pointed beard,\r\nto look like the portraits of Louis XIII. She wanted to see his\r\nlodgings; thought them poor. He blushed at them, but she did not\r\nnotice this, then advised him to buy some curtains like hers, and\r\nas he objected to the expense--\r\n"Ah! ah! you care for your money," she said laughing.\r\nEach time Leon had to tell her everything that he had done since\r\ntheir last meeting. She asked him for some verses--some verses\r\n"for herself," a "love poem" in honour of her. But he never\r\nsucceeded in getting a rhyme for the second verse; and at last\r\nended by copying a sonnet in a "Keepsake." This was less from\r\nvanity than from the one desire of pleasing her. He did not\r\nquestion her ideas; he accepted all her tastes; he was rather\r\nbecoming her mistress than she his. She had tender words and\r\nkisses that thrilled his soul. Where could she have learnt this\r\ncorruption almost incorporeal in the strength of its profanity\r\nand dissimulation?'}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Six\r\nDuring the journeys he made to see her, Leon had often dined at\r\nthe chemist\'s, and he felt obliged from politeness to invite him\r\nin turn.\r\n"With pleasure!" Monsieur Homais replied; "besides, I must\r\ninvigorate my mind, for I am getting rusty here. We\'ll go to the\r\ntheatre, to the restaurant; we\'ll make a night of it."\r\n"Oh, my dear!" tenderly murmured Madame Homais, alarmed at the\r\nvague perils he was preparing to brave.\r\n"Well, what? Do you think I\'m not sufficiently ruining my health\r\nliving here amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy? But\r\nthere! that is the way with women! They are jealous of science,\r\nand then are opposed to our taking the most legitimate\r\ndistractions. No matter! Count upon me. One of these days I shall\r\nturn up at Rouen, and we\'ll go the pace together."\r\nThe druggist would formerly have taken good care not to use such\r\nan expression, but he was cultivating a gay Parisian style, which\r\nhe thought in the best taste; and, like his neighbour, Madame\r\nBovary, he questioned the clerk curiously about the customs of\r\nthe capital; he even talked slang to dazzle the bourgeois, saying\r\nbender, crummy, dandy, macaroni, the cheese, cut my stick and\r\n"I\'ll hook it," for "I am going."\r\nSo one Thursday Emma was surprised to meet Monsieur Homais in the\r\nkitchen of the "Lion d\'Or," wearing a traveller\'s costume, that\r\nis to say, wrapped in an old cloak which no one knew he had,\r\nwhile he carried a valise in one hand and the foot-warmer of his\r\nestablishment in the other. He had confided his intentions to no\r\none, for fear of causing the public anxiety by his absence.\r\nThe idea of seeing again the place where his youth had been spent\r\nno doubt excited him, for during the whole journey he never\r\nceased talking, and as soon as he had arrived, he jumped quickly\r\nout of the diligence to go in search of Leon. In vain the clerk\r\ntried to get rid of him. Monsieur Homais dragged him off to the\r\nlarge Cafe de la Normandie, which he entered majestically, not\r\nraising his hat, thinking it very provincial to uncover in any\r\npublic place.\r\nEmma waited for Leon three quarters of an hour. At last she ran\r\nto his office; and, lost in all sorts of conjectures, accusing\r\nhim of indifference, and reproaching herself for her weakness,\r\nshe spent the afternoon, her face pressed against the\r\nwindow-panes.\r\nAt two o\'clock they were still at a table opposite each other.\r\nThe large room was emptying; the stove-pipe, in the shape of a\r\npalm-tree, spread its gilt leaves over the white ceiling, and\r\nnear them, outside the window, in the bright sunshine, a little\r\nfountain gurgled in a white basin, where; in the midst of\r\nwatercress and asparagus, three torpid lobsters stretched across\r\nto some quails that lay heaped up in a pile on their sides.\r\nHomais was enjoying himself. Although he was even more\r\nintoxicated with the luxury than the rich fare, the Pommard wine\r\nall the same rather excited his faculties; and when the omelette\r\nau rhum* appeared, he began propounding immoral theories about\r\nwomen. What seduced him above all else was chic.

The druggist went on drinking,\r\neating, and talking.\r\n"You must be very lonely," he said suddenly, "here at Rouen. To\r\nbe sure your lady-love doesn\'t live far away."\r\nAnd the other blushed--\r\n"Come now, be frank. Can you deny that at Yonville--"\r\nThe young man stammered something.\r\n"At Madame Bovary\'s, you\'re not making love to--"\r\n"To whom?"\r\n"The servant!"\r\nHe was not joking; but vanity getting the better of all prudence,\r\nLeon, in spite of himself protested. Besides, he only liked dark\r\nwomen.\r\n"I approve of that," said the chemist; "they have more passion."\r\nAnd whispering into his friend\'s ear, he pointed out the symptoms\r\nby which one could find out if a woman had passion. He even\r\nlaunched into an ethnographic digression: the German was\r\nvapourish, the French woman licentious, the Italian passionate.\r\n"And negresses?" asked the clerk.\r\n"They are an artistic taste!" said Homais. "Waiter! two cups of\r\ncoffee!"\r\n"Are we going?" at last asked Leon impatiently.\r\n"Ja!"\r\nBut before leaving he wanted to see the proprietor of the\r\nestablishment and made him a few compliments. Then the young man,\r\nto be alone, alleged he had some business engagement.\r\n"Ah! I will escort you," said Homais.\r\nAnd all the while he was walking through the streets with him he\r\ntalked of his wife, his children; of their future, and of his\r\nbusiness; told him in what a decayed condition it had formerly\r\nbeen, and to what a degree of perfection he had raised it.\r\nArrived in front of the Hotel de Boulogne, Leon left him\r\nabruptly, ran up the stairs, and found his mistress in great\r\nexcitement. At mention of the chemist she flew into a passion.\r\nHe, however, piled up good reasons; it wasn\'t his fault; didn\'t\r\nshe know Homais--did she believe that he would prefer his\r\ncompany? But she turned away; he drew her back, and, sinking on\r\nhis knees, clasped her waist with his arms in a languorous pose,\r\nfull of concupiscence and supplication.\r\nShe was standing; up, her large flashing eyes looked at him\r\nseriously, almost terribly. Then tears obscured them, her red\r\neyelids were lowered, she gave him her hands, and Leon was\r\npressing them to his lips when a servant appeared to tell the\r\ngentleman that he was wanted.\r\n"You will come back?" she said.\r\n"Yes."\r\n"But when?"\r\n"Immediately."\r\n"It\'s a trick," said the chemist, when he saw Leon. "I wanted to\r\ninterrupt this visit, that seemed to me to annoy you. Let\'s go\r\nand have a glass of garus at Bridoux\'."\r\nLeon vowed that he must get back to his office. Then the druggist\r\njoked him about quill-drivers and the law.\r\n"Leave Cujas and Barthole alone a bit. Who the devil prevents\r\nyou? Be a man! Let\'s go to Bridoux\'. You\'ll see his dog. It\'s\r\nvery interesting."\r\nAnd as the clerk still insisted--\r\n"I\'ll go with you. I\'ll read a paper while I wait for you, or\r\nturn over the leaves of a \'Code.\'"\r\nLeon, bewildered by Emma\'s anger, Monsieur Homais\' chatter, and,\r\nperhaps, by the heaviness of the luncheon, was undecided, and, as\r\nit were, fascinated by the chemist, who kept repeating--\r\n"Let\'s go to Bridoux\'. It\'s just by here, in the Rue Malpalu."\r\nThen, through cowardice, through stupidity, through that\r\nindefinable feeling that drags us into the most distasteful acts,\r\nhe allowed himself to be led off to Bridoux\', whom they found in\r\nhis small yard, superintending three workmen, who panted as they\r\nturned the large wheel of a machine for making seltzer-water.\r\nHomais gave them some good advice. He embraced Bridoux; they took\r\nsome garus. Twenty times Leon tried to escape, but the other\r\nseized him by the arm saying--\r\n"Presently! I\'m coming! We\'ll go to the \'Fanal de Rouen\' to see\r\nthe fellows there. I\'ll introduce you to Thornassin."\r\nAt last he managed to get rid of him, and rushed straight to the\r\nhotel. Emma was no longer there. She had just gone in a fit of\r\nanger. She detested him now. This failing to keep their\r\nrendezvous seemed to her an insult, and she tried to rake up\r\nother reasons to separate herself from him. He was incapable of\r\nheroism, weak, banal, more spiritless than a woman, avaricious\r\ntoo, and cowardly.\r\nThen, growing calmer, she at length discovered that she had, no\r\ndoubt, calumniated him. But the disparaging of those we love\r\nalways alienates us from them to some extent. We must not touch\r\nour idols; the gilt sticks to our fingers.\r\nThey gradually came to talking more frequently of matters outside\r\ntheir love, and in the letters that Emma wrote him she spoke of\r\nflowers, verses, the moon and the stars, naive resources of a\r\nwaning passion striving to keep itself alive by all external\r\naids. She was constantly promising herself a profound felicity on\r\nher next journey. Then she confessed to herself that she felt\r\nnothing extraordinary. This disappointment quickly gave way to a\r\nnew hope, and Emma returned to him more inflamed, more eager than\r\never. She undressed brutally, tearing off the thin laces of her\r\ncorset that nestled around her hips like a gliding snake. She\r\nwent on tiptoe, barefooted, to see once more that the door was\r\nclosed, then, pale, serious, and, without speaking, with one\r\nmovement, she threw herself upon his breast with a long shudder.\r\nYet there was upon that brow covered with cold drops, on those\r\nquivering lips, in those wild eyes, in the strain of those arms,\r\nsomething vague and dreary that seemed to Leon to glide between\r\nthem subtly as if to separate them.\r\nHe did not dare to question her; but, seeing her so skilled, she\r\nmust have passed, he thought, through every experience of\r\nsuffering and of pleasure. What had once charmed now frightened\r\nhim a little. Besides, he rebelled against his absorption, daily\r\nmore marked, by her personality. He begrudged Emma this constant\r\nvictory. He even strove not to love her; then, when he heard the\r\ncreaking of her boots, he turned coward, like drunkards at the\r\nsight of strong drinks.\r\nShe did not fail, in truth, to lavish all sorts of attentions\r\nupon him, from the delicacies of food to the coquettries of dress\r\nand languishing looks. She brought roses to her breast from\r\nYonville, which she threw into his face; was anxious about his\r\nhealth, gave him advice as to his conduct; and, in order the more\r\nsurely to keep her hold on him, hoping perhaps that heaven would\r\ntake her part, she tied a medal of the Virgin round his neck. She\r\ninquired like a virtuous mother about his companions. She said to\r\nhim--\r\n"Don\'t see them; don\'t go out; think only of ourselves; love me!"\r\nShe would have liked to be able to watch over his life; and the\r\nidea occurred to her of having him followed in the streets. Near\r\nthe hotel there was always a kind of loafer who accosted\r\ntravellers, and who would not refuse. But her pride revolted at\r\nthis.\r\n"Bah! so much the worse. Let him deceive me! What does it matter\r\nto me? As If I cared for him!"\r\nOne day, when they had parted early and she was returning alone\r\nalong the boulevard, she saw the walls of her convent; then she\r\nsat down on a form in the shade of the elm-trees. How calm that\r\ntime had been! How she longed for the ineffable sentiments of\r\nlove that she had tried to figure to herself out of books! The\r\nfirst month of her marriage, her rides in the wood, the viscount\r\nthat waltzed, and Lagardy singing, all repassed before her eyes.\r\nAnd Leon suddenly appeared to her as far off as the others.\r\n"Yet I love him," she said to herself.\r\nNo matter! She was not happy--she never had been. Whence came\r\nthis insufficiency in life--this instantaneous turning to decay\r\nof everything on which she leant? But if there were somewhere a\r\nbeing strong and beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of\r\nexaltation and refinement, a poet\'s heart in an angel\'s form, a\r\nlyre with sounding chords ringing out elegiac epithalamia to\r\nheaven, why, perchance, should she not find him? Ah! how\r\nimpossible! Besides, nothing was worth the trouble of seeking it;\r\neverything was a lie. Every smile hid a yawn of boredom, every\r\njoy a curse, all pleasure satiety, and the sweetest kisses left\r\nupon your lips only the unattainable desire for a greater\r\ndelight.\r\nA metallic clang droned through the air, and four strokes were\r\nheard from the convent-clock. Four o\'clock! And it seemed to her\r\nthat she had been there on that form an eternity. But an infinity\r\nof passions may be contained in a minute, like a crowd in a small\r\nspace.\r\nEmma lived all absorbed in hers, and troubled no more about money\r\nmatters than an archduchess.\r\nOnce, however, a wretched-looking man, rubicund and bald, came to\r\nher house, saying he had been sent by Monsieur Vincart of Rouen.\r\nHe took out the pins that held together the side-pockets of his\r\nlong green overcoat, stuck them into his sleeve, and politely\r\nhanded her a paper.\r\nIt was a bill for seven hundred francs, signed by her, and which\r\nLheureux, in spite of all his professions, had paid away to\r\nVincart. She sent her servant for him. He could not come. Then\r\nthe stranger, who had remained standing, casting right and left\r\ncurious glances, that his thick, fair eyebrows hid, asked with a\r\nnaive air--\r\n"What answer am I to take Monsieur Vincart?"\r\n"Oh," said Emma, "tell him that I haven\'t it. I will send next\r\nweek; he must wait; yes, till next week."\r\nAnd the fellow went without another word.\r\nBut the next day at twelve o\'clock she received a summons, and\r\nthe sight of the stamped paper, on which appeared several times\r\nin large letters, "Maitre Hareng, bailiff at Buchy," so\r\nfrightened her that she rushed in hot haste to the linendraper\'s.\r\nShe found him in his shop, doing up a parcel.\r\n"Your obedient!" he said; "I am at your service."\r\nBut Lheureux, all the same, went on with his work, helped by a\r\nyoung girl of about thirteen, somewhat hunch-backed, who was at\r\nonce his clerk and his servant.\r\nThen, his clogs clattering on the shop-boards, he went up in\r\nfront of Madame Bovary to the first door, and introduced her into\r\na narrow closet, where, in a large bureau in sapon-wood, lay some\r\nledgers, protected by a horizontal padlocked iron bar. Against\r\nthe wall, under some remnants of calico, one glimpsed a safe, but\r\nof such dimensions that it must contain something besides bills\r\nand money. Monsieur Lheureux, in fact, went in for pawnbroking,\r\nand it was there that he had put Madame Bovary\'s gold chain,\r\ntogether with the earrings of poor old Tellier, who, at last\r\nforced to sell out, had bought a meagre store of grocery at\r\nQuincampoix, where he was dying of catarrh amongst his candles,\r\nthat were less yellow than his face.\r\nLheureux sat down in a large cane arm-chair, saying: "What news?"\r\n"See!"\r\nAnd she showed him the paper.\r\n"Well how can I help it?"\r\nThen she grew angry, reminding him of the promise he had given\r\nnot to pay away her bills. He acknowledged it.\r\n"But I was pressed myself; the knife was at my own throat."\r\n"And what will happen now?" she went on.\r\n"Oh, it\'s very simple; a judgment and then a distraint--that\'s\r\nabout it!"\r\nEmma kept down a desire to strike him, and asked gently if there\r\nwas no way of quieting Monsieur Vincart.\r\n"I dare say! Quiet Vincart! You don\'t know him; he\'s more\r\nferocious than an Arab!"\r\nStill Monsieur Lheureux must interfere.\r\n"Well, listen. It seems to me so far I\'ve been very good to you."\r\nAnd opening one of his ledgers, "See," he said. Then running up\r\nthe page with his finger, "Let\'s see! let\'s see! August 3d, two\r\nhundred francs; June 17th, a hundred and fifty; March 23d,\r\nforty-six. In April--"\r\nHe stopped, as if afraid of making some mistake.\r\n"Not to speak of the bills signed by Monsieur Bovary, one for\r\nseven hundred francs, and another for three hundred. As to your\r\nlittle installments, with the interest, why, there\'s no end to\r\n\'em; one gets quite muddled over \'em. I\'ll have nothing more to\r\ndo with it."\r\nShe wept; she even called him "her good Monsieur Lheureux." But\r\nhe always fell back upon "that rascal Vincart." Besides, he\r\nhadn\'t a brass farthing; no one was paying him now-a-days; they\r\nwere eating his coat off his back; a poor shopkeeper like him\r\ncouldn\'t advance money.\r\nEmma was silent, and Monsieur Lheureux, who was biting the\r\nfeathers of a quill, no doubt became uneasy at her silence, for\r\nhe went on--\r\n"Unless one of these days I have something coming in, I might--"\r\n"Besides," said she, "as soon as the balance of Barneville--"\r\n"What!"\r\nAnd on hearing that Langlois had not yet paid he seemed much\r\nsurprised. Then in a honied voice--\r\n"And we agree, you say?"\r\n"Oh! to anything you like."\r\nOn this he closed his eyes to reflect, wrote down a few figures,\r\nand declaring it would be very difficult for him, that the affair\r\nwas shady, and that he was being bled, he wrote out four bills\r\nfor two hundred and fifty francs each, to fall due month by\r\nmonth.\r\n"Provided that Vincart will listen to me! However, it\'s settled.\r\nI don\'t play the fool; I\'m straight enough."\r\nNext he carelessly showed her several new goods, not one of\r\nwhich, however, was in his opinion worthy of madame.\r\n"When I think that there\'s a dress at threepence-halfpenny a\r\nyard, and warranted fast colours! And yet they actually swallow\r\nit! Of course you understand one doesn\'t tell them what it really\r\nis!" He hoped by this confession of dishonesty to others to quite\r\nconvince her of his probity to her.\r\nThen he called her back to show her three yards of guipure that\r\nhe had lately picked up "at a sale."\r\n"Isn\'t it lovely?" said Lheureux. "It is very much used now for\r\nthe backs of arm-chairs. It\'s quite the rage."\r\nAnd, more ready than a juggler, he wrapped up the guipure in some\r\nblue paper and put it in Emma\'s hands.\r\n"But at least let me know--"\r\n"Yes, another time," he replied, turning on his heel.\r\nThat same evening she urged Bovary to write to his mother, to ask\r\nher to send as quickly as possible the whole of the balance due\r\nfrom the father\'s estate. The mother-in-law replied that she had\r\nnothing more, the winding up was over, and there was due to them\r\nbesides Barneville an income of six hundred francs, that she\r\nwould pay them punctually.\r\nThen Madame Bovary sent in accounts to two or three patients, and\r\nshe made large use of this method, which was very successful. She\r\nwas always careful to add a postscript: "Do not mention this to\r\nmy husband; you know how proud he is. Excuse me. Yours\r\nobediently." There were some complaints; she intercepted them.\r\nTo get money she began selling her old gloves, her old hats, the\r\nold odds and ends, and she bargained rapaciously, her peasant\r\nblood standing her in good stead. Then on her journey to town she\r\npicked up nick-nacks secondhand, that, in default of anyone else,\r\nMonsieur Lheureux would certainly take off her hands. She bought\r\nostrich feathers, Chinese porcelain, and trunks; she borrowed\r\nfrom Felicite, from Madame Lefrancois, from the landlady at the\r\nCroix-Rouge, from everybody, no matter where.\r\nWith the money she at last received from Barneville she paid two\r\nbills; the other fifteen hundred francs fell due. She renewed the\r\nbills, and thus it was continually.\r\nSometimes, it is true, she tried to make a calculation, but she\r\ndiscovered things so exorbitant that she could not believe them\r\npossible. Then she recommenced, soon got confused, gave it all\r\nup, and thought no more about it.\r\nThe house was very dreary now. Tradesmen were seen leaving it\r\nwith angry faces. Handkerchiefs were lying about on the stoves,\r\nand little Berthe, to the great scandal of Madame Homais, wore\r\nstockings with holes in them. If Charles timidly ventured a\r\nremark, she answered roughly that it wasn\'t her fault.\r\nWhat was the meaning of all these fits of temper? She explained\r\neverything through her old nervous illness, and reproaching\r\nhimself with having taken her infirmities for faults, accused\r\nhimself of egotism, and longed to go and take her in his arms.\r\n"Ah, no!" he said to himself; "I should worry her."\r\nAnd he did not stir.\r\nAfter dinner he walked about alone in the garden; he took little\r\nBerthe on his knees, and unfolding his medical journal, tried to\r\nteach her to read. But the child, who never had any lessons, soon\r\nlooked up with large, sad eyes and began to cry. Then he\r\ncomforted her; went to fetch water in her can to make rivers on\r\nthe sand path, or broke off branches from the privet hedges to\r\nplant trees in the beds. This did not spoil the garden much, all\r\nchoked now with long weeds. They owed Lestiboudois for so many\r\ndays. Then the child grew cold and asked for her mother.\r\n"Call the servant," said Charles. "You know, dearie, that mamma\r\ndoes not like to be disturbed."\r\nAutumn was setting in, and the leaves were already falling, as\r\nthey did two years ago when she was ill. Where would it all end?\r\nAnd he walked up and down, his hands behind his back.\r\nMadame was in her room, which no one entered. She stayed there\r\nall day long, torpid, half dressed, and from time to time burning\r\nTurkish pastilles which she had bought at Rouen in an Algerian\'s\r\nshop. In order not to have at night this sleeping man stretched\r\nat her side, by dint of manoeuvring, she at last succeeded in\r\nbanishing him to the second floor, while she read till morning\r\nextravagant books, full of pictures of orgies and thrilling\r\nsituations. Often, seized with fear, she cried out, and Charles\r\nhurried to her.\r\n"Oh, go away!" she would say.\r\nOr at other times, consumed more ardently than ever by that inner\r\nflame to which adultery added fuel, panting, tremulous, all\r\ndesire, she threw open her window, breathed in the cold air,\r\nshook loose in the wind her masses of hair, too heavy, and,\r\ngazing upon the stars, longed for some princely love. She thought\r\nof him, of Leon. She would then have given anything for a single\r\none of those meetings that surfeited her.\r\nThese were her gala days. She wanted them to be sumptuous, and\r\nwhen he alone could not pay the expenses, she made up the deficit\r\nliberally, which happened pretty well every time. He tried to\r\nmake her understand that they would be quite as comfortable\r\nsomewhere else, in a smaller hotel, but she always found some\r\nobjection.\r\nOne day she drew six small silver-gilt spoons from her bag (they\r\nwere old Roualt\'s wedding present), begging him to pawn them at\r\nonce for her, and Leon obeyed, though the proceeding annoyed him.\r\nHe was afraid of compromising himself.\r\nThen, on, reflection, he began to think his mistress\'s ways were\r\ngrowing odd, and that they were perhaps not wrong in wishing to\r\nseparate him from her.\r\nIn fact someone had sent his mother a long anonymous letter to\r\nwarn her that he was "ruining himself with a married woman," and\r\nthe good lady at once conjuring up the eternal bugbear of\r\nfamilies the vague pernicious creature, the siren, the monster,\r\nwho dwells fantastically in depths of love, wrote to Lawyer\r\nDubocage, his employer, who behaved perfectly in the affair. He\r\nkept him for three quarters of an hour trying to open his eyes,\r\nto warn him of the abyss into which he was falling. Such an\r\nintrigue would damage him later on, when he set up for himself.\r\nHe implored him to break with her, and, if he would not make this\r\nsacrifice in his own interest, to do it at least for his,\r\nDubocage\'s sake.\r\nAt last Leon swore he would not see Emma again, and he reproached\r\nhimself with not having kept his word, considering all the worry\r\nand lectures this woman might still draw down upon him, without\r\nreckoning the jokes made by his companions as they sat round the\r\nstove in the morning. Besides, he was soon to be head clerk; it\r\nwas time to settle down. So he gave up his flute, exalted\r\nsentiments, and poetry; for every bourgeois in the flush of his\r\nyouth, were it but for a day, a moment, has believed himself\r\ncapable of immense passions, of lofty enterprises. The most\r\nmediocre libertine has dreamed of sultanas; every notary bears\r\nwithin him the debris of a poet.\r\nHe was bored now when Emma suddenly began to sob on his breast,\r\nand his heart, like the people who can only stand a certain\r\namount of music, dozed to the sound of a love whose delicacies he\r\nno longer noted.\r\nThey knew one another too well for any of those surprises of\r\npossession that increase its joys a hundred-fold. She was as sick\r\nof him as he was weary of her. Emma found again in adultery all\r\nthe platitudes of marriage.\r\nBut how to get rid of him? Then, though she might feel humiliated\r\nat the baseness of such enjoyment, she clung to it from habit or\r\nfrom corruption, and each day she hungered after them the more,\r\nexhausting all felicity in wishing for too much of it. She\r\naccused Leon of her baffled hopes, as if he had betrayed her; and\r\nshe even longed for some catastrophe that would bring about their\r\nseparation, since she had not the courage to make up her mind to\r\nit herself.\r\nShe none the less went on writing him love letters, in virtue of\r\nthe notion that a woman must write to her lover.\r\nBut whilst she wrote it was another man she saw, a phantom\r\nfashioned out of her most ardent memories, of her finest reading,\r\nher strongest lusts, and at last he became so real, so tangible,\r\nthat she palpitated wondering, without, however, the power to\r\nimagine him clearly, so lost was he, like a god, beneath the\r\nabundance of his attributes. He dwelt in that azure land where\r\nsilk ladders hang from balconies under the breath of flowers, in\r\nthe light of the moon. She felt him near her; he was coming, and\r\nwould carry her right away in a kiss.\r\nThen she fell back exhausted, for these transports of vague love\r\nwearied her more than great debauchery.\r\nShe now felt constant ache all over her. Often she even received\r\nsummonses, stamped paper that she barely looked at. She would\r\nhave liked not to be alive, or to be always asleep.\r\nOn Mid-Lent she did not return to Yonville, but in the evening\r\nwent to a masked ball. She wore velvet breeches, red stockings, a\r\nclub wig, and three-cornered hat cocked on one side. She danced\r\nall night to the wild tones of the trombones; people gathered\r\nround her, and in the morning she found herself on the steps of\r\nthe theatre together with five or six masks, debardeuses* and\r\nsailors, Leon\'s comrades, who were talking about having supper.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.li,{children:"People dressed as longshoremen."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'The neighbouring cafes were full. They caught sight of one on the\r\nharbour, a very indifferent restaurant, whose proprietor showed\r\nthem to a little room on the fourth floor.\r\nThe men were whispering in a corner, no doubt consorting about\r\nexpenses. There were a clerk, two medical students, and a\r\nshopman--what company for her! As to the women, Emma soon\r\nperceived from the tone of their voices that they must almost\r\nbelong to the lowest class. Then she was frightened, pushed back\r\nher chair, and cast down her eyes.\r\nThe others began to eat; she ate nothing. Her head was on fire,\r\nher eyes smarted, and her skin was ice-cold. In her head she\r\nseemed to feel the floor of the ball-room rebounding again\r\nbeneath the rhythmical pulsation of the thousands of dancing\r\nfeet. And now the smell of the punch, the smoke of the cigars,\r\nmade her giddy. She fainted, and they carried her to the window.\r\nDay was breaking, and a great stain of purple colour broadened\r\nout in the pale horizon over the St. Catherine hills. The livid\r\nriver was shivering in the wind; there was no one on the bridges;\r\nthe street lamps were going out.\r\nShe revived, and began thinking of Berthe asleep yonder in the\r\nservant\'s room. Then a cart filled with long strips of iron\r\npassed by, and made a deafening metallic vibration against the\r\nwalls of the houses.\r\nShe slipped away suddenly, threw off her costume, told Leon she\r\nmust get back, and at last was alone at the Hotel de Boulogne.\r\nEverything, even herself, was now unbearable to her. She wished\r\nthat, taking wing like a bird, she could fly somewhere, far away\r\nto regions of purity, and there grow young again.\r\nShe went out, crossed the Boulevard, the Place Cauchoise, and the\r\nFaubourg, as far as an open street that overlooked some gardens.\r\nShe walked rapidly; the fresh air calming her; and, little by\r\nlittle, the faces of the crowd, the masks, the quadrilles, the\r\nlights, the supper, those women, all disappeared like mists\r\nfading away. Then, reaching the "Croix-Rouge," she threw herself\r\non the bed in her little room on the second floor, where there\r\nwere pictures of the "Tour de Nesle." At four o\'clock Hivert\r\nawoke her.\r\nWhen she got home, Felicite showed her behind the clock a grey\r\npaper. She read--\r\n"In virtue of the seizure in execution of a judgment."\r\nWhat judgment? As a matter of fact, the evening before another\r\npaper had been brought that she had not yet seen, and she was\r\nstunned by these words--\r\n"By order of the king, law, and justice, to Madame Bovary." Then,\r\nskipping several lines, she read, "Within twenty-four hours,\r\nwithout fail--" But what? "To pay the sum of eight thousand\r\nfrancs." And there was even at the bottom, "She will be\r\nconstrained thereto by every form of law, and notably by a writ\r\nof distraint on her furniture and effects."\r\nWhat was to be done? In twenty-four hours--tomorrow. Lheureux,\r\nshe thought, wanted to frighten her again; for she saw through\r\nall his devices, the object of his kindnesses. What reassured her\r\nwas the very magnitude of the sum.\r\nHowever, by dint of buying and not paying, of borrowing, signing\r\nbills, and renewing these bills that grew at each new falling-in,\r\nshe had ended by preparing a capital for Monsieur Lheureux which\r\nhe was impatiently awaiting for his speculations.\r\nShe presented herself at his place with an offhand air.\r\n"You know what has happened to me? No doubt it\'s a joke!"\r\n"How so?"\r\nHe turned away slowly, and, folding his arms, said to her--\r\n"My good lady, did you think I should go on to all eternity being\r\nyour purveyor and banker, for the love of God? Now be just. I\r\nmust get back what I\'ve laid out. Now be just."\r\nShe cried out against the debt.\r\n"Ah! so much the worse. The court has admitted it. There\'s a\r\njudgment. It\'s been notified to you. Besides, it isn\'t my fault.\r\nIt\'s Vincart\'s."\r\n"Could you not--?"\r\n"Oh, nothing whatever."\r\n"But still, now talk it over."\r\nAnd she began beating about the bush; she had known nothing about\r\nit; it was a surprise.\r\n"Whose fault is that?" said Lheureux, bowing ironically. "While\r\nI\'m slaving like a nigger, you go gallivanting about."\r\n"Ah! no lecturing."\r\n"It never does any harm," he replied.\r\nShe turned coward; she implored him; she even pressed her pretty\r\nwhite and slender hand against the shopkeeper\'s knee.\r\n"There, that\'ll do! Anyone\'d think you wanted to seduce me!"\r\n"You are a wretch!" she cried.\r\n"Oh, oh! go it! go it!"\r\n"I will show you up. I shall tell my husband."\r\n"All right! I too. I\'ll show your husband something."\r\nAnd Lheureux drew from his strong box the receipt for eighteen\r\nhundred francs that she had given him when Vincart had discounted\r\nthe bills.\r\n"Do you think," he added, "that he\'ll not understand your little\r\ntheft, the poor dear man?"\r\nShe collapsed, more overcome than if felled by the blow of a\r\npole-axe. He was walking up and down from the window to the\r\nbureau, repeating all the while--\r\n"Ah! I\'ll show him! I\'ll show him!" Then he approached her, and\r\nin a soft voice said--\r\n"It isn\'t pleasant, I know; but, after all, no bones are broken,\r\nand, since that is the only way that is left for you paying back\r\nmy money--"\r\n"But where am I to get any?" said Emma, wringing her hands.\r\n"Bah! when one has friends like you!"\r\nAnd he looked at her in so keen, so terrible a fashion, that she\r\nshuddered to her very heart.\r\n"I promise you," she said, "to sign--"\r\n"I\'ve enough of your signatures."\r\n"I will sell something."\r\n"Get along!" he said, shrugging his shoulders; "you\'ve not got\r\nanything."\r\nAnd he called through the peep-hole that looked down into the\r\nshop--\r\n"Annette, don\'t forget the three coupons of No. 14."\r\nThe servant appeared. Emma understood, and asked how much money\r\nwould be wanted to put a stop to the proceedings.\r\n"It is too late."\r\n"But if I brought you several thousand francs--a quarter of the\r\nsum--a third--perhaps the whole?"\r\n"No; it\'s no use!"\r\nAnd he pushed her gently towards the staircase.\r\n"I implore you, Monsieur Lheureux, just a few days more!" She was\r\nsobbing.\r\n"There! tears now!"\r\n"You are driving me to despair!"\r\n"What do I care?" said he, shutting the door.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['Chapter Seven\r\nShe was stoical the next day when Maitre Hareng, the bailiff,\r\nwith two assistants, presented himself at her house to draw up\r\nthe inventory for the distraint.\r\nThey began with Bovary\'s consulting-room, and did not write down\r\nthe phrenological head, which was considered an "instrument of\r\nhis profession"; but in the kitchen they counted the plates; the\r\nsaucepans, the chairs, the candlesticks, and in the bedroom all\r\nthe nick-nacks on the whatnot. They examined her dresses, the\r\nlinen, the dressing-room; and her whole existence to its most\r\nintimate details, was, like a corpse on whom a post-mortem is\r\nmade, outspread before the eyes of these three men.\r\nMaitre Hareng, buttoned up in his thin black coat, wearing a\r\nwhite choker and very tight foot-straps, repeated from time to\r\ntime--"Allow me, madame. You allow me?" Often he uttered\r\nexclamations. "Charming! very pretty." Then he began writing\r\nagain, dipping his pen into the horn inkstand in his left hand.\r\nWhen they had done with the rooms they went up to the attic. She\r\nkept a desk there in which Rodolphe\'s letters were locked. It had\r\nto be opened.\r\n"Ah! a correspondence," said Maitre Hareng, with a discreet\r\nsmile. "But allow me, for I must make sure the box contains\r\nnothing else." And he tipped up the papers lightly, as if to\r\nshake out napoleons. Then she grew angered to see this coarse\r\nhand, with fingers red and pulpy like slugs, touching these pages\r\nagainst which her heart had beaten.\r\nThey went at last. Felicite came back. Emma had sent her out to\r\nwatch for Bovary in order to keep him off, and they hurriedly\r\ninstalled the man in possession under the roof, where he swore he\r\nwould remain.\r\nDuring the evening Charles seemed to her careworn. Emma watched\r\nhim with a look of anguish, fancying she saw an accusation in\r\nevery line of his face. Then, when her eyes wandered over the\r\nchimney-piece ornamented with Chinese screens, over the large\r\ncurtains, the armchairs, all those things, in a word, that had,\r\nsoftened the bitterness of her life, remorse seized her or rather\r\nan immense regret, that, far from crushing, irritated her\r\npassion. Charles placidly poked the fire, both his feet on the\r\nfire-dogs.\r\nOnce the man, no doubt bored in his hiding-place, made a slight\r\nnoise.\r\n"Is anyone walking upstairs?" said Charles.\r\n"No," she replied; "it is a window that has been left open, and\r\nis rattling in the wind."\r\nThe next day, Sunday, she went to Rouen to call on all the\r\nbrokers whose names she knew. They were at their country-places\r\nor on journeys. She was not discouraged; and those whom she did\r\nmanage to see she asked for money, declaring she must have some,\r\nand that she would pay it back. Some laughed in her face; all\r\nrefused.\r\nAt two o\'clock she hurried to Leon, and knocked at the door. No\r\none answered. At length he appeared.\r\n"What brings you here?"\r\n"Do I disturb you?"\r\n"No; but--" And he admitted that his landlord didn\'t like his\r\nhaving "women" there.\r\n"I must speak to you," she went on.\r\nThen he took down the key, but she stopped him.\r\n"No, no! Down there, in our home!"\r\nAnd they went to their room at the Hotel de Boulogne.\r\nOn arriving she drank off a large glass of water. She was very\r\npale. She said to him--\r\n"Leon, you will do me a service?"\r\nAnd, shaking him by both hands that she grasped tightly, she\r\nadded\r\n"Listen, I want eight thousand francs."\r\n"But you are mad!"\r\n"Not yet."\r\nAnd thereupon, telling him the story of the distraint, she\r\nexplained her distress to him; for Charles knew nothing of it;\r\nher mother-in-law detested her; old Rouault could do nothing; but\r\nhe, Leon, he would set about finding this indispensable sum.\r\n"How on earth can I?"\r\n"What a coward you are!" she cried.\r\nThen he said stupidly, "You are exaggerating the difficulty.\r\nPerhaps, with a thousand crowns or so the fellow could be\r\nstopped."\r\nAll the greater reason to try and do something; it was impossible\r\nthat they could not find three thousand francs. Besides, Leon,\r\ncould be security instead of her.\r\n"Go, try, try! I will love you so!"\r\nHe went out, and came back at the end of an hour, saying, with\r\nsolemn face--\r\n"I have been to three people with no success."\r\nThen they remained sitting face to face at the two chimney\r\ncorners, motionless, in silence. Emma shrugged her shoulders as\r\nshe stamped her feet. He heard her murmuring--\r\n"If I were in your place ',(0,a.jsx)(n.em,{children:"I"}),' should soon get some."\r\n"But where?"\r\n"At your office." And she looked at him.\r\nAn infernal boldness looked out from her burning eyes, and their\r\nlids drew close together with a lascivious and encouraging look,\r\nso that the young man felt himself growing weak beneath the mute\r\nwill of this woman who was urging him to a crime. Then he was\r\nafraid, and to avoid any explanation he smote his forehead,\r\ncrying--\r\n"Morel is to come back to-night; he will not refuse me, I hope"\r\n(this was one of his friends, the son of a very rich merchant);\r\n"and I will bring it you to-morrow," he added.\r\nEmma did not seem to welcome this hope with all the joy he had\r\nexpected. Did she suspect the lie? He went on, blushing--\r\n"However, if you don\'t see me by three o\'clock do not wait for\r\nme, my darling. I must be off now; forgive me! Goodbye!"\r\nHe pressed her hand, but it felt quite lifeless. Emma had no\r\nstrength left for any sentiment.\r\nFour o\'clock struck, and she rose to return to Yonville,\r\nmechanically obeying the force of old habits.\r\nThe weather was fine. It was one of those March days, clear and\r\nsharp, when the sun shines in a perfectly white sky. The Rouen\r\nfolk, in Sunday-clothes, were walking about with happy looks. She\r\nreached the Place du Parvis. People were coming out after\r\nvespers; the crowd flowed out through the three doors like a\r\nstream through the three arches of a bridge, and in the middle\r\none, more motionless than a rock, stood the beadle.\r\nThen she remembered the day when, all anxious and full of hope,\r\nshe had entered beneath this large nave, that had opened out\r\nbefore her, less profound than her love; and she walked on\r\nweeping beneath her veil, giddy, staggering, almost fainting.\r\n"Take care!" cried a voice issuing from the gate of a courtyard\r\nthat was thrown open.\r\nShe stopped to let pass a black horse, pawing the ground between\r\nthe shafts of a tilbury, driven by a gentleman in sable furs. Who\r\nwas it? She knew him. The carriage darted by and disappeared.\r\nWhy, it was he--the Viscount. She turned away; the street was\r\nempty. She was so overwhelmed, so sad, that she had to lean\r\nagainst a wall to keep herself from falling.\r\nThen she thought she had been mistaken. Anyhow, she did not know.\r\nAll within her and around her was abandoning her. She felt lost,\r\nsinking at random into indefinable abysses, and it was almost\r\nwith joy that, on reaching the "Croix-Rouge," she saw the good\r\nHomais, who was watching a large box full of pharmaceutical\r\nstores being hoisted on to the "Hirondelle." In his hand he held\r\ntied in a silk handkerchief six cheminots for his wife.\r\nMadame Homais was very fond of these small, heavy turban-shaped\r\nloaves, that are eaten in Lent with salt butter; a last vestige\r\nof Gothic food that goes back, perhaps, to the time of the\r\nCrusades, and with which the robust Normans gorged themselves of\r\nyore, fancying they saw on the table, in the light of the yellow\r\ntorches, between tankards of hippocras and huge boars\' heads, the\r\nheads of Saracens to be devoured. The druggist\'s wife crunched\r\nthem up as they had done--heroically, despite her wretched teeth.\r\nAnd so whenever Homais journeyed to town, he never failed to\r\nbring her home some that he bought at the great baker\'s in the\r\nRue Massacre.\r\n"Charmed to see you," he said, offering Emma a hand to help her\r\ninto the "Hirondelle." Then he hung up his cheminots to the cords\r\nof the netting, and remained bare-headed in an attitude pensive\r\nand Napoleonic.\r\nBut when the blind man appeared as usual at the foot of the hill\r\nhe exclaimed--\r\n"I can\'t understand why the authorities tolerate such culpable\r\nindustries. Such unfortunates should be locked up and forced to\r\nwork. Progress, my word! creeps at a snail\'s pace. We are\r\nfloundering about in mere barbarism."\r\nThe blind man held out his hat, that flapped about at the door,\r\nas if it were a bag in the lining that had come unnailed.\r\n"This," said the chemist, "is a scrofulous affection."\r\nAnd though he knew the poor devil, he pretended to see him for\r\nthe first time, murmured something about "cornea," "opaque\r\ncornea," "sclerotic," "facies," then asked him in a paternal\r\ntone--\r\n"My friend, have you long had this terrible infirmity? Instead of\r\ngetting drunk at the public, you\'d do better to die yourself."\r\nHe advised him to take good wine, good beer, and good joints. The\r\nblind man went on with his song; he seemed, moreover, almost\r\nidiotic. At last Monsieur Homais opened his purse--\r\n"Now there\'s a sou; give me back two lairds, and don\'t forget my\r\nadvice: you\'ll be the better for it."\r\nHivert openly cast some doubt on the efficacy of it. But the\r\ndruggist said that he would cure himself with an antiphlogistic\r\npomade of his own composition, and he gave his address--"Monsieur\r\nHomais, near the market, pretty well known."\r\n"Now," said Hivert, "for all this trouble you\'ll give us your\r\nperformance."\r\nThe blind man sank down on his haunches, with his head thrown\r\nback, whilst he rolled his greenish eyes, lolled out his tongue,\r\nand rubbed his stomach with both hands as he uttered a kind of\r\nhollow yell like a famished dog. Emma, filled with disgust, threw\r\nhim over her shoulder a five-franc piece. It was all her fortune.\r\nIt seemed to her very fine thus to throw it away.\r\nThe coach had gone on again when suddenly Monsieur Homais leant\r\nout through the window, crying--\r\n"No farinaceous or milk food, wear wool next the skin, and expose\r\nthe diseased parts to the smoke of juniper berries."\r\nThe sight of the well-known objects that defiled before her eyes\r\ngradually diverted Emma from her present trouble. An intolerable\r\nfatigue overwhelmed her, and she reached her home stupefied,\r\ndiscouraged, almost asleep.\r\n"Come what may come!" she said to herself. "And then, who knows?\r\nWhy, at any moment could not some extraordinary event occur?\r\nLheureux even might die!"\r\nAt nine o\'clock in the morning she was awakened by the sound of\r\nvoices in the Place. There was a crowd round the market reading a\r\nlarge bill fixed to one of the posts, and she saw Justin, who was\r\nclimbing on to a stone and tearing down the bill. But at this\r\nmoment the rural guard seized him by the collar. Monsieur Homais\r\ncame out of his shop, and Mere Lefrangois, in the midst of the\r\ncrowd, seemed to be perorating.\r\n"Madame! madame!" cried Felicite, running in, "it\'s abominable!"\r\nAnd the poor girl, deeply moved, handed her a yellow paper that\r\nshe had just torn off the door. Emma read with a glance that all\r\nher furniture was for sale.\r\nThen they looked at one another silently. The servant and\r\nmistress had no secret one from the other. At last Felicite\r\nsighed--\r\n"If I were you, madame, I should go to Monsieur Guillaumin."\r\n"Do you think--"\r\nAnd this question meant to say--\r\n"You who know the house through the servant, has the master\r\nspoken sometimes of me?"\r\n"Yes, you\'d do well to go there."\r\nShe dressed, put on her black gown, and her hood with jet beads,\r\nand that she might not be seen (there was still a crowd on the\r\nPlace), she took the path by the river, outside the village.\r\nShe reached the notary\'s gate quite breathless. The sky was\r\nsombre, and a little snow was falling. At the sound of the bell,\r\nTheodore in a red waistcoat appeared on the steps; he came to\r\nopen the door almost familiarly, as to an acquaintance, and\r\nshowed her into the dining-room.\r\nA large porcelain stove crackled beneath a cactus that filled up\r\nthe niche in the wall, and in black wood frames against the\r\noak-stained paper hung Steuben\'s "Esmeralda" and Schopin\'s\r\n"Potiphar. " The ready-laid table, the two silver chafing-dishes,\r\nthe crystal door-knobs, the parquet and the furniture, all shone\r\nwith a scrupulous, English cleanliness; the windows were\r\nornamented at each corner with stained glass.\r\n"Now this," thought Emma, "is the dining-room I ought to have."\r\nThe notary came in pressing his palm-leaf dressing-gown to his\r\nbreast with his left arm, while with the other hand he raised and\r\nquickly put on again his brown velvet cap, pretentiously cocked\r\non the right side, whence looked out the ends of three fair curls\r\ndrawn from the back of the head, following the line of his bald\r\nskull.\r\nAfter he had offered her a seat he sat down to breakfast,\r\napologising profusely for his rudeness.\r\n"I have come," she said, "to beg you, sir--"\r\n"What, madame? I am listening."\r\nAnd she began explaining her position to him. Monsieur Guillaumin\r\nknew it, being secretly associated with the linendraper, from\r\nwhom he always got capital for the loans on mortgages that he was\r\nasked to make.\r\nSo he knew (and better than she herself) the long story of the\r\nbills, small at first, bearing different names as endorsers, made\r\nout at long dates, and constantly renewed up to the day, when,\r\ngathering together all the protested bills, the shopkeeper had\r\nbidden his friend Vincart take in his own name all the necessary\r\nproceedings, not wishing to pass for a tiger with his\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\nShe mingled her story with recriminations against Lheureux, to\r\nwhich the notary replied from time to time with some\r\ninsignificant word. Eating his cutlet and drinking his tea, he\r\nburied his chin in his sky-blue cravat, into which were thrust\r\ntwo diamond pins, held together by a small gold chain; and he\r\nsmiled a singular smile, in a sugary, ambiguous fashion. But\r\nnoticing that her feet were damp, he said--\r\n"Do get closer to the stove; put your feet up against the\r\nporcelain."\r\nShe was afraid of dirtying it. The notary replied in a gallant\r\ntone--\r\n"Beautiful things spoil nothing."\r\nThen she tried to move him, and, growing moved herself, she began\r\ntelling him about the poorness of her home, her worries, her\r\nwants. He could understand that; an elegant woman! and, without\r\nleaving off eating, he had turned completely round towards her,\r\nso that his knee brushed against her boot, whose sole curled\r\nround as it smoked against the stove.\r\nBut when she asked for a thousand sous, he closed his lips, and\r\ndeclared he was very sorry he had not had the management of her\r\nfortune before, for there were hundreds of ways very convenient,\r\neven for a lady, of turning her money to account. They might,\r\neither in the turf-peats of Grumesnil or building-ground at\r\nHavre, almost without risk, have ventured on some excellent\r\nspeculations; and he let her consume herself with rage at the\r\nthought of the fabulous sums that she would certainly have made.\r\n"How was it," he went on, "that you didn\'t come to me?"\r\n"I hardly know," she said.\r\n"Why, hey? Did I frighten you so much? It is I, on the contrary,\r\nwho ought to complain. We hardly know one another; yet I am very\r\ndevoted to you. You do not doubt that, I hope?"\r\nHe held out his hand, took hers, covered it with a greedy kiss,\r\nthen held it on his knee; and he played delicately with her\r\nfingers whilst he murmured a thousand blandishments. His insipid\r\nvoice murmured like a running brook; a light shone in his eyes\r\nthrough the glimmering of his spectacles, and his hand was\r\nadvancing up Emma\'s sleeve to press her arm. She felt against her\r\ncheek his panting breath. This man oppressed her horribly.\r\nShe sprang up and said to him--\r\n"Sir, I am waiting."\r\n"For what?" said the notary, who suddenly became very pale.\r\n"This money."\r\n"But--" Then, yielding to the outburst of too powerful a desire,\r\n"Well, yes!"\r\nHe dragged himself towards her on his knees, regardless of his\r\ndressing-gown.\r\n"For pity\'s sake, stay. I love you!"\r\nHe seized her by her waist. Madame Bovary\'s face flushed purple.\r\nShe recoiled with a terrible look, crying--\r\n"You are taking a shameless advantage of my distress, sir! I am\r\nto be pitied--not to be sold."\r\nAnd she went out.\r\nThe notary remained quite stupefied, his eyes fixed on his fine\r\nembroidered slippers. They were a love gift, and the sight of\r\nthem at last consoled him. Besides, he reflected that such an\r\nadventure might have carried him too far.\r\n"What a wretch! what a scoundrel! what an infamy!" she said to\r\nherself, as she fled with nervous steps beneath the aspens of the\r\npath. The disappointment of her failure increased the indignation\r\nof her outraged modesty; it seemed to her that Providence pursued\r\nher implacably, and, strengthening herself in her pride, she had\r\nnever felt so much esteem for herself nor so much contempt for\r\nothers. A spirit of warfare transformed her. She would have liked\r\nto strike all men, to spit in their faces, to crush them, and she\r\nwalked rapidly straight on, pale, quivering, maddened, searching\r\nthe empty horizon with tear-dimmed eyes, and as it were rejoicing\r\nin the hate that was choking her.\r\nWhen she saw her house a numbness came over her. She could not go\r\non; and yet she must. Besides, whither could she flee ?\r\nFelicite was waiting for her at the door. "Well?"\r\n"No!" said Emma.\r\nAnd for a quarter of an hour the two of them went over the\r\nvarious persons in Yonville who might perhaps be inclined to help\r\nher. But each time that Felicite named someone Emma replied--\r\n"Impossible! they will not!"\r\n"And the master\'ll soon be in."\r\n"I know that well enough. Leave me alone."\r\nShe had tried everything; there was nothing more to be done now;\r\nand when Charles came in she would have to say to him--\r\n"Go away! This carpet on which you are walking is no longer ours.\r\nIn your own house you do not possess a chair, a pin, a straw, and\r\nit is I, poor man, who have ruined you."\r\nThen there would be a great sob; next he would weep abundantly,\r\nand at last, the surprise past, he would forgive her.\r\n"Yes," she murmured, grinding her teeth, "he will forgive me, he\r\nwho would give a million if I would forgive him for having known\r\nme! Never! never!"\r\nThis thought of Bovary\'s superiority to her exasperated her.\r\nThen, whether she confessed or did not confess, presently,\r\nimmediately, to-morrow, he would know the catastrophe all the\r\nsame; so she must wait for this horrible scene, and bear the\r\nweight of his magnanimity. The desire to return to Lheureux\'s\r\nseized her--what would be the use? To write to her father--it was\r\ntoo late; and perhaps, she began to repent now that she had not\r\nyielded to that other, when she heard the trot of a horse in the\r\nalley. It was he; he was opening the gate; he was whiter than the\r\nplaster wall. Rushing to the stairs, she ran out quickly to the\r\nsquare; and the wife of the mayor, who was talking to\r\nLestiboudois in front of the church, saw her go in to the\r\ntax-collector\'s.\r\nShe hurried off to tell Madame Caron, and the two ladies went up\r\nto the attic, and, hidden by some linen spread across props,\r\nstationed themselves comfortably for overlooking the whole of\r\nBinet\'s room.\r\nHe was alone in his garret, busy imitating in wood one of those\r\nindescribable bits of ivory, composed of crescents, of spheres\r\nhollowed out one within the other, the whole as straight as an\r\nobelisk, and of no use whatever; and he was beginning on the last\r\npiece--he was nearing his goal. In the twilight of the workshop\r\nthe white dust was flying from his tools like a shower of sparks\r\nunder the hoofs of a galloping horse; the two wheels were\r\nturning, droning; Binet smiled, his chin lowered, his nostrils\r\ndistended, and, in a word, seemed lost in one of those complete\r\nhappinesses that, no doubt, belong only to commonplace\r\noccupations, which amuse the mind with facile difficulties, and\r\nsatisfy by a realisation of that beyond which such minds have not\r\na dream.\r\n"Ah! there she is!" exclaimed Madame Tuvache.\r\nBut it was impossible because of the lathe to hear what she was\r\nsaying.\r\nAt last these ladies thought they made out the word "francs," and\r\nMadame Tuvache whispered in a low voice--\r\n"She is begging him to give her time for paying her taxes."\r\n"Apparently!" replied the other.\r\nThey saw her walking up and down, examining the napkin-rings, the\r\ncandlesticks, the banister rails against the walls, while Binet\r\nstroked his beard with satisfaction.\r\n"Do you think she wants to order something of him?" said Madame\r\nTuvache.\r\n"Why, he doesn\'t sell anything," objected her neighbour.\r\nThe tax-collector seemed to be listening with wide-open eyes, as\r\nif he did not understand. She went on in a tender, suppliant\r\nmanner. She came nearer to him, her breast heaving; they no\r\nlonger spoke.\r\n"Is she making him advances?" said Madame Tuvache. Binet was\r\nscarlet to his very ears. She took hold of his hands.\r\n"Oh, it\'s too much!"\r\nAnd no doubt she was suggesting something abominable to him; for\r\nthe tax-collector--yet he was brave, had fought at Bautzen and at\r\nLutzen, had been through the French campaign, and had even been\r\nrecommended for the cross--suddenly, as at the sight of a\r\nserpent, recoiled as far as he could from her, crying--\r\n"Madame! what do you mean?"\r\n"Women like that ought to be whipped," said Madame Tuvache.\r\n"But where is she?" continued Madame Caron, for she had\r\ndisappeared whilst they spoke; then catching sight of her going\r\nup the Grande Rue, and turning to the right as if making for the\r\ncemetery, they were lost in conjectures.\r\n"Nurse Rollet," she said on reaching the nurse\'s, "I am choking;\r\nunlace me!" She fell on the bed sobbing. Nurse Rollet covered her\r\nwith a petticoat and remained standing by her side. Then, as she\r\ndid not answer, the good woman withdrew, took her wheel and began\r\nspinning flax.\r\n"Oh, leave off!" she murmured, fancying she heard Binet\'s lathe.\r\n"What\'s bothering her?" said the nurse to herself. "Why has she\r\ncome here?"\r\nShe had rushed thither; impelled by a kind of horror that drove\r\nher from her home.\r\nLying on her back, motionless, and with staring eyes, she saw\r\nthings but vaguely, although she tried to with idiotic\r\npersistence. She looked at the scales on the walls, two brands\r\nsmoking end to end, and a long spider crawling over her head in a\r\nrent in the beam. At last she began to collect her thoughts. She\r\nremembered--one day--Leon--Oh! how long ago that was--the sun was\r\nshining on the river, and the clematis were perfuming the air.\r\nThen, carried away as by a rushing torrent, she soon began to\r\nrecall the day before.\r\n"What time is it?" she asked.\r\nMere Rollet went out, raised the fingers of her right hand to\r\nthat side of the sky that was brightest, and came back slowly,\r\nsaying--\r\n"Nearly three."\r\n"Ahl thanks, thanks!"\r\nFor he would come; he would have found some money. But he would,\r\nperhaps, go down yonder, not guessing she was here, and she told\r\nthe nurse to run to her house to fetch him.\r\n"Be quick!"\r\n"But, my dear lady, I\'m going, I\'m going!"\r\nShe wondered now that she had not thought of him from the first.\r\nYesterday he had given his word; he would not break it. And she\r\nalready saw herself at Lheureux\'s spreading out her three\r\nbank-notes on his bureau. Then she would have to invent some\r\nstory to explain matters to Bovary. What should it be?\r\nThe nurse, however, was a long while gone. But, as there was no\r\nclock in the cot, Emma feared she was perhaps exaggerating the\r\nlength of time. She began walking round the garden, step by step;\r\nshe went into the path by the hedge, and returned quickly, hoping\r\nthat the woman would have come back by another road. At last,\r\nweary of waiting, assailed by fears that she thrust from her, no\r\nlonger conscious whether she had been here a century or a moment,\r\nshe sat down in a corner, closed her eyes, and stopped her ears.\r\nThe gate grated; she sprang up. Before she had spoken Mere Rollet\r\nsaid to her--\r\n"There is no one at your house!"\r\n"What?"\r\n"Oh, no one! And the doctor is crying. He is calling for you;\r\nthey\'re looking for you."\r\nEmma answered nothing. She gasped as she turned her eyes about\r\nher, while the peasant woman, frightened at her face, drew back\r\ninstinctively, thinking her mad. Suddenly she struck her brow and\r\nuttered a cry; for the thought of Rodolphe, like a flash of\r\nlightning in a dark night, had passed into her soul. He was so\r\ngood, so delicate, so generous! And besides, should he hesitate\r\nto do her this service, she would know well enough how to\r\nconstrain him to it by re-waking, in a single moment, their lost\r\nlove. So she set out towards La Huchette, not seeing that she was\r\nhastening to offer herself to that which but a while ago had so\r\nangered her, not in the least conscious of her prostitution.']}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Eight\r\nShe asked herself as she walked along, "What am I going to say?\r\nHow shall I begin?" And as she went on she recognised the\r\nthickets, the trees, the sea-rushes on the hill, the chateau\r\nyonder. All the sensations of her first tenderness came back to\r\nher, and her poor aching heart opened out amorously. A warm wind\r\nblew in her face; the melting snow fell drop by drop from the\r\nbuds to the grass.\r\nShe entered, as she used to, through the small park-gate. She\r\nreached the avenue bordered by a double row of dense lime-trees.\r\nThey were swaying their long whispering branches to and fro. The\r\ndogs in their kennels all barked, and the noise of their voices\r\nresounded, but brought out no one.\r\nShe went up the large straight staircase with wooden balusters\r\nthat led to the corridor paved with dusty flags, into which\r\nseveral doors in a row opened, as in a monastery or an inn. His\r\nwas at the top, right at the end, on the left. When she placed\r\nher fingers on the lock her strength suddenly deserted her. She\r\nwas afraid, almost wished he would not be there, though this was\r\nher only hope, her last chance of salvation. She collected her\r\nthoughts for one moment, and, strengthening herself by the\r\nfeeling of present necessity, went in.\r\nHe was in front of the fire, both his feet on the mantelpiece,\r\nsmoking a pipe.\r\n"What! it is you!" he said, getting up hurriedly.\r\n"Yes, it is I, Rodolphe. I should like to ask your advice."\r\nAnd, despite all her efforts, it was impossible for her to\r\nopen her lips.\r\n"You have not changed; you are charming as ever!"\r\n"Oh," she replied bitterly, "they are poor charms since you\r\ndisdained them."\r\nThen he began a long explanation of his conduct, excusing himself\r\nin vague terms, in default of being able to invent better.\r\nShe yielded to his words, still more to his voice and the sight\r\nof him, so that, she pretended to believe, or perhaps believed;\r\nin the pretext he gave for their rupture; this was a secret on\r\nwhich depended the honour, the very life of a third person.\r\n"No matter!" she said, looking at him sadly. "I have suffered\r\nmuch."\r\nHe replied philosophically--\r\n"Such is life!"\r\n"Has life," Emma went on, "been good to you at least, since our\r\nseparation?"\r\n"Oh, neither good nor bad."\r\n"Perhaps it would have been better never to have parted."\r\n"Yes, perhaps."\r\n"You think so?" she said, drawing nearer, and she sighed. "Oh,\r\nRodolphe! if you but knew! I loved you so!"\r\nIt was then that she took his hand, and they remained some time,\r\ntheir fingers intertwined, like that first day at the Show. With\r\na gesture of pride he struggled against this emotion. But sinking\r\nupon his breast she said to him--\r\n"How did you think I could live without you? One cannot lose the\r\nhabit of happiness. I was desolate. I thought I should die. I\r\nwill tell you about all that and you will see. And you--you fled\r\nfrom me!"\r\nFor, all the three years, he had carefully avoided her in\r\nconsequence of that natural cowardice that characterises the\r\nstronger sex. Emma went on, with dainty little nods, more coaxing\r\nthan an amorous kitten--\r\n"You love others, confess it! Oh, I understand them, dear! I\r\nexcuse them. You probably seduced them as you seduced me. You are\r\nindeed a man; you have everything to make one love you. But we\'ll\r\nbegin again, won\'t we? We will love one another. See! I am\r\nlaughing; I am happy! Oh, speak!"\r\nAnd she was charming to see, with her eyes, in which trembled a\r\ntear, like the rain of a storm in a blue corolla.\r\nHe had drawn her upon his knees, and with the back of his hand\r\nwas caressing her smooth hair, where in the twilight was mirrored\r\nlike a golden arrow one last ray of the sun. She bent down her\r\nbrow; at last he kissed her on the eyelids quite gently with the\r\ntips of his lips.\r\n"Why, you have been crying! What for?"\r\nShe burst into tears. Rodolphe thought this was an outburst of\r\nher love. As she did not speak, he took this silence for a last\r\nremnant of resistance, and then he cried out--\r\n"Oh, forgive me! You are the only one who pleases me. I was\r\nimbecile and cruel. I love you. I will love you always. What is\r\nit. Tell me!" He was kneeling by her.\r\n"Well, I am ruined, Rodolphe! You must lend me three thousand\r\nfrancs."\r\n"But--but--" said he, getting up slowly, while his face assumed a\r\ngrave expression.\r\n"You know," she went on quickly, "that my husband had placed his\r\nwhole fortune at a notary\'s. He ran away. So we borrowed; the\r\npatients don\'t pay us. Moreover, the settling of the estate is\r\nnot yet done; we shall have the money later on. But to-day, for\r\nwant of three thousand francs, we are to be sold up. It is to be\r\nat once, this very moment, and, counting upon your friendship, I\r\nhave come to you."\r\n"Ah!" thought Rodolphe, turning very pale, "that was what she\r\ncame for." At last he said with a calm air--\r\n"Dear madame, I have not got them."\r\nHe did not lie. If he had had them, he would, no doubt, have\r\ngiven them, although it is generally disagreeable to do such fine\r\nthings: a demand for money being, of all the winds that blow upon\r\nlove, the coldest and most destructive.\r\nFirst she looked at him for some moments.\r\n"You have not got them!" she repeated several times. "You have\r\nnot got them! I ought to have spared myself this last shame. You\r\nnever loved me. You are no better than the others."\r\nShe was betraying, ruining herself.\r\nRodolphe interrupted her, declaring he was "hard up" himself.\r\n"Ah! I pity you," said Emma. "Yes--very much."\r\nAnd fixing her eyes upon an embossed carabine, that shone against\r\nits panoply, "But when one is so poor one doesn\'t have silver on\r\nthe butt of one\'s gun. One doesn\'t buy a clock inlaid with\r\ntortoise shell," she went on, pointing to a buhl timepiece, "nor\r\nsilver-gilt whistles for one\'s whips," and she touched them, "nor\r\ncharms for one\'s watch. Oh, he wants for nothing! even to a\r\nliqueur-stand in his room! For you love yourself; you live well.\r\nYou have a chateau, farms, woods; you go hunting; you travel to\r\nParis. Why, if it were but that," she cried, taking up two studs\r\nfrom the mantelpiece, "but the least of these trifles, one can\r\nget money for them. Oh, I do not want them, keep them!"\r\nAnd she threw the two links away from her, their gold chain\r\nbreaking as it struck against the wall.\r\n"But I! I would have given you everything. I would have sold all,\r\nworked for you with my hands, I would have begged on the\r\nhighroads for a smile, for a look, to hear you say \'Thanks!\' And\r\nyou sit there quietly in your arm-chair, as if you had not made\r\nme suffer enough already! But for you, and you know it, I might\r\nhave lived happily. What made you do it? Was it a bet? Yet you\r\nloved me--you said so. And but a moment since--Ah! it would have\r\nbeen better to have driven me away. My hands are hot with your\r\nkisses, and there is the spot on the carpet where at my knees you\r\nswore an eternity of love! You made me believe you; for two years\r\nyou held me in the most magnificent, the sweetest dream! Eh! Our\r\nplans for the journey, do you remember? Oh, your letter! your\r\nletter! it tore my heart! And then when I come back to him--to\r\nhim, rich, happy, free--to implore the help the first stranger\r\nwould give, a suppliant, and bringing back to him all my\r\ntenderness, he repulses me because it would cost him three\r\nthousand francs!"\r\n"I haven\'t got them," replied Rodolphe, with that perfect calm\r\nwith which resigned rage covers itself as with a shield.\r\nShe went out. The walls trembled, the ceiling was crushing her,\r\nand she passed back through the long alley, stumbling against the\r\nheaps of dead leaves scattered by the wind. At last she reached\r\nthe ha-ha hedge in front of the gate; she broke her nails against\r\nthe lock in her haste to open it. Then a hundred steps farther\r\non, breathless, almost falling, she stopped. And now turning\r\nround, she once more saw the impassive chateau, with the park,\r\nthe gardens, the three courts, and all the windows of the facade.\r\nShe remained lost in stupor, and having no more consciousness of\r\nherself than through the beating of her arteries, that she seemed\r\nto hear bursting forth like a deafening music filling all the\r\nfields. The earth beneath her feet was more yielding than the\r\nsea, and the furrows seemed to her immense brown waves breaking\r\ninto foam. Everything in her head, of memories, ideas, went off\r\nat once like a thousand pieces of fireworks. She saw her father,\r\nLheureux\'s closet, their room at home, another landscape. Madness\r\nwas coming upon her; she grew afraid, and managed to recover\r\nherself, in a confused way, it is true, for she did not in the,\r\nleast remember the cause of the terrible condition she was in,\r\nthat is to say, the question of money. She suffered only in her\r\nlove, and felt her soul passing from her in this memory; as\r\nwounded men, dying, feel their life ebb from their bleeding\r\nwounds.\r\nNight was falling, crows were flying about.\r\nSuddenly it seemed to her that fiery spheres were exploding in\r\nthe air like fulminating balls when they strike, and were\r\nwhirling, whirling, to melt at last upon the snow between the\r\nbranches of the trees. In the midst of each of them appeared the\r\nface of Rodolphe. They multiplied and drew near her, penetrating,\r\nher. It all disappeared; she recognised the lights of the houses\r\nthat shone through the fog.\r\nNow her situation, like an abyss, rose up before her. She was\r\npanting as if her heart would burst. Then in an ecstasy of\r\nheroism, that made her almost joyous, she ran down the hill,\r\ncrossed the cow-plank, the foot-path, the alley, the market, and\r\nreached the chemist\'s shop. She was about to enter, but at the\r\nsound of the bell someone might come, and slipping in by the\r\ngate, holding her breath, feeling her way along the walls, she\r\nwent as far as the door of the kitchen, where a candle stuck on\r\nthe stove was burning. Justin in his shirt-sleeves was carrying\r\nout a dish.\r\n"Ah! they are dining; I will wait."\r\nHe returned; she tapped at the window. He went out.\r\n"The key! the one for upstairs where he keeps the--"\r\n"What?"\r\nAnd he looked at her, astonished at the pallor of her face, that\r\nstood out white against the black background of the night. She\r\nseemed to him extraordinarily beautiful and majestic as a\r\nphantom. Without understanding what she wanted, he had the\r\npresentiment of something terrible.\r\nBut she went on quickly in a love voice; in a sweet, melting\r\nvoice, "I want it; give it to me."\r\nAs the partition wall was thin, they could hear the clatter of\r\nthe forks on the plates in the dining-room.\r\nShe pretended that she wanted to kill the rats that kept her from\r\nsleeping.\r\n"I must tell master."\r\n"No, stay!" Then with an indifferent air, "Oh, it\'s not worth\r\nwhile; I\'ll tell him presently. Come, light me upstairs."\r\nShe entered the corridor into which the laboratory door opened.\r\nAgainst the wall was a key labelled Capharnaum.\r\n"Justin!" called the druggist impatiently.\r\n"Let us go up."\r\nAnd he followed her. The key turned in the lock, and she went\r\nstraight to the third shelf, so well did her memory guide her,\r\nseized the blue jar, tore out the cork, plunged in her hand, and\r\nwithdrawing it full of a white powder, she began eating it.\r\n"Stop!" he cried, rushing at her.\r\n"Hush! someone will come."\r\nHe was in despair, was calling out.\r\n"Say nothing, or all the blame will fall on your master."\r\nThen she went home, suddenly calmed, and with something of the\r\nserenity of one that had performed a duty.\r\nWhen Charles, distracted by the news of the distraint, returned\r\nhome, Emma had just gone out. He cried aloud, wept, fainted, but\r\nshe did not return. Where could she be? He sent Felicite to\r\nHomais, to Monsieur Tuvache, to Lheureux, to the "Lion d\'Or,"\r\neverywhere, and in the intervals of his agony he saw his\r\nreputation destroyed, their fortune lost, Berthe\'s future ruined.\r\nBy what?--Not a word! He waited till six in the evening. At last,\r\nunable to bear it any longer, and fancying she had gone to Rouen,\r\nhe set out along the highroad, walked a mile, met no one, again\r\nwaited, and returned home. She had come back.\r\n"What was the matter? Why? Explain to me."\r\nShe sat down at her writing-table and wrote a letter, which she\r\nsealed slowly, adding the date and the hour. Then she said in a\r\nsolemn tone:\r\n"You are to read it to-morrow; till then, I pray you, do not ask\r\nme a single question. No, not one!"\r\n"But--"\r\n"Oh, leave me!"\r\nShe lay down full length on her bed. A bitter taste that she felt\r\nin her mouth awakened her. She saw Charles, and again closed her\r\neyes.\r\nShe was studying herself curiously, to see if she were not\r\nsuffering. But no! nothing as yet. She heard the ticking of the\r\nclock, the crackling of the fire, and Charles breathing as he\r\nstood upright by her bed.\r\n"Ahl it is but a little thing, death!" she thought. "I shall fall\r\nasleep and all will be over."\r\nShe drank a mouthful of water and turned to the wall. The\r\nfrightful taste of ink continued.\r\n"I am thirsty; oh! so thirsty," she sighed.\r\n"What is it?" said Charles, who was handing her a glass.\r\n"It is nothing! Open the window; I am choking."\r\nShe was seized with a sickness so sudden that she had hardly time\r\nto draw out her handkerchief from under the pillow.\r\n"Take it away," she said quickly; "throw it away."\r\nHe spoke to her; she did not answer. She lay motionless, afraid\r\nthat the slightest movement might make her vomit. But she felt an\r\nicy cold creeping from her feet to her heart.\r\n"Ah! it is beginning," she murmured.\r\n"What did you say?"\r\nShe turned her head from side to side with a gentle movement full\r\nof agony, while constantly opening her mouth as if something very\r\nheavy were weighing upon her tongue. At eight o\'clock the\r\nvomiting began again.\r\nCharles noticed that at the bottom of the basin there was a sort\r\nof white sediment sticking to the sides of the porcelain.\r\n"This is extraordinary--very singular," he repeated.\r\nBut she said in a firm voice, "No, you are mistaken."\r\nThen gently, and almost as caressing her, he passed his hand over\r\nher stomach. She uttered a sharp cry. He fell back\r\nterror-stricken.\r\nThen she began to groan, faintly at first. Her shoulders were\r\nshaken by a strong shuddering, and she was growing paler than the\r\nsheets in which her clenched fingers buried themselves. Her\r\nunequal pulse was now almost imperceptible.\r\nDrops of sweat oozed from her bluish face, that seemed as if\r\nrigid in the exhalations of a metallic vapour. Her teeth\r\nchattered, her dilated eyes looked vaguely about her, and to all\r\nquestions she replied only with a shake of the head; she even\r\nsmiled once or twice. Gradually, her moaning grew louder; a\r\nhollow shriek burst from her; she pretended she was better and\r\nthat she would get up presently. But she was seized with\r\nconvulsions and cried out--\r\n"Ah! my God! It is horrible!"\r\nHe threw himself on his knees by her bed.\r\n"Tell me! what have you eaten? Answer, for heaven\'s sake!"\r\nAnd he looked at her with a tenderness in his eyes such as she\r\nhad never seen.\r\n"Well, there--there!" she said in a faint voice. He flew to the\r\nwriting-table, tore open the seal, and read aloud: "Accuse no\r\none." He stopped, passed his hands across his eyes, and read it\r\nover again.\r\n"What! help--help!"\r\nHe could only keep repeating the word: "Poisoned! poisoned!"\r\nFelicite ran to Homais, who proclaimed it in the market-place;\r\nMadame Lefrancois heard it at the "Lion d\'Or"; some got up to go\r\nand tell their neighbours, and all night the village was on the\r\nalert.\r\nDistraught, faltering, reeling, Charles wandered about the room.\r\nHe knocked against the furniture, tore his hair, and the chemist\r\nhad never believed that there could be so terrible a sight.\r\nHe went home to write to Monsieur Canivet and to Doctor\r\nLariviere. He lost his head, and made more than fifteen rough\r\ncopies. Hippolyte went to Neufchatel, and Justin so spurred\r\nBovary\'s horse that he left it foundered and three parts dead by\r\nthe hill at Bois-Guillaume.\r\nCharles tried to look up his medical dictionary, but could not\r\nread it; the lines were dancing.\r\n"Be calm," said the druggist; "we have only to administer a\r\npowerful antidote. What is the poison?"\r\nCharles showed him the letter. It was arsenic.\r\n"Very well," said Homais, "we must make an analysis."\r\nFor he knew that in cases of poisoning an analysis must be made;\r\nand the other, who did not understand, answered--\r\n"Oh, do anything! save her!"\r\nThen going back to her, he sank upon the carpet, and lay there\r\nwith his head leaning against the edge of her bed, sobbing.\r\n"Don\'t cry," she said to him. "Soon I shall not trouble you any\r\nmore."\r\n"Why was it? Who drove you to it?"\r\nShe replied. "It had to be, my dear!"\r\n"Weren\'t you happy? Is it my fault? I did all I could!"\r\n"Yes, that is true--you are good--you."\r\nAnd she passed her hand slowly over his hair. The sweetness of\r\nthis sensation deepened his sadness; he felt his whole being\r\ndissolving in despair at the thought that he must lose her, just\r\nwhen she was confessing more love for him than ever. And he could\r\nthink of nothing; he did not know, he did not dare; the urgent\r\nneed for some immediate resolution gave the finishing stroke to\r\nthe turmoil of his mind.\r\nSo she had done, she thought, with all the treachery; and\r\nmeanness, and numberless desires that had tortured her. She hated\r\nno one now; a twilight dimness was settling upon her thoughts,\r\nand, of all earthly noises, Emma heard none but the intermittent\r\nlamentations of this poor heart, sweet and indistinct like the\r\necho of a symphony dying away.\r\n"Bring me the child," she said, raising herself on her elbow.\r\n"You are not worse, are you?" asked Charles.\r\n"No, no!"\r\nThe child, serious, and still half-asleep, was carried in on the\r\nservant\'s arm in her long white nightgown, from which her bare\r\nfeet peeped out. She looked wonderingly at the disordered room,\r\nand half-closed her eyes, dazzled by the candles burning on the\r\ntable. They reminded her, no doubt, of the morning of New Year\'s\r\nday and Mid-Lent, when thus awakened early by candle-light she\r\ncame to her mother\'s bed to fetch her presents, for she began\r\nsaying--\r\n"But where is it, mamma?" And as everybody was silent, "But I\r\ncan\'t see my little stocking."\r\nFelicite held her over the bed while she still kept looking\r\ntowards the mantelpiece.\r\n"Has nurse taken it?" she asked.\r\nAnd at this name, that carried her back to the memory of her\r\nadulteries and her calamities, Madame Bovary turned away her\r\nhead, as at the loathing of another bitterer poison that rose to\r\nher mouth. But Berthe remained perched on the bed.\r\n"Oh, how big your eyes are, mamma! How pale you are! how hot you\r\nare!"\r\nHer mother looked at her. "I am frightened!" cried the child,\r\nrecoiling.\r\nEmma took her hand to kiss it; the child struggled.\r\n"That will do. Take her away," cried Charles, who was sobbing in\r\nthe alcove.\r\nThen the symptoms ceased for a moment; she seemed less agitated;\r\nand at every insignificant word, at every respiration a little\r\nmore easy, he regained hope. At last, when Canivet came in, he\r\nthrew himself into his arms.\r\n"Ah! it is you. Thanks! You are good! But she is better. See!\r\nlook at her."\r\nHis colleague was by no means of this opinion, and, as he said of\r\nhimself, "never beating about the bush," he prescribed, an emetic\r\nin order to empty the stomach completely.\r\nShe soon began vomiting blood. Her lips became drawn. Her limbs\r\nwere convulsed, her whole body covered with brown spots, and her\r\npulse slipped beneath the fingers like a stretched thread, like a\r\nharp-string nearly breaking.\r\nAfter this she began to scream horribly. She cursed the poison,\r\nrailed at it, and implored it to be quick, and thrust away with\r\nher stiffened arms everything that Charles, in more agony than\r\nherself, tried to make her drink. He stood up, his handkerchief\r\nto his lips, with a rattling sound in his throat, weeping, and\r\nchoked by sobs that shook his whole body. Felicite was running\r\nhither and thither in the room. Homais, motionless, uttered great\r\nsighs; and Monsieur Canivet, always retaining his self-command,\r\nnevertheless began to feel uneasy.\r\n"The devil! yet she has been purged, and from the moment that the\r\ncause ceases--"\r\n"The effect must cease," said Homais, "that is evident."\r\n"Oh, save her!" cried Bovary.\r\nAnd, without listening to the chemist, who was still venturing\r\nthe hypothesis, "It is perhaps a salutary paroxysm," Canivet was\r\nabout to administer some theriac, when they heard the cracking of\r\na whip; all the windows rattled, and a post-chaise drawn by three\r\nhorses abreast, up to their ears in mud, drove at a gallop round\r\nthe corner of the market. It was Doctor Lariviere.\r\nThe apparition of a god would not have caused more commotion.\r\nBovary raised his hands; Canivet stopped short; and Homais pulled\r\noff his skull-cap long before the doctor had come in.\r\nHe belonged to that great school of surgery begotten of Bichat,\r\nto that generation, now extinct, of philosophical practitioners,\r\nwho, loving their art with a fanatical love, exercised it with\r\nenthusiasm and wisdom. Everyone in his hospital trembled when he\r\nwas angry; and his students so revered him that they tried, as\r\nsoon as they were themselves in practice, to imitate him as much\r\nas possible. So that in all the towns about they were found\r\nwearing his long wadded merino overcoat and black frock-coat,\r\nwhose buttoned cuffs slightly covered his brawny hands--very\r\nbeautiful hands, and that never knew gloves, as though to be more\r\nready to plunge into suffering. Disdainful of honours, of titles,\r\nand of academies, like one of the old Knight-Hospitallers,\r\ngenerous, fatherly to the poor, and practising virtue without\r\nbelieving in it, he would almost have passed for a saint if the\r\nkeenness of his intellect had not caused him to be feared as a\r\ndemon. His glance, more penetrating than his bistouries, looked\r\nstraight into your soul, and dissected every lie athwart all\r\nassertions and all reticences. And thus he went along, full of\r\nthat debonair majesty that is given by the consciousness of great\r\ntalent, of fortune, and of forty years of a labourious and\r\nirreproachable life.\r\nHe frowned as soon as he had passed the door when he saw the\r\ncadaverous face of Emma stretched out on her back with her mouth\r\nopen. Then, while apparently listening to Canivet, he rubbed his\r\nfingers up and down beneath his nostrils, and repeated--\r\n"Good! good!\r\nBut he made a slow gesture with his shoulders. Bovary watched\r\nhim; they looked at one another; and this man, accustomed as he\r\nwas to the sight of pain, could not keep back a tear that fell on\r\nhis shirt-frill.\r\nHe tried to take Canivet into the next room. Charles followed\r\nhim.\r\n"She is very ill, isn\'t she? If we put on sinapisms? Anything!\r\nOh, think of something, you who have saved so many!"\r\nCharles caught him in both his arms, and gazed at him wildly,\r\nimploringly, half-fainting against his breast.\r\n"Come, my poor fellow, courage! There is nothing more to be\r\ndone."\r\nAnd Doctor Lariviere turned away.\r\n"You are going?"\r\n"I will come back."\r\nHe went out only to give an order to the coachman, with Monsieur\r\nCanivet, who did not care either to have Emma die under his\r\nhands.\r\nThe chemist rejoined them on the Place. He could not by\r\ntemperament keep away from celebrities, so he begged Monsieur\r\nLariviere to do him the signal honour of accepting some\r\nbreakfast.\r\nHe sent quickly to the "Lion d\'Or" for some pigeons; to the\r\nbutcher\'s for all the cutlets that were to be had; to Tuvache for\r\ncream; and to Lestiboudois for eggs; and the druggist himself\r\naided in the preparations, while Madame Homais was saying as she\r\npulled together the strings of her jacket--\r\n"You must excuse us, sir, for in this poor place, when one hasn\'t\r\nbeen told the night before--"\r\n"Wine glasses!" whispered Homais.\r\n"If only we were in town, we could fall back upon stuffed\r\ntrotters."\r\n"Be quiet! Sit down, doctor!"\r\nHe thought fit, after the first few mouthfuls, to give some\r\ndetails as to the catastrophe.\r\n"We first had a feeling of siccity in the pharynx, then\r\nintolerable pains at the epigastrium, super purgation, coma."\r\n"But how did she poison herself?"\r\n"I don\'t know, doctor, and I don\'t even know where she can have\r\nprocured the arsenious acid."\r\nJustin, who was just bringing in a pile of plates, began to\r\ntremble.\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said the chemist.\r\nAt this question the young man dropped the whole lot on the\r\nground with a crash.\r\n"Imbecile!" cried Homais. "awkward lout! block-head! confounded\r\nass!"\r\nBut suddenly controlling himself--\r\n"I wished, doctor, to make an analysis, and primo I delicately\r\nintroduced a tube--"\r\n"You would have done better," said the physician, "to introduce\r\nyour fingers into her throat."\r\nHis colleague was silent, having just before privately received a\r\nsevere lecture about his emetic, so that this good Canivet, so\r\narrogant and so verbose at the time of the clubfoot, was to-day\r\nvery modest. He smiled without ceasing in an approving manner.\r\nHomais dilated in Amphytrionic pride, and the affecting thought\r\nof Bovary vaguely contributed to his pleasure by a kind of\r\negotistic reflex upon himself. Then the presence of the doctor\r\ntransported him. He displayed his erudition, cited pell-mell\r\ncantharides, upas, the manchineel, vipers.\r\n"I have even read that various persons have found themselves\r\nunder toxicological symptoms, and, as it were, thunderstricken by\r\nblack-pudding that had been subjected to a too vehement\r\nfumigation. At least, this was stated in a very fine report drawn\r\nup by one of our pharmaceutical chiefs, one of our masters, the\r\nillustrious Cadet de Gassicourt!"\r\nMadame Homais reappeared, carrying one of those shaky machines\r\nthat are heated with spirits of wine; for Homais liked to make\r\nhis coffee at table, having, moreover, torrefied it, pulverised\r\nit, and mixed it himself.\r\n"Saccharum, doctor?" said he, offering the sugar.\r\nThen he had all his children brought down, anxious to have the\r\nphysician\'s opinion on their constitutions.\r\nAt last Monsieur Lariviere was about to leave, when Madame Homais\r\nasked for a consultation about her husband. He was making his\r\nblood too thick by going to sleep every evening after dinner.\r\n"Oh, it isn\'t his blood that\'s too thick," said the physician.\r\nAnd, smiling a little at his unnoticed joke, the doctor opened\r\nthe door. But the chemist\'s shop was full of people; he had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in getting rid of Monsieur Tuvache, who\r\nfeared his spouse would get inflammation of the lungs, because\r\nshe was in the habit of spitting on the ashes; then of Monsieur\r\nBinet, who sometimes experienced sudden attacks of great hunger;\r\nand of Madame Caron, who suffered from tinglings; of Lheureux,\r\nwho had vertigo; of Lestiboudois, who had rheumatism; and of\r\nMadame Lefrancois, who had heartburn. At last the three horses\r\nstarted; and it was the general opinion that he had not shown\r\nhimself at all obliging.\r\nPublic attention was distracted by the appearance of Monsieur\r\nBournisien, who was going across the market with the holy oil.\r\nHomais, as was due to his principles, compared priests to ravens\r\nattracted by the odour of death. The sight of an ecclesiastic was\r\npersonally disagreeable to him, for the cassock made him think of\r\nthe shroud, and he detested the one from some fear of the other.\r\nNevertheless, not shrinking from what he called his mission, he\r\nreturned to Bovary\'s in company with Canivet whom Monsieur\r\nLariviere, before leaving, had strongly urged to make this visit;\r\nand he would, but for his wife\'s objections, have taken his two\r\nsons with him, in order to accustom them to great occasions; that\r\nthis might be a lesson, an example, a solemn picture, that should\r\nremain in their heads later on.\r\nThe room when they went in was full of mournful solemnity. On the\r\nwork-table, covered over with a white cloth, there were five or\r\nsix small balls of cotton in a silver dish, near a large crucifix\r\nbetween two lighted candles.\r\nEmma, her chin sunken upon her breast, had her eyes inordinately\r\nwide open, and her poor hands wandered over the sheets with that\r\nhideous and soft movement of the dying, that seems as if they\r\nwanted already to cover themselves with the shroud. Pale as a\r\nstatue and with eyes red as fire, Charles, not weeping, stood\r\nopposite her at the foot of the bed, while the priest, bending\r\none knee, was muttering words in a low voice.\r\nShe turned her face slowly, and seemed filled with joy on seeing\r\nsuddenly the violet stole, no doubt finding again, in the midst\r\nof a temporary lull in her pain, the lost voluptuousness of her\r\nfirst mystical transports, with the visions of eternal beatitude\r\nthat were beginning.\r\nThe priest rose to take the crucifix; then she stretched forward\r\nher neck as one who is athirst, and glueing her lips to the body\r\nof the Man-God, she pressed upon it with all her expiring\r\nstrength the fullest kiss of love that she had ever given. Then\r\nhe recited the Misereatur and the Indulgentiam, dipped his right\r\nthumb in the oil, and began to give extreme unction. First upon\r\nthe eyes, that had so coveted all worldly pomp; then upon the\r\nnostrils, that had been greedy of the warm breeze and amorous\r\nodours; then upon the mouth, that had uttered lies, that had\r\ncurled with pride and cried out in lewdness; then upon the hands\r\nthat had delighted in sensual touches; and finally upon the soles\r\nof the feet, so swift of yore, when she was running to satisfy\r\nher desires, and that would now walk no more.\r\nThe cure wiped his fingers, threw the bit of cotton dipped in oil\r\ninto the fire, and came and sat down by the dying woman, to tell\r\nher that she must now blend her sufferings with those of Jesus\r\nChrist and abandon herself to the divine mercy.\r\nFinishing his exhortations, he tried to place in her hand a\r\nblessed candle, symbol of the celestial glory with which she was\r\nsoon to be surrounded. Emma, too weak, could not close her\r\nfingers, and the taper, but for Monsieur Bournisien would have\r\nfallen to the ground.\r\nHowever, she was not quite so pale, and her face had an\r\nexpression of serenity as if the sacrament had cured her.\r\nThe priest did not fail to point this out; he even explained to\r\nBovary that the Lord sometimes prolonged the life of persons when\r\nhe thought it meet for their salvation; and Charles remembered\r\nthe day when, so near death, she had received the communion.\r\nPerhaps there was no need to despair, he thought.\r\nIn fact, she looked around her slowly, as one awakening from a\r\ndream; then in a distinct voice she asked for her looking-glass,\r\nand remained some time bending over it, until the big tears fell\r\nfrom her eyes. Then she turned away her head with a sigh and fell\r\nback upon the pillows.\r\nHer chest soon began panting rapidly; the whole of her tongue\r\nprotruded from her mouth; her eyes, as they rolled, grew paler,\r\nlike the two globes of a lamp that is going out, so that one\r\nmight have thought her already dead but for the fearful labouring\r\nof her ribs, shaken by violent breathing, as if the soul were\r\nstruggling to free itself. Felicite knelt down before the\r\ncrucifix, and the druggist himself slightly bent his knees, while\r\nMonsieur Canivet looked out vaguely at the Place. Bournisien had\r\nagain begun to pray, his face bowed against the edge of the bed,\r\nhis long black cassock trailing behind him in the room. Charles\r\nwas on the other side, on his knees, his arms outstretched\r\ntowards Emma. He had taken her hands and pressed them, shuddering\r\nat every beat of her heart, as at the shaking of a falling ruin.\r\nAs the death-rattle became stronger the priest prayed faster; his\r\nprayers mingled with the stifled sobs of Bovary, and sometimes\r\nall seemed lost in the muffled murmur of the Latin syllables that\r\ntolled like a passing bell.\r\nSuddenly on the pavement was heard a loud noise of clogs and the\r\nclattering of a stick; and a voice rose--a raucous voice--that\r\nsang--\r\n"Maids an the warmth of a summer day\r\nDream of love and of love always"\r\nEmma raised herself like a galvanised corpse, her hair undone,\r\nher eyes fixed, staring.\r\n"Where the sickle blades have been,\r\nNannette, gathering ears of corn,\r\nPasses bending down, my queen,\r\nTo the earth where they were born."\r\n"The blind man!" she cried. And Emma began to laugh, an\r\natrocious, frantic, despairing laugh, thinking she saw the\r\nhideous face of the poor wretch that stood out against the\r\neternal night like a menace.\r\n"The wind is strong this summer day,\r\nHer petticoat has flown away."\r\nShe fell back upon the mattress in a convulsion. They all drew\r\nnear. She was dead.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Nine\r\nThere is always after the death of anyone a kind of stupefaction;\r\nso difficult is it to grasp this advent of nothingness and to\r\nresign ourselves to believe in it. But still, when he saw that\r\nshe did not move, Charles threw himself upon her, crying--\r\n"Farewell! farewell!"\r\nHomais and Canivet dragged him from the room.\r\n"Restrain yourself "\r\n"Yes." said he, struggling, "I\'ll be quiet. I\'ll not do anything.\r\nBut leave me alone. I want to see her. She is my wife!"\r\nAnd he wept.\r\n"Cry," said the chemist; "let nature take her course; that will\r\nsolace you."\r\nWeaker than a child, Charles let himself be led downstairs into\r\nthe sitting-room, and Monsieur Homais soon went home. On the\r\nPlace he was accosted by the blind man, who, having dragged\r\nhimself as far as Yonville, in the hope of getting the\r\nantiphlogistic pomade, was asking every passer-by where the\r\ndruggist lived.\r\n"There now! as if I hadn\'t got other fish to fry. Well, so much\r\nthe worse; you must come later on."\r\nAnd he entered the shop hurriedly.\r\nHe had to write two letters, to prepare a soothing potion for\r\nBovary, to invent some lie that would conceal the poisoning, and\r\nwork it up into an article for the "Fanal," without counting the\r\npeople who were waiting to get the news from him; and when the\r\nYonvillers had all heard his story of the arsenic that she had\r\nmistaken for sugar in making a vanilla cream. Homais once more\r\nreturned to Bovary\'s.\r\nHe found him alone (Monsieur Canivet had left), sitting in an\r\narm-chair near the window, staring with an idiotic look at the\r\nflags of the floor.\r\n"Now," said the chemist, "you ought yourself to fix the hour for\r\nthe ceremony."\r\n"Why? What ceremony?" Then, in a stammering, frightened voice,\r\n"Oh, no! not that. No! I want to see her here."\r\nHomais, to keep himself in countenance, took up a water-bottle on\r\nthe whatnot to water the geraniums.\r\n"Ah! thanks," said Charles; "you are good."\r\nBut he did not finish, choking beneath the crowd of memories that\r\nthis action of the druggist recalled to him.\r\nThen to distract him, Homais thought fit to talk a little\r\nhorticulture: plants wanted humidity. Charles bowed his head in\r\nsign of approbation.\r\n"Besides, the fine days will soon be here again."\r\n"Ah!" said Bovary.\r\nThe druggist, at his wit\'s end, began softly to draw aside the\r\nsmall window-curtain.\r\n"Hallo! there\'s Monsieur Tuvache passing."\r\nCharles repeated like a machine---\r\n"Monsieur Tuvache passing!"\r\nHomais did not dare to speak to him again about the funeral\r\narrangements; it was the priest who succeeded in reconciling him\r\nto them.\r\nHe shut himself up in his consulting-room, took a pen, and after\r\nsobbing for some time, wrote--\r\n"I wish her to be buried in her wedding-dress, with white shoes,\r\nand a wreath. Her hair is to be spread out over her shoulders.\r\nThree coffins, one of oak, one of mahogany, one of lead. Let no\r\none say anything to me. I shall have strength. Over all there is\r\nto be placed a large piece of green velvet. This is my wish; see\r\nthat it is done."\r\nThe two men were much surprised at Bovary\'s romantic ideas. The\r\nchemist at once went to him and said--\r\n"This velvet seems to me a superfetation. Besides, the expense--"\r\n"What\'s that to you?" cried Charles. "Leave me! You did not love\r\nher. Go!"\r\nThe priest took him by the arm for a turn in the garden. He\r\ndiscoursed on the vanity of earthly things. God was very great,\r\nwas very good: one must submit to his decrees without a murmur;\r\nnay, must even thank him.\r\nCharles burst out into blasphemies: "I hate your God!"\r\n"The spirit of rebellion is still upon you," sighed the\r\necclesiastic.\r\nBovary was far away. He was walking with great strides along by\r\nthe wall, near the espalier, and he ground his teeth; he raised\r\nto heaven looks of malediction, but not so much as a leaf\r\nstirred.\r\nA fine rain was falling: Charles, whose chest was bare, at last\r\nbegan to shiver; he went in and sat down in the kitchen.\r\nAt six o\'clock a noise like a clatter of old iron was heard on\r\nthe Place; it was the "Hirondelle" coming in, and he remained\r\nwith his forehead against the windowpane, watching all the\r\npassengers get out, one after the other. Felicite put down a\r\nmattress for him in the drawing-room. He threw himself upon it\r\nand fell asleep.\r\nAlthough a philosopher, Monsieur Homais respected the dead. So\r\nbearing no grudge to poor Charles, he came back again in the\r\nevening to sit up with the body; bringing with him three volumes\r\nand a pocket-book for taking notes.\r\nMonsieur Bournisien was there, and two large candles were burning\r\nat the head of the bed, that had been taken out of the alcove.\r\nThe druggist, on whom the silence weighed, was not long before he\r\nbegan formulating some regrets about this "unfortunate young\r\nwoman." and the priest replied that there was nothing to do now\r\nbut pray for her.\r\n"Yet," Homais went on, "one of two things; either she died in a\r\nstate of grace (as the Church has it), and then she has no need\r\nof our prayers; or else she departed impertinent (that is, I\r\nbelieve, the ecclesiastical expression), and then--"\r\nBournisien interrupted him, replying testily that it was none the\r\nless necessary to pray.\r\n"But," objected the chemist, "since God knows all our needs, what\r\ncan be the good of prayer?"\r\n"What!" cried the ecclesiastic, "prayer! Why, aren\'t you a\r\nChristian?"\r\n"Excuse me," said Homais; "I admire Christianity. To begin with,\r\nit enfranchised the slaves, introduced into the world a\r\nmorality--"\r\n"That isn\'t the question. All the texts-"\r\n"Oh! oh! As to texts, look at history; it, is known that all the\r\ntexts have been falsified by the Jesuits."\r\nCharles came in, and advancing towards the bed, slowly drew the\r\ncurtains.\r\nEmma\'s head was turned towards her right shoulder, the corner of\r\nher mouth, which was open, seemed like a black hole at the lower\r\npart of her face; her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her\r\nhands; a kind of white dust besprinkled her lashes, and her eyes\r\nwere beginning to disappear in that viscous pallor that looks\r\nlike a thin web, as if spiders had spun it over. The sheet sunk\r\nin from her breast to her knees, and then rose at the tips of her\r\ntoes, and it seemed to Charles that infinite masses, an enormous\r\nload, were weighing upon her.\r\nThe church clock struck two. They could hear the loud murmur of\r\nthe river flowing in the darkness at the foot of the terrace.\r\nMonsieur Bournisien from time to time blew his nose noisily, and\r\nHomais\' pen was scratching over the paper.\r\n"Come, my good friend," he said, "withdraw; this spectacle is\r\ntearing you to pieces."\r\nCharles once gone, the chemist and the cure recommenced their\r\ndiscussions.\r\n"Read Voltaire," said the one, "read D\'Holbach, read the\r\n\'Encyclopaedia\'!"\r\n"Read the \'Letters of some Portuguese Jews,\'" said the other;\r\n"read \'The Meaning of Christianity,\' by Nicolas, formerly a\r\nmagistrate."\r\nThey grew warm, they grew red, they both talked at once without\r\nlistening to each other. Bournisien was scandalized at such\r\naudacity; Homais marvelled at such stupidity; and they were on\r\nthe point of insulting one another when Charles suddenly\r\nreappeared. A fascination drew him. He was continually coming\r\nupstairs.\r\nHe stood opposite her, the better to see her, and he lost himself\r\nin a contemplation so deep that it was no longer painful.\r\nHe recalled stories of catalepsy, the marvels of magnetism, and\r\nhe said to himself that by willing it with all his force he might\r\nperhaps succeed in reviving her. Once he even bent towards he,\r\nand cried in a low voice, "Emma! Emma!" His strong breathing made\r\nthe flames of the candles tremble against the wall.\r\nAt daybreak Madame Bovary senior arrived. Charles as he embraced\r\nher burst into another flood of tears. She tried, as the chemist\r\nhad done, to make some remarks to him on the expenses of the\r\nfuneral. He became so angry that she was silent, and he even\r\ncommissioned her to go to town at once and buy what was\r\nnecessary.\r\nCharles remained alone the whole afternoon; they had taken Berthe\r\nto Madame Homais\'; Felicite was in the room upstairs with Madame\r\nLefrancois.\r\nIn the evening he had some visitors. He rose, pressed their\r\nhands, unable to speak. Then they sat down near one another, and\r\nformed a large semicircle in front of the fire. With lowered\r\nfaces, and swinging one leg crossed over the other knee, they\r\nuttered deep sighs at intervals; each one was inordinately bored,\r\nand yet none would be the first to go.\r\nHomais, when he returned at nine o\'clock (for the last two days\r\nonly Homais seemed to have been on the Place), was laden with a\r\nstock of camphor, of benzine, and aromatic herbs. He also carried\r\na large jar full of chlorine water, to keep off all miasmata.\r\nJust then the servant, Madame Lefrancois, and Madame Bovary\r\nsenior were busy about Emma, finishing dressing her, and they\r\nwere drawing down the long stiff veil that covered her to her\r\nsatin shoes.\r\nFelicite was sobbing--"Ah! my poor mistress! my poor mistress!"\r\n"Look at her," said the landlady, sighing; "how pretty she still\r\nis! Now, couldn\'t you swear she was going to get up in a minute?"\r\nThen they bent over her to put on her wreath. They had to raise\r\nthe head a little, and a rush of black liquid issued, as if she\r\nwere vomiting, from her mouth.\r\n"Oh, goodness! The dress; take care!" cried Madame Lefrancois.\r\n"Now, just come and help," she said to the chemist. "Perhaps\r\nyou\'re afraid?"\r\n"I afraid?" replied he, shrugging his shoulders. "I dare say!\r\nI\'ve seen all sorts of things at the hospital when I was studying\r\npharmacy. We used to make punch in the dissecting room!\r\nNothingness does not terrify a philosopher; and, as I often say,\r\nI even intend to leave my body to the hospitals, in order, later\r\non, to serve science."\r\nThe cure on his arrival inquired how Monsieur Bovary was, and, on\r\nthe reply of the druggist, went on--"The blow, you see, is still\r\ntoo recent."\r\nThen Homais congratulated him on not being exposed, like other\r\npeople, to the loss of a beloved companion; whence there followed\r\na discussion on the celibacy of priests.\r\n"For," said the chemist, "it is unnatural that a man should do\r\nwithout women! There have been crimes--"\r\n"But, good heaven!" cried the ecclesiastic, "how do you expect an\r\nindividual who is married to keep the secrets of the\r\nconfessional, for example?"\r\nHomais fell foul of the confessional. Bournisien defended it; he\r\nenlarged on the acts of restitution that it brought about. He\r\ncited various anecdotes about thieves who had suddenly become\r\nhonest. Military men on approaching the tribunal of penitence had\r\nfelt the scales fall from their eyes. At Fribourg there was a\r\nminister--\r\nHis companion was asleep. Then he felt somewhat stifled by the\r\nover-heavy atmosphere of the room; he opened the window; this\r\nawoke the chemist.\r\n"Come, take a pinch of snuff," he said to him. "Take it; it\'ll\r\nrelieve you."\r\nA continual barking was heard in the distance. "Do you hear that\r\ndog howling?" said the chemist.\r\n"They smell the dead," replied the priest. "It\'s like bees; they\r\nleave their hives on the decease of any person."\r\nHomais made no remark upon these prejudices, for he had again\r\ndropped asleep. Monsieur Bournisien, stronger than he, went on\r\nmoving his lips gently for some time, then insensibly his chin\r\nsank down, he let fall his big black boot, and began to snore.\r\nThey sat opposite one another, with protruding stomachs,\r\npuffed-up faces, and frowning looks, after so much disagreement\r\nuniting at last in the same human weakness, and they moved no\r\nmore than the corpse by their side, that seemed to be sleeping.\r\nCharles coming in did not wake them. It was the last time; he\r\ncame to bid her farewell.\r\nThe aromatic herbs were still smoking, and spirals of bluish\r\nvapour blended at the window-sash with the fog that was coming\r\nin. There were few stars, and the night was warm. The wax of the\r\ncandles fell in great drops upon the sheets of the bed. Charles\r\nwatched them burn, tiring his eyes against the glare of their\r\nyellow flame.\r\nThe watering on the satin gown shimmered white as moonlight. Emma\r\nwas lost beneath it; and it seemed to him that, spreading beyond\r\nher own self, she blended confusedly with everything around her--\r\nthe silence, the night, the passing wind, the damp odours rising\r\nfrom the ground.\r\nThen suddenly he saw her in the garden at Tostes, on a bench\r\nagainst the thorn hedge, or else at Rouen in the streets, on the\r\nthreshold of their house, in the yard at Bertaux. He again heard\r\nthe laughter of the happy boys beneath the apple-trees: the room\r\nwas filled with the perfume of her hair; and her dress rustled in\r\nhis arms with a noise like electricity. The dress was still the\r\nsame.\r\nFor a long while he thus recalled all his lost joys, her\r\nattitudes, her movements, the sound of her voice. Upon one fit of\r\ndespair followed another, and even others, inexhaustible as the\r\nwaves of an overflowing sea.\r\nA terrible curiosity seized him. Slowly, with the tips of bis\r\nfingers, palpitating, he lifted her veil. But he uttered a cry of\r\nhorror that awoke the other two.\r\nThey dragged him down into the sitting-room. Then Felicite came\r\nup to say that he wanted some of her hair.\r\n"Cut some off," replied the druggist.\r\nAnd as she did not dare to, he himself stepped forward, scissors\r\nin hand. He trembled so that he pierced the skin of the temple in\r\nseveral places. At last, stiffening himself against emotion,\r\nHomais gave two or three great cuts at random that left white\r\npatches amongst that beautiful black hair.\r\nThe chemist and the cure plunged anew into their occupations, not\r\nwithout sleeping from time to time, of which they accused each\r\nother reciprocally at each fresh awakening. Then Monsieur\r\nBournisien sprinkled the room with holy water and Homais threw a\r\nlittle chlorine water on the floor.\r\nFelicite had taken care to put on the chest of drawers, for each\r\nof them, a bottle of brandy, some cheese, and a large roll. And\r\nthe druggist, who could not hold out any longer, about four in\r\nthe morning sighed--\r\n"My word! I should like to take some sustenance."\r\nThe priest did not need any persuading; he went out to go and say\r\nmass, came back, and then they ate and hobnobbed, giggling a\r\nlittle without knowing why, stimulated by that vague gaiety that\r\ncomes upon us after times of sadness, and at the last glass the\r\npriest said to the druggist, as he clapped him on the shoulder--\r\n"We shall end by understanding one another."\r\nIn the passage downstairs they met the undertaker\'s men, who were\r\ncoming in. Then Charles for two hours had to suffer the torture\r\nof hearing the hammer resound against the wood. Next day they\r\nlowered her into her oak coffin, that was fitted into the other\r\ntwo; but as the bier was too large, they had to fill up the gaps\r\nwith the wool of a mattress. At last, when the three lids had\r\nbeen planed down, nailed, soldered, it was placed outside in\r\nfront of the door; the house was thrown open, and the people of\r\nYonville began to flock round.\r\nOld Rouault arrived, and fainted on the Place when he saw the\r\nblack cloth!'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Ten\r\nHe had only received the chemist\'s letter thirty-six hours after\r\nthe event; and, from consideration for his feelings, Homais had\r\nso worded it that it was impossible to make out what it was all\r\nabout.\r\nFirst, the old fellow had fallen as if struck by apoplexy. Next,\r\nhe understood that she was not dead, but she might be. At last,\r\nhe had put on his blouse, taken his hat, fastened his spurs to\r\nhis boots, and set out at full speed; and the whole of the way\r\nold Rouault, panting, was torn by anguish. Once even he was\r\nobliged to dismount. He was dizzy; he heard voices round about\r\nhim; he felt himself going mad.\r\nDay broke. He saw three black hens asleep in a tree. He\r\nshuddered, horrified at this omen. Then he promised the Holy\r\nVirgin three chasubles for the church, and that he would go\r\nbarefooted from the cemetery at Bertaux to the chapel of\r\nVassonville.\r\nHe entered Maromme shouting for the people of the inn, burst open\r\nthe door with a thrust of his shoulder, made for a sack of oats,\r\nemptied a bottle of sweet cider into the manger, and again\r\nmounted his nag, whose feet struck fire as it dashed along.\r\nHe said to himself that no doubt they would save her; the doctors\r\nwould discover some remedy surely. He remembered all the\r\nmiraculous cures he had been told about. Then she appeared to him\r\ndead. She was there; before his eyes, lying on her back in the\r\nmiddle of the road. He reined up, and the hallucination\r\ndisappeared.\r\nAt Quincampoix, to give himself heart, he drank three cups of\r\ncoffee one after the other. He fancied they had made a mistake in\r\nthe name in writing. He looked for the letter in his pocket, felt\r\nit there, but did not dare to open it.\r\nAt last he began to think it was all a joke; someone\'s spite, the\r\njest of some wag; and besides, if she were dead, one would have\r\nknown it. But no! There was nothing extraordinary about the\r\ncountry; the sky was blue, the trees swayed; a flock of sheep\r\npassed. He saw the village; he was seen coming bending forward\r\nupon his horse, belabouring it with great blows, the girths\r\ndripping with blood.\r\nWhen he had recovered consciousness, he fell, weeping, into\r\nBovary\'s arms: "My girl! Emma! my child! tell me--"\r\nThe other replied, sobbing, "I don\'t know! I don\'t know! It\'s a\r\ncurse!"\r\nThe druggist separated them. "These horrible details are useless.\r\nI will tell this gentleman all about it. Here are the people\r\ncoming. Dignity! Come now! Philosophy!"\r\nThe poor fellow tried to show himself brave, and repeated several\r\ntimes. "Yes! courage!"\r\n"Oh," cried the old man, "so I will have, by God! I\'ll go along\r\no\' her to the end!"\r\nThe bell began tolling. All was ready; they had to start. And\r\nseated in a stall of the choir, side by side, they saw pass and\r\nrepass in front of them continually the three chanting\r\nchoristers.\r\nThe serpent-player was blowing with all his might. Monsieur\r\nBournisien, in full vestments, was singing in a shrill voice. He\r\nbowed before the tabernacle, raising his hands, stretched out his\r\narms. Lestiboudois went about the church with his whalebone\r\nstick. The bier stood near the lectern, between four rows of\r\ncandles. Charles felt inclined to get up and put them out.\r\nYet he tried to stir himself to a feeling of devotion, to throw\r\nhimself into the hope of a future life in which he should see her\r\nagain. He imagined to himself she had gone on a long journey, far\r\naway, for along time. But when he thought of her lying there, and\r\nthat all was over, that they would lay her in the earth, he was\r\nseized with a fierce, gloomy, despairful rage. At times he\r\nthought he felt nothing more, and he enjoyed this lull in his\r\npain, whilst at the same time he reproached himself for being a\r\nwretch.\r\nThe sharp noise of an iron-ferruled stick was heard on the\r\nstones, striking them at irregular intervals. It came from the\r\nend of the church, and stopped short at the lower aisles. A man\r\nin a coarse brown jacket knelt down painfully. It was Hippolyte,\r\nthe stable-boy at the "Lion d\'Or." He had put on his new leg.\r\nOne of the choristers went round the nave making a collection,\r\nand the coppers chinked one after the other on the silver plate.\r\n"Oh, make haste! I am in pain!" cried Bovary, angrily throwing\r\nhim a five-franc piece. The churchman thanked him with a deep bow.\r\nThey sang, they knelt, they stood up; it was endless! He\r\nremembered that once, in the early times, they had been to mass\r\ntogether, and they had sat down on the other side, on the right,\r\nby the wall. The bell began again. There was a great moving of\r\nchairs; the bearers slipped their three staves under the coffin,\r\nand everyone left the church.\r\nThen Justin appeared at the door of the shop. He suddenly went in\r\nagain, pale, staggering.\r\nPeople were at the windows to see the procession pass. Charles at\r\nthe head walked erect. He affected a brave air, and saluted with\r\na nod those who, coming out from the lanes or from their doors,\r\nstood amidst the crowd.\r\nThe six men, three on either side, walked slowly, panting a\r\nlittle. The priests, the choristers, and the two choirboys\r\nrecited the De profundis*, and their voices echoed over the\r\nfields, rising and falling with their undulations. Sometimes they\r\ndisappeared in the windings of the path; but the great silver\r\ncross rose always before the trees.\r\n*Psalm CXXX.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'The women followed in black cloaks with turned-down hoods; each\r\nof them carried in her hands a large lighted candle, and Charles\r\nfelt himself growing weaker at this continual repetition of\r\nprayers and torches, beneath this oppressive odour of wax and of\r\ncassocks. A fresh breeze was blowing; the rye and colza were\r\nsprouting, little dewdrops trembled at the roadsides and on the\r\nhawthorn hedges. All sorts of joyous sounds filled the air; the\r\njolting of a cart rolling afar off in the ruts, the crowing of a\r\ncock, repeated again and again, or the gambling of a foal running\r\naway under the apple-trees: The pure sky was fretted with rosy\r\nclouds; a bluish haze rested upon the cots covered with iris.\r\nCharles as he passed recognised each courtyard. He remembered\r\nmornings like this, when, after visiting some patient, he came\r\nout from one and returned to her.\r\nThe black cloth bestrewn with white beads blew up from time to\r\ntime, laying bare the coffin. The tired bearers walked more\r\nslowly, and it advanced with constant jerks, like a boat that\r\npitches with every wave.\r\nThey reached the cemetery. The men went right down to a place in\r\nthe grass where a grave was dug. They ranged themselves all\r\nround; and while the priest spoke, the red soil thrown up at the\r\nsides kept noiselessly slipping down at the corners.\r\nThen when the four ropes were arranged the coffin was placed upon\r\nthem. He watched it descend; it seemed descending for ever. At\r\nlast a thud was heard; the ropes creaked as they were drawn up.\r\nThen Bournisien took the spade handed to him by Lestiboudois;\r\nwith his left hand all the time sprinkling water, with the right\r\nhe vigorously threw in a large spadeful; and the wood of the\r\ncoffin, struck by the pebbles, gave forth that dread sound that\r\nseems to us the reverberation of eternity.\r\nThe ecclesiastic passed the holy water sprinkler to his\r\nneighbour. This was Homais. He swung it gravely, then handed it\r\nto Charles, who sank to his knees in the earth and threw in\r\nhandfuls of it, crying, "Adieu!" He sent her kisses; he dragged\r\nhimself towards the grave, to engulf himself with her. They led\r\nhim away, and he soon grew calmer, feeling perhaps, like the\r\nothers, a vague satisfaction that it was all over.\r\nOld Rouault on his way back began quietly smoking a pipe, which\r\nHomais in his innermost conscience thought not quite the thing.\r\nHe also noticed that Monsieur Binet had not been present, and\r\nthat Tuvache had "made off" after mass, and that Theodore, the\r\nnotary\'s servant wore a blue coat, "as if one could not have got\r\na black coat, since that is the custom, by Jove!" And to share\r\nhis observations with others he went from group to group. They\r\nwere deploring Emma\'s death, especially Lheureux, who had not\r\nfailed to come to the funeral.\r\n"Poor little woman! What a trouble for her husband!"\r\nThe druggist continued, "Do you know that but for me he would\r\nhave committed some fatal attempt upon himself?"\r\n"Such a good woman! To think that I saw her only last Saturday in\r\nmy shop."\r\n"I haven\'t had leisure," said Homais, "to prepare a few words\r\nthat I would have cast upon her tomb."\r\nCharles on getting home undressed, and old Rouault put on his\r\nblue blouse. It was a new one, and as he had often during the\r\njourney wiped his eyes on the sleeves, the dye had stained his\r\nface, and the traces of tears made lines in the layer of dust\r\nthat covered it.\r\nMadame Bovary senior was with them. All three were silent. At\r\nlast the old fellow sighed--\r\n"Do you remember, my friend, that I went to Tostes once when you\r\nhad just lost your first deceased? I consoled you at that time. I\r\nthought of something to say then, but now--" Then, with a loud\r\ngroan that shook his whole chest, "Ah! this is the end for me, do\r\nyou see! I saw my wife go, then my son, and now to-day it\'s my\r\ndaughter."\r\nHe wanted to go back at once to Bertaux, saying that he could not\r\nsleep in this house. He even refused to see his granddaughter.\r\n"No, no! It would grieve me too much. Only you\'ll kiss her many\r\ntimes for me. Good-bye! you\'re a good fellow! And then I shall\r\nnever forget that," he said, slapping his thigh. "Never fear, you\r\nshall always have your turkey."\r\nBut when he reached the top of the hill he turned back, as he had\r\nturned once before on the road of Saint-Victor when he had parted\r\nfrom her. The windows of the village were all on fire beneath the\r\nslanting rays of the sun sinking behind the field. He put his\r\nhand over his eyes, and saw in the horizon an enclosure of walls,\r\nwhere trees here and there formed black clusters between white\r\nstones; then he went on his way at a gentle trot, for his nag had\r\ngone lame.\r\nDespite their fatigue, Charles and his mother stayed very long\r\nthat evening talking together. They spoke of the days of the past\r\nand of the future. She would come to live at Yonville; she would\r\nkeep house for him; they would never part again. She was\r\ningenious and caressing, rejoicing in her heart at gaining once\r\nmore an affection that had wandered from her for so many years.\r\nMidnight struck. The village as usual was silent, and Charles,\r\nawake, thought always of her.\r\nRodolphe, who, to distract himself, had been rambling about the\r\nwood all day, was sleeping quietly in his chateau, and Leon, down\r\nyonder, always slept.\r\nThere was another who at that hour was not asleep.\r\nOn the grave between the pine-trees a child was on his knees\r\nweeping, and his heart, rent by sobs, was beating in the shadow\r\nbeneath the load of an immense regret, sweeter than the moon and\r\nfathomless as the night. The gate suddenly grated. It was\r\nLestiboudois; he came to fetch his spade, that he had forgotten.\r\nHe recognised Justin climbing over the wall, and at last knew who\r\nwas the culprit who stole his potatoes.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Chapter Eleven\r\nThe next day Charles had the child brought back. She asked for\r\nher mamma. They told her she was away; that she would bring her\r\nback some playthings. Berthe spoke of her again several times,\r\nthen at last thought no more of her. The child\'s gaiety broke\r\nBovary\'s heart, and he had to bear besides the intolerable\r\nconsolations of the chemist.\r\nMoney troubles soon began again, Monsieur Lheureux urging on anew\r\nhis friend Vincart, and Charles pledged himself for exorbitant\r\nsums; for he would never consent to let the smallest of the\r\nthings that had belonged to HER be sold. His mother was\r\nexasperated with him; he grew even more angry than she did. He\r\nhad altogether changed. She left the house.\r\nThen everyone began "taking advantage" of him. Mademoiselle\r\nLempereur presented a bill for six months\' teaching, although\r\nEmma had never taken a lesson (despite the receipted bill she had\r\nshown Bovary); it was an arrangement between the two women. The\r\nman at the circulating library demanded three years\'\r\nsubscriptions; Mere Rollet claimed the postage due for some\r\ntwenty letters, and when Charles asked for an explanation, she\r\nhad the delicacy to reply--\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. It was for her business affairs."\r\nWith every debt he paid Charles thought he had come to the end of\r\nthem. But others followed ceaselessly. He sent in accounts for\r\nprofessional attendance. He was shown the letters his wife had\r\nwritten. Then he had to apologise.\r\nFelicite now wore Madame Bovary\'s gowns; not all, for he had kept\r\nsome of them, and he went to look at them in her dressing-room,\r\nlocking himself up there; she was about her height, and often\r\nCharles, seeing her from behind, was seized with an illusion, and\r\ncried out--\r\n"Oh, stay, stay!"\r\nBut at Whitsuntide she ran away from Yonville, carried off by\r\nTheodore, stealing all that was left of the wardrobe.\r\nIt was about this time that the widow Dupuis had the honour to\r\ninform him of the "marriage of Monsieur Leon Dupuis her son,\r\nnotary at Yvetot, to Mademoiselle Leocadie Leboeuf of\r\nBondeville." Charles, among the other congratulations he sent\r\nhim, wrote this sentence--\r\n"How glad my poor wife would have been!"\r\nOne day when, wandering aimlessly about the house, he had gone up\r\nto the attic, he felt a pellet of fine paper under his slipper.\r\nHe opened it and read: "Courage, Emma, courage. I would not bring\r\nmisery into your life." It was Rodolphe\'s letter, fallen to the\r\nground between the boxes, where it had remained, and that the\r\nwind from the dormer window had just blown towards the door. And\r\nCharles stood, motionless and staring, in the very same place\r\nwhere, long ago, Emma, in despair, and paler even than he, had\r\nthought of dying. At last he discovered a small R at the bottom\r\nof the second page. What did this mean? He remembered Rodolphe\'s\r\nattentions, his sudden, disappearance, his constrained air when\r\nthey had met two or three times since. But the respectful tone of\r\nthe letter deceived him.\r\n"Perhaps they loved one another platonically," he said to\r\nhimself.\r\nBesides, Charles was not of those who go to the bottom of things;\r\nhe shrank from the proofs, and his vague jealousy was lost in the\r\nimmensity of his woe.\r\nEveryone, he thought, must have adored her; all men assuredly\r\nmust have coveted her. She seemed but the more beautiful to him\r\nfor this; he was seized with a lasting, furious desire for her,\r\nthat inflamed his despair, and that was boundless, because it was\r\nnow unrealisable.\r\nTo please her, as if she were still living, he adopted her\r\npredilections, her ideas; he bought patent leather boots and took\r\nto wearing white cravats. He put cosmetics on his moustache, and,\r\nlike her, signed notes of hand. She corrupted him from beyond the\r\ngrave.\r\nHe was obliged to sell his silver piece by piece; next he sold\r\nthe drawing-room furniture. All the rooms were stripped; but the\r\nbedroom, her own room, remained as before. After his dinner\r\nCharles went up there. He pushed the round table in front of the\r\nfire, and drew up her armchair. He sat down opposite it. A candle\r\nburnt in one of the gilt candlesticks. Berthe by his side was\r\npainting prints.\r\nHe suffered, poor man, at seeing her so badly dressed, with\r\nlaceless boots, and the arm-holes of her pinafore torn down to\r\nthe hips; for the charwoman took no care of her. But she was so\r\nsweet, so pretty, and her little head bent forward so gracefully,\r\nletting the dear fair hair fall over her rosy cheeks, that an\r\ninfinite joy came upon him, a happiness mingled with bitterness,\r\nlike those ill-made wines that taste of resin. He mended her\r\ntoys, made her puppets from cardboard, or sewed up half-torn\r\ndolls. Then, if his eyes fell upon the workbox, a ribbon lying\r\nabout, or even a pin left in a crack of the table, he began to\r\ndream, and looked so sad that she became as sad as he.\r\nNo one now came to see them, for Justin had run away to Rouen,\r\nwhere he was a grocer\'s assistant, and the druggist\'s children\r\nsaw less and less of the child, Monsieur Homais not caring,\r\nseeing the difference of their social position, to continue the\r\nintimacy.\r\nThe blind man, whom he had not been able to cure with the pomade,\r\nhad gone back to the hill of Bois-Guillaume, where he told the\r\ntravellers of the vain attempt of the druggist, to such an\r\nextent, that Homais when he went to town hid himself behind the\r\ncurtains of the "Hirondelle" to avoid meeting him. He detested\r\nhim, and wishing, in the interests of his own reputation, to get\r\nrid of him at all costs, he directed against him a secret\r\nbattery, that betrayed the depth of his intellect and the\r\nbaseness of his vanity. Thus, for six consecutive months, one\r\ncould read in the "Fanal de Rouen" editorials such as these--\r\n"All who bend their steps towards the fertile plains of Picardy\r\nhave, no doubt, remarked, by the Bois-Guillaume hill, a wretch\r\nsuffering from a horrible facial wound. He importunes, persecutes\r\none, and levies a regular tax on all travellers. Are we still\r\nliving in the monstrous times of the Middle Ages, when vagabonds\r\nwere permitted to display in our public places leprosy and\r\nscrofulas they had brought back from the Crusades?"\r\nOr--\r\n"In spite of the laws against vagabondage, the approaches to our\r\ngreat towns continue to be infected by bands of beggars. Some are\r\nseen going about alone, and these are not, perhaps, the least\r\ndangerous. What are our ediles about?"\r\nThen Homais invented anecdotes--\r\n"Yesterday, by the Bois-Guillaume hill, a skittish horse--" And\r\nthen followed the story of an accident caused by the presence of\r\nthe blind man.\r\nHe managed so well that the fellow was locked up. But he was\r\nreleased. He began again, and Homais began again. It was a\r\nstruggle. Homais won it, for his foe was condemned to life-long\r\nconfinement in an asylum.\r\nThis success emboldened him, and henceforth there was no longer a\r\ndog run over, a barn burnt down, a woman beaten in the parish, of\r\nwhich he did not immediately inform the public, guided always by\r\nthe love of progress and the hate of priests. He instituted\r\ncomparisons between the elementary and clerical schools to the\r\ndetriment of the latter; called to mind the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew a propos of a grant of one hundred francs to the\r\nchurch, and denounced abuses, aired new views. That was his\r\nphrase. Homais was digging and delving; he was becoming\r\ndangerous.\r\nHowever, he was stifling in the narrow limits of journalism, and\r\nsoon a book, a work was necessary to him. Then he composed\r\n"General Statistics of the Canton of Yonville, followed by\r\nClimatological Remarks." The statistics drove him to philosophy.\r\nHe busied himself with great questions: the social problem:\r\nmoralisation of the poorer classes, pisciculture, caoutchouc,\r\nrailways, etc. He even began to blush at being a bourgeois. He\r\naffected the artistic style, he smoked. He bought two chic\r\nPompadour statuettes to adorn his drawing-room.\r\nHe by no means gave up his shop. On the contrary, he kept well\r\nabreast of new discoveries. He followed the great movement of\r\nchocolates; he was the first to introduce "cocoa" and "revalenta"\r\ninto the Seine-Inferieure. He was enthusiastic about the\r\nhydro-electric Pulvermacher chains; he wore one himself, and when\r\nat night he took off his flannel vest, Madame Homais stood quite\r\ndazzled before the golden spiral beneath which he was hidden,\r\nand felt her ardour redouble for this man more bandaged than a\r\nScythian, and splendid as one of the Magi.\r\nHe had fine ideas about Emma\'s tomb. First he proposed a broken\r\ncolumn with some drapery, next a pyramid, then a Temple of Vesta,\r\na sort of rotunda, or else a "mass of ruins." And in all his\r\nplans Homais always stuck to the weeping willow, which he looked\r\nupon as the indispensable symbol of sorrow.\r\nCharles and he made a journey to Rouen together to look at some\r\ntombs at a funeral furnisher\'s, accompanied by an artist, one\r\nVaufrylard, a friend of Bridoux\'s, who made puns all the time. At\r\nlast, after having examined some hundred designs, having ordered\r\nan estimate and made another journey to Rouen, Charles decided in\r\nfavour of a mausoleum, which on the two principal sides was to\r\nhave a "spirit bearing an extinguished torch."\r\nAs to the inscription, Homais could think of nothing so fine as\r\nSta viator*, and he got no further; he racked his brain, he\r\nconstantly repeated Sta viator. At last he hit upon Amabilen\r\nconjugem calcas**, which was adopted.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.li,{children:"Rest traveler.\r\n** Tread upon a loving wife."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'A strange thing was that Bovary, while continually thinking of\r\nEmma, was forgetting her. He grew desperate as he felt this image\r\nfading from his memory in spite of all efforts to retain it. Yet\r\nevery night he dreamt of her; it was always the same dream. He\r\ndrew near her, but when he was about to clasp her she fell into\r\ndecay in his arms.\r\nFor a week he was seen going to church in the evening. Monsieur\r\nBournisien even paid him two or three visits, then gave him up.\r\nMoreover, the old fellow was growing intolerant, fanatic, said\r\nHomais. He thundered against the spirit of the age, and never\r\nfailed, every other week, in his sermon, to recount the death\r\nagony of Voltaire, who died devouring his excrements, as everyone\r\nknows.\r\nIn spite of the economy with which Bovary lived, he was far from\r\nbeing able to pay off his old debts. Lheureux refused to renew\r\nany more bills. A distraint became imminent. Then he appealed to\r\nhis mother, who consented to let him take a mortgage on her\r\nproperty, but with a great many recriminations against Emma; and\r\nin return for her sacrifice she asked for a shawl that had\r\nescaped the depredations of Felicite. Charles refused to give it\r\nher; they quarrelled.\r\nShe made the first overtures of reconciliation by offering to\r\nhave the little girl, who could help her in the house, to live\r\nwith her. Charles consented to this, but when the time for\r\nparting came, all his courage failed him. Then there was a final,\r\ncomplete rupture.\r\nAs his affections vanished, he clung more closely to the love of\r\nhis child. She made him anxious, however, for she coughed\r\nsometimes, and had red spots on her cheeks.\r\nOpposite his house, flourishing and merry, was the family of the\r\nchemist, with whom everything was prospering. Napoleon helped him\r\nin the laboratory, Athalie embroidered him a skullcap, Irma cut\r\nout rounds of paper to cover the preserves, and Franklin recited\r\nPythagoras\' table in a breath. He was the happiest of fathers,\r\nthe most fortunate of men.\r\nNot so! A secret ambition devoured him. Homais hankered after the\r\ncross of the Legion of Honour. He had plenty of claims to it.\r\n"First, having at the time of the cholera distinguished myself by\r\na boundless devotion; second, by having published, at my expense,\r\nvarious works of public utility, such as" (and he recalled his\r\npamphlet entitled, "Cider, its manufacture and effects," besides\r\nobservation on the lanigerous plant-louse, sent to the Academy;\r\nhis volume of statistics, and down to his pharmaceutical thesis);\r\n"without counting that I am a member of several learned\r\nsocieties" (he was member of a single one).\r\n"In short!" he cried, making a pirouette, "if it were only for\r\ndistinguishing myself at fires!"\r\nThen Homais inclined towards the Government. He secretly did the\r\nprefect great service during the elections. He sold himself--in a\r\nword, prostituted himself. He even addressed a petition to the\r\nsovereign in which he implored him to "do him justice"; he called\r\nhim "our good king," and compared him to Henri IV.\r\nAnd every morning the druggist rushed for the paper to see if his\r\nnomination were in it. It was never there. At last, unable to\r\nbear it any longer, he had a grass plot in his garden designed to\r\nrepresent the Star of the Cross of Honour with two little strips\r\nof grass running from the top to imitate the ribband. He walked\r\nround it with folded arms, meditating on the folly of the\r\nGovernment and the ingratitude of men.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'From respect, or from a sort of sensuality that made him carry on\r\nhis investigations slowly, Charles had not yet opened the secret\r\ndrawer of a rosewood desk which Emma had generally used. One day,\r\nhowever, he sat down before it, turned the key, and pressed the\r\nspring. All Leon\'s letters were there. There could be no doubt\r\nthis time. He devoured them to the very last, ransacked every\r\ncorner, all the furniture, all the drawers, behind the walls,\r\nsobbing, crying aloud, distraught, mad. He found a box and broke\r\nit open with a kick. Rodolphe\'s portrait flew full in his face in\r\nthe midst of the overturned love-letters.\r\nPeople wondered at his despondency. He never went out, saw no\r\none, refused even to visit his patients. Then they said "he shut\r\nhimself up to drink."\r\nSometimes, however, some curious person climbed on to the garden\r\nhedge, and saw with amazement this long-bearded, shabbily\r\nclothed, wild man, who wept aloud as he walked up and down.\r\nIn the evening in summer he took his little girl with him and led\r\nher to the cemetery. They came back at nightfall, when the only\r\nlight left in the Place was that in Binet\'s window.\r\nThe voluptuousness of his grief was, however, incomplete, for he\r\nhad no one near him to share it, and he paid visits to Madame\r\nLefrancois to be able to speak of her.\r\nBut the landlady only listened with half an ear, having troubles\r\nlike himself. For Lheureux had at last established the "Favorites\r\ndu Commerce," and Hivert, who enjoyed a great reputation for\r\ndoing errands, insisted on a rise of wages, and was threatening\r\nto go over "to the opposition shop."\r\nOne day when he had gone to the market at Argueil to sell his\r\nhorse--his last resource--he met Rodolphe.\r\nThey both turned pale when they caught sight of one another.\r\nRodolphe, who had only sent his card, first stammered some\r\napologies, then grew bolder, and even pushed his assurance (it\r\nwas in the month of August and very hot) to the length of\r\ninviting him to have a bottle of beer at the public-house.\r\nLeaning on the table opposite him, he chewed his cigar as he\r\ntalked, and Charles was lost in reverie at this face that she had\r\nloved. He seemed to see again something of her in it. It was a\r\nmarvel to him. He would have liked to have been this man.\r\nThe other went on talking agriculture, cattle, pasturage, filling\r\nout with banal phrases all the gaps where an allusion might slip\r\nin. Charles was not listening to him; Rodolphe noticed it, and he\r\nfollowed the succession of memories that crossed his face. This\r\ngradually grew redder; the nostrils throbbed fast, the lips\r\nquivered. There was at last a moment when Charles, full of a\r\nsombre fury, fixed his eyes on Rodolphe, who, in something of\r\nfear, stopped talking. But soon the same look of weary lassitude\r\ncame back to his face.\r\n"I don\'t blame you," he said.\r\nRodolphe was dumb. And Charles, his head in his hands, went on in\r\na broken voice, and with the resigned accent of infinite sorrow--\r\n"No, I don\'t blame you now."\r\nHe even added a fine phrase, the only one he ever made--\r\n"It is the fault of fatality!"\r\nRodolphe, who had managed the fatality, thought the remark very\r\noffhand from a man in his position, comic even, and a little\r\nmean.\r\nThe next day Charles went to sit down on the seat in the arbour.\r\nRays of light were straying through the trellis, the vine leaves\r\nthrew their shadows on the sand, the jasmines perfumed the air,\r\nthe heavens were blue, Spanish flies buzzed round the lilies in\r\nbloom, and Charles was suffocating like a youth beneath the vague\r\nlove influences that filled his aching heart.\r\nAt seven o\'clock little Berthe, who had not seen him all the\r\nafternoon, went to fetch him to dinner.\r\nHis head was thrown back against the wall, his eyes closed, his\r\nmouth open, and in his hand was a long tress of black hair.\r\n"Come along, papa," she said.\r\nAnd thinking he wanted to play; she pushed him gently. He fell to\r\nthe ground. He was dead.\r\nThirty-six hours after, at the druggist\'s request, Monsieur\r\nCanivet came thither. He made a post-mortem and found nothing.\r\nWhen everything had been sold, twelve francs seventy-five\r\ncentimes remained, that served to pay for Mademoiselle Bovary\'s\r\ngoing to her grandmother. The good woman died the same year; old\r\nRouault was paralysed, and it was an aunt who took charge of her.\r\nShe is poor, and sends her to a cotton-factory to earn a living.\r\nSince Bovary\'s death three doctors have followed one another at\r\nYonville without any success, so severely did Homais attack them.\r\nHe has an enormous practice; the authorities treat him with\r\nconsideration, and public opinion protects him.\r\nHe has just received the cross of the Legion of Honour.'}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"End"})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>h,x:()=>s});var r=t(96540);const a={},o=r.createContext(a);function h(e){const n=r.useContext(o);return r.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:h(e.components),r.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
