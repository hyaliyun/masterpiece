So a lot that he said slipped clean out of my memory.  I remember\r\nthat he was very clear that the danger to Karolides would not begin\r\ntill he had got to London, and would come from the very highest\r\nquarters, where there would be no thought of suspicion.  He mentioned\r\nthe name of a woman - Julia Czechenyi - as having something\r\nto do with the danger.  She would be the decoy, I gathered, to get\r\nKarolides out of the care of his guards.

I had lied to Paddock about\r\nhim, and the whole thing looked desperately fishy.  If I made a clean\r\nbreast of it and told the police everything he had told me, they\r\nwould simply laugh at me.  The odds were a thousand to one that I\r\nwould be charged with the murder, and the circumstantial evidence\r\nwas strong enough to hang me.  Few people knew me in England; I\r\nhad no real pal who could come forward and swear to my character.\r\nPerhaps that was what those secret enemies were playing for.

I wished to Heaven he had told me\r\nmore, and that I had listened more carefully to the little he had told\r\nme.  I knew nothing but the barest facts.  There was a big risk that,\r\neven if I weathered the other dangers, I would not be believed in\r\nthe end.

It was going to be a giddy hunt,\r\nand it was queer how the prospect comforted me.  I had been slack\r\nso long that almost any chance of activity was welcome.

I considered that Scotland would be best, for my\r\npeople were Scotch and I could pass anywhere as an ordinary\r\nScotsman.

Then Scaife seemed to\r\nhave penetrated to the back door of the house, pretending he was\r\nan agent for sewing-machines.  Only three servants were kept, a\r\ncook, a parlour-maid, and a housemaid, and they were just the sort\r\nthat you would find in a respectable middle-class household.  The\r\ncook was not the gossiping kind, and had pretty soon shut the door\r\nin his face, but Scaife said he was positive she knew nothing.

Sometimes he would lay down the\r\npaper and turn his glasses on the sea.  He looked for a long time at\r\nthe destroyer.

About four o'clock, when we had\r\nfished enough, I made the boatman row us round the yacht, which\r\nlay like a delicate white bird, ready at a moment to flee.

If they knew that Scudder had this clue, would they\r\nnot be certain to change their plans?  Too much depended on their\r\nsuccess for them to take any risks.  The whole question was how much\r\nthey understood about Scudder's knowledge.

He said, barring absolute certainties\r\nlike fingerprints, mere physical traits were very little use for\r\nidentification if the fugitive really knew his business.
