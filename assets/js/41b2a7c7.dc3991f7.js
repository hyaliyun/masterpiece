gaz\'d;\r\nBut Jesse\'s son in youthful bloom appears,\r\nAnd warlike courage far beyond his years:\r\nHe left the folds, he left the flow\'ry meads,\r\nAnd soft recesses of the sylvan shades.\r\nNow

base ambition of thine heart,\r\n"But back in safety from the field depart."\r\nEliab thus to Jesse\'s youngest heir,\r\nExpress\'d his wrath in accents most severe.\r\nWhen to his brother mildly he reply\'d.\r\n"What have I done? or what the cause to chide?\r\nThe words were told before the king, who sent\r\nFor the young hero to his royal tent:\r\nBefore the monarch dauntless he began,\r\n"For

go,\r\n"And venture combat with so great a foe?\r\n"Who all his days has been inur\'d to fight,\r\n"And made its deeds his study and delight:\r\n"Battles and bloodshed brought the monster forth,\r\n"And clouds and whirlwinds usher\'d in his birth."\r\nWhen David thus: "I kept the fleecy care,\r\n"And out there rush\'d a lion and a bear;\r\n"A tender lamb the hungry lion took,\r\n"And with no other weapon than my crook\r\n"Bold I pursu\'d, and chas d him o\'er the field,\r\n"The prey deliver\'d, and the felon kill\'d:\r\n"As thus the lion and the bear I slew,\r\n"So shall Goliath fall, and all his crew:\r\n"The God, who sav\'d me from these beasts of prey,\r\n"By me this monster in the dust shall lay."\r\nSo David spoke.  The wond\'ring king reply\'d;\r\n"Go thou with heav\'n and victory on thy side:\r\n"This coat of mail, this sword gird on," he said,\r\nAnd plac\'d a mighty helmet on his head:\r\nThe coat, the sword, the helm he laid aside,\r\nNor chose to venture with those arms untry\'d,\r\nThen took his staff, and to the neighb\'ring brook\r\nInstant he ran, and thence five pebbles took.\r\nMean time descended to Philistia\'s son\r\nA radiant cherub, and he thus begun:\r\n"Goliath, well thou know\'st thou hast defy\'d\r\n"Yon Hebrew armies, and their God deny\'d:\r\n"Rebellious wretch! audacious worm! forbear,\r\n"Nor tempt the vengeance of their God too far:\r\n"Them, who with his Omnipotence contend,\r\n"No eye shall pity, and no arm defend:\r\n"Proud as thou art, in short liv\'d glory great,\r\n"I come to tell thee thine approaching fate.\r\n"Regard my words.

fatal meeting to thy troops and thee,\r\nBut thou wast deaf to the divine decree;\r\nYoung David meets thee, meets thee not in vain;\r\n\'Tis thine to perish on th\' ensanguin\'d plain.\r\nAnd now the youth the forceful pebble slung\r\nPhilistia trembled as it whizz\'d along:\r\nIn his dread forehead, where the helmet ends,\r\nJust o\'er the brows the well-aim\'d stone descends,\r\nIt pierc\'d the skull, and shatter\'d all the brain,\r\nProne on his face he tumbled to the plain:\r\nGoliath\'s fall no smaller terror yields\r\nThan riving thunders in aerial fields:\r\nThe soul still ling\'red in its lov\'d abode,\r\nTill conq\'ring David o\'er the giant strode:\r\nGoliath\'s sword then laid its master dead,\r\nAnd from the body hew\'d the ghastly head;\r\nThe blood in gushing torrents drench\'d the plains,\r\nThe soul found passage through the spouting veins.\r\nAnd now aloud th\' illustrious victor said,\r\n"Where are your boastings now your champion\'s\r\n"dead?"\r\nScarce had he spoke, when the Philistines fled:\r\nBut fled in vain; the conqu\'ror swift pursu\'d:\r\nWhat scenes of slaughter!
