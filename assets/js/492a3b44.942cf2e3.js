Its authoress was quite unknown to\r\nme.  She was one Miss Mary Berwick, whom I had never heard of; and\r\nshe was to be addressed by letter, if addressed at all, at a\r\ncirculating library in the western district of London.  Through\r\nthis channel, Miss Berwick was informed that her poem was accepted,\r\nand was invited to send another.  She complied, and became a\r\nregular and frequent contributor.

Next day brought me the disclosure that\r\nI had so spoken of the poem to the mother of its writer, in its\r\nwriter's presence; that I had no such correspondent in existence as\r\nMiss Berwick; and that the name had been assumed by Barry\r\nCornwall's eldest daughter, Miss Adelaide Anne Procter."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The anecdote I have here noted down, besides serving to explain why\r\nthe parents of the late Miss Procter have looked to me for these\r\npoor words of remembrance of their lamented child, strikingly\r\nillustrates the honesty, independence, and quiet dignity, of the\r\nlady's character.

Her love of poetry was conspicuous at so early an\r\nage, that I have before me a tiny album made of small note-paper,\r\ninto which her favourite passages were copied for her by her\r\nmother's hand before she herself could write.  It looks as if she\r\nhad carried it about, as another little girl might have carried a\r\ndoll.  She soon displayed a remarkable memory, and great quickness\r\nof apprehension.  When she was quite a young child, she learned\r\nwith facility several of the problems of Euclid.  As she grew\r\nolder, she acquired the French, Italian, and German languages;\r\nbecame a clever pianoforte player; and showed a true taste and\r\nsentiment in drawing.  But, as soon as she had completely\r\nvanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study, it was her\r\nway to lose interest in it, and pass to another.  While her mental\r\nresources were being trained, it was not at all suspected in her\r\nfamily that she had any gift of authorship, or any ambition to\r\nbecome a writer.  Her father had no idea of her having ever\r\nattempted to turn a rhyme, until her first little poem saw the\r\nlight in print."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"When she attained to womanhood, she had read an extraordinary\r\nnumber of books, and throughout her life she was always largely\r\nadding to the number.  In 1853 she went to Turin and its\r\nneighbourhood, on a visit to her aunt, a Roman Catholic lady.  As\r\nMiss Procter had herself professed the Roman Catholic Faith two\r\nyears before, she entered with the greater ardour on the study of\r\nthe Piedmontese dialect, and the observation of the habits and\r\nmanners of the peasantry.  In the former, she soon became a\r\nproficient.  On the latter head, I extract from her familiar\r\nletters written home to England at the time, two pleasant pieces of\r\ndescription."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"A BETROTHAL"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"\"We have been to a ball, of which I must give you a description.\r\nLast Tuesday we had just done dinner at about seven, and stepped\r\nout into the balcony to look at the remains of the sunset behind\r\nthe mountains, when we heard very distinctly a band of music, which\r\nrather excited my astonishment, as a solitary organ is the utmost\r\nthat toils up here.  I went out of the room for a few minutes, and,\r\non my returning, Emily said, 'Oh!  That band is playing at the\r\nfarmer's near here.  The daughter is fiancee to-day, and they have\r\na ball.'  I said, 'I wish I was going!'  'Well,' replied she, 'the\r\nfarmer's wife did call to invite us.'  'Then I shall certainly go,'\r\nI exclaimed.  I applied to Madame B., who said she would like it\r\nvery much, and we had better go, children and all.  Some of the\r\nservants were already gone.  We rushed away to put on some shawls,\r\nand put off any shred of black we might have about us (as the\r\npeople would have been quite annoyed if we had appeared on such an\r\noccasion with any black), and we started.  When we reached the\r\nfarmer's, which is a stone's throw above our house, we were\r\nreceived with great enthusiasm; the only drawback being, that no\r\none spoke French, and we did not yet speak Piedmontese.  We were\r\nplaced on a bench against the wall, and the people went on dancing.\r\nThe room was a large whitewashed kitchen (I suppose), with several\r\nlarge pictures in black frames, and very smoky.  I distinguished\r\nthe Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, and the others appeared equally\r\nlively and appropriate subjects.  Whether they were Old Masters or\r\nnot, and if so, by whom, I could not ascertain.  The band were\r\nseated opposite us.  Five men, with wind instruments, part of the\r\nband of the National Guard, to which the farmer's sons belong.\r\nThey played really admirably, and I began to be afraid that some\r\nidea of our dignity would prevent me getting a partner; so, by\r\nMadame B.'s advice, I went up to the bride, and offered to dance\r\nwith her.  Such a handsome young woman!  Like one of Uwins's\r\npictures.  Very dark, with a quantity of black hair, and on an\r\nimmense scale.  The children were already dancing, as well as the\r\nmaids.  After we came to an end of our dance, which was what they\r\ncalled a Polka-Mazourka, I saw the bride trying to screw up the\r\ncourage of her fiance to ask me to dance, which after a little\r\nhesitation he did.  And admirably he danced, as indeed they all\r\ndid--in excellent time, and with a little more spirit than one sees\r\nin a ball-room.  In fact, they were very like one's ordinary\r\npartners, except that they wore earrings and were in their shirt-\r\nsleeves, and truth compels me to state that they decidedly smelt of\r\ngarlic.  Some of them had been smoking, but threw away their cigars\r\nwhen we came in.  The only thing that did not look cheerful was,\r\nthat the room was only lighted by two or three oil-lamps, and that\r\nthere seemed to be no preparation for refreshments.  Madame B.,\r\nseeing this, whispered to her maid, who disengaged herself from her\r\npartner, and ran off to the house; she and the kitchenmaid\r\npresently returning with a large tray covered with all kinds of\r\ncakes (of which we are great consumers and always have a stock),\r\nand a large hamper full of bottles of wine, with coffee and sugar.\r\nThis seemed all very acceptable.  The fiancee was requested to\r\ndistribute the eatables, and a bucket of water being produced to\r\nwash the glasses in, the wine disappeared very quickly--as fast as\r\nthey could open the bottles.  But, elated, I suppose, by this, the\r\nfloor was sprinkled with water, and the musicians played a\r\nMonferrino, which is a Piedmontese dance.  Madame B. danced with\r\nthe farmer's son, and Emily with another distinguished member of\r\nthe company.  It was very fatiguing--something like a Scotch reel.\r\nMy partner was a little man, like Perrot, and very proud of his\r\ndancing.  He cut in the air and twisted about, until I was out of\r\nbreath, though my attempts to imitate him were feeble in the\r\nextreme.  At last, after seven or eight dances, I was obliged to\r\nsit down.  We stayed till nine, and I was so dead beat with the\r\nheat that I could hardly crawl about the house, and in an agony\r\nwith the cramp, it is so long since I have danced.\""}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"A MARRIAGE"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The wedding of the farmer's daughter has taken place.  We had hoped\r\nit would have been in the little chapel of our house, but it seems\r\nsome special permission was necessary, and they applied for it too\r\nlate.  They all said, \"This is the Constitution.  There would have\r\nbeen no difficulty before!\" the lower classes making the poor\r\nConstitution the scapegoat for everything they don't like.  So as\r\nit was impossible for us to climb up to the church where the\r\nwedding was to be, we contented ourselves with seeing the\r\nprocession pass.  It was not a very large one, for, it requiring\r\nsome activity to go up, all the old people remained at home.  It is\r\nnot etiquette for the bride's mother to go, and no unmarried woman\r\ncan go to a wedding--I suppose for fear of its making her\r\ndiscontented with her own position.  The procession stopped at our\r\ndoor, for the bride to receive our congratulations.  She was\r\ndressed in a shot silk, with a yellow handkerchief, and rows of a\r\nlarge gold chain.  In the afternoon they sent to request us to go\r\nthere.  On our arrival we found them dancing out of doors, and a\r\nmost melancholy affair it was.  All the bride's sisters were not to\r\nbe recognised, they had cried so.  The mother sat in the house, and\r\ncould not appear.  And the bride was sobbing so, she could hardly\r\nstand!  The most melancholy spectacle of all to my mind was, that\r\nthe bridegroom was decidedly tipsy.  He seemed rather affronted at\r\nall the distress.  We danced a Monferrino; I with the bridegroom;\r\nand the bride crying the whole time.  The company did their utmost\r\nto enliven her by firing pistols, but without success, and at last\r\nthey began a series of yells, which reminded me of a set of\r\nsavages.  But even this delicate method of consolation failed, and\r\nthe wishing good-bye began.  It was altogether so melancholy an\r\naffair that Madame B. dropped a few tears, and I was very near it,\r\nparticularly when the poor mother came out to see the last of her\r\ndaughter, who was finally dragged off between her brother and\r\nuncle, with a last explosion of pistols.  As she lives quite near,\r\nmakes an excellent match, and is one of nine children, it really\r\nwas a most desirable marriage, in spite of all the show of\r\ndistress.  Albert was so discomfited by it, that he forgot to kiss\r\nthe bride as he had intended to do, and therefore went to call upon\r\nher yesterday, and found her very smiling in her new house, and\r\nsupplied the omission.  The cook came home from the wedding,\r\ndeclaring she was cured of any wish to marry--but I would not\r\nrecommend any man to act upon that threat and make her an offer.\r\nIn a couple of days we had some rolls of the bride's first baking,\r\nwhich they call Madonnas.  The musicians, it seems, were in the\r\nsame state as the bridegroom, for, in escorting her home, they all\r\nfell down in the mud.  My wrath against the bridegroom is somewhat\r\ncalmed by finding that it is considered bad luck if he does not get\r\ntipsy at his wedding.\""}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Those readers of Miss Procter\'s poems who should suppose from their\r\ntone that her mind was of a gloomy or despondent cast, would be\r\ncuriously mistaken.  She was exceedingly humorous, and had a great\r\ndelight in humour.  Cheerfulness was habitual with her, she was\r\nvery ready at a sally or a reply, and in her laugh (as I remember\r\nwell) there was an unusual vivacity, enjoyment, and sense of\r\ndrollery.  She was perfectly unconstrained and unaffected:  as\r\nmodestly silent about her productions, as she was generous with\r\ntheir pecuniary results.  She was a friend who inspired the\r\nstrongest attachments; she was a finely sympathetic woman, with a\r\ngreat accordant heart and a sterling noble nature.  No claim can be\r\nset up for her, thank God, to the possession of any of the\r\nconventional poetical qualities.  She never by any means held the\r\nopinion that she was among the greatest of human beings; she never\r\nsuspected the existence of a conspiracy on the part of mankind\r\nagainst her; she never recognised in her best friends, her worst\r\nenemies; she never cultivated the luxury of being misunderstood and\r\nunappreciated; she would far rather have died without seeing a line\r\nof her composition in print, than that I should have maundered\r\nabout her, here, as "the Poet", or "the Poetess".'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"With the recollection of Miss Procter as a mere child and as a\r\nwoman, fresh upon me, it is natural that I should linger on my way\r\nto the close of this brief record, avoiding its end.

Now, it was the visitation of the\r\nsick, that had possession of her; now, it was the sheltering of the\r\nhouseless; now, it was the elementary teaching of the densely\r\nignorant; now, it was the raising up of those who had wandered and\r\ngot trodden under foot; now, it was the wider employment of her own\r\nsex in the general business of life; now, it was all these things\r\nat once.
