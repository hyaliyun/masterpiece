To many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of\r\nlife, Food. To the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of\r\npalatable grass, with water to drink; unless he seeks the Shelter of\r\nthe forest or the mountain's shadow. None of the brute creation\r\nrequires more than Food and Shelter. The necessaries of life for man\r\nin this climate may, accurately enough, be distributed under the\r\nseveral heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we\r\nhave secured these are we prepared to entertain the true problems of\r\nlife with freedom and a prospect of success. Man has invented, not\r\nonly houses, but clothes and cooked food; and possibly from the\r\naccidental discovery of the warmth of fire, and the consequent use\r\nof it, at first a luxury, arose the present necessity to sit by it. We\r\nobserve cats and dogs acquiring the same second nature. By proper\r\nShelter and Clothing we legitimately retain our own internal heat; but\r\nwith an excess of these, or of Fuel, that is, with an external heat\r\ngreater than our own internal, may not cookery properly be said to\r\nbegin? Darwin, the naturalist, says of the inhabitants of Tierra del\r\nFuego, that while his own party, who were well clothed and sitting\r\nclose to a fire, were far from too warm, these naked savages, who were\r\nfarther off, were observed, to his great surprise, \"to be streaming\r\nwith perspiration at undergoing such a roasting.\" So, we are told, the\r\nNew Hollander goes naked with impunity, while the European shivers\r\nin his clothes. Is it impossible to combine the hardiness of these\r\nsavages with the intellectualness of the civilized man? According to\r\nLiebig, man's body is a stove, and food the fuel which keeps up the\r\ninternal combustion in the lungs. In cold weather we eat more, in warm\r\nless. The animal heat is the result of a slow combustion, and\r\ndisease and death take place when this is too rapid; or for want of\r\nfuel, or from some defect in the draught, the fire goes out. Of course\r\nthe vital heat is not to be confounded with fire; but so much for\r\nanalogy. It appears, therefore, from the above list, that the\r\nexpression, animal life, is nearly synonymous with the expression,\r\nanimal heat; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel which keeps up\r\nthe fire within us- and Fuel serves only to prepare that Food or to\r\nincrease the warmth of our bodies by addition from without- Shelter\r\nand Clothing also serve only to retain the heat thus generated and\r\nabsorbed."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to\r\nkeep the vital heat in us.

The poor man is wont to complain that\r\nthis is a cold world; and to cold, no less physical than social, we\r\nrefer directly a great part of our ails. The summer, in some climates,\r\nmakes possible to man a sort of Elysian life. Fuel, except to cook his\r\nFood, is then unnecessary; the sun is his fire, and many of the fruits\r\nare sufficiently cooked by its rays; while Food generally is more\r\nvarious, and more easily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly\r\nor half unnecessary. At the present day, and in this country, as I\r\nfind by my own experience, a few implements, a knife, an axe, a spade,\r\na wheelbarrow, etc., and for the studious, lamplight, stationery,\r\nand access to a few books, rank next to necessaries, and can all be\r\nobtained at a trifling cost.

Consider first\r\nhow slight a shelter is absolutely necessary. I have seen Penobscot\r\nIndians, in this town, living in tents of thin cotton cloth, while the\r\nsnow was nearly a foot deep around them, and I thought that they would\r\nbe glad to have it deeper to keep out the wind. Formerly, when how\r\nto get my living honestly, with freedom left for my proper pursuits,\r\nwas a question which vexed me even more than it does now, for\r\nunfortunately I am become somewhat callous, I used to see a large\r\nbox by the railroad, six feet long by three wide, in which the\r\nlaborers locked up their tools at night; and it suggested to me that\r\nevery man who was hard pushed might get such a one for a dollar,\r\nand, having bored a few auger holes in it, to admit the air at\r\nleast, get into it when it rained and at night, and hook down the lid,\r\nand so have freedom in his love, and in his soul be free.

Economy is a subject which admits of being treated\r\nwith levity, but it cannot so be disposed of. A comfortable house\r\nfor a rude and hardy race, that lived mostly out of doors, was once\r\nmade here almost entirely of such materials as Nature furnished\r\nready to their hands. Gookin, who was superintendent of the Indians\r\nsubject to the Massachusetts Colony, writing in 1674, says, "The\r\nbest of their houses are covered very neatly, tight and warm, with\r\nbarks of trees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the\r\nsap is up, and made into great flakes, with pressure of weighty\r\ntimber, when they are green.... The meaner sort are covered with\r\nmats which they make of a kind of bulrush, and are also\r\nindifferently tight and warm, but not so good as the former.... Some I\r\nhave seen, sixty or a hundred feet long and thirty feet broad.... I\r\nhave often lodged in their wigwams, and found them as warm as the best\r\nEnglish houses." He adds that they were commonly carpeted and lined\r\nwithin with well-wrought embroidered mats, and were furnished with\r\nvarious utensils. The Indians had advanced so far as to regulate the\r\neffect of the wind by a mat suspended over the hole in the roof and\r\nmoved by a string. Such a lodge was in the first instance\r\nconstructed in a day or two at most, and taken down and put up in a\r\nfew hours; and every family owned one, or its apartment in one.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best,\r\nand sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I\r\nspeak within bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air\r\nhave their nests, and the foxes their holes, and the savages their\r\nwigwams, in modern civilized society not more than one half the\r\nfamilies own a shelter. In the large towns and cities, where\r\ncivilization especially prevails, the number of those who own a\r\nshelter is a very small fraction of the whole. The rest pay an\r\nannual tax for this outside garment of all, become indispensable\r\nsummer and winter, which would buy a village of Indian wigwams, but\r\nnow helps to keep them poor as long as they live. I do not mean to\r\ninsist here on the disadvantage of hiring compared with owning, but it\r\nis evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so\r\nlittle, while the civilized man hires his commonly because he cannot\r\nafford to own it; nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to\r\nhire. But, answers one, by merely paying this tax, the poor\r\ncivilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared with the\r\nsavage's. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars\r\n(these are the country rates) entitles him to the benefit of the\r\nimprovements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and paper,\r\nRumford fireplace, back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper pump,\r\nspring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how\r\nhappens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly\r\na poor civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a\r\nsavage?

I never in all my\r\nwalks came across a man engaged in so simple and natural an occupation\r\nas building his house. We belong to the community. It is not the\r\ntailor alone who is the ninth part of a man; it is as much the\r\npreacher, and the merchant, and the farmer. Where is this division\r\nof labor to end? and what object does it finally serve? No doubt\r\nanother may also think for me; but it is not therefore desirable\r\nthat he should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'True, there are architects so called in this country, and I have\r\nheard of one at least possessed with the idea of making\r\narchitectural ornaments have a core of truth, a necessity, and hence a\r\nbeauty, as if it were a revelation to him. All very well perhaps\r\nfrom his point of view, but only a little better than the common\r\ndilettantism. A sentimental reformer in architecture, he began at\r\nthe cornice, not at the foundation. It was only how to put a core of\r\ntruth within the ornaments, that every sugarplum, in fact, might\r\nhave an almond or caraway seed in it- though I hold that almonds are\r\nmost wholesome without the sugar- and not how the inhabitant, the\r\nindweller, might build truly within and without, and let the ornaments\r\ntake care of themselves. What reasonable man ever supposed that\r\nornaments were something outward and in the skin merely- that the\r\ntortoise got his spotted shell, or the shell-fish its\r\nmother-o\'-pearl tints, by such a contract as the inhabitants of\r\nBroadway their Trinity Church? But a man has no more to do with the\r\nstyle of architecture of his house than a tortoise with that of its\r\nshell: nor need the soldier be so idle as to try to paint the\r\nprecise color of his virtue on his standard. The enemy will find it\r\nout. He may turn pale when the trial comes. This man seemed to me to\r\nlean over the cornice, and timidly whisper his half truth to the\r\nrude occupants who really knew it better than he. What of\r\narchitectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within\r\noutward, out of the necessities and character of the indweller, who is\r\nthe only builder- out of some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness,\r\nwithout ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additional\r\nbeauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by a\r\nlike unconscious beauty of life. The most interesting dwellings in\r\nthis country, as the painter knows, are the most unpretending,\r\nhumble log huts and cottages of the poor commonly; it is the life of\r\nthe inhabitants whose shells they are, and not any peculiarity in\r\ntheir surfaces merely, which makes them picturesque; and equally\r\ninteresting will be the citizen\'s suburban box, when his life shall be\r\nas simple and as agreeable to the imagination, and there is as\r\nlittle straining after effect in the style of his dwelling. A great\r\nproportion of architectural ornaments are literally hollow, and a\r\nSeptember gale would strip them off, like borrowed plumes, without\r\ninjury to the substantials. They can do without architecture who\r\nhave no olives nor wines in the cellar. What if an equal ado were made\r\nabout the ornaments of style in literature, and the architects of\r\nour bibles spent as much time about their cornices as the architects\r\nof our churches do? So are made the belles-lettres and the\r\nbeaux-arts and their professors. Much it concerns a man, forsooth, how\r\na few sticks are slanted over him or under him, and what colors are\r\ndaubed upon his box. It would signify somewhat, if, in any earnest\r\nsense, he slanted them and daubed it; but the spirit having departed\r\nout of the tenant, it is of a piece with constructing his own\r\ncoffin- the architecture of the grave- and "carpenter" is but\r\nanother name for "coffin-maker." One man says, in his despair or\r\nindifference to life, take up a handful of the earth at your feet, and\r\npaint your house that color. Is he thinking of his last and narrow\r\nhouse? Toss up a copper for it as well. What an abundance of leisure\r\nbe must have! Why do you take up a handful of dirt?

At Cambridge\r\nCollege the mere rent of a student\'s room, which is only a little\r\nlarger than my own, is thirty dollars each year, though the\r\ncorporation had the advantage of building thirty-two side by side\r\nand under one roof, and the occupant suffers the inconvenience of many\r\nand noisy neighbors, and perhaps a residence in the fourth story. I\r\ncannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these respects,\r\nnot only less education would be needed, because, forsooth, more would\r\nalready have been acquired, but the pecuniary expense of getting an\r\neducation would in a great measure vanish. Those conveniences which\r\nthe student requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody\r\nelse ten times as great a sacrifice of life as they would with\r\nproper management on both sides. Those things for which the most money\r\nis demanded are never the things which the student most wants.\r\nTuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while\r\nfor the far more valuable education which he gets by associating\r\nwith the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made.\r\nThe mode of founding a college is, commonly, to get up a\r\nsubscription of dollars and cents, and then, following blindly the\r\nprinciples of a division of labor to its extreme- a principle which\r\nshould never be followed but with circumspection- to call in a\r\ncontractor who makes this a subject of speculation, and he employs\r\nIrishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations, while\r\nthe students that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for\r\nit; and for these oversights successive generations have to pay. I\r\nthink that it would be better than this, for the students, or those\r\nwho desire to be benefited by it, even to lay the foundation\r\nthemselves. The student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement\r\nby systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an\r\nignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience\r\nwhich alone can make leisure fruitful.

I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which\r\nhe might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not play\r\nlife, or study it merely, while the community supports them at this\r\nexpensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could\r\nyouths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of\r\nliving? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as\r\nmathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and\r\nsciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is\r\nmerely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where\r\nanything is professed and practised but the art of life;- to survey\r\nthe world through a telescope or a microscope, and never with his\r\nnatural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is\r\nmade, or mechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new\r\nsatellites to Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to\r\nwhat vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the\r\nmonsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters\r\nin a drop of vinegar. Which would have advanced the most at the end of\r\na month- the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which\r\nhe had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for\r\nthis- or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the\r\nInstitute in the meanwhile, and had received a Rodgers penknife from\r\nhis father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers?... To my\r\nastonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied\r\nnavigation!- why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should\r\nhave known more about it. Even the poor student studies and is\r\ntaught only political economy, while that economy of living which is\r\nsynonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely professed in our\r\ncolleges.

Why should I feel lonely? is not our\r\nplanet in the Milky Way? This which you put seems to me not to be\r\nthe most important question. What sort of space is that which\r\nseparates a man from his fellows and makes him solitary? I have\r\nfound that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer\r\nto one another.

Not to many men\r\nsurely, the depot, the post-office, the bar-room, the meeting-house,\r\nthe school-house, the grocery, Beacon Hill, or the Five Points,\r\nwhere men most congregate, but to the perennial source of our life,\r\nwhence in all our experience we have found that to issue, as the\r\nwillow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that\r\ndirection.

He never\r\nheard the sound of praise. He particularly reverenced the writer and\r\nthe preacher. Their performances were miracles. When I told him that I\r\nwrote considerably, he thought for a long time that it was merely\r\nthe handwriting which I meant, for he could write a remarkably good\r\nhand himself. I sometimes found the name of his native parish\r\nhandsomely written in the snow by the highway, with the proper\r\nFrench accent, and knew that he had passed. I asked him if he ever\r\nwished to write his thoughts. He said that he had read and written\r\nletters for those who could not, but he never tried to write thoughts-\r\nno, he could not, he could not tell what to put first, it would kill\r\nhim, and then there was spelling to be attended to at the same time!'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'I heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he\r\ndid not want the world to be changed; but he answered with a chuckle\r\nof surprise in his Canadian accent, not knowing that the question\r\nhad ever been entertained before, "No, I like it well enough." It\r\nwould have suggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings\r\nwith him.

The former was a sort of cyclopaedia to\r\nhim, which he supposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge, as\r\nindeed it does to a considerable extent. I loved to sound him on the\r\nvarious reforms of the day, and he never failed to look at them in the\r\nmost simple and practical light. He had never heard of such things\r\nbefore. Could he do without factories? I asked. He had worn the\r\nhome-made Vermont gray, he said, and that was good. Could he\r\ndispense with tea and coffee? Did this country afford any beverage\r\nbeside water? He had soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it,\r\nand thought that was better than water in warm weather. When I asked\r\nhim if he could do without money, he showed the convenience of money\r\nin such a way as to suggest and coincide with the most philosophical\r\naccounts of the origin of this institution, and the very derivation of\r\nthe word pecunia. If an ox were his property, and he wished to get\r\nneedles and thread at the store, he thought it would be inconvenient\r\nand impossible soon to go on mortgaging some portion of the creature\r\neach time to that amount. He could defend many institutions better\r\nthan any philosopher, because, in describing them as they concerned\r\nhim, he gave the true reason for their prevalence, and speculation had\r\nnot suggested to him any other. At another time, hearing Plato\'s\r\ndefinition of a man- a biped without feathers- and that one\r\nexhibited a cock plucked and called it Plato\'s man, he thought it an\r\nimportant difference that the knees bent the wrong way. He would\r\nsometimes exclaim, "How I love to talk! By George, I could talk all\r\nday!" I asked him once, when I had not seen him for many months, if he\r\nhad got a new idea this summer. "Good Lord"- said he, "a man that\r\nhas to work as I do, if he does not forget the ideas he has had, he\r\nwill do well. May he the man you hoe with is inclined to race; then,\r\nby gorry, your mind must be there; you think of weeds." He would\r\nsometimes ask me first on such occasions, if I had made any\r\nimprovement. One winter day I asked him if he was always satisfied\r\nwith himself, wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the\r\npriest without, and some higher motive for living. "Satisfied!" said\r\nhe; "some men are satisfied with one thing, and some with another. One\r\nman, perhaps, if he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day\r\nwith his back to the fire and his belly to the table, by George!"\r\nYet I never, by any manoeuvring, could get him to take the spiritual\r\nview of things; the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a\r\nsimple expediency, such as you might expect an animal to appreciate;\r\nand this, practically, is true of most men.

Though\r\nhe hesitated, and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly, he\r\nalways had a presentable thought behind. Yet his thinking was so\r\nprimitive and immersed in his animal life, that, though more promising\r\nthan a merely learned man's, it rarely ripened to anything which can\r\nbe reported. He suggested that there might be men of genius in the\r\nlowest grades of life, however permanently humble and illiterate,\r\nwho take their own view always, or do not pretend to see at all; who\r\nare as bottomless even as Walden Pond was thought to be, though they\r\nmay be dark and muddy."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Many a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of\r\nmy house, and, as an excuse for calling, asked for a glass of water.

Half-witted men\r\nfrom the almshouse and elsewhere came to see me; but I endeavored to\r\nmake them exercise all the wit they had, and make their confessions to\r\nme; in such cases making wit the theme of our conversation; and so was\r\ncompensated.

The Lord had made\r\nhim so, yet he supposed the Lord cared as much for him as for another.\r\n"I have always been so," said he, "from my childhood; I never had much\r\nmind; I was not like other children; I am weak in the head. It was the\r\nLord\'s will, I suppose." And there he was to prove the truth of his\r\nwords. He was a metaphysical puzzle to me. I have rarely met a\r\nfellow-man on such promising ground- it was so simple and sincere\r\nand so true all that he said. And, true enough, in proportion as he\r\nappeared to humble himself was he exalted. I did not know at first but\r\nit was the result of a wise policy.

Every day or two I strolled to the village to hear\r\nsome of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating\r\neither from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which,\r\ntaken in homeopathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the\r\nrustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I walked in the woods to\r\nsee the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men\r\nand boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts\r\nrattle. In one direction from my house there was a colony of\r\nmuskrats in the river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods\r\nin the other horizon was a village of busy men, as curious to me as if\r\nthey had been prairie-dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its burrow,\r\nor running over to a neighbor's to gossip. I went there frequently\r\nto observe their habits. The village appeared to me a great news room;\r\nand on one side, to support it, as once at Redding & Company's on\r\nState Street, they kept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other\r\ngroceries. Some have such a vast appetite for the former commodity,\r\nthat is, the news, and such sound digestive organs, that they can\r\nsit forever in public avenues without stirring, and let it simmer\r\nand whisper through them like the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling\r\nether, it only producing numbness and insensibility to pain- otherwise\r\nit would often be painful to bear- without affecting the\r\nconsciousness. I hardly ever failed, when I rambled through the\r\nvillage, to see a row of such worthies, either sitting on a ladder\r\nsunning themselves, with their bodies inclined forward and their\r\neyes glancing along the line this way and that, from time to time,\r\nwith a voluptuous expression, or else leaning against a barn with\r\ntheir hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as if to prop it up.\r\nThey, being commonly out of doors, heard whatever was in the wind.\r\nThese are the coarsest mills, in which all gossip is first rudely\r\ndigested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more\r\ndelicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the\r\nvillage were the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank;\r\nand, as a necessary part of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big\r\ngun, and a fire-engine, at convenient places; and the houses were so\r\narranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting one\r\nanother, so that every traveller had to run the gauntlet, and every\r\nman, woman, and child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who\r\nwere stationed nearest to the head of the line, where they could\r\nmost see and be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest\r\nprices for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the\r\noutskirts, where long gaps in the line began to occur, and the\r\ntraveller could get over walls or turn aside into cow-paths, and so\r\nescape, paid a very slight ground or window tax. Signs were hung out\r\non all sides to allure him; some to catch him by the appetite, as\r\nthe tavern and victualling cellar; some by the fancy, as the dry goods\r\nstore and the jeweller's; and others by the hair or the feet or the\r\nskirts, as the barber, the shoe-maker, or the tailor. Besides, there\r\nwas a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one\r\nof these houses, and company expected about these times. For the\r\nmost part I escaped wonderfully from these dangers, either by\r\nproceeding at once boldly and without deliberation to the goal, as\r\nis recommended to those who run the gauntlet, or by keeping my\r\nthoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who, \"loudly singing the\r\npraises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices of the Sirens, and\r\nkept out of danger.\" Sometimes I bolted suddenly, and nobody could\r\ntell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about gracefulness,\r\nand never hesitated at a gap in a fence. I was even accustomed to make\r\nan irruption into some houses, where I was well entertained, and after\r\nlearning the kernels and very last sieveful of news- what had\r\nsubsided, the prospects of war and peace, and whether the world was\r\nlikely to hold together much longer- I was let out through the rear\r\navenues, and so escaped to the woods again."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself\r\ninto the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set\r\nsail from some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of\r\nrye or Indian meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the\r\nwoods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches\r\nwith a merry crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the\r\nhelm, or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing. I had\r\nmany a genial thought by the cabin fire "as I sailed." I was never\r\ncast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some\r\nsevere storms. It is darker in the woods, even in common nights,\r\nthan most suppose. I frequently had to look up at the opening\r\nbetween the trees above the path in order to learn my route, and,\r\nwhere there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet the faint track\r\nwhich I had worn, or steer by the known relation of particular trees\r\nwhich I felt with my hands, passing between two pines for instance,\r\nnot more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the woods,\r\ninvariably, in the darkest night. Sometimes, after coming home thus\r\nlate in a dark and muggy night, when my feet felt the path which my\r\neyes could not see, dreaming and absent-minded all the way, until I\r\nwas aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch, I have not\r\nbeen able to recall a single step of my walk, and I have thought\r\nthat perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should\r\nforsake it, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance.\r\nSeveral times, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it\r\nproved a dark night, I was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path\r\nin the rear of the house, and then point out to him the direction he\r\nwas to pursue, and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by\r\nhis feet than his eyes. One very dark night I directed thus on their\r\nway two young men who had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a\r\nmile off through the woods, and were quite used to the route. A day or\r\ntwo after one of them told me that they wandered about the greater\r\npart of the night, close by their own premises, and did not get home\r\ntill toward morning, by which time, as there had been several heavy\r\nshowers in the meanwhile, and the leaves were very wet, they were\r\ndrenched to their skins. I have heard of many going astray even in the\r\nvillage streets, when the darkness was so thick that you could cut\r\nit with a knife, as the saying is. Some who live in the outskirts,\r\nhaving come to town a-shopping in their wagons, have been obliged to\r\nput up for the night; and gentlemen and ladies making a call have gone\r\nhalf a mile out of their way, feeling the sidewalk only with their\r\nfeet, and not knowing when they turned. It is a surprising and\r\nmemorable, as well as valuable experience, to be lost in the woods any\r\ntime. Often in a snow-storm, even by day, one will come out upon a\r\nwell-known road and yet find it impossible to tell which way leads\r\nto the village. Though he knows that he has travelled it a thousand\r\ntimes, he cannot recognize a feature in it, but it is as strange to\r\nhim as if it were a road in Siberia. By night, of course, the\r\nperplexity is infinitely greater. In our most trivial walks, we are\r\nconstantly, though unconsciously, steering like pilots by certain\r\nwell-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond our usual course\r\nwe still carry in our minds the bearing of some neighboring cape;\r\nand not till we are completely lost, or turned round- for a man\r\nneeds only to be turned round once with his eyes shut in this world to\r\nbe lost- do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of nature.\r\nEvery man has to learn the points of compass again as often as be\r\nawakes, whether from sleep or any abstraction.

It is a clear and deep green well, half a mile\r\nlong and a mile and three quarters in circumference, and contains\r\nabout sixty-one and a half acres; a perennial spring in the midst of\r\npine and oak woods, without any visible inlet or outlet except by\r\nthe clouds and evaporation.

Viewed from a hilltop it\r\nreflects the color of the sky; but near at hand it is of a yellowish\r\ntint next the shore where you can see the sand, then a light green,\r\nwhich gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in the body of the\r\npond. In some lights, viewed even from a hilltop, it is of a vivid\r\ngreen next the shore. Some have referred this to the reflection of the\r\nverdure; but it is equally green there against the railroad\r\nsandbank, and in the spring, before the leaves are expanded, and it\r\nmay be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the\r\nyellow of the sand. Such is the color of its iris. This is that\r\nportion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by the heat\r\nof the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through the\r\nearth, melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen\r\nmiddle. Like the rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear\r\nweather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the\r\nright angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it\r\nappears at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and\r\nat such a time, being on its surface, and looking with divided vision,\r\nso as to see the reflection, I have discerned a matchless and\r\nindescribable light blue, such as watered or changeable silks and\r\nsword blades suggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating\r\nwith the original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves, which\r\nlast appeared but muddy in comparison. It is a vitreous greenish blue,\r\nas I remember it, like those patches of the winter sky seen through\r\ncloud vistas in the west before sundown. Yet a single glass of its\r\nwater held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of\r\nair. It is well known that a large plate of glass will have a green\r\ntint, owing, as the makers say, to its "body," but a small piece of\r\nthe same will be colorless. How large a body of Walden water would\r\nbe required to reflect a green tint I have never proved. The water\r\nof our river is black or a very dark brown to one looking directly\r\ndown on it, and, like that of most ponds, imparts to the body of one\r\nbathing in it a yellowish tinge; but this water is of such crystalline\r\npurity that the body of the bather appears of an alabaster\r\nwhiteness, still more unnatural, which, as the limbs are magnified and\r\ndistorted withal, produces a monstrous effect, making fit studies\r\nfor a Michael Angelo.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be\r\ndiscerned at the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet.

Once, in the winter,\r\nmany years ago, when I had been cutting holes through the ice in order\r\nto catch pickerel, as I stepped ashore I tossed my axe back on to\r\nthe ice, but, as if some evil genius had directed it, it slid four\r\nor five rods directly into one of the holes, where the water was\r\ntwenty-five feet deep. Out of curiosity, I lay down on the ice and\r\nlooked through the hole, until I saw the axe a little on one side,\r\nstanding on its head, with its helve erect and gently swaying to and\r\nfro with the pulse of the pond; and there it might have stood erect\r\nand swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off, if I had\r\nnot disturbed it. Making another hole directly over it with an ice\r\nchisel which I had, and cutting down the longest birch which I could\r\nfind in the neighborhood with my knife, I made a slip-noose, which I\r\nattached to its end, and, letting it down carefully, passed it over\r\nthe knob of the handle, and drew it by a line along the birch, and\r\nso pulled the axe out again."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones\r\nlike paving-stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so\r\nsteep that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over\r\nyour head; and were it not for its remarkable transparency, that would\r\nbe the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite\r\nside.

It is nowhere muddy, and a casual\r\nobserver would say that there were no weeds at all in it; and of\r\nnoticeable plants, except in the little meadows recently overflowed,\r\nwhich do not properly belong to it, a closer scrutiny does not\r\ndetect a flag nor a bulrush, nor even a lily, yellow or white, but\r\nonly a few small heart-leaves and potamogetons, and perhaps a\r\nwater-target or two; all which however a bather might not perceive;\r\nand these plants are clean and bright like the element they grow in.\r\nThe stones extend a rod or two into the water, and then the bottom\r\nis pure sand, except in the deepest parts, where there is usually a\r\nlittle sediment, probably from the decay of the leaves which have been\r\nwafted on to it so many successive falls, and a bright green weed is\r\nbrought up on anchors even in midwinter."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"We have one other pond just like this, White Pond, in Nine Acre\r\nCorner, about two and a half miles westerly; but, though I am\r\nacquainted with most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this\r\ncentre I do not know a third of this pure and well-like character.\r\nSuccessive nations perchance have drank at, admired, and fathomed\r\nit, and passed away, and still its water is green and pellucid as\r\never.

This is particularly distinct to one\r\nstanding on the middle of the pond in winter, just after a light\r\nsnow has fallen, appearing as a clear undulating white line,\r\nunobscured by weeds and twigs, and very obvious a quarter of a mile\r\noff in many places where in summer it is hardly distinguishable\r\nclose at hand.

I can remember\r\nwhen it was a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least five\r\nfeet higher, than when I lived by it. There is a narrow sand-bar\r\nrunning into it, with very deep water on one side, on which I helped\r\nboil a kettle of chowder, some six rods from the main shore, about the\r\nyear 1824, which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years;\r\nand, on the other hand, my friends used to listen with incredulity\r\nwhen I told them, that a few years later I was accustomed to fish from\r\na boat in a secluded cove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only\r\nshore they knew, which place was long since converted into a meadow.\r\nBut the pond has risen steadily for two years, and now, in the\r\nsummer of '52, is just five feet higher than when I lived there, or as\r\nhigh as it was thirty years ago, and fishing goes on again in the\r\nmeadow. This makes a difference of level, at the outside, of six or\r\nseven feet; and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is\r\ninsignificant in amount, and this overflow must be referred to\r\ncauses which affect the deep springs. This same summer the pond has\r\nbegun to fall again. It is remarkable that this fluctuation, whether\r\nperiodical or not, appears thus to require many years for its\r\naccomplishment.

On the side of the pond next my house a row of pitch pines,\r\nfifteen feet high, has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever,\r\nand thus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size indicates\r\nhow many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height. By\r\nthis fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore, and thus the\r\nshore is shorn, and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession.\r\nThese are the lips of the lake, on which no beard grows. It licks\r\nits chaps from time to time. When the water is at its height, the\r\nalders, willows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots\r\nseveral feet long from all sides of their stems in the water, and to\r\nthe height of three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to\r\nmaintain themselves; and I have known the high blueberry bushes\r\nabout the shore, which commonly produce no fruit, bear an abundant\r\ncrop under these circumstances."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly\r\npaved. My townsmen have all heard the tradition- the oldest people\r\ntell me that they heard it in their youth- that anciently the\r\nIndians were holding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high\r\ninto the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they\r\nused much profanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of\r\nwhich the Indians were never guilty, and while they were thus\r\nengaged the hill shook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw,\r\nnamed Walden, escaped, and from her the pond was named. It has been\r\nconjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side\r\nand became the present shore. It is very certain, at any rate, that\r\nonce there was no pond here, and now there is one; and this Indian\r\nfable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that\r\nancient settler whom I have mentioned, who remembers so well when he\r\nfirst came here with his divining-rod, saw a thin vapor rising from\r\nthe sward, and the hazel pointed steadily downward, and he concluded\r\nto dig a well here. As for the stones, many still think that they\r\nare hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these\r\nhills; but I observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of\r\nthe same kind of stones, so that they have been obliged to pile them\r\nup in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond; and,\r\nmoreover, there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt; so\r\nthat, unfortunately, it is no longer a mystery to me.

Its pickerel,\r\nthough not abundant, are its chief boast. I have seen at one time\r\nlying on the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds: a long\r\nand shallow one, steel-colored, most like those caught in the river; a\r\nbright golden kind, with greenish reflections and remarkably deep,\r\nwhich is the most common here; and another, golden-colored, and shaped\r\nlike the last, but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or\r\nblack spots, intermixed with a few faint blood-red ones, very much\r\nlike a trout. The specific name reticulatus would not apply to this;\r\nit should be guttatus rather. These are all very firm fish, and\r\nweigh more than their size promises. The shiners, pouts, and perch\r\nalso, and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond, are much\r\ncleaner, handsomer, and firmer-fleshed than those in the river and\r\nmost other ponds, as the water is purer, and they can easily be\r\ndistinguished from them.

When you invert your head, it looks like\r\na thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley, and\r\ngleaming against the distant pine woods, separating one stratum of the\r\natmosphere from another. You would think that you could walk dry under\r\nit to the opposite hills, and that the swallows which skim over\r\nmight perch on it. Indeed, they sometimes dive below this line, as\r\nit were by mistake, and are undeceived. As you look over the pond\r\nwestward you are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes\r\nagainst the reflected as well as the true sun, for they are equally\r\nbright; and if, between the two, you survey its surface critically, it\r\nis literally as smooth as glass, except where the skater insects, at\r\nequal intervals scattered over its whole extent, by their motions in\r\nthe sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on it, or, perchance,\r\na duck plumes itself, or, as I have said, a swallow skims so low as to\r\ntouch it. It may be that in the distance a fish describes an arc of\r\nthree or four feet in the air, and there is one bright flash where\r\nit emerges, and another where it strikes the water; sometimes the\r\nwhole silvery arc is revealed; or here and there, perhaps, is a\r\nthistle-down floating on its surface, which the fishes dart at and\r\nso dimple it again. It is like molten glass cooled but not\r\ncongealed, and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the\r\nimperfections in glass. You may often detect a yet smoother and darker\r\nwater, separated from the rest as if by an invisible cobweb, boom of\r\nthe water nymphs, resting on it. From a hilltop you can see a fish\r\nleap in almost any part; for not a pickerel or shiner picks an\r\ninsect from this smooth surface but it manifestly disturbs the\r\nequilibrium of the whole lake. It is wonderful with what elaborateness\r\nthis simple fact is advertised- this piscine murder will out- and from\r\nmy distant perch I distinguish the circling undulations when they\r\nare half a dozen rods in diameter. You can even detect a water-bug\r\n(Gyrinus) ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface a quarter of\r\na mile off; for they furrow the water slightly, making a conspicuous\r\nripple bounded by two diverging lines, but the skaters glide over it\r\nwithout rippling it perceptibly. When the surface is considerably\r\nagitated there are no skaters nor water-bugs on it, but apparently, in\r\ncalm days, they leave their havens and adventurously glide forth\r\nfrom the shore by short impulses till they completely cover it. It\r\nis a soothing employment, on one of those fine days in the fall when\r\nall the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated, to sit on a stump on\r\nsuch a height as this, overlooking the pond, and study the dimpling\r\ncircles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible\r\nsurface amid the reflected skies and trees. Over this great expanse\r\nthere is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away\r\nand assuaged, as, when a vase of water is jarred, the trembling\r\ncircles seek the shore and all is smooth again. Not a fish can leap or\r\nan insect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling\r\ndimples, in lines of beauty, as it were the constant welling up of its\r\nfountain, the gentle pulsing of its life, the heaving of its breast.\r\nThe thrills of joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable.

Paddling gently\r\nto one of these places, I was surprised to find myself surrounded by\r\nmyriads of small perch, about five inches long, of a rich bronze color\r\nin the green water, sporting there, and constantly rising to the\r\nsurface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on it. In such\r\ntransparent and seemingly bottomless water, reflecting the clouds, I\r\nseemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon, and their\r\nswimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering, as if they were\r\na compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the right or\r\nleft, their fins, like sails, set all around them. There were many\r\nsuch schools in the pond, apparently improving the short season before\r\nwinter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight,\r\nsometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze\r\nstruck it, or a few rain-drops fell there.

At length the wind\r\nrose, the mist increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch\r\nleaped much higher than before, half out of water, a hundred black\r\npoints, three inches long, at once above the surface. Even as late\r\nas the fifth of December, one year, I saw some dimples on the surface,\r\nand thinking it was going to rain hard immediately, the air being\r\nfun of mist, I made haste to take my place at the oars and row\r\nhomeward; already the rain seemed rapidly increasing, though I felt\r\nnone on my cheek, and I anticipated a thorough soaking.

About fifteen years ago you could see the top of a pitch\r\npine, of the kind called yellow pine hereabouts, though it is not a\r\ndistinct species, projecting above the surface in deep water, many\r\nrods from the shore. It was even supposed by some that the pond had\r\nsunk, and this was one of the primitive forest that formerly stood\r\nthere.

In the\r\nspring of \'49 I talked with the man who lives nearest the pond in\r\nSudbury, who told me that it was he who got out this tree ten or\r\nfifteen years before. As near as he could remember, it stood twelve or\r\nfifteen rods from the shore, where the water was thirty or forty\r\nfeet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out ice in\r\nthe forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid\r\nof his neighbors, he would take out the old yellow pine. He sawed a\r\nchannel in the ice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along\r\nand out on to the ice with oxen; but, before he had gone far in his\r\nwork, he was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward, with\r\nthe stumps of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly\r\nfastened in the sandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the\r\nbig end, and he had expected to get a good saw-log, but it was so\r\nrotten as to be fit only for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in\r\nhis shed then. There were marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the\r\nbutt. He thought that it might have been a dead tree on the shore, but\r\nwas finally blown over into the pond, and after the top had become\r\nwater-logged, while the butt-end was still dry and light, had\r\ndrifted out and sunk wrong end up. His father, eighty years old, could\r\nnot remember when it was not there.

Beside, there is something essentially\r\nunclean about this diet and all flesh, and I began to see where\r\nhousework commences, and whence the endeavor, which costs so much,\r\nto wear a tidy and respectable appearance each day, to keep the\r\nhouse sweet and free from all ill odors and sights. Having been my own\r\nbutcher and scullion and cook, as well as the gentleman for whom the\r\ndishes were served up, I can speak from an unusually complete\r\nexperience. The practical objection to animal food in my case was\r\nits uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked\r\nand eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It\r\nwas insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A\r\nlittle bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less\r\ntrouble and filth. Like many of my contemporaries, I had rarely for\r\nmany years used animal food, or tea, or coffee, etc.; not so much\r\nbecause of any ill effects which I had traced to them, as because they\r\nwere not agreeable to my imagination. The repugnance to animal food is\r\nnot the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It appeared more\r\nbeautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects; and though I\r\nnever did so, I went far enough to please my imagination. I believe\r\nthat every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher or\r\npoetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly\r\ninclined to abstain from animal food, and from much food of any\r\nkind. It is a significant fact, stated by entomologists- I find it\r\nin Kirby and Spence- that "some insects in their perfect state, though\r\nfurnished with organs of feeding, make no use of them"; and they lay\r\nit down as "a general rule, that almost all insects in this state\r\neat much less than in that of larvae. The voracious caterpillar when\r\ntransformed into a butterfly... and the gluttonous maggot when\r\nbecome a fly" content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some\r\nother sweet liquid. The abdomen under the wings of the butterfly\r\nstir represents the larva. This is the tidbit which tempts his\r\ninsectivorous fate.

The young suddenly disperse on your approach, at a signal\r\nfrom the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away, and they so\r\nexactly resemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has\r\nplaced his foot in the midst of a brood, and heard the whir of the old\r\nbird as she flew off, and her anxious calls and mewing, or seen her\r\ntrail her mings to attract his attention, without suspecting their\r\nneighborhood.

Looking farther, I was surprised to find\r\nthat the chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a\r\nduellum, but a bellum, a war between two races of ants, the red always\r\npitted against the black, and frequently two red ones to one black.\r\nThe legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my\r\nwoodyard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying,\r\nboth red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever\r\nwitnessed, the only battle-field I ever trod while the battle was\r\nraging; internecine war; the red republicans on the one hand, and\r\nthe black imperialists on the other. On every side they were engaged\r\nin deadly combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human\r\nsoldiers never fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that were fast\r\nlocked in each other's embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the\r\nchips, now at noonday prepared to fight till the sun went down, or\r\nlife went out. The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a\r\nvice to his adversary's front, and through all the tumblings on that\r\nfield never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near\r\nthe root, having already caused the other to go by the board; while\r\nthe stronger black one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw\r\non looking nearer, had already divested him of several of his members.\r\nThey fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs. Neither manifested\r\nthe least disposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry\r\nwas \"Conquer or die.\" In the meanwhile there came along a single red\r\nant on the hillside of this valley, evidently full of excitement,\r\nwho either had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the\r\nbattle; probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs;\r\nwhose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it.\r\nOr perchance he was some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath\r\napart, and had now come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this\r\nunequal combat from afar- for the blacks were nearly twice the size of\r\nthe red- he drew near with rapid pace till be stood on his guard\r\nwithin half an inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity,\r\nhe sprang upon the black warrior, and commenced his operations near\r\nthe root of his right fore leg, leaving the foe to select among his\r\nown members; and so there were three united for life, as if a new kind\r\nof attraction had been invented which put all other locks and\r\ncements to shame. I should not have wondered by this time to find that\r\nthey had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent\r\nchip, and playing their national airs the while, to excite the slow\r\nand cheer the dying combatants. I was myself excited somewhat even\r\nas if they had been men. The more you think of it, the less the\r\ndifference. And certainly there is not the fight recorded in Concord\r\nhistory, at least, if in the history of America, that will bear a\r\nmoment's comparison with this, whether for the numbers engaged in\r\nit, or for the patriotism and heroism displayed. For numbers and for\r\ncarnage it was an Austerlitz or Dresden. Concord Fight! Two killed\r\non the patriots' side, and Luther Blanchard wounded! Why here every\r\nant was a Buttrick- \"Fire! for God's sake fire!\"- and thousands shared\r\nthe fate of Davis and Hosmer. There was not one hireling there.

I\r\npursued with a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer\r\nthan before. He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he\r\nwould take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface\r\nthis time, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he\r\nlaughed long and loud, and with more reason than before. He manoeuvred\r\nso cunningly that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him.\r\nEach time, when he came to the surface, turning his head this way\r\nand that, he cooly surveyed the water and the land, and apparently\r\nchose his course so that he might come up where there was the widest\r\nexpanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat. It was\r\nsurprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into\r\nexecution. He led me at once to the widest part of the pond, and could\r\nnot be driven from it. While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I\r\nwas endeavoring to divine his thought in mine. It was a pretty game,\r\nplayed on the smooth surface of the pond, a man against a loon.\r\nSuddenly your adversary's checker disappears beneath the board, and\r\nthe problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear\r\nagain. Sometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of\r\nme, having apparently passed directly under the boat. So long-winded\r\nwas he and so unweariable, that when he had swum farthest he would\r\nimmediately plunge again, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine\r\nwhere in the deep pond, beneath the smooth surface, he might be\r\nspeeding his way like a fish, for he had time and ability to visit the\r\nbottom of the pond in its deepest part. It is said that loons have\r\nbeen caught in the New York lakes eighty feet beneath the surface,\r\nwith hooks set for trout- though Walden is deeper than that. How\r\nsurprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another\r\nsphere speeding his way amid their schools! Yet he appeared to know\r\nhis course as surely under water as on the surface, and swam much\r\nfaster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple where he approached the\r\nsurface, just put his head out to reconnoitre, and instantly dived\r\nagain. I found that it was as well for me to rest on my oars and\r\nwait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he would\r\nrise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over the\r\nsurface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh\r\nbehind me. But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he\r\ninvariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh?\r\nDid not his white breast enough betray him? He was indeed a silly\r\nloon, I thought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he\r\ncame up, and so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as\r\nfresh as ever, dived as willingly, and swam yet farther than at first.\r\nIt was surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled\r\nbreast when he came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed\r\nfeet beneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet\r\nsomewhat like that of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had\r\nbalked me most successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a\r\nlong-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than\r\nany bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and\r\ndeliberately howls. This was his looning- perhaps the wildest sound\r\nthat is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide. I\r\nconcluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts, confident of\r\nhis own resources. Though the sky was by this time overcast, the\r\npond was so smooth that I could see where he broke the surface when\r\nI did not hear him. His white breast, the stillness of the air, and\r\nthe smoothness of the water were all against him.

There, too, I admired, though I did not gather, the\r\ncranberries, small waxen gems, pendants of the meadow grass, pearly\r\nand red, which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake, leaving the smooth\r\nmeadow in a snarl, heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the\r\ndollar only, and sells the spoils of the meads to Boston and New York;\r\ndestined to be jammed, to satisfy the tastes of lovers of Nature\r\nthere. So butchers rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass,\r\nregardless of the torn and drooping plant. The barberry's brilliant\r\nfruit was likewise food for my eyes merely; but I collected a small\r\nstore of wild apples for coddling, which the proprietor and travellers\r\nhad overlooked. When chestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for\r\nwinter. It was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless\r\nchestnut woods of Lincoln- they now sleep their long sleep under the\r\nrailroad- with a bag on my shoulder, and a stick to open burs with\r\nin my hand, for I did not always wait for the frost, amid the rustling\r\nof leaves and the loud reproofs of the red squirrels and the jays,\r\nwhose half-consumed nuts I sometimes stole, for the burs which they\r\nhad selected were sure to contain sound ones. Occasionally I climbed\r\nand shook the trees. They grew also behind my house, and one large\r\ntree, which almost overshadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet\r\nwhich scented the whole neighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays\r\ngot most of its fruit; the last coming in flocks early in the\r\nmorning and picking the nuts out of the burs before they fell, I\r\nrelinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant woods\r\ncomposed wholly of chestnut. These nuts, as far as they went, were a\r\ngood substitute for bread. Many other substitutes might, perhaps, be\r\nfound. Digging one day for fishworms, I discovered the groundnut\r\n(Apios tuberosa) on its string, the potato of the aborigines, a sort\r\nof fabulous fruit, which I had begun to doubt if I had ever dug and\r\neaten in childhood, as I had told, and had not dreamed it.

It has a sweetish taste, much like that\r\nof a frost-bitten potato, and I found it better boiled than roasted.\r\nThis tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature to rear her own\r\nchildren and feed them simply here at some future period. In these\r\ndays of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields this humble root,\r\nwhich was once the totem of an Indian tribe, is quite forgotten, or\r\nknown only by its flowering vine; but let wild Nature reign here\r\nonce more, and the tender and luxurious English grains will probably\r\ndisappear before a myriad of foes, and without the care of man the\r\ncrow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the great\r\ncornfield of the Indian's God in the southwest, whence he is said to\r\nhave brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will\r\nperhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove\r\nitself indigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as\r\nthe diet of the hunter tribe.

There are many furrows in the\r\nsand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its\r\ntracks; and, for wrecks, it is strewn with the cases of caddis-worms\r\nmade of minute grains of white quartz. Perhaps these have creased\r\nit, for you find some of their cases in the furrows, though they are\r\ndeep and broad for them to make. But the ice itself is the object of\r\nmost interest, though you must improve the earliest opportunity to\r\nstudy it. If you examine it closely the morning after it freezes,\r\nyou find that the greater part of the bubbles, which at first appeared\r\nto be within it, are against its under surface, and that more are\r\ncontinually rising from the bottom; while the ice is as yet\r\ncomparatively solid and dark, that is, you see the water through it.\r\nThese bubbles are from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, very clear and beautiful, and you see your face reflected in\r\nthem through the ice. There may be thirty or forty of them to a square\r\ninch. There are also already within the ice narrow oblong\r\nperpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp cones with the\r\napex upward; or oftener, if the ice is quite fresh, minute spherical\r\nbubbles one directly above another, like a string of beads. But\r\nthese within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as those beneath.\r\nI sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the ice, and\r\nthose which broke through carried in air with them, which formed\r\nvery large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath. One day when I\r\ncame to the same place forty-eight hours afterward, I found that those\r\nlarge bubbles were still perfect, though an inch more of ice had\r\nformed, as I could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake.\r\nBut as the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer,\r\nthe ice was not now transparent, showing the dark green color of the\r\nwater, and the bottom, but opaque and whitish or gray, and though\r\ntwice as thick was hardly stronger than before, for the air bubbles\r\nhad greatly expanded under this heat and run together, and lost\r\ntheir regularity; they were no longer one directly over another, but\r\noften like silvery coins poured from a bag, one overlapping another,\r\nor in thin flakes, as if occupying slight cleavages.

The new ice had formed around and under the bubble,\r\nso that it was included between the two ices. It was wholly in the\r\nlower ice, but close against the upper, and was flattish, or perhaps\r\nslightly lenticular, with a rounded edge, a quarter of an inch deep by\r\nfour inches in diameter; and I was surprised to find that directly\r\nunder the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the\r\nform of a saucer reversed, to the height of five eighths of an inch in\r\nthe middle, leaving a thin partition there between the water and the\r\nbubble, hardly an eighth of an inch thick; and in many places the\r\nsmall bubbles in this partition had burst out downward, and probably\r\nthere was no ice at all under the largest bubbles, which were a foot\r\nin diameter. I inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles\r\nwhich I had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now\r\nfrozen in likewise, and that each, in its degree, had operated like\r\na burning-glass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it.

This I hauled up partly on the shore. After\r\nsoaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly\r\nsound, though waterlogged past drying.

Though completely waterlogged and almost\r\nas heavy as lead, they not only burned long, but made a very hot fire;\r\nnay, I thought that they burned better for the soaking, as if the\r\npitch, being confined by the water, burned longer, as in a lamp."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Gilpin, in his account of the forest borderers of England, says that\r\n"the encroachments of trespassers, and the houses and fences thus\r\nraised on the borders of the forest," were "considered as great\r\nnuisances by the old forest law, and were severely punished under\r\nthe name of purprestures, as tending ad terrorem ferarum- ad\r\nnocumentum forestae, etc.," to the frightening of the game and the\r\ndetriment of the forest.

It is remarkable how long men will\r\nbelieve in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble\r\nto sound it. I have visited two such Bottomless Ponds in one walk in\r\nthis neighborhood.

Some who have lain flat on the\r\nice for a long time, looking down through the illusive medium,\r\nperchance with watery eyes into the bargain, and driven to hasty\r\nconclusions by the fear of catching cold in their breasts, have seen\r\nvast holes "into which a load of hay might be drived," if there were\r\nanybody to drive it, the undoubted source of the Styx and entrance\r\nto the Infernal Regions from these parts. Others have gone down from\r\nthe village with a "fifty-six" and a wagon load of inch rope, but\r\nyet have failed to find any bottom; for while the "fifty-six" was\r\nresting by the way, they were paying out the rope in the vain\r\nattempt to fathom their truly immeasurable capacity for\r\nmarvellousness.

The greatest depth was exactly one hundred\r\nand two feet; to which may be added the five feet which it has risen\r\nsince, making one hundred and seven. This is a remarkable depth for so\r\nsmall an area; yet not an inch of it can be spared by the imagination.\r\nWhat if all ponds were shallow? Would it not react on the minds of\r\nmen?

A severe cold of\r\nit few days duration in March may very much retard the opening of\r\nthe former ponds, while the temperature of Walden increases almost\r\nuninterruptedly. A thermometer thrust into the middle of Walden on the\r\n6th of March, 1847, stood at 32', or freezing point; near the shore at\r\n33'; in the middle of Flint's Pond, the same day, at 32 1/2'; at a\r\ndozen rods from the shore, in shallow water, under ice a foot thick,\r\nat 36'. This difference of three and it half degrees between the\r\ntemperature of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond,\r\nand the fact that a great proportion of it is comparatively shallow,\r\nshow why it should break up so much sooner than Walden. The ice in the\r\nshallowest part was at this time several inches thinner than in the\r\nmiddle. In midwinter the middle had been the warmest and the ice\r\nthinnest there. So, also, every one who has waded about the shores\r\nof the pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the water is\r\nclose to the shore, where only three or four inches deep, than a\r\nlittle distance out, and on the surface where it is deep, than near\r\nthe bottom. In spring the sun not only exerts an influence through the\r\nincreased temperature of the air and earth, but its heat passes\r\nthrough ice a foot or more thick, and is reflected from the bottom\r\nin shallow water, and so also warms the water and melts the under side\r\nof the ice, at the same time that it is melting it more directly\r\nabove, making it uneven, and causing the air bubbles which it contains\r\nto extend themselves upward and downward until it is completely\r\nhoneycombed, and at last disappears suddenly in a single spring\r\nrain. Ice has its grain as well as wood, and when a cake begins to rot\r\nor \"comb,\" that is, assume the appearance of honeycomb, whatever may\r\nbe its position, the air cells are at right angles with what was the\r\nwater surface. Where there is a rock or a log rising near to the\r\nsurface the ice over it is much thinner, and is frequently quite\r\ndissolved by this reflected heat; and I have been told that in the\r\nexperiment at Cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond,\r\nthough the cold air circulated underneath, and so had access to both\r\nsides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than\r\ncounterbalanced this advantage. When a warm rain in the middle of\r\nthe winter melts off the snow ice from Walden, and leaves a hard\r\ndark or transparent ice on the middle, there will be a strip of rotten\r\nthough thicker white ice, a rod or more wide, about the shores,\r\ncreated by this reflected heat. Also, as I have said, the bubbles\r\nthemselves within the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice\r\nbeneath."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a\r\nsmall scale. Every morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is\r\nbeing warmed more rapidly than the deep, though it may not be made\r\nso warm after all, and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly\r\nuntil the morning, The day is an epitome of the year. The night is the\r\nwinter, the morning and evening are the spring and fall, and the\r\nnoon is the summer. The cracking and booming of the ice indicate a\r\nchange of temperature. One pleasant morning after a cold night,\r\nFebruary 24th, 1850, having gone to Flint's Pond to spend the day, I\r\nnoticed with surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of\r\nmy axe, it resounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I\r\nhad struck on a tight drum-head. The pond began to boom about an\r\nhour after sunrise, when it felt the influence of the sun's rays\r\nslanted upon it from over the hills; it stretched itself and yawned\r\nlike a waking man with a gradually increasing tumult, which was kept\r\nup three or four hours. It took a short siesta at noon, and boomed\r\nonce more toward night, as the sun was withdrawing his influence. In\r\nthe right stage of the weather a pond fires its evening gun with great\r\nregularity. But in the middle of the day, being full of cracks, and\r\nthe air also being less elastic, it had completely lost its resonance,\r\nand probably fishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by a\r\nblow on it. The fishermen say that the \"thundering of the pond\" scares\r\nthe fishes and prevents their biting. The pond does not thunder\r\nevery evening, and I cannot tell surely when to expect its thundering;\r\nbut though I may perceive no difference in the weather, it does. Who\r\nwould have suspected so large and cold and thick-skinned a thing to be\r\nso sensitive? Yet it has its law to which it thunders obedience when\r\nit should as surely as the buds expand in the spring. The earth is all\r\nalive and covered with papillae.

Fogs and rains and warmer suns are gradually melting the snow;\r\nthe days have grown sensibly longer; and I see how I shall get through\r\nthe winter without adding to my woodpile, for large fires are no\r\nlonger necessary. I am on the alert for the first signs of spring,\r\nto hear the chance note of some arriving bird, or the striped\r\nsquirrel's chirp, for his stores must be now nearly exhausted, or\r\nsee the woodchuck venture out of his winter quarters. On the 13th of\r\nMarch, after I had heard the bluebird, song sparrow, and red-wing, the\r\nice was still nearly a foot thick. As the weather grew warmer it was\r\nnot sensibly worn away by the water, nor broken up and floated off\r\nas in rivers, but, though it was completely melted for half a rod in\r\nwidth about the shore, the middle was merely honeycombed and saturated\r\nwith water, so that you could put your foot through it when six inches\r\nthick; but by the next day evening, perhaps, after a warm rain\r\nfollowed by fog, it would have wholly disappeared, all gone off with\r\nthe fog, spirited away. One year I went across the middle only five\r\ndays before it disappeared entirely. In 1845 Walden was first\r\ncompletely open on the 1st of April; in '46, the 25th of March; in\r\n'47, the 8th of April; in '51, the 28th of March; in '52, the 18th\r\nof April; in '53, the 23d of March; in '54, about the 7th of April."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Every incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and\r\nponds and the settling of the weather is particularly interesting to\r\nus who live in a climate of so great extremes.

The material was sand of\r\nevery degree of fineness and of various rich colors, commonly mixed\r\nwith a little clay. When the frost comes out in the spring, and even\r\nin a thawing day in the winter, the sand begins to flow down the\r\nslopes like lava, sometimes bursting out through the snow and\r\noverflowing it where no sand was to be seen before. Innumerable little\r\nstreams overlap and interlace one with another, exhibiting a sort of\r\nhybrid product, which obeys half way the law of currents, and half way\r\nthat of vegetation. As it flows it takes the forms of sappy leaves\r\nor vines, making heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth, and\r\nresembling, as you look down on them, the laciniated, lobed, and\r\nimbricated thalluses of some lichens; or you are reminded of coral, of\r\nleopard's paws or birds' feet, of brains or lungs or bowels, and\r\nexcrements of all kinds. It is a truly grotesque vegetation, whose\r\nforms and color we see imitated in bronze, a sort of architectural\r\nfoliage more ancient and typical than acanthus, chiccory, ivy, vine,\r\nor any vegetable leaves; destined perhaps, under some circumstances,\r\nto become a puzzle to future geologists.

When the flowing mass reaches the drain at the foot of the\r\nbank it spreads out flatter into strands, the separate streams\r\nlosing their semicylindrical form and gradually becoming more flat and\r\nbroad, running together as they are more moist, till they form an\r\nalmost flat sand, still variously and beautifully shaded, but in which\r\nyou call trace the original forms of vegetation; till at length, in\r\nthe water itself, they are converted into banks, like those formed off\r\nthe mouths of rivers, and the forms of vegetation are lost in the\r\nripple- marks on the bottom."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The whole bank, which is from twenty to forty feet high, is\r\nsometimes overlaid with a mass of this kind of foliage, or sandy\r\nrupture, for a quarter of a mile on one or both sides, the produce\r\nof one spring day. What makes this sand foliage remarkable is its\r\nspringing into existence thus suddenly. When I see on the one side the\r\ninert bank- for the sun acts on one side first- and on the other\r\nthis luxuriant foliage, the creation of an hour, I am affected as if\r\nin a peculiar sense I stood in the laboratory of the Artist who made\r\nthe world and me- had come to where he was still at work, sporting\r\non this bank, and with excess of energy strewing his fresh designs\r\nabout. I feel as if I were nearer to the vitals of the globe, for this\r\nsandy overflow is something such a foliaceous mass as the vitals of\r\nthe animal body. You find thus in the very sands an anticipation of\r\nthe vegetable leaf. No wonder that the earth expresses itself\r\noutwardly in leaves, it so labors with the idea inwardly. The atoms\r\nhave already learned this law, and are pregnant by it. The overhanging\r\nleaf sees here its prototype. Internally, whether in the globe or\r\nanimal body, it is a moist thick lobe, a word especially applicable to\r\nthe liver and lungs and the leaves of fat (leibo, labor, lapsus, to\r\nflow or slip downward, a lapsing; lobos, globus, lobe, globe; also\r\nlap, flap, and many other words); externally a dry thin leaf, even\r\nas the f and v are a pressed and dried b. The radicals of lobe are lb,\r\nthe soft mass of the b (single-lobed, or B, double-lobed), with the\r\nliquid l behind it pressing it forward. In globe, glb, the guttural\r\ng adds to the meaning the capacity of the throat. The feathers and\r\nwings of birds are still drier and thinner leaves. Thus, also, you\r\npass from the lumpish grub in the earth to the airy and fluttering\r\nbutterfly. The very globe continually transcends and translates\r\nitself, and becomes winged in its orbit. Even ice begins with delicate\r\ncrystal leaves, as if it had flowed into moulds which the fronds of\r\nwaterplants have impressed on the watery mirror.

It is wonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes\r\nitself as it flows, using the best material its mass affords to form\r\nthe sharp edges of its channel. Such are the sources of rivers. In the\r\nsilicious matter which the water deposits is perhaps the bony\r\nsystem, and in the still finer soil and organic matter the fleshy\r\nfibre or cellular tissue.

Each rounded lobe of\r\nthe vegetable leaf, too, is a thick and now loitering drop, larger\r\nor smaller; the lobes are the fingers of the leaf; and as many lobes\r\nas it has, in so many directions it tends to flow, and more heat or\r\nother genial influences would have caused it to flow yet farther."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Thus it seemed that this one hillside illustrated the principle of\r\nall the operations of Nature.

I delight to come\r\nto my bearings- not walk in procession with pomp and parade, in a\r\nconspicuous place, but to walk even with the Builder of the\r\nuniverse, if I may- not to live in this restless, nervous, bustling,\r\ntrivial Nineteenth Century, but stand or sit thoughtfully while it\r\ngoes by. What are men celebrating? They are all on a committee of\r\narrangements, and hourly expect a speech from somebody. God is only\r\nthe president of the day, and Webster is his orator. I love to\r\nweigh, to settle, to gravitate toward that which most strongly and\r\nrightfully attracts me;- not hang by the beam of the scale and try\r\nto weigh less- not suppose a case, but take the case that is; to\r\ntravel the only path I can, and that on which no power can resist\r\nme. It affords me no satisfaction to commerce to spring an arch before\r\nI have got a solid foundation. Let us not play at kittly-benders.\r\nThere is a solid bottom everywhere. We read that the traveller asked\r\nthe boy if the swamp before him had a hard bottom. The boy replied\r\nthat it had. But presently the traveller\'s horse sank in up to the\r\ngirths, and he observed to the boy, "I thought you said that this\r\nbog had a hard bottom." "So it has," answered the latter, "but you\r\nhave not got half way to it yet." So it is with the bogs and\r\nquicksands of society; but he is an old boy that knows it. Only what\r\nis thought, said, or done at a certain rare coincidence is good. I\r\nwould not be one of those who will foolishly drive a nail into mere\r\nlath and plastering; such a deed would keep me awake nights. Give me a\r\nhammer, and let me feel for the furring. Do not depend on the putty.\r\nDrive a nail home and clinch it so faithfully that you can wake up\r\nin the night and think of your work with satisfaction- a work at which\r\nyou would not be ashamed to invoke the Muse. So will help you God, and\r\nso only. Every nail driven should be as another rivet in the machine\r\nof the universe, you carrying on the work.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a\r\ntable where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious\r\nattendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry\r\nfrom the inhospitable board. The hospitality was as cold as the\r\nices. I thought that there was no need of ice to freeze them. They\r\ntalked to me of the age of the wine and the fame of the vintage; but I\r\nthought of an older, a newer, and purer wine, of a more glorious\r\nvintage, which they had not got, and could not buy. The style, the\r\nhouse and grounds and "entertainment" pass for nothing with me. I\r\ncalled on the king, but he made me wait in his hall, and conducted\r\nlike a man incapacitated for hospitality.

There are the Records of the\r\nPhilosophical Societies, and the public Eulogies of Great Men! It is\r\nthe good Adam contemplating his own virtue. "Yes, we have done great\r\ndeeds, and sung divine songs, which shall never die"- that is, as long\r\nas we can remember them. The learned societies and great men of\r\nAssyria- where are they?

As\r\nI stand over the insect crawling amid the pine needles on the forest\r\nfloor, and endeavoring to conceal itself from my sight, and ask myself\r\nwhy it will cherish those humble thoughts, and bide its head from me\r\nwho might, perhaps, be its benefactor, and impart to its race some\r\ncheering information, I am reminded of the greater Benefactor and\r\nIntelligence that stands over me the human insect.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"There is an incessant influx of novelty into the world, and yet we\r\ntolerate incredible dulness.
