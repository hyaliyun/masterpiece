All who have followed the\r\ncareer of GOETHE are familiar with the name and character of\r\nDALBERG, and also with the deep and lasting friendship that\r\nexisted between them, from which SCHILLER too was not absent;\r\nrecalling to the mind the days of old, when a Virgil and a Horace\r\nand a Maecenas sat side by side."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Remembering, then, the connection that, in a former century,\r\nwas formed and riveted between your illustrious ancestor and him\r\nwhom it is the object of these pages to represent, I deem it a\r\nhappy augury that the link then established finds itself not\r\nwholly severed even now (although its strength may be\r\nimmeasurably weakened in the comparison), inasmuch as this page\r\nbrings them once more in contact, the one in the person of his\r\nown descendant, the other in that of the translator of his Poems."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Believe me, with great truth,\r\nVery faithfully yours,\r\nEDGAR A.

Preeminently\r\nis this the case with Goethe, the most masterly of all the master\r\nminds of modern times, whose name is already inscribed on the\r\ntablets of immortality, and whose fame already extends over the\r\nearth, although as yet only in its infancy. Scarcely have two\r\ndecades passed away since he ceased to dwell among men, yet he\r\nnow stands before us, not as a mere individual, like those whom\r\nthe world is wont to call great, but as a type, as an emblem--the\r\nrecognised emblem and representative of the human mind in its\r\npresent stage of culture and advancement."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Among the infinitely varied effusions of Goethe's pen, perhaps\r\nthere are none which are of as general interest as his Poems,\r\nwhich breathe the very spirit of Nature, and embody the real\r\nmusic of the feelings. In Germany, they are universally known,\r\nand are considered as the most delightful of his works. Yet in\r\nthis country, this kindred country, sprung from the same stem,\r\nand so strongly resembling her sister in so many points, they are\r\nnearly unknown. Almost the only poetical work of the greatest\r\nPoet that the world has seen for ages, that is really and\r\ngenerally read in England, is Faust, the translations of which\r\nare almost endless; while no single person has as yet appeared to\r\nattempt to give, in an English dress, in any collective or\r\nsystematic manner, those smaller productions of the genius of\r\nGoethe which it is the object of the present volume to lay before\r\nthe reader, whose indulgence is requested for its many\r\nimperfections. In addition to the beauty of the language in which\r\nthe Poet has given utterance to his thoughts, there is a depth of\r\nmeaning in those thoughts which is not easily discoverable at\r\nfirst sight, and the translator incurs great risk of overlooking\r\nit, and of giving a prosaic effect to that which in the original\r\ncontains the very essence of poetry. It is probably this\r\ndifficulty that has deterred others from undertaking the task I\r\nhave set myself, and in which I do not pretend to do more than\r\nattempt to give an idea of the minstrelsy of one so unrivalled,\r\nby as truthful an interpretation of it as lies in my power."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The principles which have guided me on the present occasion are\r\nthe same as those followed in the translation of Schiller's\r\ncomplete Poems that was published by me in 1851, namely, as\r\nliteral a rendering of the original as is consistent with good\r\nEnglish, and also a very strict adherence to the metre of the\r\noriginal. Although translators usually allow themselves great\r\nlicense in both these points, it appears to me that by so doing\r\nthey of necessity destroy the very soul of the work they profess\r\nto translate. In fact, it is not a translation, but a paraphrase\r\nthat they give. It may perhaps be thought that the present\r\ntranslations go almost to the other extreme, and that a rendering\r\nof metre, line for line, and word for word, makes it impossible\r\nto preserve the poetry of the original both in substance and in\r\nsound. But experience has convinced me that it is not so, and\r\nthat great fidelity is even the most essential element of\r\nsuccess, whether in translating poetry or prose. It was therefore\r\nvery satisfactory to me to find that the principle laid down by\r\nme to myself in translating Schiller met with the very general,\r\nif not universal, approval of the reader. At the same time, I\r\nhave endeavoured to profit in the case of this, the younger born\r\nof the two attempts made by me to transplant the muse of Germany\r\nto the shores of Britain, by the criticisms, whether friendly or\r\nhostile, that have been evoked or provoked by the appearance of\r\nits elder brother."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"As already mentioned, the latter contained the whole of the\r\nPoems of Schiller.

They contain between 30,000\r\nand 40,000 verses, exclusive of his plays. and similar works.\r\nVery many of these would be absolutely without interest to the\r\nEnglish reader,--such as those having only a local application,\r\nthose addressed to individuals, and so on. Others again, from\r\ntheir extreme length, could only be published in separate\r\nvolumes. But the impossibility of giving all need form no\r\nobstacle to giving as much as possible; and it so happens that\r\nthe real interest of Goethe's Poems centres in those classes of\r\nthem which are not too diffuse to run any risk when translated of\r\noffending the reader by their too great number. Those by far the\r\nmore generally admired are the Songs and Ballads, which are about\r\n150 in number, and the whole of which are contained in this\r\nvolume (with the exception of one or two of the former, which\r\nhave been, on consideration, left out by me owing to their\r\ntrifling and uninteresting nature).
