Recall the year\r\nWhen our beloved Caliph put to death\r\nHis Vizir Jaffer for an unknown reason:\r\n\"If but the shirt upon my body knew it\r\nI'd tear it off and throw it in the fire.'\r\nThat speech was all that the town knew, but he\r\nSeemed for a while to have grown young again;\r\nSeemed so on purpose, muttered Jaffer's friends,\r\nThat none might know that he was conscience-struck --\r\nBut that s a traitor's thought.  Enough for me\r\nThat in the early summer of the year\r\nThe mightiest of the princes of the world\r\nCame to the least considered of his courtiers;\r\nSat down upon the fountain's marble edge,\r\nOne hand amid the goldfish in the pool;\r\nAnd thereupon a colloquy took place\r\nThat I commend to all the chroniclers\r\nTo show how violent great hearts can lose\r\nTheir bitterness and find the honeycomb.\r\n\"I have brought a slender bride into the house;\r\nYou know the saying, \"\"Change the bride with spring.''\r\nAnd she and I, being sunk in happiness,\r\nCannot endure to think you tread these paths,\r\nWhen evening stirs the jasmine bough, and yet\r\nAre brideless.'\r\n\"I am falling into years.'\r\n\"But such as you and I do not seem old\r\nLike men who live by habit.  Every day\r\nI ride with falcon to the river's edge\r\nOr carry the ringed mail upon my back,\r\nOr court a woman; neither enemy,\r\nGame-bird, nor woman does the same thing twice;\r\nAnd so a hunter carries in the eye\r\nA mimic of youth.  Can poet's thought\r\nThat springs from body and in body falls\r\nLike this pure jet, now lost amid blue sky,\r\nNow bathing lily leaf and fish's scale,\r\nBe mimicry?'\r\n\"What matter if our souls\r\nAre nearer to the surface of the body\r\nThan souls that start no game and turn no rhyme!\r\nThe soul's own youth and not the body's youth\r\nShows through our lineaments.  My candle's bright,\r\nMy lantern is too loyal not to show\r\nThat it was made in your great father's reign,\r\nAnd yet the jasmine season warms our blood.'\r\n\"Great prince, forgive the freedom of my speech:\r\nYou think that love has seasons, and you think\r\nThat if the spring bear off what the spring gave\r\nThe heart need suffer no defeat; but I\r\nWho have accepted the Byzantine faith,\r\nThat seems unnatural to Arabian minds,\r\nThink when I choose a bride I choose for ever;\r\nAnd if her eye should not grow bright for mine\r\nOr brighten only for some younger eye,\r\nMy heart could never turn from daily ruin,\r\nNor find a remedy.'\r\n\"But what if I\r\nHave lit upon a woman who so shares\r\nYour thirst for those old crabbed mysteries,\r\nSo strains to look beyond Our life, an eye\r\nThat never knew that strain would scarce seem bright,\r\nAnd yet herself can seem youth's very fountain,\r\nBeing all brimmed with life?'\r\n\"Were it but true\r\nI would have found the best that life can give,\r\nCompanionship in those mysterious things\r\nThat make a man's soul or a woman's soul\r\nItself and not some other soul.'\r\n\"That love\r\nMust needs be in this life and in what follows\r\nUnchanging and at peace, and it is right\r\nEvery philosopher should praise that love.\r\nBut I being none can praise its opposite.\r\nIt makes my passion stronger but to think\r\nLike passion stirs the peacock and his mate,\r\nThe wild stag and the doe; that mouth to mouth\r\nIs a man's mockery of the changeless soul.'\r\nAnd thereupon his bounty gave what now\r\nCan shake more blossom from autumnal chill\r\nThan all my bursting springtime knew.  A girl\r\nPerched in some window of her mother's housc\r\nHad watched my daily passage to and fro;\r\nHad heard impossible history of my past;\r\nImagined some impossible history\r\nLived at my side; thought time's disfiguring touch\r\nGave but more reason for a woman's care.\r\nYet was it love of me, or was it love\r\nOf the stark mystery that has dazed my sight,\r\nperplexed her fantasy and planned her care?\r\nOr did the torchlight of that mystery\r\nPick out my features in such light and shade\r\nTwo contemplating passions chose one theme\r\nThrough sheer bewilderment? She had not paced\r\nThe garden paths, nor counted up the rooms,\r\nBefore she had spread a book upon her knees\r\nAnd asked about the pictures or the text;\r\nAnd often those first days I saw her stare\r\nOn old dry writing in a learned tongue,\r\nOn old dry faggots that could never please\r\nThe extravagance of spring; or move a hand\r\nAs if that writing or the figured page\r\nWere some dear cheek.\r\nUpon a moonless night\r\nI sat where I could watch her sleeping form,\r\nAnd wrote by candle-light; but her form moved.\r\nAnd fearing that my light disturbed her sleep\r\nI rose that I might screen it with a cloth.\r\nI heard her voice, \"Turn that I may expound\r\nWhat's bowed your shoulder and made pale your cheek\r\nAnd saw her sitting upright on the bed;\r\nOr was it she that spoke or some great Djinn?\r\nI say that a Djinn spoke.  A livelong hour\r\nShe seemed the learned man and I the child;\r\nTruths without father came, truths that no book\r\nOf all the uncounted books that I have read,\r\nNor thought out of her mind or mine begot,\r\nSelf-born, high-born, and solitary truths,\r\nThose terrible implacable straight lines\r\nDrawn through the wandering vegetative dream,\r\nEven those truths that when my bones are dust\r\nMust drive the Arabian host.\r\nThe voice grew still,\r\nAnd she lay down upon her bed and slept,\r\nBut woke at the first gleam of day, rose up\r\nAnd swept the house and sang about her work\r\nIn childish ignorance of all that passed.\r\nA dozen nights of natural sleep, and then\r\nWhen the full moon swam to its greatest height\r\nShe rose, and with her eyes shut fast in sleep\r\nWalked through the house.  Unnoticed and unfelt\r\nI wrapped her in a hooded cloak, and she,\r\nHalf running, dropped at the first ridge of the desert\r\nAnd there marked out those emblems on the sand\r\nThat day by day I study and marvel at,\r\nWith her white finger.  I led her home asleep\r\nAnd once again she rose and swept the house\r\nIn childish ignorance of all that passed.\r\nEven to-day, after some seven years\r\nWhen maybe thrice in every moon her mouth\r\nMurmured the wisdom of the desert Djinns,\r\nShe keeps that ignorance, nor has she now\r\nThat first unnatural interest in my books.\r\nIt seems enough that I am there; and yet,\r\nOld fellow-student, whose most patient ear\r\nHeard all the anxiety of my passionate youth,\r\nIt seems I must buy knowledge with my peace.\r\nWhat if she lose her ignorance and so\r\nDream that I love her only for the voice,\r\nThat every gift and every word of praise\r\nIs but a payment for that midnight voice\r\nThat is to age what milk is to a child?\r\nWere she to lose her love, because she had lost\r\nHer confidence in mine, or even lose\r\nIts first simplicity, love, voice and all,\r\nAll my fine feathers would be plucked away\r\nAnd I left shivering.  The voice has drawn\r\nA quality of wisdom from her love's\r\nParticular quality.
