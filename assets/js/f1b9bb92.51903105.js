Under Queen Anne he was an original poet, but made little money by his verses; under George I. he was chiefly a translator, and made much money by satisfying the French-classical taste with versions of the "Iliad" and "Odyssey."  Under George I. he also edited Shakespeare, but with little profit to himself; for Shakespeare was but a Philistine in the eyes of the French-classical critics.  But as the eighteenth century grew slowly to its work, signs of a deepening interest in the real issues of life distracted men\'s attention from the culture of the snuff-box and the fan.  As Pope\'s genius ripened, the best part of the world in which he worked was pressing forward, as a mariner who will no longer hug the coast but crowds all sail to cross the storms of a wide unknown sea.  Pope\'s poetry thus deepened with the course of time, and the third period of his life, which fell within the reign of George II., was that in which he produced the "Essay on Man," the "Moral Essays," and the "Satires."  These deal wholly with aspects of human life and the great questions they raise, according throughout with the doctrine of the poet, and of the reasoning world about him in his latter day, that "the proper study of mankind is Man."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Wrongs in high places, and the private infamy of many who enforced the doctrines of the Church, had produced in earnest men a vigorous antagonism. Tyranny and unreason of low-minded advocates had brought religion itself into question; and profligacy of courtiers, each worshipping the golden calf seen in his mirror, had spread another form of scepticism.  The intellectual scepticism, based upon an honest search for truth, could end only in making truth the surer by its questionings.  The other form of scepticism, which might be traced in England from the low-minded frivolities of the court of Charles the Second, was widely spread among the weak, whose minds flinched from all earnest thought.  They swelled the number of the army of bold questioners upon the ways of God to Man, but they were an idle rout of camp-followers, not combatants; they simply ate, and drank, and died."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'In 1697, Pierre Bayle published at Rotterdam, his "Historical and Critical Dictionary," in which the lives of men were associated with a comment that suggested, from the ills of life, the absence of divine care in the shaping of the world.  Doubt was born of the corruption of society; Nature and Man were said to be against faith in the rule of a God, wise, just, and merciful.  In 1710, after Bayle\'s death, Leibnitz, a German philosopher then resident in Paris, wrote in French a book, with a title formed from Greek words meaning Justice of God, Theodicee, in which he met Bayle\'s argument by reasoning that what we cannot understand confuses us, because we see only the parts of a great whole.  Bayle, he said, is now in Heaven, and from his place by the throne of God, he sees the harmony of the great Universe, and doubts no more.  We see only a little part in which are many details that have purposes beyond our ken.  The argument of Leibnitz\'s Theodicee was widely used; and although Pope said that he had never read the Theodicee, his "Essay on Man" has a like argument.  When any book has a wide influence upon opinion, its general ideas pass into the minds of many people who have never read it.  Many now talk about evolution and natural selection, who have never read a line of Darwin.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'In the reign of George the Second, questionings did spread that went to the roots of all religious faith, and many earnest minds were busying themselves with problems of the state of Man, and of the evidence of God in the life of man, and in the course of Nature.  Out of this came, nearly at the same time, two works wholly different in method and in tone -- so different, that at first sight it may seem absurd to speak of them together.  They were Pope\'s "Essay on Man," and Butler\'s "Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Butler\'s "Analogy" was published in 1736; of the "Essay on Man," the first two Epistles appeared in 1732, the Third Epistle in 1733, the Fourth in 1734, and the closing Universal Hymn in 1738.  It may seem even more absurd to name Pope\'s "Essay on Man" in the same breath with Milton\'s "Paradise Lost;" but to the best of his knowledge and power, in his smaller way, according to his nature and the questions of his time, Pope was, like Milton, endeavouring "to justify the ways of God to Man."  He even borrowed Milton\'s line for his own poem, only weakening the verb, and said that he sought to "vindicate the ways of God to Man."  In Milton\'s day the questioning all centred in the doctrine of the "Fall of Man," and questions of God\'s Justice were associated with debate on fate, fore-knowledge, and free will.  In Pope\'s day the question was not theological, but went to the root of all faith in existence of a God, by declaring that the state of Man and of the world about him met such faith with an absolute denial.  Pope\'s argument, good or bad, had nothing to do with questions of theology.  Like Butler\'s, it sought for grounds of faith in the conditions on which doubt was rested.  Milton sought to set forth the story of the Fall in such way as to show that God was love.  Pope dealt with the question of God in Nature, and the world of Man.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Pope's argument was attacked with violence by M. de Crousaz, Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics in the University of Lausanne, and defended by Warburton, then chaplain to the Prince of Wales, in six letters published in 1739, and a seventh in 1740, for which Pope (who died in 1744) was deeply grateful.  His offence in the eyes of de Crousaz was that he had left out of account all doctrines of orthodox theology.  But if he had been orthodox of the orthodox, his argument obviously could have been directed only to the form of doubt it sought to overcome.  And when his closing hymn was condemned as the freethinker's hymn, its censurers surely forgot that their arguments against it would equally apply to the Lord's Prayer, of which it is, in some degree, a paraphrase."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'The first design of the Essay on Man arranged it into four books, each consisting of a distinct group of Epistles.  The First Book, in four Epistles, was to treat of man in the abstract, and of his relation to the Universe.  That is the whole work as we have it now.  The Second Book was to treat of Man Intellectual; the Third Book, of Man Social, including ties to Church and State; the Fourth Book, of Man Moral, was to illustrate abstract truth by sketches of character.  This part of the design is represented by the Moral Essays, of which four were written, to which was added, as a fifth, the Epistle to Addison which had been written much earlier, in 1715, and first published in 1720.  The four Moral essays are two pairs.  One pair is upon the Characters of Men and on the Characters of Women, which would have formed the opening of the subject of the Fourth Book of the Essay:  the other pair shows character expressed through a right or a wrong use of Riches:  in fact, Money and Morals.  The four Epistles were published separately.  The fourth (to the Earl of Burlington) was first published in 1731, its title then being "Of Taste;" the third (to Lord Bathurst) followed in 1732, the year of the publication of the first two Epistles on the "Essay on Man."  In 1733, the year of publication of the Third Epistle of the "Essay on Man," Pope published his Moral Essay of the "Characters of Men."  in 1734 followed the Fourth Epistle of the "Essay on Man;" and in 1735 the "Characters of Women," addressed to Martha Blount, the woman whom Pope loved, though he was withheld by a frail body from marriage.  Thus the two works were, in fact, produced together, parts of one design.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Pope\'s Satires, which still deal with characters of men, followed immediately, some appearing in a folio in January, 1735.  That part of the epistle to Arbuthnot forming the Prologue, which gives a character of Addison, as Atticus, had been sketched more than twelve years before, and earlier sketches of some smaller critics were introduced; but the beginning and the end, the parts in which Pope spoke of himself and of his father and mother, and his friend Dr. Arbuthnot, were written in 1733 and 1734.  Then follows an imitation of the first Epistle of the Second Book of the Satires of Horace, concerning which Pope told a friend, "When I had a fever one winter in town that confined me to my room for five or six days, Lord Bolingbroke, who came to see me, happened to take up a Horace that lay on the table, and, turning it over, dropped on the first satire in the Second Book, which begins, \'Sunt, quibus in satira.\'  He observed how well that would suit my case if I were to imitate it in English.  After he was gone, I read it over, translated it in a morning or two, and sent it to press in a week or a fortnight after" (February, 1733).  "And this was the occasion of my imitating some others of the Satires and Epistles."  The two dialogues finally used as the Epilogue to the Satires were first published in the year 1738, with the name of the year, "Seventeen Hundred and Thirty-eight."  Samuel Johnson\'s "London," his first bid for recognition, appeared in the same week, and excited in Pope not admiration only, but some active endeavour to be useful to its author.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The reader of Pope, as of every author, is advised to begin by letting him say what he has to say, in his own manner to an open mind that seeks only to receive the impressions which the writer wishes to convey.  First let the mind and spirit of the writer come into free, full contact with the mind and spirit of the reader, whose attitude at the first reading should be simply receptive.  Such reading is the condition precedent to all true judgment of a writer's work.  All criticism that is not so grounded spreads as fog over a poet's page.

It is therefore in the anatomy of the Mind as in that of the Body; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and perceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels, the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation.  The disputes are all upon these last, and, I will venture to say, they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other, and have diminished the practice more than advanced the theory of Morality.

I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail, without becoming dry and tedious; or more poetically, without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament, without wandering from the precision, or breaking the chain of reasoning: if any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"What is now published is only to be considered as a general Map of Man, marking out no more than the greater parts, their extent, their limits, and their connection, and leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow.

divine.\r\nNot that I'd lop the beauties from his book,\r\nLike slashing Bentley with his desperate hook,\r\nOr damn all Shakespeare, like the affected fool\r\nAt court, who hates whate'er he read at school.\r\nBut for the wits of either Charles's days,\r\nThe mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease;\r\nSprat, Carew, Sedley, and a hundred more,\r\n(Like twinkling stars the miscellanies o'er)\r\nOne simile, that solitary shines\r\nIn the dry desert of a thousand lines,\r\nOr lengthened thought that gleams through many a page,\r\nHas sanctified whole poems for an age.\r\nI lose my patience, and I own it too,\r\nWhen works are censured, not as bad but new;\r\nWhile if our elders break all reason's laws,\r\nThese fools demand not pardon, but applause.\r\nOn Avon's bank, where flowers eternal blow,\r\nIf I but ask, if any weed can grow;\r\nOne tragic sentence if I dare deride\r\nWhich Betterton's grave action dignified,\r\nOr well-mouthed Booth with emphasis proclaims,\r\n(Though but, perhaps, a muster-roll of names)\r\nHow will our fathers rise up in a rage,\r\nAnd swear, all shame is lost in George's age!\r\nYou'd think no fools disgraced the former reign,\r\nDid not some grave examples yet remain,\r\nWho scorn a lad should teach his father skill,\r\nAnd, having once been wrong, will be so still.\r\nHe, who to seem more deep than you or I,\r\nExtols old bards, or Merlin's Prophecy,\r\nMistake him not; he envies, not admires,\r\nAnd to debase the sons, exalts the sires.\r\nHad ancient times conspired to disallow\r\nWhat then was new, what had been ancient now?\r\nOr what remained, so worthy to be read\r\nBy learned critics, of the mighty dead?\r\nIn days of ease, when now the weary sword\r\nWas sheathed, and luxury with Charles restored;\r\nIn every taste of foreign courts improved,\r\n\"All, by the king's example, lived and loved.\"\r\nThen peers grew proud in horsemanship t' excel,\r\nNewmarket's glory rose, as Britain's fell;\r\nThe soldier breathed the gallantries of France,\r\nAnd every flowery courtier wrote romance.\r\nThen marble, softened into life, grew warm:\r\nAnd yielding metal flowed to human form:\r\nLely on animated canvas stole\r\nThe sleepy eye, that spoke the melting soul.\r\nNo wonder then, when all was love and sport,\r\nThe willing Muses were debauched at court:\r\nOn each enervate string they taught the note\r\nTo pant, or tremble through an eunuch's throat.\r\nBut Britain, changeful as a child at play,\r\nNow calls in princes, and now turns away.\r\nNow Whig, now Tory, what we loved we hate;\r\nNow all for pleasure, now for Church and State;\r\nNow for prerogative, and now for laws;\r\nEffects unhappy from a noble cause.\r\nTime was, a sober Englishman would knock\r\nHis servants up, and rise by five o'clock,\r\nInstruct his family in every rule,\r\nAnd send his wife to church, his son to school.\r\nTo worship like his fathers, was his care;\r\nTo teach their frugal virtues to his heir;\r\nTo prove, that luxury could never hold;\r\nAnd place, on good security, his gold.\r\nNow times are changed, and one poetic itch\r\nHas seized the court and city, poor and rich:\r\nSons, sires, and grandsires, all will wear the bays,\r\nOur wives read Milton, and our daughters plays,\r\nTo theatres, and to rehearsals throng,\r\nAnd all our grace at table is a song.\r\nI, who so oft renounce the Muses, lie,\r\nNot ----'s self e'er tells more fibs than I;\r\nWhen sick of Muse, our follies we deplore,\r\nAnd promise our best friends to rhyme no more;\r\nWe wake next morning in a raging fit,\r\nAnd call for pen and ink to show our wit.\r\nHe served a 'prenticeship, who sets up shop;\r\nWard tried on puppies, and the poor, his drop;\r\nEven Radcliff's doctors travel first to France,\r\nNor dare to practise till they've learned to dance.\r\nWho builds a bridge that never drove a pile?\r\n(Should Ripley venture, all the world would smile)\r\nBut those who cannot write, and those who can,\r\nAll rhyme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man.\r\nYet, sir, reflect, the mischief is not great;\r\nThese madmen never hurt the Church or State;\r\nSometimes the folly benefits mankind;\r\nAnd rarely av'rice taints the tuneful mind.\r\nAllow him but his plaything of a pen,\r\nHe ne'er rebels, or plots, like other men:\r\nFlight of cashiers, or mobs, he'll never mind;\r\nAnd knows no losses while the Muse is kind.\r\nTo cheat a friend, or ward, he leaves to Peter;\r\nThe good man heaps up nothing but mere metre,\r\nEnjoys his garden and his book in quiet;\r\nAnd then--a perfect hermit in his diet.\r\nOf little use the man you may suppose,\r\nWho says in verse what others say in prose;\r\nYet let me show, a poet's of some weight,\r\nAnd (though no soldier) useful to the State.\r\nWhat will a child learn sooner than a song?\r\nWhat better teach a foreigner the tongue?\r\nWhat's long or short, each accent where to place,\r\nAnd speak in public with some sort of grace?\r\nI scarce can think him such a worthless thing,\r\nUnless he praise some monster of a king;\r\nOr virtue, or religion turn to sport,\r\nTo please a lewd or unbelieving court.\r\nUnhappy Dryden!--In all Charles's days,\r\nRoscommon only boasts unspotted bays;\r\nAnd in our own (excuse some courtly stains)\r\nNo whiter page than Addison remains.\r\nHe, from the taste obscene reclaims our youth,\r\nAnd sets the passions on the side of truth,\r\nForms the soft bosom with the gentlest art,\r\nAnd pours each human virtue in the heart.\r\nLet Ireland tell, how wit upheld her cause,\r\nHer trade supported, and supplied her laws;\r\nAnd leave on Swift this grateful verse engraved:\r\n'The rights a court attacked, a poet saved.'\r\nBehold the hand that wrought a nation's cure,\r\nStretched to relieve the idiot and the poor,\r\nProud vice to brand, or injured worth adorn,\r\nAnd stretch the ray to ages yet unborn.\r\nNot but there are, who merit other palms;\r\nHopkins and Sternhold glad the heart with psalms:\r\nThe boys and girls whom charity maintains,\r\nImplore your help in these pathetic strains:\r\nHow could devotion touch the country pews,\r\nUnless the gods bestowed a proper Muse?\r\nVerse cheers their leisure, verse assists their work,\r\nVerse prays for peace, or sings down Pope and Turk.\r\nThe silenced preacher yields to potent strain,\r\nAnd feels that grace his prayer besought in vain;\r\nThe blessing thrills through all the lab'ring throng,\r\nAnd Heaven is won by violence of song.\r\nOur rural ancestors, with little blest,\r\nPatient of labour when the end was rest,\r\nIndulged the day that housed their annual grain,\r\nWith feasts, and off'rings, and a thankful strain:\r\nThe joy their wives, their sons, and servants share,\r\nEase of their toil, and partners of their care:\r\nThe laugh, the jest, attendants on the bowl,\r\nSmoothed every brow, and opened every soul:\r\nWith growing years the pleasing licence grew,\r\nAnd taunts alternate innocently flew.\r\nBut times corrupt, and Nature, ill-inclined,\r\nProduced the point that left a sting behind;\r\nTill friend with friend, and families at strife,\r\nTriumphant malice raged through private life.\r\nWho felt the wrong, or feared it, took th' alarm,\r\nAppealed to law, and justice lent her arm.\r\nAt length, by wholesome dread of statutes bound,\r\nThe poets learned to please, and not to wound:\r\nMost warped to flatt'ry's side; but some more nice,\r\nPreserved the freedom, and forebore the vice.\r\nHence satire rose, that just the medium hit,\r\nAnd heals with morals what it hurts with wit.\r\nWe    conquered France, but felt our captive's charms;\r\nHer arts victorious triumphed o'er our arms;\r\nBritain to soft refinements less a foe,\r\nWit grew polite, and numbers learned to flow.\r\nWaller was smooth; but Dryden taught to join  )\r\nThe varying verse, the full-resounding line,  )\r\nThe long majestic march, and energy divine.   )\r\nThough still some traces of our rustic vein\r\nAnd splay-foot verse, remained, and will remain.\r\nLate, very late, correctness grew our care,\r\nWhen the tired nation breathed from civil war.\r\nExact Racine, and Corneille's noble fire,\r\nShowed us that France had something to admire.\r\nNot but the tragic spirit was our own,\r\nAnd full in Shakespeare, fair in Otway shone:\r\nBut Otway failed to polish or refine,\r\nAnd fluent Shakespeare scarce effaced a line.\r\nE'en copious Dryden wanted, or forgot\r\nThe last and greatest art, the art to blot.\r\nSome doubt, if equal pains, or equal fire\r\nThe humbler Muse of comedy require.\r\nBut in known images of life, I guess\r\nThe labour greater, as th' indulgence less.\r\nObserve how seldom even the best succeed:\r\nTell me if Congreve's fools are fools indeed?\r\nWhat pert, low dialogue has Farquhar writ!\r\nHow Van wants grace, who never wanted wit!\r\nThe stage how loosely does Astraea tread,\r\nWho fairly puts all characters to bed!\r\nAnd idle Cibber, how he breaks the laws,\r\nTo make poor Pinky eat with vast applause!\r\nBut fill their purse, our poet's work is done,\r\nAlike to them, by pathos or by pun.\r\nO you! whom vanity's light bark conveys\r\nOn fame's mad voyage by the wind of praise,\r\nWith what a shifting gale your course you ply,\r\nFor ever sunk too low, or borne too high!\r\nWho pants for glory finds but short repose,\r\nA breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows.\r\nFarewell the stage! if just as thrives the play,\r\nThe silly bard grows fat, or falls away.\r\nThere still remains, to mortify a wit,\r\nThe many-headed monster of the pit;\r\nA senseless, worthless, and unhonoured crowd;\r\nWho, to disturb their betters mighty proud,\r\nClatt'ring their sticks before ten lines are spoke,\r\nCall for the farce, the bear, or the black-joke.\r\nWhat dear delight to Britons farce affords!\r\nEver the taste of mobs, but now of lords;\r\n(Taste, that eternal wanderer, which flies\r\nFrom heads to ears, and now from ears to eyes).\r\nThe play stands still; damn action and discourse,\r\nBack fly the scenes, and enter foot and horse;\r\nPageants on pageants, in long order drawn,\r\nPeers, Heralds, Bishops, ermine, gold, and lawn;\r\nThe champion too! and, to complete the jest,\r\nOld Edward's armour beams on    Cibber's breast,\r\nWith laughter sure Democritus had died,\r\nHad he beheld an audience gape so wide.\r\nLet bear or elephant be e'er so white,\r\nThe people, sure, the people are the sight!\r\nAh luckless poet! stretch thy lungs and roar,\r\nThat bear or elephant shall heed thee more;\r\nWhile all its throats the gallery extends,\r\nAnd all the thunder of the pit ascends!\r\nLoud as the wolves, on Orcas' stormy steep,\r\nHowl to the roarings of the Northern deep,\r\nSuch is the shout, the long-applauding note,\r\nAt Quin's high plume, or Oldfield's petticoat;\r\nOr when from court a birthday suit bestowed,\r\nSinks the lost actor in the tawdry load.\r\nBooth enters--hark! the universal peal!\r\n\"But has he spoken?\"  Not a syllable.\r\nWhat shook the stage, and made the people stare?\r\nCato's long wig, flowered gown, and lacquered chair.\r\nYet lest you think I rally more than teach,\r\nOr praise malignly arts I cannot reach,\r\nLet me for once presume t' instruct the times,\r\nTo know the poet from the man of rhymes:\r\n'Tis he, who gives my breast a thousand pains,\r\nCan make me feel each passion that he feigns;\r\nEnrage, compose, with more than magic art,\r\nWith pity, and with terror, tear my heart;\r\nAnd snatch me, o'er the earth, or through the air,\r\nTo Thebes, to Athens, when he will, and where.\r\nBut not this part of the poetic state\r\nAlone, deserves the favour of the great;\r\nThink of those authors, sir, who would rely\r\nMore on a reader's sense, than gazer's eye.\r\nOr who shall wander where the Muses sing?\r\nWho climb their mountain, or who taste their spring?\r\nHow shall we fill a library with wit,\r\nWhen Merlin's cave is half unfurnished yet?\r\nMy liege! why writers little claim your thought,\r\nI guess; and, with their leave, will tell the fault:\r\nWe poets are (upon a poet's word)\r\nOf all mankind, the creatures most absurd:\r\nThe season, when to come, and when to go,\r\nTo sing, or cease to sing, we never know;\r\nAnd if we will recite nine hours in ten,\r\nYou lose your patience, just like other men.\r\nThen too we hurt ourselves, when to defend\r\nA single verse, we quarrel with a friend;\r\nRepeat unasked; lament, the wit's too fine\r\nFor vulgar eyes, and point out every line.\r\nBut most, when straining with too weak a wing,\r\nWe needs will write epistles to the King;\r\nAnd from the moment we oblige the town,\r\nExpect a place, or pension from the Crown;\r\nOr dubbed historians, by express command,\r\nT' enrol your triumphs o'er the seas and land,\r\nBe called to Court to plan some work divine,\r\nAs once for Louis, Boileau and Racine.\r\nYet think, great sir! (so many virtues shown)\r\nAh think, what poet best may make them known?\r\nOr choose at least some minister of grace,\r\nFit to bestow the laureate's weighty place.\r\nCharles, to late times to be transmitted fair,\r\nAssigned his figure to Bernini's care;\r\nAnd great Nassau to Kneller's hand decreed\r\nTo fix him graceful on the bounding steed;\r\nSo well in paint and stone they judged of merit:\r\nBut kings in wit may want discerning spirit.\r\nThe hero William and the martyr Charles,\r\nOne knighted Blackmore, and one pensioned Quarles;\r\nWhich made old Ben, and surly Dennis swear,\r\n\"No Lord's anointed, but a Russian bear.\"\r\nNot with such majesty, such bold relief,\r\nThe forms august, of king, or conquering chief,\r\nE'er swelled on marble; as in verse have shined\r\n(In polished verse) the manners and the mind.\r\nOh! could I mount on the Maeonian wing,\r\nYour arms, your actions, your repose to sing!\r\nWhat seas you traversed, and what fields you fought!\r\nYour country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought!\r\nHow barb'rous rage subsided at your word,\r\nAnd nations wondered while they dropped the sword!\r\nHow, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep,\r\nPeace stole her wing, and wrapped the world in sleep;\r\nTill earth's extremes your mediation own,\r\nAnd Asia's tyrants tremble at your throne--\r\nBut verse, alas! your majesty disdains;\r\nAnd I'm not used to panegyric strains:"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The zeal of fools offends at any time,\r\nBut most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme.\r\nBesides, a fate attends on all I write,\r\nThat when I aim at praise, they say I bite.\r\nA vile encomium doubly ridicules:\r\nThere's nothing blackens like the ink of fools.\r\nIf true, a woeful likeness; and if lies,\r\n\"Praise undeserved is scandal in disguise:\"\r\nWell may he blush, who gives it, or receives;\r\nAnd when I flatter, let my dirty leaves\r\n(Like journals, odes, and such forgotten things\r\nAs Eusden, Philips, Settle, writ of kings)\r\nClothe spice, line trunks, or, flutt'ring in a row,\r\nBefringe the rails of Bedlam and Soho."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"THE SECOND EPISTLE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF HORACE."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"Ludentis speciem dabit, et torquebitur."
