When the boy reached the second mill, and saw a second beardless man sitting there, he did not stop, and walked on till he came to a third mill.

Every morning when I got up I counted them over, and it was quite easy to number the bees, but I never could reckon the hives properly.  One day, as I was counting the bees, I discovered that my best bee was missing, and without losing a moment I saddled a cock and went out to look for him.  I traced him as far as the shore, and knew that he had crossed the sea, and that I must follow.  When I had reached the other side I found a man had harnessed my bee to a plough, and with his help was sowing millet seed."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'\' "That is my bee!" I shouted.  "Where did you get him from?" \' "Brother," replied the man, "if he is yours, take him."  And he not only gave me back my bee, but a sack of millet seed into the bargain, because he had made use of my bee.  Then I put the bag on my shoulders, took the saddle from the cock, and placed it on the back of the bee, which I mounted, leading the cock by a string, so that he should have a rest.  As we were flying home over the sea one of the strings that held the bag of millet broke in two, and the sack dropped straight into the ocean.  It was quite lost, of course, and there was no use thinking about it, and by the time we were safe back again night had come.  I then got down from my bee, and let him loose, that he might get his supper, gave the cock some hay, and went to sleep myself.  But when I awoke with the sun what a scene met my eyes!  During the night wolves had come and had eaten my bee.  And honey lay ankle-deep in the valley and knee-deep on the hills.  Then I began to consider how I could best collect some, to take home with me.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"'Now it happened that I had with me a small hatchet, and this I took to the wood, hoping to meet some animal which I could kill, whose skin I might turn into a bag.  As I entered the forest I saw two roe-deer hopping on one foot, so I slew them with a single blow, and made three bags from their skins, all of which I filled with honey and placed on the back of the cock.  At length I reached home, where I was told that my father had just been born, and that I must go at once to fetch some holy water to sprinkle him with.  As I went I turned over in my mind if there was no way for me to get back my millet seed, which had dropped into the sea, and when I arrived at the place with the holy water I saw the seed had fallen on fruitful soil, and was growing before my eyes.  And more than that, it was even cut by an invisible hand, and made into a cake."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"'So I took the cake as well as the holy water, and was flying back with them over the sea, when there fell a great rain, and the sea was swollen, and swept away my millet cake.

If I stood it touched the ground, although if I was sitting it only reached my ears.  I seized a knife and cut off a large lock, which I plaited together, and when night came tied it into a knot, and prepared to use it for a pillow.  But what was I to do for a fire?  A tinder box I had, but no wood.  Then it occurred to me that I had stuck a needle in my clothes, so I took the needle and split it in pieces, and lit it, then laid myself down by the fire and went to sleep.  But ill-luck still pursued me.  While I was sleeping a spark from the fire lighted on the hair, which was burnt up in a moment.  In despair I threw myself on the ground, and instantly sank in it as far as my waist.  I struggled to get out, but only fell in further; so I ran to the house, seized a spade, dug myself out, and took home the holy water.  On the way I noticed that the ripe fields were full of reapers, and suddenly the air became so frightfully hot that the men dropped down in a faint.  Then I called to them, "Why don\'t you bring out our mare, which is as tall as two days, and as broad as half a day, and make a shade for yourselves?" My father heard what I said and jumped quickly on the mare, and the reapers worked with a will in the shadow, while I snatched up a wooden pail to bring them some water to drink.  When I got to the well everything was frozen hard, so in order to draw some water I had to take off my head and break the ice with it.  As I drew near them, carrying the water, the reapers all cried out, "Why, what has become of your head?" I put up my hand and discovered that I really had no head, and that I must have left it in the well.  I ran back to look for it, but found that meanwhile a fox which was passing by had pulled my head out of the water, and was tearing at my brains.  I stole cautiously up to him, and gave him such a kick that he uttered a loud scream, and let fall a parchment on which was written, "The cake is mine, and the beardless one goes empty-handed." \''}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"With these words the boy rose, took the cake, and went home, while the beardless one remained behind to swallow his disappointment."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[Volksmarchen der Serben.]"})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,h.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>i});var n=a(96540);const o={},h=n.createContext(o);function s(e){const t=n.useContext(h);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:s(e.components),n.createElement(h.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
