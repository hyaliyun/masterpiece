It may fairly claim to be the oldest treatise on logic; for that science originates in the misunderstandings which necessarily accompany the first efforts of speculation.  Several of the fallacies which are satirized in it reappear in the Sophistici Elenchi of Aristotle and are retained at the end of our manuals of logic.  But if the order of history were followed, they should be placed not at the end but at the beginning of them; for they belong to the age in which the human mind was first making the attempt to distinguish thought from sense, and to separate the universal from the particular or individual.  How to put together words or ideas, how to escape ambiguities in the meaning of terms or in the structure of propositions, how to resist the fixed impression of an 'eternal being' or 'perpetual flux,' how to distinguish between words and things--these were problems not easy of solution in the infancy of philosophy.  They presented the same kind of difficulty to the half- educated man which spelling or arithmetic do to the mind of a child.  It was long before the new world of ideas which had been sought after with such passionate yearning was set in order and made ready for use.  To us the fallacies which arise in the pre-Socratic philosophy are trivial and obsolete because we are no longer liable to fall into the errors which are expressed by them.  The intellectual world has become better assured to us, and we are less likely to be imposed upon by illusions of words."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The logic of Aristotle is for the most part latent in the dialogues of Plato.

Here we have most of the important elements of logic, not yet systematized or reduced to an art or science, but scattered up and down as they would naturally occur in ordinary discourse.  They are of little or no use or significance to us; but because we have grown out of the need of them we should not therefore despise them.  They are still interesting and instructive for the light which they shed on the history of the human mind."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There are indeed many old fallacies which linger among us, and new ones are constantly springing up.  But they are not of the kind to which ancient logic can be usefully applied.  The weapons of common sense, not the analytics of Aristotle, are needed for their overthrow.  Nor is the use of the Aristotelian logic any longer natural to us.  We no longer put arguments into the form of syllogisms like the schoolmen; the simple use of language has been, happily, restored to us.  Neither do we discuss the nature of the proposition, nor extract hidden truths from the copula, nor dispute any longer about nominalism and realism.  We do not confuse the form with the matter of knowledge, or invent laws of thought, or imagine that any single science furnishes a principle of reasoning to all the rest.  Neither do we require categories or heads of argument to be invented for our use.  Those who have no knowledge of logic, like some of our great physical philosophers, seem to be quite as good reasoners as those who have.  Most of the ancient puzzles have been settled on the basis of usage and common sense; there is no need to reopen them.  No science should raise problems or invent forms of thought which add nothing to knowledge and are of no use in assisting the acquisition of it.  This seems to be the natural limit of logic and metaphysics; if they give us a more comprehensive or a more definite view of the different spheres of knowledge they are to be studied; if not, not.  The better part of ancient logic appears hardly in our own day to have a separate existence; it is absorbed in two other sciences:  (1) rhetoric, if indeed this ancient art be not also fading away into literary criticism; (2) the science of language, under which all questions relating to words and propositions and the combinations of them may properly be included."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To continue dead or imaginary sciences, which make no signs of progress and have no definite sphere, tends to interfere with the prosecution of living ones.  The study of them is apt to blind the judgment and to render men incapable of seeing the value of evidence, and even of appreciating the nature of truth.  Nor should we allow the living science to become confused with the dead by an ambiguity of language.  The term logic has two different meanings, an ancient and a modern one, and we vainly try to bridge the gulf between them.  Many perplexities are avoided by keeping them apart.  There might certainly be a new science of logic; it would not however be built up out of the fragments of the old, but would be distinct from them--relative to the state of knowledge which exists at the present time, and based chiefly on the methods of Modern Inductive philosophy.  Such a science might have two legitimate fields:  first, the refutation and explanation of false philosophies still hovering in the air as they appear from the point of view of later experience or are comprehended in the history of the human mind, as in a larger horizon:  secondly, it might furnish new forms of thought more adequate to the expression of all the diversities and oppositions of knowledge which have grown up in these latter days; it might also suggest new methods of enquiry derived from the comparison of the sciences.  Few will deny that the introduction of the words 'subject' and 'object' and the Hegelian reconciliation of opposites have been 'most gracious aids' to psychology, or that the methods of Bacon and Mill have shed a light far and wide on the realms of knowledge.  These two great studies, the one destructive and corrective of error, the other conservative and constructive of truth, might be a first and second part of logic.  Ancient logic would be the propaedeutic or gate of approach to logical science,--nothing more.  But to pursue such speculations further, though not irrelevant, might lead us too far away from the argument of the dialogue."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Euthydemus is, of all the Dialogues of Plato, that in which he approaches most nearly to the comic poet.

Even Thrasymachus, in the Republic, is at last pacified, and becomes a friendly and interested auditor of the great discourse.

They are natives of Chios, who had settled at Thurii, but were driven out, and in former days had been known at Athens as professors of rhetoric and of the art of fighting in armour.  To this they have now added a new accomplishment--the art of Eristic, or fighting with words, which they are likewise willing to teach 'for a consideration.'  But they can also teach virtue in a very short time and in the very best manner.  Socrates, who is always on the look-out for teachers of virtue, is interested in the youth Cleinias, the grandson of the great Alcibiades, and is desirous that he should have the benefit of their instructions.  He is ready to fall down and worship them; although the greatness of their professions does arouse in his mind a temporary incredulity."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A circle gathers round them, in the midst of which are Socrates, the two brothers, the youth Cleinias, who is watched by the eager eyes of his lover Ctesippus, and others.  The performance begins; and such a performance as might well seem to require an invocation of Memory and the Muses.  It is agreed that the brothers shall question Cleinias.  'Cleinias,' says Euthydemus, 'who learn, the wise or the unwise?'  'The wise,' is the reply; given with blushing and hesitation.  'And yet when you learned you did not know and were not wise.'  Then Dionysodorus takes up the ball:  'Who are they who learn dictation of the grammar-master; the wise or the foolish boys?'  'The wise.'  'Then, after all, the wise learn.'  'And do they learn,' said Euthydemus, 'what they know or what they do not know?'  'The latter.'  'And dictation is a dictation of letters?'  'Yes.'  'And you know letters?'  'Yes.'  'Then you learn what you know.'  'But,' retorts Dionysodorus, 'is not learning acquiring knowledge?'  'Yes.'  'And you acquire that which you have not got already?'  'Yes.'

He therefore explains to him the nature of the process to which he is being subjected.  The two strangers are not serious; there are jests at the mysteries which precede the enthronement, and he is being initiated into the mysteries of the sophistical ritual.  This is all a sort of horse-play, which is now ended.  The exhortation to virtue will follow, and Socrates himself (if the wise men will not laugh at him) is desirous of showing the way in which such an exhortation should be carried on, according to his own poor notion.  He proceeds to question Cleinias.  The result of the investigation may be summed up as follows:--"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"All men desire good; and good means the possession of goods, such as wealth, health, beauty, birth, power, honour; not forgetting the virtues and wisdom.

But what need is there of good fortune when we have wisdom already:--in every art and business are not the wise also the fortunate?  This is admitted.  And again, the possession of goods is not enough; there must also be a right use of them which can only be given by knowledge:  in themselves they are neither good nor evil-- knowledge and wisdom are the only good, and ignorance and folly the only evil.  The conclusion is that we must get 'wisdom.'  But can wisdom be taught?  'Yes,' says Cleinias.  The ingenuousness of the youth delights Socrates, who is at once relieved from the necessity of discussing one of his great puzzles.  'Since wisdom is the only good, he must become a philosopher, or lover of wisdom.'  'That I will,' says Cleinias."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After Socrates has given this specimen of his own mode of instruction, the two brothers recommence their exhortation to virtue, which is of quite another sort."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"'You want Cleinias to be wise?'

Pretty lovers and friends you must all be!'"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Here Ctesippus, the lover of Cleinias, interposes in great excitement, thinking that he will teach the two Sophists a lesson of good manners.  But he is quickly entangled in the meshes of their sophistry; and as a storm seems to be gathering Socrates pacifies him with a joke, and Ctesippus then says that he is not reviling the two Sophists, he is only contradicting them.  'But,' says Dionysodorus, 'there is no such thing as contradiction. When you and I describe the same thing, or you describe one thing and I describe another, how can there be a contradiction?'  Ctesippus is unable to reply."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Socrates has already heard of the denial of contradiction, and would like to be informed by the great master of the art, 'What is the meaning of this paradox?  Is there no such thing as error, ignorance, falsehood?  Then what are they professing to teach?'  The two Sophists complain that Socrates is ready to answer what they said a year ago, but is 'non-plussed' at what they are saying now.  'What does the word \"non-plussed\" mean?'  Socrates is informed, in reply, that words are lifeless things, and lifeless things have no sense or meaning.  Ctesippus again breaks out, and again has to be pacified by Socrates, who renews the conversation with Cleinias.  The two Sophists are like Proteus in the variety of their transformations, and he, like Menelaus in the Odyssey, hopes to restore them to their natural form."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"He had arrived at the conclusion that Cleinias must become a philosopher.  And philosophy is the possession of knowledge; and knowledge must be of a kind which is profitable and may be used.  What knowledge is there which has such a nature?  Not the knowledge which is required in any particular art; nor again the art of the composer of speeches, who knows how to write them, but cannot speak them, although he too must be admitted to be a kind of enchanter of wild animals.  Neither is the knowledge which we are seeking the knowledge of the general.  For the general makes over his prey to the statesman, as the huntsman does to the cook, or the taker of quails to the keeper of quails; he has not the use of that which he acquires.  The two enquirers, Cleinias and Socrates, are described as wandering about in a wilderness, vainly searching after the art of life and happiness.  At last they fix upon the kingly art, as having the desired sort of knowledge.  But the kingly art only gives men those goods which are neither good nor evil:  and if we say further that it makes us wise, in what does it make us wise? Not in special arts, such as cobbling or carpentering, but only in itself:  or say again that it makes us good, there is no answer to the question, 'good in what?'

'Do they know shoemaking, etc?'  'Yes.'  The sceptical Ctesippus would like to have some evidence of this extraordinary statement:  he will believe if Euthydemus will tell him how many teeth Dionysodorus has, and if Dionysodorus will give him a like piece of information about Euthydemus.  Even Socrates is incredulous, and indulges in a little raillery at the expense of the brothers.  But he restrains himself, remembering that if the men who are to be his teachers think him stupid they will take no pains with him.  Another fallacy is produced which turns on the absoluteness of the verb 'to know.'  And here Dionysodorus is caught 'napping,' and is induced by Socrates to confess that 'he does not know the good to be unjust.'  Socrates appeals to his brother Euthydemus; at the same time he acknowledges that he cannot, like Heracles, fight against a Hydra, and even Heracles, on the approach of a second monster, called upon his nephew Iolaus to help.  Dionysodorus rejoins that Iolaus was no more the nephew of Heracles than of Socrates.  For a nephew is a nephew, and a brother is a brother, and a father is a father, not of one man only, but of all; nor of men only, but of dogs and sea-monsters.  Ctesippus makes merry with the consequences which follow:  'Much good has your father got out of the wisdom of his puppies.'"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"'But,' says Euthydemus, unabashed, 'nobody wants much good.'  Medicine is a good, arms are a good, money is a good, and yet there may be too much of them in wrong places.  'No,' says Ctesippus, 'there cannot be too much gold.'  And would you be happy if you had three talents of gold in your belly, a talent in your pate, and a stater in either eye?'  Ctesippus, imitating the new wisdom, replies, 'And do not the Scythians reckon those to be the happiest of men who have their skulls gilded and see the inside of them?'  'Do you see,' retorts Euthydemus, 'what has the quality of vision or what has not the quality of vision?'  'What has the quality of vision.'  'And you see our garments?'  'Yes.'

After a few more amphiboliae, in which Socrates, like Ctesippus, in self-defence borrows the weapons of the brothers, they both confess that the two heroes are invincible; and the scene concludes with a grand chorus of shouting and laughing, and a panegyrical oration from Socrates:--"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"First, he praises the indifference of Dionysodorus and Euthydemus to public opinion; for most persons would rather be refuted by such arguments than use them in the refutation of others.

Thirdly, he notes their liberality, which makes them give away their secret to all the world:  they should be more reserved, and let no one be present at this exhibition who does not pay them a handsome fee; or better still they might practise on one another only.

They are a class who are very likely to get mauled by Euthydemus and his friends, and have a great notion of their own wisdom; for they imagine themselves to have all the advantages and none of the drawbacks both of politics and of philosophy.

They subsist only as forms which have rooted themselves in language--as troublesome elements of thought which cannot be either used or explained away.  The same absoluteness which was once attributed to abstractions is now attached to the words which are the signs of them.

The fallacies which are noted by him appear trifling to us now, but they were not trifling in the age before logic, in the decline of the earlier Greek philosophies, at a time when language was first beginning to perplex human thought.  Besides he is caricaturing them; they probably received more subtle forms at the hands of those who seriously maintained them.  They are patent to us in Plato, and we are inclined to wonder how any one could ever have been deceived by them; but we must remember also that there was a time when the human mind was only with great difficulty disentangled from such fallacies."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To appreciate fully the drift of the Euthydemus, we should imagine a mental state in which not individuals only, but whole schools during more than one generation, were animated by the desire to exclude the conception of rest, and therefore the very word 'this' (Theaet.) from language; in which the ideas of space, time, matter, motion, were proved to be contradictory and imaginary; in which the nature of qualitative change was a puzzle, and even differences of degree, when applied to abstract notions, were not understood; in which there was no analysis of grammar, and mere puns or plays of words received serious attention; in which contradiction itself was denied, and, on the one hand, every predicate was affirmed to be true of every subject, and on the other, it was held that no predicate was true of any subject, and that nothing was, or was known, or could be spoken.  Let us imagine disputes carried on with religious earnestness and more than scholastic subtlety, in which the catchwords of philosophy are completely detached from their context.  (Compare Theaet.)  To such disputes the humour, whether of Plato in the ancient, or of Pope and Swift in the modern world, is the natural enemy.  Nor must we forget that in modern times also there is no fallacy so gross, no trick of language so transparent, no abstraction so barren and unmeaning, no form of thought so contradictory to experience, which has not been found to satisfy the minds of philosophical enquirers at a certain stage, or when regarded from a certain point of view only.  The peculiarity of the fallacies of our own age is that we live within them, and are therefore generally unconscious of them."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Aristotle has analysed several of the same fallacies in his book 'De Sophisticis Elenchis,' which Plato, with equal command of their true nature, has preferred to bring to the test of ridicule.  At first we are only struck with the broad humour of this 'reductio ad absurdum:' gradually we perceive that some important questions begin to emerge.  Here, as everywhere else, Plato is making war against the philosophers who put words in the place of things, who tear arguments to tatters, who deny predication, and thus make knowledge impossible, to whom ideas and objects of sense have no fixedness, but are in a state of perpetual oscillation and transition.  Two great truths seem to be indirectly taught through these fallacies:  (1) The uncertainty of language, which allows the same words to be used in different meanings, or with different degrees of meaning:  (2) The necessary limitation or relative nature of all phenomena.  Plato is aware that his own doctrine of ideas, as well as the Eleatic Being and Not- being, alike admit of being regarded as verbal fallacies.  The sophism advanced in the Meno, 'that you cannot enquire either into what you know or do not know,' is lightly touched upon at the commencement of the Dialogue; the thesis of Protagoras, that everything is true to him to whom it seems to be true, is satirized.  In contrast with these fallacies is maintained the Socratic doctrine that happiness is gained by knowledge.  The grammatical puzzles with which the Dialogue concludes probably contain allusions to tricks of language which may have been practised by the disciples of Prodicus or Antisthenes.  They would have had more point, if we were acquainted with the writings against which Plato's humour is directed.  Most of the jests appear to have a serious meaning; but we have lost the clue to some of them, and cannot determine whether, as in the Cratylus, Plato has or has not mixed up purely unmeaning fun with his satire."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The two discourses of Socrates may be contrasted in several respects with the exhibition of the Sophists:  (1) In their perfect relevancy to the subject of discussion, whereas the Sophistical discourses are wholly irrelevant:  (2) In their enquiring sympathetic tone, which encourages the youth, instead of 'knocking him down,' after the manner of the two Sophists:  (3) In the absence of any definite conclusion--for while Socrates and the youth are agreed that philosophy is to be studied, they are not able to arrive at any certain result about the art which is to teach it.  This is a question which will hereafter be answered in the Republic; as the conception of the kingly art is more fully developed in the Politicus, and the caricature of rhetoric in the Gorgias."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The characters of the Dialogue are easily intelligible.  There is Socrates once more in the character of an old man; and his equal in years, Crito, the father of Critobulus, like Lysimachus in the Laches, his fellow demesman (Apol.), to whom the scene is narrated, and who once or twice interrupts with a remark after the manner of the interlocutor in the Phaedo, and adds his commentary at the end; Socrates makes a playful allusion to his money-getting habits.  There is the youth Cleinias, the grandson of Alcibiades, who may be compared with Lysis, Charmides, Menexenus, and other ingenuous youths out of whose mouths Socrates draws his own lessons, and to whom he always seems to stand in a kindly and sympathetic relation.  Crito will not believe that Socrates has not improved or perhaps invented the answers of Cleinias (compare Phaedrus).  The name of the grandson of Alcibiades, who is described as long dead, (Greek), and who died at the age of forty-four, in the year 404 B.C., suggests not only that the intended scene of the Euthydemus could not have been earlier than 404, but that as a fact this Dialogue could not have been composed before 390 at the soonest.  Ctesippus, who is the lover of Cleinias, has been already introduced to us in the Lysis, and seems there too to deserve the character which is here given him, of a somewhat uproarious young man.  But the chief study of all is the picture of the two brothers, who are unapproachable in their effrontery, equally careless of what they say to others and of what is said to them, and never at a loss.

At the same time he takes the opportunity of assailing another class of persons who are as alien from the spirit of philosophy as Euthydemus and Dionysodorus.  The Eclectic, the Syncretist, the Doctrinaire, have been apt to have a bad name both in ancient and modern times.  The persons whom Plato ridicules in the epilogue to the Euthydemus are of this class.  They occupy a border-ground between philosophy and politics; they keep out of the dangers of politics, and at the same time use philosophy as a means of serving their own interests.  Plato quaintly describes them as making two good things, philosophy and politics, a little worse by perverting the objects of both.  Men like Antiphon or Lysias would be types of the class.  Out of a regard to the respectabilities of life, they are disposed to censure the interest which Socrates takes in the exhibition of the two brothers.

I never knew what the true pancratiast was before; they are simply made up of fighting, not like the two Acarnanian brothers who fight with their bodies only, but this pair of heroes, besides being perfect in the use of their bodies, are invincible in every sort of warfare; for they are capital at fighting in armour, and will teach the art to any one who pays them; and also they are most skilful in legal warfare; they will plead themselves and teach others to speak and to compose speeches which will have an effect upon the courts.  And this was only the beginning of their wisdom, but they have at last carried out the pancratiastic art to the very end, and have mastered the only mode of fighting which had been hitherto neglected by them; and now no one dares even to stand up against them:  such is their skill in the war of words, that they can refute any proposition whether true or false.

Cleinias saw me from the entrance as I was sitting alone, and at once came and sat down on the right hand of me, as you describe; and Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, when they saw him, at first stopped and talked with one another, now and then glancing at us, for I particularly watched them; and then Euthydemus came and sat down by the youth, and the other by me on the left hand; the rest anywhere.  I saluted the brothers, whom I had not seen for a long time; and then I said to Cleinias:  Here are two wise men, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, Cleinias, wise not in a small but in a large way of wisdom, for they know all about war,--all that a good general ought to know about the array and command of an army, and the whole art of fighting in armour:  and they know about law too, and can teach a man how to use the weapons of the courts when he is injured."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"They heard me say this, but only despised me.

But now if you really have the other knowledge, O forgive me:  I address you as I would superior beings, and ask you to pardon the impiety of my former expressions.

I shall be the first; and there is the youth Cleinias, and Ctesippus:  and here are several others, I said, pointing to the lovers of Cleinias, who were beginning to gather round us.  Now Ctesippus was sitting at some distance from Cleinias; and when Euthydemus leaned forward in talking with me, he was prevented from seeing Cleinias, who was between us; and so, partly because he wanted to look at his love, and also because he was interested, he jumped up and stood opposite to us:  and all the other admirers of Cleinias, as well as the disciples of Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, followed his example.  And these were the persons whom I showed to Euthydemus, telling him that they were all eager to learn:  to which Ctesippus and all of them with one voice vehemently assented, and bid him exhibit the power of his wisdom.  Then I said:  O Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, I earnestly request you to do myself and the company the favour to exhibit.  There may be some trouble in giving the whole exhibition; but tell me one thing,--can you make a good man of him only who is already convinced that he ought to learn of you, or of him also who is not convinced, either because he imagines that virtue is a thing which cannot be taught at all, or that you are not the teachers of it?

His name is Cleinias, and he is the son of Axiochus, and grandson of the old Alcibiades, cousin of the Alcibiades that now is.  He is quite young, and we are naturally afraid that some one may get the start of us, and turn his mind in a wrong direction, and he may be ruined.

The two foreign gentlemen, perceiving that you did not know, wanted to explain to you that the word 'to learn' has two meanings, and is used, first, in the sense of acquiring knowledge of some matter of which you previously have no knowledge, and also, when you have the knowledge, in the sense of reviewing this matter, whether something done or spoken by the light of this newly-acquired knowledge; the latter is generally called 'knowing' rather than 'learning,' but the word 'learning' is also used; and you did not see, as they explained to you, that the term is employed of two opposite sorts of men, of those who know, and of those who do not know.  There was a similar trick in the second question, when they asked you whether men learn what they know or what they do not know.  These parts of learning are not serious, and therefore I say that the gentlemen are not serious, but are only playing with you.  For if a man had all that sort of knowledge that ever was, he would not be at all the wiser; he would only be able to play with men, tripping them up and oversetting them with distinctions of words.  He would be like a person who pulls away a stool from some one when he is about to sit down, and then laughs and makes merry at the sight of his friend overturned and laid on his back.  And you must regard all that has hitherto passed between you and them as merely play.  But in what is to follow I am certain that they will exhibit to you their serious purpose, and keep their promise (I will show them how); for they promised to give me a sample of the hortatory philosophy, but I suppose that they wanted to have a game with you first.  And now, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, I think that we have had enough of this.  Will you let me see you explaining to the young man how he is to apply himself to the study of virtue and wisdom?  And I will first show you what I conceive to be the nature of the task, and what sort of a discourse I desire to hear; and if I do this in a very inartistic and ridiculous manner, do not laugh at me, for I only venture to improvise before you because I am eager to hear your wisdom:  and I must therefore ask you and your disciples to refrain from laughing.  And now, O son of Axiochus, let me put a question to you:  Do not all men desire happiness?  And yet, perhaps, this is one of those ridiculous questions which I am afraid to ask, and which ought not to be asked by a sensible man:  for what human being is there who does not desire happiness?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There is no one, said Cleinias, who does not."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Well, then, I said, since we all of us desire happiness, how can we be happy?--that is the next question.

Now, if philosophy and political action are both good, but tend to different ends, and they participate in both, and are in a mean between them, then they are talking nonsense, for they are worse than either; or, if the one be good and the other evil, they are better than the one and worse than the other; only on the supposition that they are both evil could there be any truth in what they say.  I do not think that they will admit that their two pursuits are either wholly or partly evil; but the truth is, that these philosopher- politicians who aim at both fall short of both in the attainment of their respective ends, and are really third, although they would like to stand first.  There is no need, however, to be angry at this ambition of theirs-- which may be forgiven; for every man ought to be loved who says and manfully pursues and works out anything which is at all like wisdom:  at the same time we shall do well to see them as they really are."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CRITO:  I have often told you, Socrates, that I am in a constant difficulty about my two sons.

I cannot help thinking, when I hear you talk, that there is a sort of madness in many of our anxieties about our children:--in the first place, about marrying a wife of good family to be the mother of them, and then about heaping up money for them-- and yet taking no care about their education.
