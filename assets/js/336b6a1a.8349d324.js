While, as regards\\r any historical accuracy in dress, Lord Lytton, in an article in the\\r NINETEENTH CENTURY, has laid it down as a dogma of art that\\r archaeology is entirely out of place in the presentation of any of\\r Shakespeare\'s plays, and the attempt to introduce it one of the\\r stupidest pedantries of an age of prigs.\\r \\r Lord Lytton\'s position I shall examine later on; but, as regards\\r the theory that Shakespeare did not busy himself much about the\\r costume-wardrobe of his theatre, anybody who cares to study\\r Shakespeare\'s method will see that there is absolutely no dramatist\\r of the French, English, or Athenian stage who relies so much for\\r his illusionist effects on the dress of his actors as Shakespeare\\r does himself.\\r \\r Knowing how the artistic temperament is always fascinated by beauty\\r of costume, he constantly introduces into his plays masques and\\r dances, purely for the sake of the pleasure which they give the\\r eye; and we have still his stage-directions for the three great\\r processions in HENRY THE EIGHTH, directions which are characterised\\r by the most extraordinary elaborateness of detail down to the\\r collars of S.S. and the pearls in Anne Boleyn\'s hair.  Indeed it\\r would be quite easy for a modern manager to reproduce these\\r pageants absolutely as Shakespeare had them designed; and so\\r accurate were they that one of the court officials of the time,\\r writing an account of the last performance of the play at the Globe\\r Theatre to a friend, actually complains of their realistic\\r character, notably of the production on the stage of the Knights of\\r the Garter in the robes and insignia of the order as being\\r calculated to bring ridicule on the real ceremonies; much in the\\r same spirit in which the French Government, some time ago,\\r prohibited that delightful actor, M. Christian, from appearing in\\r uniform, on the plea that it was prejudicial to the glory of the\\r army that a colonel should be caricatured.  And elsewhere the\\r gorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the English stage under\\r Shakespeare\'s influence was attacked by the contemporary critics,\\r not as a rule, however, on the grounds of the democratic tendencies\\r of realism, but usually on those moral grounds which are always the\\r last refuge of people who have no sense of beauty.\\r \\r The point, however, which I wish to emphasise is, not that\\r Shakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in adding\\r picturesqueness to poetry, but that he saw how important costume is\\r as a means of producing certain dramatic effects.  Many of his\\r plays, such as MEASURE FOR MEASURE, TWELFTH NIGHT, THE TWO\\r GENTLEMAN OF VERONA, ALL\'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, CYMBELINE, and\\r others, depend for their illusion on the character of the various\\r dresses worn by the hero or the heroine; the delightful scene in\\r HENRY THE SIXTH, on the modern miracles of healing by faith, loses\\r all its point unless Gloster is in black and scarlet; and the\\r DENOUMENT of the MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR hinges on the colour of\\r Anne Page\'s gown.  As for the uses Shakespeare makes of disguises\\r the instances are almost numberless.  Posthumus hides his passion\\r under a peasant\'s garb, and Edgar his pride beneath an idiot\'s\\r rags; Portia wears the apparel of a lawyer, and Rosalind is attired\\r in \'all points as a man\'; the cloak-bag of Pisanio changes Imogen\\r to the Youth Fidele; Jessica flees from her father\'s house in boy\'s\\r dress, and Julia ties up her yellow hair in fantastic love-knots,\\r and dons hose and doublet; Henry the Eighth woos his lady as a\\r shepherd, and Romeo his as a pilgrim; Prince Hal and Poins appear\\r first as footpads in buckram suits, and then in white aprons and\\r leather jerkins as the waiters in a tavern-\\r \\r \\r I remember\\r The first time ever Caesar put it on.\\r \'Twas on a summer\'s evening, in his tent,\\r The day he overcame the Nervii\\r See what a rent the envious Casca made-\\r \\r \\r Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,\\r Which in the day of battle tire thee more\\r Than all the complete armour that thou wear\'st.\\r \\r \\r As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, it\\r is to be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the\\r smallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historical\\r plays, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many\\r effective open-air incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who\\r had at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who\\r could rely on the actors taking pains about their make-up.  Even\\r now it is difficult to produce such a play as the COMEDY OF ERRORS;\\r and to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry\'s brother\\r resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing TWELFTH NIGHT\\r adequately performed.  Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare\'s on\\r the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires\\r the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a\\r costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a\\r master of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-\\r master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production.\\r For he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each\\r character.  \'Racine abhorre la realite,\' says Auguste Vacquerie\\r somewhere; \'il ne daigne pas s\'occuper de son costume.  Si l\'on\\r s\'en rapportait aux indications du poete, Agamemnon serait vetu\\r d\'un sceptre et Achille d\'une epee.\'  But with Shakespeare it is\\r very different.  He gives us directions about the costumes of\\r Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in MACBETH, and the\\r apothecary in ROMEO AND JULIET, several elaborate descriptions of\\r his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in\\r which Petruchio is to be married.  Rosalind, he tells us, is tall,\\r and is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and\\r is to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt.  The children\\r who play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white\\r and green - a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose\\r favourite colours they were - and in white, with green garlands and\\r gilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton.\\r Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by his\\r wearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his boots.  The\\r Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in\\r mourning beside her.  The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of the\\r Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are\\r all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue.  We know the\\r patterns on the Dauphin\'s armour and the Pucelle\'s sword, the crest\\r on Warwick\'s helmet and the colour of Bardolph\'s nose.  Portia has\\r golden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls,\\r and Sir Andrew Aguecheek\'s hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and\\r won\'t curl at all.  Some of the characters are stout, some lean,\\r some straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are\\r to blacken their faces.  Lear has a white beard, Hamlet\'s father a\\r grizzled, and Benedick is to shave his in the course of the play.\\r Indeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quite\\r elaborate; tells us of the many different colours in use, and gives\\r a hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on.\\r There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics in\\r hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians,\\r and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in an\\r ass\'s head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the\\r Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated\\r husband and his wife\'s milliner about the slashing of a sleeve.\\r \\r As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the\\r aphorisms he makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age,\\r particularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies\' bonnets, and the\\r many descriptions of the MUNDUS MULIEBRIS, from the long of\\r Autolycus in the WINTER\'S TALE down to the account of the Duchess\\r of Milan\'s gown in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, they are far too\\r numerous to quote; though it may be worth while to remind people\\r that the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to be found in\\r Lear\'s scene with Edgar - a passage which has the advantage of\\r brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing\\r metaphysics of SARTOR RESARTUS.  But I think that from what I have\\r already said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much\\r interested in costume.  I do not mean in that shallow sense by\\r which it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds and\\r daffodils that he was the Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan\\r age; but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressive\\r of a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain types\\r of character, and is one of the essential factors of the means\\r which a true illusionist has at his disposal.  Indeed to him the\\r deformed figure of Richard was of as much value as Juliet\'s\\r loveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks of\\r the lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each  and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one of\\r his plays, expresses his regret at being unable to produce helmets\\r of the period, he is speaking as an Elizabethan manager and not\\r merely as an Elizabethan poet.  At Cambridge, for instance, during\\r his day, a play of RICHARD THE THIRD was performed, in which the\\r actors were attired in real dresses of the time, procured from the\\r great collection of historical costume in the Tower, which was\\r always open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes placed at\\r their disposal.  And I cannot help thinking that this performance\\r must have been far more artistic, as regards costume, than\\r Garrick\'s mounting of Shakespeare\'s own play on the subject, in\\r which he himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, and\\r everybody else in the costume of the time of George the Third,\\r Richmond especially being much admired in the uniform of a young\\r guardsman.\\r \\r For what is the use to the stage of that archaeology which has so\\r strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can\\r give us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which\\r the action of the play passes?  It enables us to see a Greek\\r dressed like a Greek, and an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the\\r arcades of Venice and the balconies of Verona; and, if the play\\r deals with any of the great eras in our country\'s history, to\\r contemplate the age in its proper attire, and the king in his habit\\r as he lived.  And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would have\\r said some time ago, at the Princess\'s Theatre, had the curtain\\r risen on his father\'s Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair,\\r attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume\\r which in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to\\r an antique Roman!  For in those halcyon days of the drama no\\r archaeology troubled the stage, or distressed the critics, and our\\r inartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of\\r anachronisms, and beheld with the calm complacency of the age of\\r prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a Lear in lace ruffles, and\\r a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline.  I can understand archaeology\\r being attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but to\\r attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark.\\r However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as\\r well speak disrespectfully of the equator.  For archaeology, being\\r a science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply.  Its value\\r depends entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it.\\r We look to the archaeologist for the materials, to the artist for\\r the method.\\r \\r In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare\'s\\r plays, the first thing the artist has to settle is the best date\\r for the drama.  This should be determined by the general spirit of\\r the play, more than by any actual historical references which may\\r occur in it.  Most HAMLETS I have seen were placed far too early.\\r HAMLET is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and if\\r the allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts it\\r back to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down much\\r later.  Once, however, that the date has been fixed, then the\\r archaeologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is to\\r convert into effects.\\r \\r It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show\\r us that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a\\r great deal of capital has been made out of Hector\'s indiscreet\\r quotation from Aristotle.  Upon the other hand, the anachronisms\\r are really few in number, and not very important, and, had\\r Shakespeare\'s attention been drawn to them by a brother artist, he\\r would probably have corrected them.  For, though they can hardly be\\r called blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of his\\r work; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannot\\r be emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to\\r its proper date.  In looking at Shakespeare\'s plays as a whole,\\r however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelity\\r as regards his personages and his plots.  Many of his DRAMATIS\\r PERSONAE are people who had actually existed, and some of them\\r might have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience.\\r Indeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his\\r time was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.  As for his\\r plots, Shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentic\\r history, or from the old ballads and traditions which served as\\r history to the Elizabethan public, and which even now no scientific\\r historian would dismiss as absolutely untrue.  And not merely did\\r he select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of his\\r imaginative work, but he always gives to each play the general\\r character, the social atmosphere in a word, of the age in question.\\r Stupidity he recognises as being one of the permanent\\r characteristics of all European civilisations; so he sees no\\r difference between a London mob of his own day and a Roman mob of\\r pagan days, between a silly watchman in Messina and a silly Justice\\r of the Peace in Windsor.  But when he deals with higher characters,\\r with those exceptions of each age which are so fine that they\\r become its types, he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal of\\r their time.  Virgilia is one of those Roman wives on whose tomb was\\r written \'Domi mansit, lanam fecit,\' as surely as Juliet is the\\r romantic girl of the Renaissance.  He is even true to the\\r characteristics of race.  Hamlet has all the imagination and\\r irresolution of the Northern nations, and the Princess Katharine is\\r as entirely French as the heroine of DIVORCONS.  Harry the Fifth is\\r a pure Englishman, and Othello a true Moor.\\r \\r Again when Shakespeare treats of the history of England from the\\r fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it is wonderful how careful\\r he is to have his facts perfectly right - indeed he follows\\r Holinshed with curious fidelity.  The incessant wars between France\\r and England are described with extraordinary accuracy down to the\\r names of the besieged towns, the ports of landing and embarkation,\\r the sites and dates of the battles, the titles of the commanders on\\r each side, and the lists of the killed and wounded.  And as regards\\r the Civil Wars of the Roses we have many elaborate genealogies of\\r the seven sons of Edward the Third; the claims of the rival Houses\\r of York and Lancaster to the throne are discussed at length; and if\\r the English aristocracy will not read Shakespeare as a poet, they\\r should certainly read him as a sort of early Peerage.  There is\\r hardly a single title in the Upper House, with the exception of\\r course of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords, which\\r does not appear in Shakespeare along with many details of family\\r history, creditable and discreditable.  Indeed if it be really\\r necessary that the School Board children should know all about the\\r Wars of the Roses, they could learn their lessons just as well out\\r of Shakespeare as out of shilling primers, and learn them, I need\\r not say, far more pleasurably.  Even in Shakespeare\'s own day this\\r use of his plays was recognised.  \'The historical plays teach\\r history to those who cannot read it in the chronicles,\' says\\r Heywood in a tract about the stage, and yet I am sure that\\r sixteenth-century chronicles were much more delightful reading than\\r nineteenth-century primers are.\\r \\r Of course the aesthetic value of Shakespeare\'s plays does not, in\\r the slightest degree, depend on their facts, but on their Truth,\\r and Truth is independent of facts always, inventing or selecting\\r them at pleasure.  But still Shakespeare\'s use of facts is a most\\r interesting part of his method of work, and shows us his attitude\\r towards the stage, and his relations to the great art of illusion.\\r Indeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classing\\r his plays with \'fairy tales,\' as Lord Lytton does; for one of his\\r aims was to create for England a national historical drama, which\\r should deal with incidents with which the public was well\\r acquainted, and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people.\\r Patriotism, I need hardly say, is not a necessary quality of art;\\r but it means, for the artist, the substitution of a universal for\\r an individual feeling, and for the public the presentation of a\\r work of art in a most attractive and popular form.  It is worth\\r noticing that Shakespeare\'s first and last successes were both\\r historical plays.\\r \\r It may be asked, what has this to do with Shakespeare\'s attitude\\r towards costume?  I answer that a dramatist who laid such stress on\\r historical accuracy of fact would have welcomed historical accuracy\\r of costume as a most important adjunct to his illusionist method.\\r And I have no hesitation in saying that he did so.  The reference\\r to helmets of the period in the prologue to HENRY THE FIFTH may be\\r considered fanciful, though Shakespeare must have often seen\\r \\r \\r The very casque\\r That did affright the air at Agincourt,\\r \\r \\r where it still hangs in the dusky gloom of Westminster Abbey, along\\r with the saddle of that \'imp of fame,\' and the dinted shield with\\r its torn blue velvet lining and its tarnished lilies of gold; but\\r the use of military tabards in HENRY THE SIXTH is a bit of pure\\r archaeology, as they were not worn in the sixteenth century; and\\r the King\'s own tabard, I may mention, was still suspended over his\\r tomb in St. George\'s Chapel, Windsor, in Shakespeare\'s day.  For,\\r up to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the Philistines in\\r 1645, the chapels and cathedrals of England were the great national\\r museums of archaeology, and in them were kept the armour and attire\\r of the heroes of English history.  A good deal was of course\\r preserved in the Tower, and even in Elizabeth\'s day tourists were\\r brought there to see such curious relics of the past as Charles\\r Brandon\'s huge lance, which is still, I believe, the admiration of\\r our country visitors; but the cathedrals and churches were, as a\\r rule, selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception of\\r the historic antiquities.  Canterbury can still show us the helm of\\r the Black Prince, Westminster the robes of our kings, and in old\\r St. Paul\'s the very banner that had waved on Bosworth field was\\r hung up by Richmond himself.\\r \\r In fact, everywhere that Shakespeare turned in London, he saw the\\r apparel and appurtenances of past ages, and it is impossible to\\r doubt that he made use of his opportunities.  The employment of\\r lance and shield, for instance, in actual warfare, which is so\\r frequent in his plays, is drawn from archaeology, and not from the\\r military accoutrements of his day; and his general use of armour in\\r battle was not a characteristic of his age, a time when it was\\r rapidly disappearing before firearms.  Again, the crest on\\r Warwick\'s helmet, of which such a point is made in HENRY THE SIXTH,\\r is absolutely correct in a fifteenth-century play when crests were\\r generally worn, but would not have been so in a play of\\r Shakespeare\'s own time, when feathers and plumes had taken their\\r place - a fashion which, as he tells us in HENRY THE EIGHTH, was\\r borrowed from France.  For the historical plays, then, we may be\\r sure that archaeology was employed, and as for the others I feel\\r certain that it was the case also.  The appearance of Jupiter on\\r his eagle, thunderbolt in hand, of Juno with her peacocks, and of\\r Iris with her many-coloured bow; the Amazon masque and the masque\\r of the Five Worthies, may all be regarded as archaeological; and\\r the vision which Posthumus sees in prison of Sicilius Leonatus -\\r \'an old man, attired like a warrior, leading an ancient matron\' -\\r is clearly so.  Of the \'Athenian dress\' by which Lysander is\\r distinguished from Oberon I have already spoken; but one of the\\r most marked instances is in the case of the dress of Coriolanus,\\r for which Shakespeare goes directly to Plutarch.  That historian,\\r in his Life of the great Roman, tells us of the oak-wreath with\\r which Caius Marcius was crowned, and of the curious kind of dress\\r in which, according to ancient fashion, he had to canvass his\\r electors; and on both of these points he enters into long\\r disquisitions, investigating the origin and meaning of the old\\r customs.  Shakespeare, in the spirit of the true artist, accepts\\r the facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic and\\r picturesque effects  and, as far as dramatic value goes, to confuse\\r the costumes is to confuse the play.  Costume is a growth, an\\r evolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, sign\\r of the manners, customs and mode of life of each century.  The\\r Puritan dislike of colour, adornment and grace in apparel was part\\r of the great revolt of the middle classes against Beauty in the\\r seventeenth century.  A historian who disregarded it would give us\\r a most inaccurate picture of the time, and a dramatist who did not\\r avail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing an\\r illusionist effect.  The effeminacy of dress that characterised the\\r reign of Richard the Second was a constant theme of contemporary\\r authors.  Shakespeare, writing two hundred years after, makes the\\r king\'s fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in the\\r play, from John of Gaunt\'s reproaches down to Richard\'s own speech\\r in the third act on his deposition from the throne.  And that\\r Shakespeare examined Richard\'s tomb in Westminster Abbey seems to\\r me certain from York\'s speech  it is not merely a dangerous\\r colour to wear by gaslight, but it is really difficult in England\\r to get a thoroughly good blue.  The fine Chinese blue, which we all\\r so much admire, takes two years to dye, and the English public will\\r not wait so long for a colour.  Peacock blue, of course, has been\\r employed on the stage, notably at the Lyceum, with great advantage;\\r but all attempts at a good light blue, or good dark blue, which I\\r have seen have been failures.  The value of black is hardly\\r appreciated; it was used effectively by Mr. Irving in HAMLET as the\\r central note of a composition, but as a tone-giving neutral its\\r importance is not recognised.  And this is curious, considering the\\r general colour of the dress of a century in which, as Baudelaire\\r says, \'Nous celebrons tous quelque enterrement.\'  The archaeologist\\r of the future will probably point to this age as the time when the\\r beauty of black was understood; but I hardly think that, as regards\\r stage-mounting or house decoration, it really is.  Its decorative\\r value is, of course, the same as that of white or gold; it can\\r separate and harmonise colours.  In modern plays the black frock-\\r coat of the hero becomes important in itself, and should be given a\\r suitable background.  But it rarely is.  Indeed the only good\\r background for a play in modern dress which I have ever seen was\\r the dark grey and cream-white scene of the first act of the\\r PRINCESSE GEORGES in Mrs. Langtry\'s production.  As a rule, the\\r hero is smothered in BRIC-E-BRAC and palm-trees, lost in the gilded\\r abyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge in\\r the midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always be\\r kept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.  This, of\\r course, can only be done when there is one single mind directing\\r the whole production.  The facts of art are diverse, but the\\r essence of artistic effect is unity.  Monarchy, Anarchy, and\\r Republicanism may contend for the government of nations; but a\\r theatre should be in the power of a cultured despot.  There may be\\r division of labour, but there must be no division of mind.  Whoever\\r understands the costume of an age understands of necessity its\\r architecture and its surroundings also, and it is easy to see from\\r the chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines or\\r not.  In fact, in art there is no specialism, and a really artistic\\r production should bear the impress of one master, and one master\\r only, who not merely should design and arrange everything, but\\r should have complete control over the way in which each dress is to\\r be worn.\\r \\r Mademoiselle Mars, in the first production of HERNANI, absolutely\\r refused to call her lover \'MON LION!\' unless she was allowed to\\r wear a little fashionable TOQUE then much in vogue on the\\r Boulevards; and many young ladies on our own stage insist to the\\r present day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under Greek\\r dresses, to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold; but\\r these wicked things should not be allowed.  And there should be far\\r more dress rehearsals than there are now.  Actors such as Mr.\\r Forbes-Robertson, Mr. Conway, Mr. George Alexander, and others, not\\r to mention older artists, can move with ease and elegance in the\\r attire of any century; but there are not a few who seem dreadfully\\r embarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets, and who\\r always wear their dresses as if they were costumes.  Costumes, of\\r course, they are to the designer; but dresses they should be to\\r those that wear them.  And it is time that a stop should be put to\\r the idea, very prevalent on the stage, that the Greeks and Romans\\r always went about bareheaded in the open air - a mistake the\\r Elizabethan managers did not fall into, for they gave hoods as well\\r as gowns to their Roman senators.\\r \\r More dress rehearsals would also be of value in explaining to the\\r actors that there is a form of gesture and movement that is not\\r merely appropriate to each style of dress, but really conditioned\\r by it.  The extravagant use of the arms in the eighteenth century,\\r for instance, was the necessary result of the large hoop, and the\\r solemn dignity of Burleigh owed as much to his ruff as to his\\r reason.  Besides until an actor is at home in his dress, he is not\\r at home in his part.\\r \\r Of the value of beautiful costume in creating an artistic\\r temperament in the audience, and producing that joy in beauty for\\r beauty\'s sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never\\r be understood, I will not here speak; though it is worth while to\\r notice how Shakespeare appreciated that side of the question in the\\r production of his tragedies, acting them always by artificial\\r light, and in a theatre hung with black; but what I have tried to\\r point out is that archaeology is not a pedantic method, but a\\r method of artistic illusion, and that costume is a means of\\r displaying character without description, and of producing dramatic\\r situations and dramatic effects.  And I think it is a pity that so\\r many critics should have set themselves to attack one of the most\\r important movements on the modern stage before that movement has at\\r all reached its proper perfection.  That it will do so, however, I\\r feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics\\r in the future higher qualification than that they can remember\\r Macready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them,\\r indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty.  POUR ETRE PLUS\\r DIFFICILE, LA TACHE N\'EN EST QUE PLUS GLORIEUSE.  And if they will\\r not encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of which\\r Shakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it has\\r the illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beauty\\r for its result.  Not that I agree with everything that I have said\\r in this essay.  There is much with which I entirely disagree.  The\\r essay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in aesthetic\\r criticism attitude is everything.  For in art there is no such\\r thing as a universal truth.  A Truth in art is that whose\\r contradictory is also true.  And just as it is only in art-\\r criticism, and through it, that we can apprehend the Platonic\\r theory of ideas, so it is only in art-criticism, and through it,\\r that we can realise Hegel\'s system of contraries.  The truths of\\r metaphysics are the truths of masks.\\r \\r \\r \\r \\r \\r End","sidebar":"devDocsSidebar"},"THE UGLY DUCKLING":{"id":"THE UGLY DUCKLING","title":"THE UGLY DUCKLING","description":"1872","sidebar":"devDocsSidebar"},"The Ultimate Standard of Value":{"id":"The Ultimate Standard of Value","title":"The Ultimate Standard of Value","description":"The Ultimate Standard of Value Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science volume 5, (1894-95), pp. 149-208 by Eugen Bohm-Bawerk translated by C.W.
