This introduced a second use of Cauponation,\r\nwhen men did by the Pledge of Money procure not only those things\r\nwhich they themselves wanted, but which they might sell to others\r\nfor more money: and under that kind is all Trades comprehended,\r\nwhether it be grose sale, or retale; and this use hath brought in\r\na third use of Money, for the gain of cauponation did give a\r\nColour to those that lent Money to such as did encrease it by\r\nTrade, to take usury for it, which is therefore termed the most\r\nunnatural use of Money, because it is most remote from the\r\nnatural Institution. Of this there are many kinds of which the\r\nmost refined is that of Exchange, which is mix'd with an usury of\r\nplace, as that is of time.\r\nThus did Money grow inseperably necessary to all Exchange, to\r\nmake the things exchanged equal in value, for that all exchange\r\nis either by the actual or intellectual valuation of Money; that\r\nis to say, Either the thing is exchanged for Money, or if it be\r\nexchanged for another thing, the measure of that exchange is how\r\nmuch Money either of the things exchanged is conceived to be\r\nworth; and Practice hath found out that in values, which the\r\nGeometricians have found out in quantities, that two lines which\r\nare equal to a third line, are equal to one another: So is money\r\na third line, by which all things are made equal in value, and\r\ntherefore it is not ill compared to the Meteria Prima, because,\r\nthough it serves actually to no use almost, it serves potentially\r\nto all uses.

And for that purpose, I\r\nintend first Historically, to set down by what Degrees, and upon\r\nwhat Reasons the forms of Money and of Coinage, now practised are\r\ngiven into use, and without any censure or observation upon them:\r\nand I will afterwards treat a part of the inconveniences grown\r\ninto this Subject of Money, and of the Remedies that may be\r\napplied thereunto."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 2"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the Matter of Money"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Of all things whereof Money could be made, there was nothing\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"so fit as Metalls, as Copper, Silver, but above all Gold; for\r\nthey are first useful, which doth increase it; they may be\r\ndivided into as little parts as you will, and then returned into\r\na greater mass: they are susceptible of any form, mark or\r\nimpression to be made and fit to conceive it; they are of an\r\nexceeding long indurance against the Injuries of time or\r\naccident, they are hardly subject to any natural corruption,\r\nespecially Gold, of the continuitie and incorruptableness whereof\r\nthe Alchimists, who have most vexed that body, do write wonders;\r\nso as one affirmeth, That it is harder to destroy Gold than to\r\nmake it; and they have sundry other properties accomodating them\r\nfor the matter of Money; as the world hath by a general consent,\r\nand from all times received them for that purpose, especially\r\nGold and Silver, of which chiefly I mean to treat: It is true\r\nthat many particular Countries have antiently, and do as this day\r\nuse other things in stead of Money: (as to instance in some of\r\nthe modern) in AEthiopia they use certain stones of Salt in stead\r\nof Money; in Guinney, Shells; in New Spain, Cacao, Coco in Peru,\r\none of which is a fruit, the other an herb: but in all these\r\nCountries you shall find that there is a certain value set upon\r\nGold and Silver, by which chiefly the value of all other things\r\nis raised, and that these other things do but serve as base Money\r\ndoth in sundry Countries of Europe, where it is current in\r\ncertain limits, by the Law or Custom of the Place; but yet they\r\ncannot be without Gold and Silver Money, unless they will barr\r\nthemselves from all commerce with other Nations: And to that\r\npurpose the Invention of Licurgus was admirable, who desiring to\r\nlock up his Citizens from all commerce with other nations, did\r\nupon great penalties banish all Gold and Silver out of the City;\r\nand as long as that Prohibition was observed, the manners and\r\nCustoms of the City were preserved entire from the mixture of\r\nother Nations: but when their ambition and voluptuousness had\r\nentangled them in the Commerce of other Nations, then did Gold\r\nand Silver grow into use in despite of all Laws, by this\r\nuniversal value given unto Gold and Silver. I shall convince\r\nhereafter an important and a popular Error, by which many are\r\nperswaded, that Princes can give what value they list to Gold and\r\nSilver, by enhansing and letting fall their Coins, when as in\r\ntruth Gold and Silver will retain the same proportion towards\r\nother things, which are valued by them, which the general consent\r\nof other Nations doth give unto them, if there be a Trade and\r\nCommerce with other Nations: By which intercourse it comes to\r\npass, that if the price of Gold and Silver be raised, the price\r\nof all Commodities is raised according to the raising of Gold and\r\nSilver; so as let any particular Prince or State raise the price\r\nof Gold and Silver as they list, yet they will still hold the\r\nsame proportion towards other things valued by them, which the\r\ngeneral consent of other Nations neer about them doth give unto\r\nthem: and this universal value of Gold and Silver, the mint, even\r\nin money, do call Intrinsical, and the local value they call\r\nExtrinsical, as depending upon impression of the mark and\r\nordinance of the State. Now Money is said to have an Intrinsical\r\nvalue so much as there is Gold and Silver in it in fineness and\r\nweight, which is computed in France (and was antiently likewise\r\nthe Computation in England) first for Gold, it is divided into 24\r\nparts, which are called Carrats, and so when they say, the Gold\r\nis 23 Carrats fine, then it is understood there is a 2th part\r\nbase, which is Allay mingled with Gold; or if they say, it is 22\r\nCarrats fine, then there is a 12th part of Allay: or if they say\r\n22 Carrats and one quarter fine, then there is so much Allay as\r\nthere wants to make up 24 parts.\r\nSilver is divided into 12 Deniers and every Denier into 25\r\ngrains; as if it be said, that Silver is jj Deniers and 12 grains\r\nfine, then there is 12 grains of allay, which is a 24th part; or\r\nif it be said to be jj Deniers and 6 grains fine, there is then\r\nso much allay as it wants in the fineness to make it 12 deniers:\r\nBut with us in England, ever since the time of Edward the third,\r\nthe Computation hath been dividing the Gold into 24 carrats, and\r\nevery carrat into a 4 grains, and every grain into so many parts\r\nas there is occasion offered to divide it; as for Example, The\r\nantient Standard of the sterling Gold was 23 Carrats, 3 grains,\r\nand one half of fine, and half a grain of Allay, which is the 192\r\npart; and the Silver is divided in England into 12 Ounces; every\r\nOunce into 20 Pence, every Penny into 24 grains; as for Example,\r\nthe old sterling standard is jj Ounces fine, and two Penny\r\nweight, then there remains eighteen Penny weight of Allay and, if\r\nthere were jj Ounces two Penny weight, and 6 grains fine, then\r\nthere would remain 17 Penny weight, and 10 grains of Allay: and\r\nagain, when mention is made of a Pound of Silver fine, and Gold\r\nfine, the meaning is so much Gold or Silver pure, is a pound\r\nweight, besides the Allay which is mingled with it,but a pound of\r\nGold or Silver wrought, is but just a pound weight as it is\r\nwrought either in Money or in Plate. The Allay being mingled with\r\nit according to the ordinance of the State, for the practise is\r\nnow, almost in all States, to set a price upon Silver and Gold,\r\naccording to the weight and fineness, above which price\r\nGold-Smiths or others who trade in those metals wrought in Money,\r\nmay not sell them; which price is in certain proportion\r\nunderneath the value which is given to the same metals wrought in\r\nMoney; the over-value allowed to the Money, being so much\r\nadvantage given to the State in recompence of the charge of\r\nCoynage, and in Acknowledgement of the Soveraignty, which hath\r\nwith it likewise this necessary use, that it makes the Money so\r\nmuch the less valuable to him that either would transport it into\r\nforrein parts, or melt it, and consequently retaineth the Money\r\nso much the better within its proper limits and natural form."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 3"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the Forms of the Money anciently and now in use"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"It follows in the next place to be Considered, by what\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"degrees Gold and Silver came into these forms of Money, which are\r\nnow in use. And for that purpose it is most manifest that the\r\nmost proper measure in nature for mettals is weight; and the\r\nnotice of Antiquity doth confirm it that it was so in practice;\r\nfor when the use of money hath excited the industry of men to\r\nsearch for these rich metals and by study and practice to\r\ndiscover their natures, it was easily found out that there was no\r\nmeasure so fit to them as weight: But it was speedily found out\r\nand discovered that weight alone was not a sufficient measure for\r\nthem, by reason that they are subject to mixture, and therefore\r\nthere was an examination made of the pureness of them, and a mark\r\nimpressed upon them to shew that they were approved; which was of\r\nno other nature, but as the Assaymaster in the West Indies doth\r\nmark the wedges of Silver to shew that they were approved of such\r\na fineness, and as the Corporation of Gold smiths in London, and\r\nother Cities, do mark the Bullion which is melted as a Testimony\r\nof fineness, but not to make it Current at any Price, because the\r\nmark hath no relation to the weight but onely the fineness. The\r\nmost ancient and most undoubted Testimonies whereof are in\r\nScripture: as that of Abraham, when he had bought the field of\r\nEphron for the burial of Sarah, for which it is not said that he\r\npaid, but weighed four hundred shekels of silver, approved among\r\nMerchants; which denoteth the fineness. And it is said that the\r\nsons of Jacob brought back their silver in the same weight that\r\nthey carried into Egypt; and Tobit lent unto Gabael the weight of\r\nten Talents: By which it is manifest they did not count their\r\nMoneys in pieces,as they did in succeeding ages, or by imaginary,\r\nor abstracted sums, as we do make their valuation, but by weight,\r\nthe fineness only is approved of by the mark. It were tedious to\r\nsearch the proofs of Antiquity in this kind, but it is manifest\r\nthat almost all the Names of Moneys, both among the Hebrews and\r\nGreeks, were not properly the names of any species of Money, but\r\nof several sorts of weight. As of Sicle, Mina, Talent and\r\nDrachma; so likewise the Original Moneys, both of the Romans, the\r\nFrancks, and of the Monarchy of England, were the As, the Livre,\r\nthe Pound and the Mark; and amongst the Romans, the ancient\r\nReceivers were not called numeratores, but libripendes; the names\r\nof Moneys being originally only the proportions of weight, and\r\nthe mark serving only for a proof of the pureness of the Metal:\r\nThere did succeed a form of Money, wherein the impression did not\r\nonly signify the fineness, but the weight also. This among the\r\nRomans was moneta, from when our name of Money is derived a\r\nMonedo: it is attributed to Servius Tullius, to have bin the\r\nfirst in Rome, to have stamped with an Impression a certain piece\r\nof Money which was called As (as being of Copper, and weighing a\r\npound weight) and that he coyned lesser parts, distinguished by\r\nounces: it was long after in the Consulat of Quintus Fabius, that\r\nthe first Silver coin was made, called Denarius, because it was\r\nvalued at ten As, and at the same time were made half and\r\nquarters of the Denarii, called Sestertii, marked LLs, to signifi\r\nduas libras cum semisse. The first Denarii were made of Sextula\r\nor six in the ounce: it was above threescore years after 'ere any\r\nGold was coined, the first pieces were of such a weight as 40\r\nmade a pound: which Example of the Roman Coins, I do not alledge\r\nas the first, for it is manifest, that both the Median, Persian\r\nand Grecian states did use Coins, which by their Impression did\r\nsignify both the weight and fineness; but because they were the\r\nfirst, whereof I have any certain relation, and upon whose ground\r\nall these parts of the World have formed their Coins and made\r\ntheir divisions of weight. It doth now appear what Allay was\r\nmingled or what Tribute was charged in the first Roman moneys of\r\nGold and Silver; by which word of Tribute, I do understand\r\nwhatever was substracted out of the Intrinsical value of the\r\nMoney, and allowed to it as an over-value towards the charge of\r\nCoinage, or right of Soveraignty, rated by the State, or what\r\nremedies were allowed for their weight and fineness; only it\r\nappeareth by their medals that they were cast in a mold. But\r\nafter ages did grow to stamp their Coins finding how useful it\r\nwas to have lesser coins than could well be cast in a mould, and\r\nalso to avoid counterfeiting, which is with more difficulty in\r\nCoins stamped: and because it was hard to observe an exact\r\nproportion of weight, there was a certain remedy of grains,\r\nbeyond which, if the pieces of Coin did not fall of their just\r\nweight, they were to be received of Officers appointed, otherwise\r\nthey were rejected to be new coyned. There was a remedy of\r\nfineness, for when Allay grew to be mingled in the Coins, the\r\nworkmen could not constantly and precisely hit upon the mixture,\r\nand therefore had allowed them a certain proportion for Remedy,\r\nwhich if they did not exceed, their work was not subject to\r\ncensure. This allowance of Remedy hath been of two sorts, for\r\nwhen States would coin their Money strong and rich in value, they\r\ndid not give any allowance to any pieces of Coin under the just\r\nweight and fineness: but if they were of a just weight and\r\nfineness, not exceeding the grains of Remedy, then they were\r\nallowed; so as in this case, the Coins were upon accompt to be\r\nrecompence for so much as the over-put in the Money, being within\r\nthe remedy permitted, and this they call in French Battre le\r\nfort. But all States rather inclining to make their Moneys weak\r\nthan strong, there is in these latter Ages another way practiced,\r\nwhich is more general; that is, that Coins are not made one jot\r\nabove the just proportion of weight and fineness, but\r\n(notwithstanding) the fail of either, so as it be no more than\r\nthe grains of remedy, they are allowed as compleat: and by this\r\nmeans, upon Accompt, the Coiners are to make recompence to the\r\nState of so much as is short in their Coins, of the just weight\r\nand fineness, being within the permission of their remedy, which\r\nin French they call Battre Sur le foible. This is as much as I\r\nhold fit to be spoken of the Antient and Modern forms; Except I\r\nshould discourse of the Inscriptions or Characters, or of the\r\nFigures of Money, which in some times and places, have been long,\r\noval, or square,and are now almost everywhere round, which to the\r\nsearchers of Antiquity might prove grateful, but to my purpose\r\nwould be of no use."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 4"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the Proportion held between Gold and Silver, Antient and\r\nModern."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Use and Delight, or the opinion of them, are the true causes\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"why all things have a Value and Price set upon them, but the\r\nProportion of that value and price is wholly governed by Rarity\r\nand Abundance: And therefore the Proportion of value between Gold\r\nand Silver must needs differ in several Times and Places,\r\naccording to the scarcity or abundance of those Mettals. There is\r\nmuch Variety amongst Authors what Proportions Gold and Silver\r\nheld to one another amongst the Hebrews, not out of the\r\nDifference of Times, but out of the Difference of\r\nInterpretations; for Bodine doth alledge the same places to prove\r\nthe Proportion was twenty five for one, which other Authors do\r\nalledge to prove it to have been 45 for one; and others 10 for\r\none. There is a Passage in Thalia, of Herodotus (sect. 95) by\r\nwhich it appears, that Thirteen Talents of Silver were valued at\r\none of Gold in the Revenues of Darius. And there is an Opinion\r\nreceived, That in the time of the flourishing of the Grecian\r\nCommon-wealths, those Mettals were in the Proportion of twelve to\r\none. It is also reported in Pliny, (without mentioning any\r\ncertain time) That antiently the Romans did value a scruple of\r\nGold at twenty Sestertii of Silver, which, if it were when the\r\nSestertii were at the greatest weight, made the Proportion of\r\ntwenty for one: and if it were when they were at their least\r\nweight, it made the Proportion of fifteen for one. But there is a\r\nclear Passage, in the 8th Book (sect. 11) of the 4th Decade of\r\nLivy, of an Accord between the Romans and AEtolians, that the\r\nAEtolians might pay, instead of every Talent of Gold, ten Talents\r\nof Silver; and (in Suetonius) it is said, that Caesar, at his\r\ncoming out of Gallia brought such a quantity of Gold, that the\r\nProportion betwixt Gold and silver abated to seven and one half\r\nof Silver to one of Gold: the abatement had not been credible, if\r\nthe Proportion of Pliny had been twenty for one, or fifteen for\r\none. But to come to later times, and to our Neighbours, which\r\nhave therefore a more near Relation to us, both in time and\r\nplace.\r\nThe proportion in France, in the time of King John, who was\r\ncontemporant with Edward the Third, was 11 for one: and in the\r\ntime of Charles the Fifth, who succeeded next to him, it was 11\r\nand almost 12 for one. And ever since the Proportion has been\r\nheld between 11 and 12 for one. But by the edict of this French\r\nKind now reigning, December 1614, the mark of Gold fine is valued\r\nat 27 l. 16 s. 7 d. the mark of Silver called Argent le Roy, is\r\nvalued at 14 s. 6 d. and almost one half penny. But adding a 24th\r\npart to the two, to make it fine, which the Silver called Argent\r\nle Roy doth want of fineness, the proportion will arise into 13,\r\nwanting about a seventh part to one of Gold. In Germany about the\r\nyear 1610, the Proportion held 13 for one, sometimes a little\r\nmore, sometimes a little less; though antiently the Proportion\r\nwas eleven for one. The Proportion in Spain hath a long time\r\nremained near about twelve for one. The Proportion in the United\r\nProvinces, by the Placcard 1622 (which is yet in force) is about\r\n12 and two thirds fine silver, to one of Gold. But before I come\r\nto set the Proportions that have been held in this Kingdom of\r\nEngland I shall first set down, How I do inquire and resolve of\r\nthe said Proportions, to the end I may satisfy such whose\r\nCuriosity may carry them to examine the truth of the said\r\nProportions.\r\nI do first examine by the Records of the several times, how\r\nmuch the Gold, then coined in work, is valued at, then I do\r\nexamine what proportion of Allay is mixed in the said Gold coined\r\nin work, and add to the same the said proportion of Allay, as if\r\nit were fine Gold, and so make up a full pound of fine Gold; and\r\ndo just in the same manner, value the full pound of fine Silver\r\nand then calculate what proportion is between the value of the\r\npound of fine Gold and the value of the pound of fine Silver. To\r\nwhich examination, I cannot conceive what can be objected other\r\nthan this, That the remedies which are allowed, being different\r\nin the Gold from the Silver, and different in themselves, in\r\ndifferent times, must needs breed an error in this Calculation.\r\nBut to that objection I answer, that the remedies do make so\r\nsmall a difference that it is not considerable; and besides it\r\nwere impossible to consider the remedies in this\r\nCalculation,because they are casual in the work and are supposed\r\nto fall out sometimes as well beyond the just standard as\r\ndeficient: And from all Antiquity it is provided in the\r\nIndentures, that the remedies shall be allowed, if the defects\r\nappear to be casual and not voluntary. The Truth is, that they\r\nwere an invention by which the Masters of the Mint made their\r\nadvantage under colour of Contingency of the work, which appears\r\nto have bin first apprehended by King Henry the VII who in the\r\nfirst year of his reign made the Masters of the Mint accountable\r\nto himself for so much of the remedie as was found deficient from\r\nthe standard. The first clear record that I can find for the\r\nvalues of our Moneys, is in the eighteenth year of Edward III and\r\nthen a full pound of fine silver was valued at 11 l. of fine\r\nSilver, and eight pence over: From that time to the 25th of\r\nEdward III there was some variety in the Money, but not worth the\r\nmention. But in the 25th a full pound of fine Gold was valued at\r\n11 l. of fine Silver, and 3s. 2d. over; and so it remained all\r\nEdward III time, and all Richard II time, and until the 13 of\r\nHenry IV; at which time both Gold and Silver were raised by\r\nadvice in Parliament, upon complaint that by reason of the low\r\nprices of Gold and Silver, the Money of the Realm was exhausted.\r\nAnd by that Ordinance a pound of fine Gold was valued at ten\r\npounds of fine Silver and almost one half, and so it remained all\r\nhis time, and all Henry V time and until the 49 of Henry VI time,\r\nand then the Gold and Silver was again raised, and a pound of\r\nGold fine was valued at 11 l. of the fine Silver and 6s. over. In\r\nthe fourth of Edward IV the Gold was abased in value, and the\r\nSilver left at the same price; by which means a pound of fine\r\nGold was valued at ten pound of fine Silver, and 6s 7d. over. But\r\nin the 8 of Edward IV the Gold was again raised to the former\r\nprice, as it was in the 49 of Hen. VI and so the proportion\r\nremained just the same both all Edward IV time and Henry VII\r\ntime, and the beginning of Henry VIII time. In 18 of Henry VIII\r\nthere were Letters Patent granted to the Cardinal of York and to\r\nsuch of the King's Council, as he should call unto him,\r\nauthorizing them to give such Directions, as they should think\r\nmeet, for the alteration both of the standard and values of the\r\nKings Moneys, and a Commission was accordingly issued to the\r\nOfficers of the Mint to pursue the said Directions; the Colour\r\nwhereof was, That the Moneys of the Realm were transported\r\nsecretly by reason of the excessive raising of Moneys in France,\r\nand in the Low Countries, and that the King, having sent unto\r\nother Princes, could obtain no redress for the raising of their\r\nCoyns: Upon this Commission did arise great confusions in the\r\nprices and standards of the Moneys; which, with certainly I\r\ncannot trace any further, because the matter passing by private\r\ndirection, there are no publick Records extant of them. In the\r\nthird of Edward VI a Commision was granted to coin Gold at 22\r\nCarrats fine, of the value of 34 l. the pound: and Silver of 8\r\nounces fine, of the value of 4 l. 16s. the Pound whereby a pound\r\nof Gold fine was valued at 37 l. and almost 2s. and a pound of\r\nSilver fine was valued at 7 l. 4s. and by that rate, a pound of\r\nfine Gold was as five pound of fine Silver and 22s. over: which\r\ncould not so fall out but through the excessive gain which the\r\nKing did make upon the Silver more than on the Gold: and it seems\r\nthat the proportion was much other between the Merchants in\r\nBullion, for neer about the same time the King gave Commission to\r\nbuy Gold and the Mint of 24 Carrats fine, at 58s. the ounce; and\r\nSilver of 12 ounces fine 5s. 4d. which is almost jj for one.\r\nThese confusions did still remain all Kind Edward and Queen\r\nMaries Reigns, but in 14 of Queen Elizabeth the antient sterling\r\nstandard both of Gold and Silver was renewed, and a pound of Gold\r\nfine valued at 11 l. of fine Silver, and 7s. 10d. over: In the\r\n24th of Elizabeth the standard of Gold was abased one quarter of\r\na grain, and of Silver one pennyweight, but the proportion\r\nbetween two metals near upon the same point: And although in\r\nthese times the Crown Gold was coined upon another standard, yet\r\nthe proportion in the Intrinsical value was kept the same. In\r\nsecundo Jacobi, the proportion was 12 for one; but every 20s.\r\nbeing afterwards by Proclamation raised to 22s; one pound of fine\r\nGold of 24 carrats, is valued at 13 l. of fine Silver of 12\r\nounces fine and one fifth over.\r\nAnd these are the Antient and Modern proportions of Gold and\r\nSilver to one another in price, as punctually and authentically\r\nas by diligent search I could gather them. There is yet another\r\nproportion between mettals, which is not unnecessary to our\r\npurpose to be understood, which although I have not by mine own\r\ntrial examined, yet having taken it from good Authors, I will not\r\nomit; and that is a natural and a constant proportion which\r\nmettals do hold differently to one another in weight in the same\r\nvalue and superficies: which is, that Gold weighs 48 parts, Quick\r\nSilver 27 parts, Silver 24 parts, Lead 22 parts, Tinn, Iron,\r\nCoper, 15 parts; which different proportion of weight was the\r\nground of that condition of Archymedes whereby he found out how\r\nmuch Silver the workmen of Hiero put into his Crown of Gold; and\r\nwhich is likewise the ground of many other subtil Conclusions,\r\nwhich have bin found out for the deprehension of mettals, and\r\nother mechanical works; and by this proportion those of China do\r\nexamine the fineness of the Gold which is current amongst them,\r\nwho by constant Relation, being said to be most subtile and exact\r\nin mechanical trials of mettals, have not the Gold which is\r\ncurrent amongst them coined, but reduced into powder, which they\r\ndo pass to one another in their commerce by weight, and do easily\r\ndeprehend if there be mixture of Allay amongst it by measuring\r\nthe powder, and then tempering the weight and measure together."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 5"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the raising of the price of Money both of Silver and Gold"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"It is to be understood that there are three ways of raising\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"the price of Moneys either Gold or Silver: The first is without\r\nalteration of the Species of the Money, by encreasing the value\r\nof it, by giving more parts to it than originally it had, as by\r\nordaining an Angel or a Soveraign to be valued at eleven\r\nshillings, which was coined for ten, or a shilling to be valued\r\nat fourteen pence. The second way is by diminishing the matter,\r\nbut leaving the same name and value to the Money which it  had\r\nbefore, as if Shillings or Angels, or Soveraigns were coined by\r\nthe same name and value as before, but were diminished so many\r\ngrains in weight: or, if new names were given to them and the\r\nsame value retained, but the weight diminished; for in this case,\r\nthere being really less Gold and Silver in weight in the piece\r\nthan there was before and the value remaining the same, the\r\nSilver and Gold which remains hath a higher price set upon it.\r\nThe third is when the value remaining the same of the species of\r\nMoney, and the weight of the same, the fineness is abased by\r\nputting more Allay into it, for then there is really less Gold\r\nand Silver in fineness.\r\nThere are two causes of the raising of Money: the first and\r\nmost antient cause of raising Money, was a gain which the state\r\nmade of it in their Necessities, which hath not often been\r\npractised in this Kingdom. But the second and most frequent cause\r\nhath been, an Art which States have used to rob one another of\r\ntheir Money, by setting on higher prices upon it; so that some\r\nStates being induced, by an unjust device, to draw to themselves\r\nthe Money of their Neighbours, and others by a necessity to keep\r\ntheir own. All these parts of the world, for some few hundred of\r\nyears, have done nothing but vye one upon another who shall raise\r\ntheir Money highest, which hath brought great Confusion in all\r\nStates; and doth threaten much greater, if it be not prevented.\r\nBut first to shew the Antiquity of the practice of raising of\r\nMonies we will begin with the Romans. The As, which was\r\noriginally coyned of a pound weight, was, during the first Punick\r\nWar for help of publick necessities, brought to 2 ounces, and all\r\nthe lesser parts of the As, as ounces and others, were abated in\r\nproportion. During the Dictatorship of Fabius Maximus the As was\r\nbrought to one ounce weight, and yet reduced again by Papirius to\r\nhalf an ounce. The Denarii of Silver were at first current for\r\nten As, and the Sestertii, which were quarters of the Denarii,\r\nfor two and a half as. But when the weight of the as was\r\ndiminished to one ounce the denarius was made worth sixteen as,\r\nand the sestertius worth four as. They did likewise make sundry\r\nabasements (by means) of the Allay, whereof that of Livius Drusus\r\nwas excessive, mixing an 8th part of Copper. And hereby the\r\nconfusions grew so great, that Tullie in a passage of his Offices\r\nsaith, Jactobatur enim Temporibus illis Nummus, sic ut nemo\r\nposset scire quid haberet (in pecunia); where upon Marius\r\nGratidianus, who being Triumvir monetae cudendae, brought in an\r\nexact Ordinance for the regulating of this Money, had Statues\r\nerected to him by the people. The first gold pieces were coined\r\nof 40 pieces in the pound, and in the time of Justinian, the same\r\npieces, called Solidi aurei were 72 in the pound. After the great\r\ninundations of the Barbarous people into the Roman Empire, the\r\nConfusions in this subject of Money grew incredible.\r\nCharles the Great, in whose time the Monarchy of the Francks\r\ngrew to the Height, made a new Reglement of Moneys, which is the\r\nsame that continues to this day in France, and is the same which\r\nwe do now practice in England, for the division of Moneys, though\r\nfor the Values of them the difference is grown exceeding great:\r\nFor he renewed again the Account by Livres or Pounds, and divided\r\nthe Pounds into twenty Solidi, which in France they call Sols,\r\nand we Shillings; the solidus again into 12 Denarii, which in\r\nFrance they call Deniers, and we pence. But the values are grown\r\nso different as every of our Shillings, our Pounds, our Pence are\r\nvalued at ten of theirs: and yet in intrinsical value are more.\r\nMany do hold that by the Institution of Charles the Great, twenty\r\nSols contained in them a Pound of silver. but it is authentically\r\nto be proved, both by unquestionable Records, and by Pieces\r\nthemselves, of which I have some extant, that many hundred of\r\nyears after, in the time of St. Lewis, who was contemporary with\r\nour Henry the Third, that the Sols then contained in intrinsical\r\nvalue near six Sols of this present King, so much hath the Money\r\nsince that time been raised in price, and abased in substance,\r\nwhich is the same. In the Reign of Philip the Second, in the year\r\n1181, the French Mark of fine Gold, which makes almost 8 ounces\r\nof our Pound, was valued in the Moneys then at 44 livres, and the\r\nMark of the King's Silver was valued at 2 livres, 13 sols, and 4\r\ndeniers. And by the Edict of this present King, in the year 1614,\r\nthe Mark of the same Gold was valued at 278 Livres, 6 Sols, 6\r\nDeniers. And the Mark of the same silver was valued at 20 livres,\r\n5 Sols; so that in this time, the Gold hath been raised to six\r\ntimes, and almost the third part of the price which then it did\r\nbear; and the Silver hath been raised much above seven times the\r\nvalue which then it did bear.\r\nI will not trouble the Reader to set down by what degrees\r\nthis Price has grown to so great an height which have been very\r\nvarious, the Price having been sometimes excessively raised and\r\nsometimes sudainly reduced back again by the French Kings, and\r\nmost commonly to make a Levy of Monies upon the People, which\r\nhath bred infinite Confusions, and sometimes Rebellions in that\r\nKingdom.\r\nBut I will now come to the Kingdom of England, where the\r\nraising of the Price hath been with a more constant hand, and,\r\nalmost alwayes, out of a kind of Necessity to follow the raising\r\nof other States; yet, from time to time we shall not finde the\r\nRates of the raising much to differ from those of France. But I\r\ncannot begin from so antient (a date) as in France; The first\r\nRecord that I can find for this purpose being in the eighteenth\r\nyear of Edward the Third, which was in the year of Grace about\r\n1344. And then a pound of Gold of sterling Standard, which is 23\r\ncarrats, 3 grains, and one half fine, was valued at 13 pound 4s\r\n8d. and a pound of Silver of sterling Standard, at 22s. 2d. The\r\n20th of Edward the Third, the pound of Gold of the same Standard\r\nwas raised to 14 pound, and the pound of Silver to 22s 6d. In the\r\n27th of Edward the Third, the same gold was raised to 15 pound,\r\nand the same Silver to 25s the pound; the rest of the reign of\r\nEdward the Third, and during all the Reign of Richard the Second,\r\nand until the Thirteenth of Henry the Fourth, the same prices\r\nremained. And then by the Advice of the Parliament, to prevent\r\nTransportation, the same Gold was raised to 16 pound, 15s and the\r\nsame Silver to 30s the pound; and this price remained all the\r\nrest of the reign of Henry the Fourth, and during all the Reign\r\nof Henry the Fifth, and until the 49th of Henry the Sixth; and\r\nthen the same Gold was raised to 22 l. 10s. and the same Silver\r\nto 37s. 6d. But in the fourth of Edward the Fourth, the price of\r\nthe same Gold was brought back to 20 pound 16s. 8d. the Silver\r\nremaining as before. And in the eighth of Edward the Fourth, the\r\nGold was again raised to the former price of 22 l. 10s. the\r\nSilver still remaining at 37s. 6d. And this price remained all\r\nthe rest of the Reign of Edward the Fourth, all the Reign of\r\nRichard the Third, all the Reign of Henry the Seventh, and all\r\nthe beginning of Henry the Eight: But in 18th of Henry the Eight,\r\na Commission issued forth for the Alteration of the Standard, and\r\nof the Prices of Moneys, according to the Direction to be given\r\nby the Cardinal of York, and such other of the King's Council as\r\nhe should call unto him: form whence issued so great a Confusion,\r\nboth in the prices and Standard of the Moneys, as would prove\r\nvery difficult to trace out, and tedious to read, as well for the\r\nObscurity as for the great Variations, which succeeded: And\r\ntherefore I pass over all the rest of his Reign, as also those of\r\nKing Edward and Queen Mary, and until the fourteenth of Queen\r\nElizabeth, when was again coined Gold and Silver of the antient\r\nsterling Standard, the Gold at 36 l. the pound, and the Silver of\r\nthe old Standard at 3 l. the pound: and although there were at\r\nthe same time and after much crown Gold coined, yet the\r\nintrinsical value of it was governed by (the weight and fineness\r\nof) the Angel of Gold: In the 25th and 26th of the Queen, she\r\nabased the standard of the Gold one quarter of a grain, and the\r\nstandard of the Silver one penny weight, whereby the price of\r\nGold was raised one shilling 10 pence in the pound, and the price\r\nof Silver 3d. in the pound. but in the second year of King James,\r\nthe price of the Soveraign, in gold which is but 22 carats fine,\r\nwas raised to 27 pound, 4 shill. being almost one eleventh part\r\nmore; and by the Proclamation, by which every 20 shilling piece\r\nwas made current for 22 shillings, the said Gold was yet raised\r\nanother tenth part; so that the increase of the price of Gold has\r\nbeen such by the Degrees before specified, that every pound\r\nsterling, by reckoning of Gold coin, and every part of a pound,\r\nas Marks, and Shillings, etc. in coin of Gold, did in the\r\neighteenth of Edward the Third contain in intrinsical value (id\r\nest) in pure Gold, thrice as much and above a third part more\r\nthan the same pound sterling in reckoning of Gold-coin, marks,\r\nshillings, etc. does at this day contain. And every pound\r\nsterling in reckoning of Silver-coin, and every part of a pound,\r\nas marks, shillings, etc. in Silver coins did in the 18th year of\r\nEdward the third, contain in intrinsical value, (id est) in pure\r\nSilver, thrice as much, wanting about 1/6th part as the same\r\npound sterling, in reckoning of Silver coins, marks, shillings,\r\netc. does at this day contain.\r\nThere is yet another Proportion of Gold and Silver to be\r\ninquired into as necessary to be known; and peradventure more\r\nnecessary than either of these: And that is to enquire what\r\nProportion our Gold and Silver holds in Value, being in Bullion,\r\nas it is presented to the Mint by the Merchant, in Comparison of\r\nthe near adjoyning Countries: For by this Proportion we shall\r\ndiscover the Reason why the Merchant Brings Gold into England\r\nrather than Silver, and Silver into Holland rather than Gold, or,\r\nwhy he carries both, or either of them, into one Country rather\r\nthan into another. And for that purpose, I will first begin with\r\nEngland, and then compare it with some of the nearest\r\nneighbouring Countreys.\r\nIn England, where the Merchant for so much Gold fine of 24\r\ncarats, as makes a pound, Tower weight, doth receive 43 l. 7s.\r\n1d. according to the rate of the Mint, which is 41 l. 5s. for a\r\npound weight of sterling gold.\r\nIn France, according to the Edict of this King, Anno 1614,\r\nwhich is yet in force, the Merchant receiveth at this Mint for so\r\nmuch Gold of 24 Carats, as makes a pound of Tower weight, but 426\r\nlivres, and about 7 sols and one half French more at the Mint in\r\nEngland for the same quantity of Gold, than the Merchant doth\r\nreceive at the Mint in France. Of Silver, the Merchant, at the\r\nMint in England receives for so much fine Silver as makes a\r\npound, Tower weight, 3 l. 4s. 6d. the Merchant receives at the\r\nMint in France, for the same quantity of Silver, 2 livres, and 2\r\nsols French, or 4s. and almost 2d. half penny more than the\r\nMerchant receives at the Mint of England. This Account I do make\r\nreckoning the 12 ounces, Tower weight to make, as by tryal it has\r\nbeen proved, 12 ounces and 6 deniers, Paris weight.\r\nAs for the United Provinces, etc."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 6"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of Base Money"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"I do not mean by base Money, Money of pure Copper, which in\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"all States and in all Ages hath almost always been used, at the\r\nfirst for want of Gold and Silver, and now since, for the\r\nnecessity of the poorer sort onely, and not for Commerce and\r\nTrade, as our farthlings have lately bin introduced: But I mean\r\nthat mixture of Metals, wherein Silver is incorporated with other\r\nbaser Metals, not for Allay but to the extinction of the\r\ndenomination of Silver; as Wine, when it is watered beyond a\r\ncertain proportion looseth the name of Wine. And in all the\r\nCountries of Europe, as far as I can learn, except England and\r\nMuscovia, is used for Commerce and Trade amongst the people:\r\nwhich mixtion of mettals however it hath been practised at times\r\nin former Ages, out of the extream Necessities of the Common\r\nwealth, yet I do not find that it hath been constantly embraced\r\n(as now it is in all parts) until about Eightscore years since,\r\nabout which time it was introduced into France by Charles the\r\nSeventh. The pretences whereof were these.\r\nFirst, That there was no Intention thereby to raise the price\r\nor to diminish the weight of Silver, but that this Money should\r\nbe as good in intrinsical value, as in the Money of purer Silver,\r\nsave only a small charge laid upon it for the coinage: then that\r\nby coining small pieces of a penny, two pence, or three pence,\r\nand thereabouts, the pieces, by the mixtion should have a greater\r\nbulk, and so be preserved from loss, which must needs frequently\r\nhappen by reason of the smallness of the pieces, if they were\r\nmade of pure Silver, so likewise they should be preserved from\r\nwearing: and again, that the Gold-Smith should by this means be\r\nkept from melting them, and the Stranger from exporting them,\r\nbecause the charge of refining them and drawing the pure Silver\r\nout of them would far exceed the profit: These are the Pretences\r\nby which base Money was first introduced, but if they be weighed\r\nagainst the Inconveniences, which have followed upon it, it will\r\nbe found one of the most mischievous Inventions that ever was\r\nfound in matters of Money. I could hardly resolve with myself to\r\ninsert this Chapter in this Discourse, because having mine aim\r\nonly a the good of this State, it seemed unnecessary to treat of\r\nthis Subject, since we have no base Money in England; but when I\r\nconsider, that in some unhappy seasons heretofore we have had\r\nbase Money; and that it is not impossible, but that the like\r\nProjects may again be revived, I determin'd not only to treat,\r\nbut to go through with it all at once, and not to interrupt this\r\nDiscourse any more with that Subject: And therefore to set down\r\nthe Inconveniences that have followed it, which in the former\r\nChapter I did forbear, reserving both the Inconveniences and the\r\nRemedies to be treated of apart. The first Inconvenience then of\r\nthe great mixture of Mettals, is the falsifying of them; for both\r\nin reason it is too true, that by this mixture both the Colour,\r\nSound, Weight, and the other more hidden Qualities of the\r\ndifferent mettals are so confounded as the falsity cannot be\r\ndiscovered, but with extream difficulty: and by experience it is\r\nverified, that in all those Countries where base Money\r\nhath-course, the greatest part of it is not coyned by the State,\r\nbut either counterfeited by the Natives, or brought in by several\r\nStrangers.\r\nSecondly, It is true that the base Money was first coined in\r\nFrance, of an intrinsical value, almost equal to that of purer\r\nmettals, and so it continues to this day, for so much of it is\r\ncoined by ordinance of the State, (the greatest part being\r\nfalsifyed:) But in most other Countries (as namely in Spain) the\r\nState in self, to raise a Tribute upon the people, hath extreamly\r\nfalsified the intrinsical value, by which means both the State\r\nhath for gain, Coins much more than there is occasion to use, and\r\nthere is incomparably more counterfeited by others, so as the\r\nmischief doth hourly multiply.\r\nThirdly, The values of Money are continually raised from time\r\nto time, which is no new Device (as is already more particularly\r\ndeclared) the base Money must then in Proportion be likewise\r\nraised, which cannot be done by increasing the value of the\r\nparticular pieces for being of so small price, the fractions\r\nwould be irreconcilable, so as there is no other way left to\r\nraise the base Money, but by coining new, of a weaker Intrinsical\r\nvalue. I would then gladly know what becomes of all the old base\r\nMoney, either it is melted down by Bullioners, which is the name\r\nin French of those who by culling and trying of Coins make their\r\nprofit to melt them; or it is transported by strangers, so as in\r\neffect the use of base Money doth bring that inconvenience, the\r\navoiding whereof was made one of the chiefest Pretences for\r\nCoinage of it.\r\nFourthly, It is truly observed, that in all those Countries\r\nwhere base Money is current, there the price of Gold and Silver\r\nis daily raised by the people, not only without the Ordinance of\r\nthe State, but contrary to, and in despight of all Prohibitions\r\nto the contrary, which draws with it extream disorders and\r\nmischiefs, so it is in the Low Countries, so it is in France, so\r\nin Germany, and in Spain; although the Ordinance for the value of\r\nthe Gold and Silver may securely be maintained by this help, that\r\nno Forrein Coin is there current; yet when you come to change\r\nbase Money for Silver or Gold, you shall find how the people\r\nthere raise the price unto you of the purer Money; But in England\r\nand Muscovia, where no base Money is in use, there the people\r\nnever raise the price of Gold and Silver (except by Ordinance of\r\nthe State it be directed) neither doth Experience only try this\r\nConclusion, but Reason also; for the people when they see the\r\nMoney of base and uncertain mixture, do disesteem it, and in\r\ncomparison thereof do esteem the Money of purer Gold and Silver\r\nabove the proportion, and so do raise the price of it; and this\r\nesteem is not meerly out of opinion, for that really, that piece\r\nof base Money which hath as much fine Silver as a penny, is\r\nnotwithstanding not worth a penny, because the mixture makes that\r\nyou cannot extract this penny in pure mettal, without loss and\r\ncharge: and if the people do hold this base esteem of this\r\nmixture which hath in it the intrinsical value for which it is\r\ncurrent, how much more base esteem must they hold of that\r\nmixture, which they know hath not neer in it that intrinsical\r\nvalue for which it is current, and how much more must they needs\r\nraise the Silver. And certainly base Money, when either it is at\r\nfirst coined much in the intrinsical value under the extrinsical,\r\nor is by degrees brought unto it and long so continued, doth in\r\nthe end breed either Insurrections among the People, or\r\nrejections of it; whereof the examples of Insurrections are very\r\nfrequent, and therefore I will forbear to instance in them. But I\r\ncannot omit one example of Rejection, because it is so fresh in\r\nMemory, which was in Ireland in the end of the Reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth; which Country although it was newly vindicated from\r\nRebellion, and did patently endure all the imperious Directions\r\nwhich a late fresh Victory did bring with it, yet as soon as the\r\nExchanges of base Moneys sent thither did cease in England, it\r\nwas instantly rejected there, and would not pass current for so\r\nmuch as in the true intrinsical value it was worth, but was\r\nbrought up at under rates by such as made profit by melting it.\r\nFifthly, The Dishonour that accompanies base Moneys, is of a\r\nmore important Inconvenience than all the rest, for what can be\r\nmore dishonourable than to have the Image of the Prince, or the\r\nMark of the Publick Attestation impressed upon false and\r\ncounterfeited stuff: according to the saying of an Emperour, Quid\r\nenim erit tutum si in nostra peccetur Effigie? And if there be\r\ngain made of it, it is a manifest breach of the publick Faith,\r\nfor that it hath no other course than as it hath publick warrant\r\nto be good. Nay, this point of Honour hath so far prevailed in\r\nthe World, that it hath been made an Observation by many, that in\r\nall great Divisions in States and Monarchaies, that partly hath\r\ninfallibly the juster cause which doth most warily proceed,\r\neither to the raising of the price, or the abasing of the matter\r\nthereof: which Observations are not without warrant of Experience\r\nnor of Reason also; for that all raising of the price and abasing\r\nof the matter of Money for gain, drawing with it an unjust,\r\nruinous and unequal burthen upon the people, they that maintain\r\nthe better cause, like the true Mother, will choose to loose the\r\ncause than the Child should be destroyed. In which loyal\r\nmaintenance of the public Faith in matters of Money our Kings do\r\nincomparably outshine all other Princes and States of Europe: for\r\nif Spain, and some other States do equal them in the pureness of\r\nthe mettals, and the low values of their Monies of Gold and\r\nSilver, yet they have made themselves farr inferiour unto them by\r\nfilling their Countries with base Money. And if in Muscovy they\r\nhave coined no base Money, yet they have raised the Standard of\r\ntheir Silver so high, by diminishing both the fineness and\r\nweight, that the Silver itself scarcly deserves that name. And\r\nthis I have seen and can learn by other means, that there is no\r\nState in the World more excellently tempered than this of\r\nEngland, or wherein the Prince is more absolute in all things,\r\nwherein it is good for himself and the publick, that he should be\r\nabsolute; or where the great men are more honoured without\r\nlicense of oppressing the People; or where the People do live\r\nmore freely or so happily as in England. As for the Remedies of\r\nthis Inconvenience of base Money, I do leave those Countries to\r\nstruggle with them that are afflicted with it, for us in England\r\nthe remedy is plain and easy, which is mainly and constantly to\r\nkeep it out. Thus far I have proceeded in the History of Money to\r\nset down, as briefly as I could, by what degrees Money hath grown\r\ninto that form and state as now it is governed; but have forborn\r\nto speake of the Inconveniences grown therein, and of the\r\nRemedies thereof, save only in the last Chapter, which I mean to\r\npropound, and debate in the rest of this Discourse, for the\r\nopening of the Readers understanding without making any positive\r\nconclusion, but leave that to every ones private Judgment."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 7"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the Inconveniences in general grown in the matter of Money."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The inconveniences which are accident to this Subject of\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Money are in general but two, Raritie and Confusion; which\r\nalthough they do coincide many times in the subject, that is,\r\nthat Rarity breeds Confusion, and Confusion breeds Rarity, yet in\r\ntheir Nature they do differ, and many times likewise in the\r\nSubject; and there is seen Confusion without Rarity, and Rarity\r\nwithout Confusion: yet this latter branch of Confusion will yield\r\nsmall matter to our discourse, because in England no forrein\r\nCoins are current, nor base Money; there is no variation in the\r\nMints, there being but one; and there is very small Varietie in\r\nAllayes; in the Silver Money none at all, and in the Gold, but\r\ntwo, all which are occasions of confusion in the matter of Money.\r\nAs for the other branch of Rarity, the causes thereof, when we\r\ncome to handle them, will appear both very various and very\r\nintricate. And, if I were to handle this Subject as part of a\r\nTreatise of the best Form of a Common-wealth, I would first\r\nendeavour to search out what proportion of Money were fittest for\r\nthe Common-wealth, for if MOney were invented for the Exchange of\r\nthings useful to man's life, there is a certain Proportion for\r\nthat use, and there is as well a too much as a too little:\r\nBecause that the want of Money makes the life of the Citizens\r\npenurious and barbarous, so the over-great Abundance of Money\r\nmakes their lives luxurious and wanton, by reason of the great\r\nCommutability of all things for Money, by which the vain and\r\nvicious Fancies of men are presently supplied with all that they\r\ndo affect. But I must apply my Conceit to the Common-wealth as it\r\nis, not as a Philosopher may frame it is to perfect the Horse in\r\nall his natural actions, and to redeem and win him from all\r\nvicious affections; but for the Rider it is enough if he do use\r\nhim to the best Advantage such as he finds him.\r\now all the Common-wealths of the World are grown to such a\r\nDepravation, that not only the exchange of Necessaries, for which\r\nMoney was first invented, but all things else are valued by\r\nMoney, the services and duties of the Commonwealth, the virtue\r\nand the lives of the citizens; so that in the common opinions,\r\nthat State that abounds in Money, hath Courage, hath Men, and all\r\nother Instruments to defend itself and offend others, if it have\r\nwisdom how to make use of it: and upon this ground it was said,\r\nduring the time of the late Wars in France, that that side that\r\nhad the last Crown to spend must be infallibly victorious. And it\r\nseems that in the Low Countries, on both sides they are of the\r\nsame opinion; for so they may draw Money by it from their\r\nEnemies, they do furnish them with Victuals and other Provisions\r\nto sustain their Armies by Pasport and publick Avowal. Hence it\r\nis that in the modern Forms of Common-wealths there is no\r\nProportion, no Mediocrity of Money, but all do strive to abound\r\nwith it, without any stint. And hence it is that Rarity is almost\r\nthe sole Inconvenience in matter of Money; the Rarity of Money\r\ndoth grow out of these Four Causes following, viz.\r\nFirst, Want of means to bring in the Materials of Money.\r\nSecondly, Facility of exporting them.\r\nThirdly, The wasting of them in the Kingdom.\r\nFourthly, The great encrease of the proportion between Gold\r\nand Silver, and the things valued by them."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"First, the want of means to bring in the Materials of Money,\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"may be reduced into these heads.\r\nFirst, The want of Manufactures, for Manufactures do breed\r\nMoney, and Money again doth breed Manufactures, which is apparent\r\nin divers States and Cities, that have no natural commodities of\r\ntheir own, either to exchange for other Commodities or to bring\r\nin Gold and Silver, which do yet notwithstanding abound with both\r\nby reason of their Manufactures, and as the Stocks of their Money\r\ndo encrease, so do their Manufactures encrease withall. But the\r\nways of encreasing and maintaining Manufactures do depend upon\r\nother considerations in civil Government, and in no sort upon the\r\ncourse of Money except by accident, that the good Government of\r\nthe course of Money may breed plenty of money, and plenty of\r\nMoney doth help to encrease Manufactures, and therefore to speak\r\nno more of this Subject; I purpose.\r\nA Second cause of want of Means to bring in the Materials of\r\nMoney, is the want of Sumptuary Laws to be made and executed, for\r\nas in private Families there is no so easie and certain way to\r\nthrive, as the cutting off superfluous expences, so is it in the\r\nCommon-wealth; and that which the Industry and Will of the Master\r\ndoth perform in every Private Family, that the Magistrates and\r\nLaw ought to perform in the Common-wealth. But this Title\r\nlikewise hath not Coherence with my Subject; and therefore I do\r\nomit to speak any further of it.\r\nA Third cause, is the want of Sufficient Search of these\r\nMettals in the Bowels of the Earth within the Kingdom, and it is\r\na certain Experiement that there are sundry Mines of Silver in\r\nthis Kingdom: and there is ground to believe both that they are\r\nof great Profit and of long continuance, if the working of them\r\nshall be well regulated by the State, and judiciously prosecuted\r\nby the Undertakers: but this also hath no dependance upon my\r\nSubject, and therefore here I leave it.\r\nThe fourth cause of the want of means to bring in the\r\nMaterials of Money is the impediments of Trade, which are very\r\nmany, and of subtile disquistion; but have no dependance upon our\r\nEnquiry, but by accident; and therefore I leave them to be\r\ndiscussed where it appertaineth.\r\nA fifth Defect, in the bringing in of the Materials of Money,\r\nis the Prohibition of Forrein, especially Spanish, and this Title\r\nhath entirely relation to our Subject, and hereof I purpose\r\nhereafter to examine the Inconvenience apart, together with the\r\nRemedies propounded.\r\nA sixth cause, is the Low price of our Moneys, especially of\r\nour Silver Moneys, which is the cause assigned by many that much\r\nof the Materials that would be brought hither into England, if\r\nthe price were higher, is now transported into other parts: And\r\nin this Title I mean first to examine apart the disproportion\r\nbetween our Money of Silver and Gold. But the low price of our\r\nMoney in respect of our Neighbours and the raising of it higher,\r\nor not raising of it, or the reducing of it yet lower, according\r\nto the values of more ancient times, and the Inconveniences that\r\nmay grow by the one or the other, and the remedies propounded\r\nwill occurr to be considered in every division of the causes of\r\nthe Rarity of Money. But to avoid Confusion, I do purpose to\r\nhandle them all together in one Chapter.\r\nThe Second cause of the rarity of Money and the Materials\r\nthereof, is the facility of exporting them out of the Kingdom\r\nwhich doth arise out of these Causes;\r\nFirst, out of raising of prices of Moneys by our Neighbours,\r\nwhich in effect is the same with the former of the low prices of\r\nour Moneys; for by giving a greater price for our Moneys, than it\r\nis valued here with us, they allure both our own and Forrein\r\nMerchants to carry our Moneys to them.\r\nA second Cause is the unequal Coinage of our Moneys, by which\r\ncometh to pass that those pieces which are over heavy and of\r\nfiner Allay, are tried and culled out, and either exported into\r\nForrein parts, or melted down for other uses. And although it\r\nmight be thought that the strict care used by the State in this\r\nbehalf should have prevented this mischief, yet daily experience\r\ndoth shew that great Quantities of the weightiest and best Moneys\r\nare daily exported, and that the Silver which remaineth amongst\r\nus is so much under the Standard as is hardly credible: which\r\nmatter I purpose to handle, being naturally incident to this\r\nsubject. The want likewise of Manufactures and Sumptuary Laws,\r\nare two causes of the facility of the exporting the Money and the\r\nMaterials thereof our of this Realm, for by the encrease of\r\nManufactures, the Commodities of the Kingdom are increased, and\r\nby Sumptuary Laws Forrein commodities are made less useful, both\r\nwhich conduce to the keeping of the Money and Bullion within the\r\nRealm. But these causes are not of our consideration.\r\nA third cause of the Rarity of Money and the Materials\r\nthereof, is the wasting and consuming it within the Kingdom, as\r\nin guildings, gold and silver-thread, and inlayings, all which is\r\nconsumed in a manner to nothing; the excessive use likewise of\r\nPlate maketh Money scant, but all these Defects are to be\r\nremedied by Sumptuary Laws. The laying up of Money also in\r\nTreasure, is likewise a Cause of Rarity: But the Interest of\r\nMoney is so high and quick in England, as I believe that cause\r\ndoth little prejudice.\r\nThe fourth cause of the Rarity of Money and Materials\r\nthereof, which is the great Encrease of the Proportion between\r\nGold and Silver, and things valued by them is entirely of our\r\nConsideration. And this cause doth diminish the quantity or\r\ndecrease the weight or fineness of the Gold and Silver, but doth\r\nencrease the use and want of Gold and Silver, and so maketh the\r\nMoney and Bullion of the Realm in general, and of every man in\r\nparticular, less in effect and value, though the quantity do\r\nincrease. As for Example: If a pound of Silver of the sterling\r\nStandard, coined into Money in Edward the Thirds Reign, would\r\nhave bought two fat Oxen, or seven quarters of Wheat; and that\r\nnow at this day, two pounds of Silver of the sterling Standard\r\ncoined into Money, will do no more than buy one fat Ox, or three\r\nquarters and one half of wheat: and if other things are increased\r\nin price according to that value, and that the like proportion\r\ndoth hold also in Gold; it doth then follow that although the\r\nRealm in general, and every man in particular should have now\r\ntwice as much of Gold and Silver in weight and fineness, as in\r\nKing Edward the Thirds Reign; yet in use and effect they should\r\nhave but half as much as then, because this double quantity in\r\nweight and fineness would in proportion to things valued by Gold\r\nand Silver, arise but to half so much as then: and so the great\r\nIncrease of the Proportion between Gold and Silver, and things\r\nvalued by them, doth induce a Rarity and Scarcity of these\r\nMettals, though the Quantity should increase. But what the just\r\nincrease of this Proportion is, and by what means it may be\r\ncertainly proved, and how the Raritie may be remedied, I purpose\r\nto treat hereafter.\r\nThus I have set down in general all the constant and certain\r\nCauses of the Rarity of Money: of so many of which as are\r\nincident to our subject, I purpose to treat in particular: As for\r\nthe other Branch, of the Inconveniencies of the matter of Money,\r\nwhich is Disorder and Confusion, I purpose not to make any title\r\na part of it, both because, as I have said before, the occasions\r\nof Confusions in England, in this Subject are very few; and that\r\nI shall aptly have cause to speak of it by the way, in the Causes\r\nof Rarity, which I mean to handle, not in the Method set down in\r\nthis Chapter, but begin with the plainest and easiest Titles, and\r\nof most certain Proof, first to the end that they may serve both\r\nto the opening and facilitating the Proof of the more difficult\r\nand obscure."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 8"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the low Price of our Silver"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"It hath been declared in the Chapter concerning the\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Proportion between Gold and Silver, that now in England Thirteen\r\npound and one fifth of Silver doth but answer in value to one\r\nPound in Gold, which Proportion is much above the Practice of\r\nformer ages in England, and other Countries about, both\r\nheretofore and at the present, which is principally grown by the\r\ngreat raising of Gold 2s in the pound, in the 9th year of his\r\nlate Majestie's Reign, at which time or at any time since, Silver\r\nhath not been raised: the first Effect whereof hath been, That\r\ngreat Quantities of Gold have since been coined, but little or no\r\nSilver, except now very lately. And of that Silver which we\r\nbefore had, the weightiest hath been culled out, and transported\r\nor melted, and that which doth remain amongst us, is so light, as\r\nthe lightness only doth preserve it in use, and the scarcity\r\nthereof is so great, that a many may go into a great many shops\r\nin London, of great Trade and Commerce before he shall get a 20s.\r\npiece in Gold to be chang'd into Silver: and far the greatest\r\npart of all paiments is made now in gold, contrary to former\r\ntimes; whereas the true Rule for the good of the Commonwealth is,\r\nThat there should be such a Proportion kept between Gold and\r\nSilver, as that they might equally abound, and of the two Silver\r\nmost abound: the Reason whereof is, That the greatest part of the\r\nCommerce, is made in silver, the want whereof doth greatly\r\nrejudice the same. The Remedy of this Inconvenience is plain and\r\neasy in the general, and theory, which is to reduce the Gold and\r\nsilver to an equal Proportion, but when you come to the Practick,\r\nthere does arise two great Difficulties, the first to find out\r\nwhat this equal Proportion is, the next how to settle it, whether\r\nby reducing the Gold unto the Silver, or by advancing the Silver\r\nunto the Gold.\r\nI. Concerning the first, Many are of opinion, that the\r\nProportion should be left as it is; for they say, Although our\r\nGold be very high priced, yet it answereth the weight of the\r\nKing's Ordinance, being continually weighed, and rejected if it\r\nbe not weighty. But our Silver is not so, being much lighter than\r\nthe King's Ordinance, the Silver be above 13 fine in Silver, for\r\none fine in Gold; yet in Practice, by reason of the lightness of\r\nthe Silver, the Proportion is much short of that. But they that\r\ngive this reason do not consider, that in this manner, although\r\nour Silver will remain still in use amongst us, as long as it\r\nlasteth, by reason of the lightness of it, yet of all that is new\r\ncoined according to this Ordinance, the weightest and loyallest\r\nwill be continually culled out, and transported, or melted: and\r\ntherefore since the Experience of the scarcity which we have of\r\nSilver doth sufficiently prove unto us the Inconvenience of the\r\nProportion, it ought to be altered. Others would have the\r\nProportion to be eleven or thereabouts, because that was the\r\nancient Proportion, both amongst us here in England, and amongst\r\nour Neighbours. But since that Proportion is under that of all\r\nour neighbours at this present, it would in time fall out\r\nthereupon that we should suffer as much scarcity of Gold as we do\r\nnow of Silver. But the most, and the most Judicious Propositions\r\nthat I have seen, both at home and in other parts, do agree upon\r\ntwelve for one, as the most equal Proportion; and it agrees with\r\nthe Proportion of Spain, upon which in this Subject, we ought\r\nprincipally to have our eye fixed: and for my part, I do the\r\nrather incline to this Proportion, because 12 of all the numbers\r\nis most proper for Money, being the most clear from fractions and\r\nConfusion of an Accompt, (which ought not to be neglected) by\r\nreason that of all other numbers it is most divisible, being\r\ndivisible into unities as all numbers are; into two parts as no\r\nodd number is; three parts as no even number is but six, and the\r\nnumbers that consist of sixes; fourths into which six is not\r\ndivisible; and into sixths: This Proportion seems like to square\r\nwith the Conceipt of the Alchymists, who call Gold Sol, and\r\nSilver Luna, whose Motions do come near upon the point of 12 for\r\n1, and the Conceipt of many men hath run so strongly upon the\r\nproportion of 12 for 1, that they'd have it hold as well in Money\r\nwrought, as in Gold or Silver fine, so as the Pieces of Silver\r\nand Gold should weight one the other; and 12 in Silver should\r\nanswer in value one of Gold.\r\nBut the Proportion cannot hold both in Money wrought, and\r\nSilver and Gold unwrought, except the Allay should be likewise\r\nmade equal, and then it follows that there should be 12 times as\r\nmuch over-value allowed to the Gold as to the Silver, which were\r\na rate beyond the present allowance, and would much weak'n the\r\nMoney of Gold in intrinsical value; yet that point doth justly\r\nmeet with the practice which in ancient time was in France, there\r\nbeing in an ancient Reglement of Moneys, this following Article,\r\nQue l'on face Monoye d'or a 23 carrats et rendra aux Merchans\r\nd'un Marc d'or fine, un Marc d'or ouvre, et Monoye a ladit loy.\r\nAnd by the same Reglement the Silver Money was made of 11 deniers\r\nand 12 grains fine, called Argent le Roy; and some others do find\r\nit a very subtile Inconvenience in the want of laying so many\r\ntimes a greater Charge and Tribute upon the Gold than upon the\r\nSilver, as the Gold doth exceed the Silver in value, proportion\r\nfor proportion; alledging that for one main reason, why the Gold\r\nis always raised and esteemed somewhat higher than the publick\r\nOrdinance, because the Gold Money is really so much more in value\r\nthan the Silver Money, according to their rates, by how much\r\nthere is less Charge and Tribute laid upon the Gold in proportion\r\nthan upon the Silver. But admitting the Objection made, that if\r\nthere should be 12 times as much charge laid upon the Gold as\r\nupon the Silver, it would be too great a discouragement to the\r\nMerchant to bring his Gold to be coined, it may easily be salved\r\nhere in England, according to the custom of our Mint, by making\r\nthe price of Gold fine unwrought, somewhat more than 12 for one,\r\nand allowing so unto the Merchant, leaving the charge the same,\r\nwhich now it is.\r\nFor the second point to wit, whether the Proportion should be\r\nsettled by raising the Silver in price unto the Gold, or by\r\nreducing the Gold unto the Silver.\r\nFirst, In speaking thereof, I do not mean to anticipate that\r\nQuestion, Whether if be beneficial for the Commonwealth, that the\r\nprices should at any time be raised or not? which is the proper\r\nSubject of another Chapter, and is indeed the most Importunate,\r\nand the most difficult Question of any other in matter of Money:\r\nAlthough it be true, that the raising one of the Materials of\r\nMoney doth produce all the inconveniences that are produced by\r\nraising of both the Materials which is not rais'd; yet in the\r\npresent Estate and Condition wherein our Silver doth now stand,\r\nwe shall find by the subsequent Discussion of this Question, that\r\nby the raising of the Silver to a more equal Proportion to our\r\nGold, these Inconveniences have no place.\r\nAnd First, If you shall abase the Gold to hold a proportion\r\nof 12 to 1 with the Silver, besides the general Objection against\r\nall Abasements, which is Exportation, there will this particular\r\nInconvenience follow, as we now stand, That you cannot abase it\r\nto the just Proportion without new coyning of all the Gold, which\r\nwill produce both an extream trouble and Confusion, and exceeding\r\nloss unto the Kingdom, and is by the Prescripts of many excellent\r\nRoman Emperors condemned, as savoring of Injustice and Envy\r\ntowards the memorie of precedent Princes to deface their Coins.\r\nAnd besides the scarcity of the Silver will still remain, for\r\ntheir continuing still so great a disproportion between the new\r\nSilver which shall be coyned according to the antient standard\r\nweighty and good, and the old Silver grown so much over-light,\r\npartly by the wearing, but especially by that culling out and\r\nexporting that which was coined either over-heavie, or of just\r\nweight; and that which coyned over-light only remaining; how will\r\nit be possible, but that so much of the new Silver which shall be\r\ncoined either of over-heavie, or of a just weight, will still be\r\nculled out, either to be transported, or to be melted down for\r\nother uses? If on the other side the Silver shall be coyned\r\nhereafter of a new standard answering to a proportion of 12 for\r\none of the Gold, as now it stands; the Merchant will be\r\nencouraged to bring more in, the reminting of the antient Money\r\nshall be avoided; and if that supposition be true, that the\r\nantient Silver be exported upon the raising of the new, neither\r\nwill the price of the things be raised, since the new Money\r\n(although in standard it differs) yet in truth of weight will\r\nhold so near a Proportion with the antient: and here it will be\r\nnecessary to observe the Examination which we have made in\r\nseveral places of this Treatise.\r\nFirst, In what Proportion, for the values of our Gold and\r\nSilver, it is most useful for this Kingdom to stand, in respect\r\nof our Neighbours neerest about us, and then examine how indeed\r\nwe do stand with them? Where I do find an exceeding great abuse,\r\nbecause those who do manage the affairs of the Mint do make their\r\nComputation of the Standard of Forrein Coins, meerly as the\r\nGold-Smiths do by melting of them: the error of which Computation\r\nwill easily be apprehended, if any man shall go about to discover\r\nthe sterling standard by melting of sterling money, the pieces\r\nwhereof being so unequally coyned, as they are the difference\r\nbetween a piece that is over-light, and again of a piece of the\r\nabsolute fineness of the standard, and another deficient the full\r\nextent of the Remedy allowed, will be so great, as whosoever\r\nshall compute the standard by the one or by the other, must needs\r\nrun into extream Error."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 9"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the Prohibition of Forrein Moneys, especially Spanish"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"It is the Opinion of wise men and intelligent in this Subject\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"of Money, that the Prohibition of forrein Moneys especially\r\nSpanish is a great hindrance to the coming in of Gold and Silver:\r\nand they do ground themselves upon two Arguments: --\r\nThe first, in reason, that Spain being the Cistern and\r\nReceptacle of almost all the gold and silver, which is thence\r\ndispersed into the rest of Europe, to forbid Spanish Money to be\r\ncurrent, is, in effect, to forbid the coming in of Gold and\r\nSilver, and that rather we ought to draw it in by setting an high\r\nprice upon it. The other Argument is out of the Example of other\r\nNations, which do abound with Moneys, where Spanish Money is not\r\nonly current, but it is current at higher rates then their own\r\nMoney, value for value, who have therefore more Spanish Money to\r\nbe made current. But before it be fit to resolve of that, it\r\nshould be first maturely considered, What reasons did induce the\r\nProhibition of all Forrein Coins, and how they may be satisfied,\r\nleast in seeking to salve one mischief we do introduce a greater,\r\nand do fall into the complaints of those Countries, which do crie\r\nout against the Inconveniences which they do feel by forrein\r\nMoneys, and know not how to remedie themselves. If you make\r\nforrein Moneys current but just at the rate of the intrinsical\r\nvalue you gain nothing, for they will as well be now brought in\r\nfor Bullion as then for Money; only this disadvantage you shall\r\nhave, that whereas that which is now brought in for Bullion, is\r\ngood and weighty, you shall instead thereof have the same\r\nquantity brought in for Money abased and light; which was one of\r\nthe many reasons why it was made not current. If you make forrein\r\nMoney current above the intrinsical value, allowing them an\r\nover-rate for charge of coyning and tribute to the Prince that\r\ncoined them; Observe then the inconveniences which follow upon\r\nit;\r\nFirst, The dishonour, in that you do communicate a principal\r\npoint of Soveraignty unto a Stranger, and you do pay a Tribute to\r\na forrein Prince out of your own Country, and you shall never\r\nhave any material Coin to be coined in your own Mint.\r\nSecondly, You shall fill the Country with light Money of\r\nSilver, which is hardly ever weighed, and with counterfeit and\r\nbase Money of Gold; the punishment whereof lieth not in your\r\nhands, the act being done in forrein parts and is so much clear\r\nloss to the Country.\r\nThirdly, You shall give the people occasion to raise it to a\r\nhigher rate than the publick Ordinance, which is an effect that\r\nfollows forrein Moneys in all those Countries where it is\r\npermitted; or if the people do not raise, yet strangers will\r\nraise it higher, and then it will go out faster than it came in,\r\nand you have gained this Inconvenience, to have it higher rais'd:\r\nthe mischief whereof I shall have more occasion to declare\r\nhereafter. But if forrein Money shall come to be current at an\r\nover-rate, to the intrinsical value, greater than your own, value\r\nfor value, as Spanish Money is both in France and in the Low\r\nCountries, and as English was in both, till it was discried and\r\nvalue only as Bullion; but daily varies the value in those parts,\r\nthen shall you give occasion to have the weightiest of your Money\r\nculled out and transported into forrein parts to be coined for\r\nAdvantage, to be brought back in forrein coin: but above all,\r\nyour materials in bullion of silver and Gold will be transported\r\nto that purpose, and the Common-wealth shall cheerly loose so\r\nmuch in substance of Gold and Silver, as the Transporter doth\r\nget; as for Example, In the years 1607 and 1608, our Jacobus\r\npieces were ordinarily current in Paris after the rate of 22s.\r\nwhen as three French Crowns, were current but after the rate of\r\n21s sterling: The Jacobus weighs 7 deniers and 20 grains, and is\r\n22 carrats fine. The French Crown sol, is 23 carrats fine bating\r\nthe Remedy, and weighs by the ordinance 2 deniers, 15 grains, so\r\nas three French Crowns full weight, weigh one grain more than a\r\nJacobus, and are worth one 24th part more in fineness, and yet\r\nwere current in France for 12d less than a Jacobus. The Jacobus\r\nwas worth in Holland after the rate of 15s sterling, in the years\r\n1621, and 1622; then was the Ryder there current, but after the\r\nrate of 22s sterling or little more, and yet the Ryder in\r\nintrinsical value is not two pence worse than the Jacobus. In the\r\nyear 1622, at the Mart at Francfort n Autumn, English shillings\r\nwere current at a higher rate, fineness for fineness, and weight\r\nfor weight, than their own Dollars coyned in that Town, so as in\r\nthese times there were great profit by transporting Dollars out\r\nof Francfort, Ryders out of Holland, and French Crowns out of\r\nFrance, and carrying them back again coined in English Coins; and\r\nthere is no doubt to be made, but that great Numbers were\r\naccordingly transported, the subtilty of the Bancquers not\r\nomitting any opportunity to make their Advantage of the popular\r\nErrors, which daily do exceed in this Subject of Money. But if\r\nthe Permission may be so qualified as the Usefullness may be\r\nretained, and yet the Dangers may be avoided therein. Now that\r\nthe Dangers may be avoided therein. Now that the Dangers are\r\nexposed, I do exhort all the furtherers of the Common good to\r\nexercise their Invention, as in all other Inconveniences\r\npropounded in this Subject. The most probable Proposition that I\r\ncan find, is that Spanish Money should be made current, but not\r\nthat any Realls of Silver or Pistolets of Gold should be current\r\nat any rate according to the price. But that the Spanish Money of\r\nGold and Silver should be made current according to a certain\r\nRate by the Ounce, which rate should be so proportioned, as that\r\nthe Spanish Money should have allowed unto it at one value, as\r\ngreat as may answer the charge of coinage, without allowing any\r\nthing for the King's Tribute, to draw it the easiest into the\r\nKingdom. By this means the Dishonour would be avoided for,\r\nalthough it would be frequently current amongst Merchants, and in\r\nall great payments, yet in Fairs and Markets and the Commerce\r\nwithin the Kingdom, it would have no place being not current by\r\nthe piece. And this defect of the Currencie of the pieces would\r\nmake a great part of them piece by piece drop into his Majesties\r\nMint. Especially if the Officers of the Mint use their endeavour\r\nto buy them for the use of the Mint: than it would necessarily\r\nkeep out all light Money, or if any were brought in, it would be\r\nwithout disadvantage to us. For,\r\nFirst, Upon our occasion of raising it, strangers could not\r\nraise it higher; both because it would be most concealed from\r\nthem, and they should not be able to proportion their raising to\r\nours, except they should take the same course, which is almost\r\nimpossible for them to do, who have Spanish Money in so great\r\nabundance already current by the piece.\r\nAnd lastly, not allowing to it a greater over-value than to\r\nyour own Money, it will be impossible to transports your own\r\nMoney for profit to bring it back coyned in Spanish Money. Others\r\nhave propounded that the Spanish Money both of Gold and Silver\r\nshould be made current by the piece, allowing an over-value unto\r\nit both for the Coinage and the King's Tribute equal unto our\r\nown, but that being of a weight allowable, it should receive the\r\naddition of a new stamp at the King's Mint, for which the King\r\nshould receive upon the pound, so much as his own clear Profit\r\namounts unto upon his own coin; and the Merchants in the currency\r\nof the pieces should have allowance of so much as the charge of\r\nthe Coinage amounts unto. But this inconvenience would probably\r\nhappen in this Proposition, that if the pieces that should have\r\nthe Addition of the stamp unto them, were made current at a\r\nprice, the people would likewise receive those that had not the\r\nsaid Addition at the same price."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 10"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the unequal Coinage of our Moneys"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"This Title doth wholly depend upon the Mechanical part of\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"making Money, which because I am unskilful in, I do handle with\r\nmuch scruple and retention, being forced to apply my self to what\r\nI read in others; and peradventure may in some points\r\nmisunderstand, yet because this is a very main and principal\r\ncause of the exportation of Money I cannot omit it: And the first\r\ncause of the unequality of the coinage, is the greatness of the\r\nRemedies both of the weight and fineness: and I do find that some\r\nmen of great experience and understanding even in this Mechanical\r\npart do hold, that the Money both of Gold and Silver may be made\r\nwithout any Remedy to be allowed either for weight or fineness.\r\nThis I am sure that it doth appear by the Records of former\r\ntimes, that the Remedies allowed have been many times less than\r\nnow they are, and have been heretofore very variable according to\r\nthe favour or the skill which the Masters of the Mint did use to\r\nmake their own Advantage: since Henry VIIths time, the Mint\r\nMasters have bin tied to account to the King for half the Profits\r\nof the Remedies allowed, by which means it is manifest that half\r\nthe Remedies allowed might be cut off, and the Kings profits\r\nmight be better recompenced upon the price of the Coinage. By the\r\nIndentures of the Second of King James, the Officers of the Mint\r\nare tied to account to the King for the whole profit of the\r\nRemedies; but then there is a clause that the King shall give\r\nthem allowance for so much as they shall over-put above the\r\nstandard, which clause seemeth to me very captious: But if all\r\nthe inequality of the Moneys coined did consist in the Remedies,\r\nthe matter were not so much; but the great profit which hath been\r\nmade by culling of the Coins by Goldsmiths and Cashiers to\r\nMerchants and others, through whose hands great Sums of Money do\r\npass, doth manifestly prove that the inequality of the Moneys is\r\nmuch greater than the allowance of the Remedies can make it; yet\r\nwhen I consider upon what great Penalties the Mint Master is\r\ntied, how exact a Course is set down by his Indenture, and\r\nobserv'd for the Examination and Trial of his work, I cannot\r\nimagine much less find out, where the Error lieth, but that there\r\nis an Error, and such an one as deserveth strict Enquiry and\r\nRedress by the State, I am verily perswaded. The Mint Master\r\nknoweth exactly how many pieces he is to sheer out of every pound\r\nweight, but whether these pieces are shorn so equal to one\r\nanother in weight, as there shall be no advantage in culling out\r\nthe heaviest from the lightest, that is the Scruple: The course\r\nis this, out of every proportion of Silver and Gold coined, there\r\nis a piece taken at adventure, by certain Officers trusted, and\r\nput into a Pix under their several Keys, and then at the years\r\nend, this Pix is opened in the Star Chamber, and telling out so\r\nmany pieces as are to make a pound, they melt them and examine\r\nwhether they hold the weight and fineness, within the Remedies\r\nrequired; which Course for the examination of the Fineness\r\nseemeth exact enough, but for the weight it may fall out that the\r\npieces taken out of the several Proportions of Money coined,\r\nbeing melted together may hold the weight required within the\r\nRemedies, and yet the pieces of those several Proportions may\r\ndiffer in weight from one another, more than the Remedy allowed.\r\nThe Remedies that are propounded for this inequality are divers:\r\nSome think that it may be redressed by a strict and severe\r\nCourse to be held with all those, through whose hands the work\r\ndoth pass for the perfection of their works.\r\nOthers are much pleased with belief of some invented Engines,\r\nwhich have been by some work-men offered for a more perfect and\r\nexact coining of Moneys, than can be performed by the stamp, and\r\nthe ways that are now practised.\r\nOthers find no so good way as by the Mill, whereof divers\r\nexperiments have been made both in this Kingdom and in other\r\nparts. Of which, because I dare in my self deliver no Opinion, I\r\nwill only translate what I find written by a French Author, a man\r\nof great practice and experience in these Mysteries, but because\r\nin some places he hath words of Art which admit of no\r\ntranslation, I must be fain use the original Terms: He saith,\r\nThat against the Establishment of the Mill it is objected, that\r\nafter the Invention of it, by reason of the great clipping that\r\nbelongs to it; the Conductor of it was of Necessity to have an\r\nAugmentation for the Workmanship.\r\n2. That the Ressorts, and Wheels, and Squares and Pieces, by\r\nwhich it is governed, are very subject to break and bruise one\r\nanother.\r\n3. That it wants Expedition, and dispatches but a little\r\nwork.\r\n4. That makers of false Money will easily counterfeit it.\r\n5. That no man will undertake to make Money with the Mill,\r\nbut at the same price which is paid for the marks for Silver\r\nCounters made with a Mill.\r\nTo which fie objections I answer.\r\n1. That the quantity of Clipping Mill Money, is no loss to\r\nthe Farmer nor to the Workman, and is done without pain, charge\r\nor travel; besides the Charge of the wasting is taken away, which\r\nis both an expence to the Master and to the Farmer: That the\r\naugmentation for the workmanship was not allowed for the new\r\nmelting of the Clippings, but because there was no reason that\r\nthe Masters of the Mill should without recompence give those\r\nseveral fashions to the work, which the work-man is paid for, and\r\nhath 3 sols allowed him upon the mark, and besides furnish great\r\nCizers, three sorts of Hammers, Anvil and other Instruments. Now\r\nthe Money being made in the Mill by the industry of the Master\r\nwho doth give other like fashions to the work, as the Minters now\r\ndo, it was but reason to attribute the same right unto him. And\r\nin those places where Mill-Money hath remained in use, as at Pau\r\nand at Bearne, the fee of the work-man is attributed to the\r\nMaster of the Mill, as likewise of the Carver and Graver, and\r\nthat very justly.\r\n2. For the Second Objection, that the Ressorts, Wheels,\r\nSquares, etc. are subject to breaking; It may be answered that at\r\nthe new setting up of the first Mills, the Artisans were not so\r\nperfect and expert as they have shewed themselves since by\r\nPractice, since the Mills are grown common as now they are: There\r\nis nothing harder than to invent, nor more easie than to adde to\r\nthings invented. There are Mills set up not only at Paris, but at\r\nLyons, Tholouse, Aix, Amiens, Nants, Bordeaux, Poitiers, so that\r\nthe use of them is now universal, for the Coinage doubles base\r\nand abject Money.\r\n3. For the third Objection, That there is no Expedition in\r\nMills, and that the work is not so soon dispatched as with the\r\nHammer: It shall suffice to answer, That it proceeds from a Man\r\nthat hath no experience in this Subject of Money, because that\r\nfour Men bred and used to the making of Money in a Mill will do\r\nmore work than twelve work-men or Moneyers with the Hammer.\r\n4. For the fourth Objection, That the Counterfeiter of Money\r\nwill imitate the Money made in a Mill: this objection were\r\ncredible if the author could produce one piece of Silver or Gold\r\nmade in the Mill counterfeited since the Introduction thereof\r\nbrought into France; and there is nothing that the counterfeiters\r\nof Money and their foster Fathers the Alchymists, do more fear\r\nand apprehend, knowing that they cannot suborn base and abject\r\nmettals, as Copper, Lead, Tinn, (the materials of Counterfeiters)\r\nfor Gold and Silver, but that the piece will instantly be\r\ndiscovered, because the Moneys made in the Mill will always be\r\nequal and of like volume, greatness and thickness, because it all\r\npasseth by the same Coupier which cutteth equally, which cannot\r\nbe the case with the Moneys made with the Hammer, (the Hammer not\r\nbeing governed with an equal force and measure, as in the Mill.)\r\nNeither can they be clipped, but that the exposer thereof will be\r\ndiscovered, taken and punished. And it may be avowed that the\r\nTeston made in the Mill hath not been seen clipped in France, the\r\nperfect representation of the King's Image seeming to have been\r\nretained, and terrified the Clippers.\r\n5. As for the last Objection, That no man will undertake to\r\nmake Money in the Mill, but at the rate which is paid for the\r\nmark of the Silver Counters: This objection proceeds out of\r\nIgnorance, because, the matter of Silver Counters is Argent le\r\nRoy, and therefore of greater fineness than the Money, and\r\nrequires a greater charge to refine it to that title and degree.\r\nBesides the maker of Silver Counters must have a great diversity\r\nof Chisels, and Prints of a different sort from those of Moneys,\r\nand almost as many as there be different Noble men, Corporations,\r\nand Townhouses, that take pleasure to have their Arms or Devises\r\nengraven in Silver or Copper Counters; whereof sometimes the very\r\nsquare will cost 20 Livres, which shall serve only for one purse\r\nof two marks of Counters; and for proof thereof let the Masters\r\nof the Mills for coining of Doubles be called, and he will\r\nundertake for the same wages and fees that the Moniers have, to\r\nmake the Moneys in the Mill.

I intend to prove that this increase of price\r\nand Proportion is not meerly according to the raising of the\r\nMoney, which hath bin since that, and is about the rate of three\r\nfor one, as the Money hath been raised, for then the price and\r\nproportion should be only nominally, and not really encreased,\r\nfor that if we pay now 3s. for that which in the 25th year of\r\nEdward the Third cost but 1s. and if we pay now 3 Crowns for that\r\nwhich cost then but one; yet if then there was as much fine Gold\r\nin one Crown as now there is in 3, the price should only be\r\nincreased in name; but the proportion between gold and silver,\r\nand the things valued by them, would remain the same. But I\r\nintend to prove that this increase of Proportion hath bin real,\r\nand that the price of things in general is now grown six times as\r\nmuch or eight times as much as then they cost, in name of\r\nShillings, Crowns and Pounds and in reality of fine Gold and\r\nSilver, to double, and almost treble the Proportion of all\r\nthings, valued by Gold and Silver, in respect of what it was in\r\nthe 25th year of Edward the Third. Then I intend to prove that\r\nthis real increase of Proportion, by which all things valued by\r\nMoney, are valued at more than double, almost treble, the\r\nquantity of fine Silver and Gold, than then they were, is grown\r\nprincipally, and in a manner solely, out of the great quantities\r\nof Gold and Silver come into the Kingdom of Spain out of the West\r\nand East-Indies, within this Hundred years or thereabouts, and\r\nthence dispersed into other parts of the World, whereby it is\r\ncome to pass that the value of Gold and Silver is become more\r\nvile and cheap; and generally all things valued by them, are\r\nrated higher, at double and almost treble as much Gold and silver\r\nas they were rated at in the 25th year of Edward III or\r\nthereabouts; as one Scale pres't down doth necessarily make the\r\nother rise higher: From those Proportions it will necessarily\r\nfollow that if the Kingdom of England should have at this day as\r\nmuch Gold and Silver in fineness and weight, or peradventure half\r\nas much more, as it had in the 25th year of Edward the Third; yet\r\nbecause the increase of the Proportion between Gold and Silver\r\nand the things valued by them is so much greater than it was\r\nthen, to wit, above double and almost treble; that the Kingdom of\r\nEngland is so much poorer and more disabled than it was then, by\r\nhow much it wants of that quantity of Gold and Silver, which may,\r\nin Proportion to things valued by them, countervail the quantity\r\nwhich then was in England, and this great Mischief and Disability\r\ndoth not only hold in the present Stock, but in the Fruit and\r\ngrowing Wealth of the Kingdom.\r\nLastly, Having discovered this great Evil, the Danger whereof\r\nis not apprehended as it deserves, together with the Causes of\r\nit, I intend to set down what Remedies are propounded unto it.\r\nNow when I shall compare the Prices of things at this day\r\nwith those of antient times, if I should go to set down all\r\nthings particularly the Labour and Search were beyond measure,\r\nand the variety of the Proportions of prices would not be very\r\ngreat between several things, but the same things in several\r\nseasons would exceedingly differ in price, and the proofs, would\r\nbe very disputable so as no certain conclusion would be drawn\r\nfrom them: as for Example, of Corn, Cattel, and Fish, the\r\nProportions of price would not hold the same, and every of these\r\nwould differ in several seasons for several causes; as Corn\r\nthrough unseasonable weather, Cattle through murraign, Fish\r\nthrough Warr; and every one of these through many other accidents\r\nare able to raise or draw down the price again: Cloth, Linnen,\r\nLeather, and such like, would have the like variety of prices\r\nthrough the same, and through other causes, as through\r\nImpositions laid upon them, new Inventions, whereby the\r\nManufactures may be the more easily and speedily made, engrossing\r\nof them, false making of them, want of work-men.\r\nAnd if these things, which are most necessary for man's life,\r\nare subject to so many varieties of Prices through several\r\ncauses; how much more uncertain would those Materials prove,\r\nwhich serve only to delights and magnificence, as precious\r\nStones, Pearls, Hangings, Pictures, Embroideries, and such like;\r\nwhich are subject to so many causes of varieties of price, as\r\nthings necessarie, and are moreover subject to the Humours and\r\nFancies of the Times, by which their price is raised or abased.\r\nBut there is only one thing, from whence we may certainly\r\ntrack out the prices, and which carries with it a constant\r\nresultance of the Prices of all other things which are necessary\r\nfor a Mans life; and that is the price of Labourers and Servants\r\nWages, especially those of the meaner sort. And as there is to be\r\nfound no other certain and constant Cause of the raising of the\r\nPrices of all things, but two; viz. the one the raising of the\r\nvalues of Moneys, the other the great abundance of Gold and\r\nsilver coming into these parts, in this latter age, out of the\r\nIndies: And although the hire of Labourers did continually rise\r\n(when Money was raised), yet it did rise so much and no more, as\r\nits value was raised; but after the Discoverie of the Indies, you\r\nshall finde the price of the Labourers wages raised in Proportion\r\nfar exceeding the raising of Moneys, and therefore, for my part,\r\nI am certainly perswaded that as long as the values of Moneys are\r\nraised, and the Indies do yield that abundance of Gold and Silver\r\nwhich they do, that both the hire of Labourers, and generally the\r\nprice of all things, especially of things necessary for life,\r\nwill rise, although for a year, two or three, through uncertain\r\nAccidents, sundry particulars may stand at a stay or abate: But\r\nthat the hire of Labourers and Servants carrieth with it a\r\nresultance of the prices of all things generally necessary for a\r\nmans life: Besides, that Reason doth convince that there must be\r\na convenient Proportion between their Wages and their Food and\r\nRaiment, the Wisdom of the Statute doth confirm it, which doth\r\nalways direct the Rate of Labourers and Servants to be made with\r\na regard of Prices of Victuals, Apparel, and other things\r\nnecessary to their use. In the 25th year of Edward the Third, it\r\nwas provided that in time of Hay-making, none should pay above\r\nour penny in the day; that for threshing of one quarter of Wheat\r\nor Rye, none should pay above 2 1/2 d., and for threshing of a\r\nquarter of Oats, Barly, Beans and Pease, above one penny half\r\npenny; that a Master Carpenter shall have 3 pence, another\r\nCarpenter but 2d. a day; a Master free-Mason but 4 pence, a Tyler\r\n3 pence; but either of their servants, a penny half penny: all\r\nthis is in the summer time, for in the Winter wages lessened, and\r\nwithout meat or drink, or any other courtesie, and that in the\r\nCountry, where Wheat was wont to be given, they shall take for\r\nthe Bushel ten pence, or Wheat at the will of the Giver.\r\nIn the Twelvth year of Richard the Second these Rates did\r\nstill continue (so likewise the Money did still continue the same\r\nin goodness) but there was further added like wise a yearly rate\r\nfor Servants wages; and there was allowed by the year for a\r\nBailiff 13s. 4 pence, with a Livery: a Master Hind was rated at\r\n10s. a Carter at 10s. a Shepheard at 10s. an Ox-heard or\r\nCow-heard at 6s. 8d. a Driver of a Plough at 7s. at the most: and\r\nall these but the Bailiff, without cloathing or other courtesie.\r\nIn the Thirteenth of Richard the Second, It was provided that the\r\nJustices of the Peace might rate the Day-labourers according to\r\nthe dearth of Victuals, which seemed to have growth through some\r\naccidental Dearth, which then happened: in the Thirteenth of\r\nHenry the Fourth there was raising of Moneys to about the 6th\r\npart more, by Advice in Parliament, but there was no new Rate for\r\nServants Wages, until the sixth of Henry the Sixth,the price of\r\nthings growing higher by reason of the raising of Moneys: It was\r\nprovided by Statute that the Justices of the Peace might rate as\r\nwell the Hire of day labourers as the Wages of Servants,as they\r\nshould find fit in the Sessions, notwithstanding the former\r\nStatute of the 25th of Edward the Third, and 12th of Richard the\r\nSecond, and notwithstanding the Money had not been raised above a\r\nsixth part, which I attribute to the great want of Servants and\r\nLabourers, the Kingdom being then exceedingly exhausted by the\r\nlong continuance of the Wars in France: but in the 49th of Henry\r\nthe Sixth Money was exceedingly raised, so as a pound of Sterling\r\nGold made 22l. 10s. and a pound of Sterling Silver together was\r\nhalf as much more as they were valued, in the 25th of Edward the\r\nThird.\r\nIn the 11th of Henry the Seventh (c. 22) there was a new\r\nStatute for the rating of Servants wages and the hire of\r\nday-laborers, which in a manner doth agree with the 23rd of Henry\r\nthe Sixth: but I find this almost only difference between them,\r\nthat by the 23rd of Henry the Sixth, the Meat and Drink of the\r\nDay-labourer is valued but three halfpence, but by the 11th of\r\nHenry the Sixth, the Pound of sterling Gold being (then brought\r\nfrom 16l. 13s. 4d. to 22 l. 10s. 0d. and the silver from 30s to\r\n37 s 6d.: From the 11th of Henry the Seventh until the 6th of\r\nHenry the Eight, there was no new Rate upon hire of Labourers or\r\nServants wages: but that year there was a new Statute, which\r\nnotwithstanding was little or nothing different in the Rates from\r\nthe former, except in some Particulars which are not pertinent to\r\nthis Inquiry.\r\nSo likewise hitherto did the value of the King's Money remain\r\nthe same, and so continued until the 18th of Henry the Eight,\r\nwhen the Commission was given for the Alteration of the Coins to\r\nCardinal Wolsey, which brought in great Confusions among the\r\nvalues of Money, which together with the excessive quantities of\r\nGold and Silver, which about those times began to be brought into\r\nChristendom out of the West Indies, were the occasion that the\r\nStatutes for Labourers and Servants were no further observed\r\nbecause the prices of all things being much inhansed, Labourers\r\nand Servants could not live upon their Hire and Wages ordained by\r\nthe Statute: and this is acknowledged in the Preamble of the\r\nStatute of the 5th of Q. Elizabeth (which is the next Statute for\r\nthe rating of Servants and Labourers wages, after the 6th of\r\nHenry the Eighth) by which Statute all former Statutes for\r\nLabourers and Servants are repealed, and an exact Course set down\r\nhow the Rates for the Wages of Servants, and Hire of Labourers\r\nshall hereafter be set down by the Justices of Peace, in\r\nSessions, having regard to the price of victuals, and other\r\nthings for maintenance: so having thus deduced the Rates of\r\nServants and Labourers from time to time. It remaineth now only\r\nthat I examine some of the late Rates set down in the Counties\r\nAdjacent, and compare them with those of the 25th of Edward the\r\nThird, and 12th of Richard the Second, and that I do calculate\r\nhow much these later Rates do exceed the Ancient: and deducted\r\nfrom the later Rates do exceed the Ancient: and deducting from\r\nthe later Rates so much as the values of the Moneys of Gold and\r\nSilver hath been raised, which induceth rather a nominal than a\r\nreal Increase of the price, it will follow, That whatsoever\r\nincrease hath been more of the Rates, that it hath grown from the\r\ngreat quantities of Gold and Silver brought into Spain out of the\r\nIndies, within these Hundred years.\r\nIn the Statute of 25th of Edward the Third, the threshing of\r\na Quarter of Wheat or Rye, is rated at ijd. ob. By the Rate, in\r\nMiddlesex, of the 17th of King James, which is the last Rate made\r\nthere, the Threshing of a quarter of Wheat is eighteen pence,\r\nwhich is above seven times as much as in the old Statute; the\r\nstone, either of Wheat or Rye in Essex by the rate now in force\r\nis 16d which is above six for one, wherein it is to be observed\r\nthat in that they shall give more: and yet we know that the\r\nBushel, and consequently the Quarter in many of the remoter\r\nsheirs containeth half as much more as in these Counties near\r\nunto London. The threshing of a quarter of Barley, Oats, Pease,\r\nor Beans, by the Statute of 25th of Edw. the Third, is rated at 1\r\n1/2 d. ob; but by the said Rate in Middlesex the quarter of\r\nBarley is rated at 10d and Beans and Peas at nine pence, which,\r\nby a medium comes to be between six and seven times as much. And\r\nby the said rate in Essex they are rated at ten pence and eight\r\npence which by a medium, comes to six times as much; and in this\r\nlikewise the aforesaid Observation of the difference of the\r\nmeasure doth hold.\r\nBy the said Statute of 25th Edward III it is provided that in\r\ntime of Hay making none shall pay above a penny for hay making,\r\nbut by the said rate in Middlesex, the hire of a man a day for\r\nhay-making is 10 pence, for a woman viii pence, and by the same\r\nrate in Essex, the hire of a man is rated at xii pence, and the\r\nhire of a woman at ix pence, which, by the medium, is ten times\r\nas much as the old rate. By the said Statute of 25th Edward III\r\nthe work of a master Carpenter is rated at iii pence a day, a\r\nsecond Carpenter ii pence, a Tyler iii pence, and the Servant of\r\neither of them one penny half penny, in the Summer time, without\r\nmeat or drink or any other courtesie. By the said rate of\r\nMiddlesex (17th James I) master Carpenters and Tylers are rated\r\nat xx pence a day, which accounteth to near seven times the old\r\nrate. The second sort of the said work men at 16 pence a day,\r\nwhich amounteth unto 8 times the old; and Labourers of the best\r\nsort at 12 pence a day, of the second sort at ten pence a day,\r\nwhich, by medium, is neer eight times the old rate. By the said\r\nrate in Essex, Master Carpenters and Tylers are rate at 16 pence\r\na day, which is not six times the old rate, their Servants 12\r\npence, which is eight times the old rate.\r\nIt is said in the said Statute of 25th of Edward III that in\r\nthose Counties where wheat was wont to be given for work, they\r\nshould take ten pence for the bushel or Wheat at the will of the\r\nGiver, by which clause it appeareth that 10 pence was then a\r\nlarge price, even in those Counties where the Bushel was bigger,\r\nor else it had been a great Rigour to leave it to the will of the\r\nGiver.\r\nBy the Statute of the 12th Richard the Second, the yearly\r\nwages of a Bayliff was rated at thirteen shillings and four\r\npence, and by the aforesaid rate in Essex the wages of a Bayliff\r\nis rated at three pounds three shillings and eight pence, which\r\nis (near) five times the old Rate. By the said Statute of 12 R. a\r\nmaster Hind is rated at ten shillings, a Carter at ten shillings,\r\na Shepheard at ten shillings, an Ox-heard at six shillings and\r\neight pence, a Cowheard at six shillings and eight pence. By the\r\nsaid Rate in Middlesex Carters are rated five pound wages, which\r\nis ten times the old rate. By the said rate in Middlesex the best\r\nsort of Plough-men, Carters, or Shepheards are rated at three\r\npound. The second sort of Hinds and all Servants in Husbandry at\r\ntwo pound six shillings and eight pence, which amounteth in the\r\nfirst, to six times the old rate, and in the second to seven\r\ntimes the old rate; a woman labourer or Dairy woman by the said\r\nStatute at Six shillings. By the said rate in Middlesex, the best\r\nwomen servants are rated at forty shillings a year, the second\r\nsort at thirty three shillings and fourpence, which by medium\r\namounts to six times the old rate, and somewhat more; and by the\r\nsaid rate in Essex, the best women are rated at thirty three\r\nshillings and four pence, the second sort at one pound six\r\nshillings and eight pence, which by a medium amounts to five\r\ntimes the old Rate.\r\nAnd if any many shall object, That the present rates will\r\nnot, generally through the whole Kingdome, hold thus high, though\r\nthey are thus rated in the parts near adjoyning to London:\r\nIt may be answered. That by the old Statutes it was provided,\r\nthat in no place any higher rates than these should be given; but\r\nthey might give less, where less in former times had been used to\r\nbe given.\r\nBut on the other side it may be much more probably objected,\r\nThat the rates are now greater than they are here set down,\r\nbecause it is not so strictly observed as it should be; whereas\r\nwhen the old Statutes were first made it is probable that that\r\nthe Rates were with the largest, and were more strictly observed\r\nthan they now are: and although this computation of the wages and\r\nhire of Servants and Labourers be (as I conceive) the most\r\ncertain way of comparison of the prices of all things between\r\nthat time of King Edward the third and this present; yet for\r\nConfirmation I will add unto it another Observation, wherein we\r\nshall find the same Proportion to hold in a Subject much more\r\ngeneral, and therefore so exactly calculated. But therein I must\r\nappeal to the well grounded Judgment of my Reader, and that is\r\nthat I will set down the entire receipts as I find them by\r\nundoubted Records of divers years of Edward the Third; and then I\r\nwill briefly represent the actions of War in the said years,\r\nbesides the ordinary expence and the said actions of War could be\r\nnow maintained, but by a Proportion so much larger as the rates\r\nof wages are now encreased, which I compute between six and eight\r\ntimes as much a they were in the 19th year of Edward the third.\r\nThe whole receipts of the Kingdom, as appeareth by the Pell\r\nof the Introitus amounted to 72,826 pound 11 shillings 5 pence;\r\nin that year the King sent over six hundred men of Arms, and six\r\nhundred Archers into Gascoign, under the Conduct of the Earl of\r\nDerby, and divers other great Lords, who gathering unto them the\r\nother Garrisons, did not only maintain a body of an Army in the\r\nfield a great part of that year, but recovered divers Towns by\r\nSiege: all that year the King did likewise maintain some\r\nauxiliary forces of good importance, the Number is not set down,\r\nfor the aid of the Duke of Brittany under the Command of Sir\r\nThomas Dayworth. And that Year the King likewise made a voyage in\r\ngreat magnificence into Flanders, and continued there long in\r\nTreaty with Jacques van Arteveld and the Flemings, to withdraw\r\nthem from the Homage of their Earl unto his Allegience. The 20th\r\nyear of Edward the Third, the whole Revenues of the Kingdom in\r\nthe Pell, amounted to 154,139 pound, 17 shillings 5 pence. This\r\nyear the same forces were maintain'd in Gascoign, which did\r\nfreely ransack and spoil all Xaintong and Poitou, by the favour\r\nof the Kings great Victories elsewhere.\r\nAnd in July the King went over in person, and landed in\r\nNormandy, and wasted a great part of that Province, and ransacked\r\nmany of the principal Towns: his forces transported thereto, are\r\nby Hollingshead reckoned 4,000 men at Arms, and 10,000 Archers,\r\nbesides a great Number of Footmen, but not defined. In the end of\r\nSummer he fought that famous Battel of Cressey; and in the\r\nbeginning of Winter did set his Siege before Calais. This Year\r\nlikewise was the King of Scots taken prisoner at the Battel of\r\nDurham, by the Queen: The 21st year of his Reign his Receipts\r\namounted unto 226,113 pound, five shillings and five pence;\r\nalmost all this year the King continued his Siege before Calais,\r\nhaving reinforced his Army, both out of England and Gascoign, and\r\nkept the Sea by his own Shipping and the Easterlings; and in the\r\nend of the year, notwithstanding that the King of France having\r\nassembled all his Puissance, sought to rescue it, the Town was\r\nyielded, and an English Colony transported thither, and Victuals\r\nbesides; all this year the King continued his auxiliary forces in\r\nBrittany with great success.\r\nNow if King Edward the Third had with his Revenue furnished\r\nout Money for these great actions of War, besides the\r\nMagnificence of his own house and other necessary expences of his\r\nKingdom, I do appeal to the Judgment of the Reader whether the\r\nordinary expences of the King's house, and other necessary things\r\nwithin his Kingdom, and the like actions of War could be\r\nmaintained (not speaking of the success) at this day with any\r\nfrugality without any other increase of comings in, equal in\r\nProportion to the increase of the hire of Labourers and Servants\r\nwages; which I compute at six times or rather at 8 times as much\r\nas then it was. And I am sure that whosoever shall exactly weigh\r\nall Circumstances, shall find that of the two, this latter\r\ncomparison will exceed the former.\r\nHaving thus, with as much exactness as possible I can, and I\r\nconceive is incident to this subject, made proof of the\r\nProportion between Gold and Silver and the things valued by them,\r\nas it now stands compared with what it antiently was; and namely\r\nin the 25th year of Edward the Third; the next that I have\r\nundertaken to prove, is, that the different Proportion which is\r\nreally grown between Gold and Silver, and the things valued by\r\nthem, doth principally and indeed solely arise of the grat\r\nquantities of the said Mettals, which in these hundred years was\r\nbrought out of the East and West-Indies. Now although there be\r\nmany other causes which may produced this effect, as Scarcity or\r\nAbundance of the things valued by Money, War, Depopulation, and\r\nall other Accidents, by which, either these Mettals are\r\nexhausted, or the things valued by them are consumed or made less\r\nuseful; yet, as before is shewed, all those are temporary and\r\nsubject to continual variety up and down, and therefore cannot be\r\nthe causes of a constant effect as this is. And, as for the\r\ncontinual variety up and down, and therefore cannot be the causes\r\nof a constant effect as this is. And, as for the continual\r\nraising of the values of Moneys, it is formerly shewed, that\r\nreally that breeds no disproportion between Gold and Silver and\r\nthe things valued by them; but only it breeds an alteration in\r\nthe Proportion between the species of Money, so named, as Pounds,\r\nCrowns, Shillings, etc. and the things valued by them; and\r\naccordingly in the Examination of the Rates of the hire of\r\nServants and Labourers, it might be observed that it punctually\r\narises according to the raising of the value of Moneys, until the\r\ndiscovery of the West Indies, and the navigation of the\r\nEast-Indies, which have brought in so great a glut of these\r\nmettals. There is no other constant cause to produce the real\r\ndisproportion, but only the abundance of Gold and Silver, by\r\nwhich of necessity they must grow cheaper and abased in their\r\nvalue. A certain Author who wrote about the year 1620, doth\r\ncalculate, that in the space of 100 per year there was at that\r\ntime brought into Spain and Portugal 900 Milions of Pezoes, worth\r\nsix shillings and sixpence sterling a piece in Gold and Silver;\r\nwhich calculation doth seem to be excessive amounting to nine\r\nmillions every year of Gold and Silver out of the Indies, of all\r\nwhich infinite Summ, not one jot did come into these parts in\r\nformer times out of the West Indies, and very little or nothing\r\nout of the East: how is it then possible but that it must abase\r\nthe value of the Mettals?\r\nAnd if it be said that we waste this excessive supply in our\r\nexcesses of Luxurie, as in Guildings, Embroideries, Inlayings,\r\nand the like, so as the mass of the said Mettals increaseth not;\r\nit is answered, That neither were former times exempt from those\r\nvanities; neither are they now sufficient to consume the greatest\r\nProportion of this stock.\r\nAnd if it be objected that the greatest part of the Stock is\r\ndrayned away every year to the Eastern Countries:\r\nIt is answered, That this is only true of Silver; and yet the\r\nSilver cannot be so drained away, but that a great part doth\r\nremain in Europe. Now if the Rate of things valued by Money be\r\nsix times as great as it was in 25th of Edward the Third,allowing\r\nthe values of Moneys to be raised to treble what they then were\r\nby the same names, yet there will be a real Increase of a double\r\nProportion, yet there will be a real Increase of a double\r\nProportion, to what then was of gold and Silver in weight and\r\nfineness, to things valued by them; and if the rate be raised to\r\neight times what it then was, the real increase of the Proportion\r\nwill be almost treble to what it then was.\r\nTo understand the whether this Kingdom be now of the same\r\nWealth and Ability which then it was: We must find out whether\r\nthere be now double or treble the quantity of Gold and silver in\r\nweight and fineness in this Kingdom which then was, and whether\r\nthe fruits and growing wealth of the Kingdom will produce double\r\nand almost treble the quantity of Gold, in weight and fineness,\r\nto what it then did. I am absolutely perswaded that we shall fail\r\nof it very much, of which the most certain and assured proof were\r\nto calculate for so many years together the quantity of Gold and\r\nSilver coined in those days; and then by a medium to compare it\r\nwith so many years in these times; though this proof were not\r\ndemonstrative, but probable.\r\nBut in those days the Mint was kept at Calais, as well as in\r\nthe Tower, and much more of the Money of this Kingdom was coined\r\nthere than here, the Records whereof are all lost and dissipated.\r\nBut that our Wealth doth not answer that increase of\r\nProportion at this day, I will endeavour to satisfie the Reader\r\nby two Arguments; the one drawn from the Abundance or Scarcity of\r\nGold and silver; the other from an Effect of it.\r\nFor the first it is this, I have alwayes understood it to be\r\nobserved by all men intelligent and practised in matters of\r\nTrade, that although all Commodities in general are raised in\r\nprice, in comparison of what they antiently were, yet in general\r\nthat our domestick Commodities are not raised answerable in\r\nproportion to Forrein. Now we have a very small quantity of\r\nSilver produced within our own Countrey, and of Gold none at all,\r\nso that the Stock of these Mettals is in a manner raised wholly\r\nout of the over-ballance of our domestick Commodities with\r\nforrein: it then ours do not rise in price from what antiently\r\nthey did bear proportionable unto Forrein, it is a strong\r\nArgument to prove that our Stock of these Mettals does not\r\nincrease in a Proportion answerable to the increase of the Price\r\nof other things valued by Money.\r\nThe second Argument is from the Effect; now one of the\r\ngreatest Effects of the abundance of Gold and Silver, is, the\r\nAbility which the Kingdom hath to set forth and maintain great\r\nactions of War in forrein parts: then let us set forth before our\r\neyes the many and great Armies which Edward the Third did raise\r\nand maintain both of Strangers and his own Subjects in the first\r\nyear of his Warrs against France, and withal let us take into our\r\nconsideration the Calculation made, in Anno   by expert\r\nCommissioners, of the charge of one Army to be raised,\r\ntransported, and maintained for one year, in Forrein Countries,\r\n25,000 Foot and Horse, and proportionable Artillery, which doth\r\naccount unto    and then I doubt not but that every mans own\r\nConscience will convince him that at this day the Kingdom is not\r\nable to maintain the like actions in forrein parts which then it\r\ndid: and yet at that time there were forces maintained against\r\nScotland; a great part of the Realm was imployed upon Monks and\r\nFriers improfitable members; besides the substance of a great\r\npart of the Wealth of the Kingdom (drawn of) by the See of Rome:\r\nand the trade of the Kingdom was in no comparison so great as it\r\nis now, and this is an undoubted Effect of this truth, That the\r\nincrease of our stock of gold and Silver is not in a Proportion\r\nanswerable to the increase of the price of other things valued by\r\nMoney; neither can there be any other analogical reason given of\r\nthe present disability but this, That although that we do draw\r\nsome drops of this Indian spring, whereof Spain is the Cistern,\r\nyet we do draw them at the second hand, we draw them upon hard\r\nterms and conditions, and we do not draw them neer in that\r\nProportion as the prices of all things do arise upon our hands,\r\nby the great increase of those Mettals; and the consequence of\r\nthis hath more advanced the affairs of Spain in these times than\r\ncan be imagined, for that hereby all the other States of Europe\r\nhave bin abated half in half. I will propound France for Example,\r\nwhich Kingdom notwithstanding draweth much more Money out of\r\nSpain than we do, by reason that the French consume little of the\r\nSpanish commodities, make the return of their own for a great\r\npart in Gold and Silver.\r\nThe Author of the Denier Royal undertaketh to prove that St.\r\nLewis in France, who was contemporary with Henry the Third of\r\nEngland, whose whole Revenues in those days amounted not unto\r\n300,000 French livres, did notwithstanding in Proportion to all\r\nthings valued by Money, raise more out his Kingdom than Lewis the\r\nthirteenth who now reignth, and whose Revenue amounteth, unto\r\n3,600,000 pound sterling.\r\nAnd although he bringeth such Arguments and Authorities for\r\nhis assertions, as for my part, I cannot see how they can be\r\nanswered: yet the difference is so great that I could hardly\r\nassent to his Conclusion, were it not for this reason. In the\r\ntime of St. Lewis, Provence, Dauphiny, Gascoign, Brittany and\r\nother parts were distracted from the Crown of France, and yet did\r\nhe transport such Armies and maintain them so long in the Holy\r\nLand, Egypt and Affrick, besides the payment of an excessive\r\nRansom to the Mammalukes for his Liberty, as this present King\r\nwas not able to do the like, though his Revenue were three times\r\nas much as it is, of which there can be no other cause answerable\r\nto the effect, but the excessive increase of the price of all\r\nthings, more than the increase of Gold and Silver in the Kingdom.\r\nAnd if these Kingdoms of England and France are so much impaired\r\nin ability by this Means, how much more must those Kingdoms be\r\ndisabled which are more remote, and draw these Mettals from Spain\r\nbut at a second or third hand: I am perswaded that the\r\nconsequence of this hath more advanced the affairs of Spain in\r\nthese later times than the success of their Armys: neither can\r\nany other Remedy be propounded to this Mischief but one, which is\r\nto fetch these materials of Money from the fountain it self. And\r\nfor my part I do confidently believe that future times will find\r\nno part of the Story of this Age so strange, as that all the\r\nother States of Europe have endured this ruinous Inconvenience\r\nwith so great Indifference, or rather Stupidity, so long, and\r\nthat they have not combined together to enforce a liberty of\r\nTrade in the West Indies; the restraint whereof is against all\r\nJustice, Trade being de Communi Jure an appendant of Peace, and\r\nagainst the Example of former Ages.\r\nIt is true, that the Romans who of all other Nations were\r\nmost advantageous in their publick Contracts, did enjoyn the\r\nCarthaginians, that they should not sail beyond certain\r\nPromontaries with their vessels of War, but never debarred\r\nCommerce and Trade into any parts.\r\nAnd the Muscovites and those of China, who forbid all Access\r\nunto Strangers in their Dominions, do notwithstanding permit all\r\nFairs and Markets in their parts and entries of their Countries\r\nfor commerce with other Nations, with whom they have no\r\nCapitualations of Peace.\r\nBut the Spaniards and Portugals do not only forbid all access\r\nand commerce to the West and East Indies within their Dominions,\r\nbut do define and bound their Dominions, in a manner unheard of\r\nto all former Ages, and with an arrogancy more than humane; for\r\nwhereas all other Nations, since the World began, have claimed\r\nand denominated their Dominions either from their own possession\r\nor the possession of their Ancestors, the Spaniards and\r\nPortugals, in a contrary way, draw certain imaginary Mathematical\r\nlines through Heaven and Earth, and claim for theirs all that\r\nlieth within the compass of these lines, as if they would\r\nincroach upon God in Heaven, as well as upon Men on Earth."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 12"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the raising of the Price of Moneys by our Neighbours, and the\r\ndefect of our not raising of our Moneys accordingly."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Both these Causes are assigned of the Rarity of Money, and\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"are indeed the same, and do both stand and fall together, and\r\nboth are assigned for causes of Exportation of our Gold and\r\nSilver, and for Impediments of the importation of these Materials\r\nunto us: For if it be true that our Neighbours by the raising of\r\nthe price of the Moneys of Gold and Silver, do the more abound in\r\nGold and Silver, it is true likewise, that if we do not raise\r\nours in the same Proportion, we shall much less abound in the\r\nsame Materials: And if it be true, that they by raising theirs do\r\ndraw a greater quantity of Gold and Silver into their States, it\r\nis likewise true, that they do not only thereby withdraw from us\r\nthat quantity of Gold and Silver, which would otherwise be\r\nimported unto us, but they do facilitate the exportation from us,\r\nof that whereof we are already possessed: But, on the contrary,\r\nif these Positions be not true, then all the Consequences\r\ninferred upon them are not true likewise; Now because almost all\r\nthe deliberations in matters of Money do resort to the one or the\r\nother side of this main Question, Whether the raising of the\r\nprice of Moneys doth really and stably increase the abundance of\r\nMoney in any State, or if it do increase the quantity, whether\r\nthat increase be not more prejudicial than beneficial to the\r\nCommonwealth?

The venting of\r\ndomestical Commodities, for that if our own Moneys be as high in\r\nvalue, as those of other Nations, our own Commodities must be\r\nvented with them whether we have need of their Commodities, or\r\nthey have need of ours; because there will be no Profit to fetch\r\ntheir Commodities with our Moneys: and again, the raising of our\r\nMoneys doth make Commodities vented in other parts at an higher\r\nprice; because, when our Neighbours do raise their Moneys, they\r\ndo still hold in common estimation that Proportion in value to\r\nour Moneys, which they held before they were raised, though in\r\nIntrinsical value they want so much thereof as they are raised,\r\nby which means our Commodities being sold for the same Rates\r\nwhich they were sold for before, are sold for so much less as the\r\nIntrinsical value is impaired: But if our Moneys were likewise\r\nraised, then our Merchants must of necessity sell our Commodities\r\nat higher Rates in name than they did before, or else they should\r\nnot make their Reckonings. The abundance likewise of Money doth\r\nenable Tenants the better to pay their Rents, and all men in\r\ngeneral to keep up and maintain their Credits, and to pay all\r\npublick Charges and Contributions; and these Benefits may suffice\r\nin general without specifying many others, which have concurrency\r\nwith these or consequently from them.\r\nAnd for the Prejudices, which do grow by the not raising of\r\nour Moneys in a parity to other Nations, they are easily\r\nexpressed by these, for admitting these Benefits to grow by the\r\nraising of Money, the Prejudices which will grow by the not\r\nraising of them, will be the contrary to these.\r\nBut the main knot of the business is to prove, that the\r\nraising of Moneys doth really encrease the quantity of Money in\r\nany State, or doth preserve it from diminution. For that they do\r\nalledge these reasons:\r\nFirst, The Practice of all antiquity, in all States\r\nwhatsoever, which could not possibly fall out except there were\r\nfound an inevitable necessity to raise themselves to a parity\r\nwith their Neighbours, of which the Examples are laid down in the\r\nformer part of this Treatise; but specially that of the\r\nthirteenth of Henry the Fourth is very pregnant, where, by advice\r\nof Parliament, Money was raised, the reason being alledged, That\r\nfor want of raising it, the Realm was improvished and exhausted\r\nof Money.\r\nA second Reason which they alledge is the general and\r\nconstant observation, that when Moneys are raised they grow\r\nplentiful, whereof we do see with our eyes an evident\r\ndemonstration in this Kingdom, for that Gold having been raised\r\nin price of late years is grown much more plentiful than it was\r\nin the days of Queen Elizabeth: but the Silver having not been\r\nraised in Proportion, is grown very scant and rare in respect of\r\nthe abundance which was then seen.\r\nBut these are rather Authorities and Observations than\r\nReasons: but the main Reason whereon the maintainers of this side\r\ndo stand is this, When your Money is richer in substance and\r\nlower in price than that of your Neighbour Nations, as our Silver\r\nis than the Silver in the Low Countries, how can you expect that\r\nthe Merchant, who only seeketh his profit, will ever bring hither\r\nany Silver, when he can sell it in the Low Countries at a higher\r\nRate, and make more money of it here by returning of it from then\r\nhither, or by Exchange, or by Commodities? or, if any Merchant do\r\nbring Silver hither, it is to sell it to such who will give a\r\nhigher rate for it, than can be produced at the Mint, as the\r\nprice of our Silver Coins now stands; in which manner although\r\nthere be much brought over, yet being sold in that sort, it is\r\nnot only direct against the Law but turns to no use of the\r\nCommon-wealth.\r\nAnd again, whatsoever laws are made against Transportation of\r\nour Moneys, if our Silver be so rich as the Merchant by\r\ntransporting it into the Low Countries, or elsewhere, can make\r\nprofit by returning it in Commodities, or by Exchange; or that,\r\nwhich is yet more clear and evident, by returning it in Gold,\r\nmust not our Silver be inevitably exhausted?

Now\r\nit is manifest that the less importation you have of forrein\r\nCommodities the price of them is so much the more: and both these\r\nReasons do shew; and Experience it self doth confirm, that when\r\nMoney is raised, the price of forrein Commodities doth first\r\nrise: And the price of forrein being once raised, the price of\r\nDomestick Commodities will of necessitie be raised also; for the\r\nprice of forrein Commodities will make great plenty of them to be\r\nimported, and the high price of Money will inforce that they must\r\nbe returned in domestick Commodities: by which means domestick\r\nCommodities being much sought for, will of necessity be raised in\r\nprice, and the price of both these being raised, it follows that\r\nthe rate of all mens sallaries and hire of Labourers and\r\nEndeavorers must rise in Proportion, or else men shall be forced\r\nto defer their Trades and Endeavours, and then the scarcity will\r\nencrease the price. by these means it comes to pass, by the\r\nraising of Money, that all those who have contracted for antient\r\nRights and Rents are prejudiced, and such as have Rights and\r\nRents settled in perpetuity, can never receive help in this case;\r\nand therefore in divers other Countries, there have been very\r\nmany famous Judgments giv'n in this case, and great volumes\r\nwritten by the Civilians, to prove that the Rents which they call\r\nfeodats and fanniers, penalties and amercements, which are set\r\ndown uncertain, ought to be paied according to the value of the\r\nMoneys then Current when the said Rents and Penalties were\r\nestablished; and if we do examine it, we shall find it, that much\r\nthe greatest part of the Common-wealth is prejudiced whensoever\r\nMoney is raised.\r\nFirst, all those who have let Leases of their lands. Then all\r\nsuch as live upon Pensions and Wages.\r\nAll those that live by their professions either Civil or\r\nMilitary.\r\nAll those that live by Trade or Handy crafts, or Labourers.\r\nAnd although it be true when the Leases do come out, the Lords\r\nmay recompence themselves, and that when the hire and salaries of\r\nseveral professions and endeavorers shall be raised, (as I have\r\nshowed) that of necessity in time it must come to pass, that\r\nPrejudice doth cease unto them, yet in mean time they suffer: But\r\nthe King who is head of the Common-wealth, and whose Revenue is\r\nonly truly publick, doth of all suffer most, and most\r\nirreparably: Colledges are helped by the Stat. of Corn, and other\r\nCorporations do in some sort repair themselves by the fines they\r\ntake. But the King's Revenue, which of necessity is managed by\r\nmultitude of Officers, doth perpetually diminish, as much as the\r\nprice of Money is raised, so as the same lands yield, in name the\r\nsame Revenue to the King which they did in Edward the Thirds\r\ntime, but in truth not the third part: and besides much of his\r\nRevenue is assessed by the Parliament by prescription to a\r\ncertain Summ, all which doth continually diminish so much as the\r\nprice of Money riseth.\r\nOne other Mischief that groweth by the raising of Money is\r\nthis, When do you raise your Money, as that you do give a greater\r\nprice than before unto the Merchant, you do conceive that he is\r\nthereby the rather allured to bring the Materials of Money to\r\nyour Mint, and so withdraw them from other Nations. but if other\r\nnations find that, they will raise the price of their Money\r\nlikewise, and then what shall you get by raising of yours? or if\r\nyou raise upon them again, there will be no period to rest in,\r\nbut you shall continually sow confusion, until you be constrained\r\nto abolish your coins and invent new species, and new measures of\r\nweight and fineness, or else with infinite loss to the people, to\r\nbring the price back again to an ancient standard.\r\nOne other Mischief that groweth by the raising of Money is\r\nthis, a very great part of the Gold which cometh into Europe, and\r\nalmost all the Silver doth first aboard in Spain: so that when\r\nyou raise the price of these mettals, you raise the proper\r\ncommodities of Spain, and by that means you encrease the\r\ngreatness and power of that King, of whose greatness and power,\r\nof all others, you have cause to be most jealous and\r\napprehensive: And again, in a Kingdom as this is, which hath more\r\nCommodities to vent into Forrein Commodities, and which hath no\r\nmaterials of Money, as this hath not in any considerable\r\nquantity, but must have all their Gold and Silver supplied by the\r\nreturn of their Commodities, as ours is, it is most expedient to\r\nkeep the price of Money as low as may be, to the end your\r\nCommodities may return you the greater quantity of these\r\nmaterials in fineness and weight.\r\nAs for Example, If you should raise the ounce of sterling\r\nstandard to six shillings; then the Real of eight would be worth\r\nnear hand six shillings likewise; would it not then follow of\r\nNecessity, that you should have by so much the fewer of them in\r\nnumber, for the return of your Commodities? And the like may be\r\nsaid of Gold.\r\nLastly, when you raise your Money, it bringeth a great\r\nconfusion.\r\nFirst, by giving stop and hindrance to Trade and Commerce,\r\nall men being fearful and doubtful how to make their Contracts\r\nand Exchanges, until there be a settlement by time.\r\nAnd again, if you coin new species of less intrinsical value\r\nthan the old either in weight or fineness, or both, there is\r\ndanger of melting or exporting the old; if you raise the price of\r\nthe old species, you introduce Fractions and Confusions in\r\nreckoning, and do many times inforce him that pays to give more\r\nthan he intends, especially in reward and gratifications and\r\nfees, which are more exactly defined."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 15"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Examinations of the Reasons for the raising of Money."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The first Reason for the raising of Money, is the practise of\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Antiquity: it is true, as I have shewed before, that the Grecians\r\nand the Romans did successively raise the values of their Moneys,\r\nbut it was not to draw thereby the materials of Money from other\r\nStates unto theirs; but to supply the State, by that means on\r\ngreat and desperate Necessities, of the Wages thereof; and of the\r\nadvantage, or disadvantage growing thereby to the Common wealth,\r\nI intend to speak hereafter.\r\nBut this invention of raising of Money to draw a quantity of\r\ngold and silver from your Neighbours, or to preserve our own from\r\nbeing exhausted, is a conceit unknown to the ancient world, and\r\nintroduced long since the decay of the Roman Empire; when as\r\nthose Monarchies that are now settled in Europe, by succession\r\nfrom those Northern Nations, which did over-throw the antient\r\nRoman Empire, having together with many other necesary Arts, lost\r\nthe knowledge and orders of the Mint, were fain to use the\r\nSubtilty and Industry of the Jews, and those of Genoa and Lucca\r\n(who did succeed the Jews in this Trade) for the coining of their\r\nMoneys, who for their own Advantage did (by subtil and specious\r\nReasons many times by a seeming and not considerable Profit as\r\nProjectors use to do) allure Princes to make unnecessary\r\nalterations in their Moneys, from whence this Art of robbing Gold\r\nand Silver from one state to another is grown.\r\nAnd therefore I will speak no more concerning the practise of\r\nAntiquity, but will examine the other Reasons: as for the second\r\nReason, which is the Observation, that since King James raised\r\nthe Gold so much as he did, Gold is grown much more plentiful in\r\nthe Kingdom that it was before, but Silver having not been raised\r\nin Proportion is grown much more scant and rare: --\r\nIt is confessed that the Observation is true in this, that\r\nwhensoever you raise the Material of (one sort of) Money, that\r\nmaterial will encrease, and the other will grow scanty in\r\nProportion. And what doth the Commonwealth gain by that, if there\r\nbe more Gold now than heretofore, if there be less Silver in\r\nProportion? But it is denied, That if you raise equally both the\r\nmaterials of Money, that then either of them will ever a whit the\r\nmore abound; and this reason is given for it, Whatsoever the\r\nvalue of Money be in other Countreys, they will spend no more of\r\nyour Commodities than they have use for: if so, the over-value of\r\nyour (exported) Commodities must of necessity be returned to you\r\neither in Gold or Silver, whatsoever the value of them be, high\r\nor low: or suppose that, by reason of the low value of Gold and\r\nSilver in respect of their price in other parts, the Merchants do\r\nforbear the return of the over-values of your Commodities in\r\nthose Materials, and do choose rather to return Forrein\r\nCommodities more than you can vent; this may fall out thus for\r\none year, but two or three or more years, it is impossible it can\r\nhold, for that the Merchant should have these Forrein Commodities\r\nwhich are not consumed perish in his hands. And this Reason doth\r\nlikewise answer.\r\nThe third Argument made for the raising of Money which is,\r\nThat if you do not raise your Money to a parity with your\r\nNeighbours, the Merchant, who always seeks his profit, wil carry\r\nhis materials of Gold and Silver, where he may have most for\r\nthem; for if this reason stand good, the Merchant shall be\r\nconstrained to bring his Gold and Silver hither, what price\r\nsoever they bear.\r\nBut because this reason seems so evident and unanswerable in\r\nthe Judgment of many, and that if it stand good, it doth\r\nabsolutely confute the practise of all the States of Europe, who\r\nhave continued many years raising of the values of their Moneys,\r\nupon this ground, to attract thereby greater quantities of Gold\r\nand Silver.\r\nI intend to make a more strict Examination of this Reason.\r\nAnd first for a most clear understanding of the Case, Let us\r\nsuppose that al the commodities, any way exported out of this\r\nKingdom in one year, be worth one Million of pounds sterling, and\r\nthat the Commodities imported, be worth but 900,000 pound, and\r\nthat this Proportion, or near thereabouts, be constant; then of\r\nnecessity, it follows, That an hundred thousand pounds must be\r\nbrought in in gold and silver, what price soever Money bear.\r\nBut if it shall appear that the Low values of our Money doth\r\ncause the Kingdom to vent more forrein Commodities than otherwise\r\nit would vent; and, that where otherwise it would vent 900,000\r\npound, the Low values of Money cause it to vent a Million or\r\nmore: then is the force of this argument lost; and it follows,\r\nThat the low values are the cause why the Materials of Gold and\r\nSilver, or less of them than otherwise would do, come not in.\r\nNow when this may come to pass several ways, First, If the\r\nvalue of your Moneys be so low as the Merchant shall lose by\r\nbringing you gold and silver, he will rather return you forrein\r\nCommodities, though he sell them as cheap as he bought them, and\r\nso gain nothing by them, than bring you Gold and Silver by which\r\nhe shall loose.\r\nAs for Example, the Merchant trading into Muscovia, will\r\nrather return his Cloth in Furr, or in Silk of Persia, though he\r\nsell them as cheap as he bought them there, than in Silver and\r\nGold, by which he shall loose the fourth part. Now the cheapness\r\nof forrein Commodities makes the greater quantity of them to be\r\nspent, as we see of Calico's, of which few or none were\r\nheretofore vented in this Kingdom, the cheapness of them making\r\ngreater Quantities of them to be spent.\r\nAnd again, the Lowness of the values of Money may cause a\r\ngreater Proportion of Forrein Commodities to be consumed, though\r\nnot in quantity, yet in value.\r\nAs for Example, Though the Lowness of the value of Money\r\nshould not make a greater quantity of Silver to be spent in\r\nEngland, than otherwise would be, yet it would make a greater\r\nProportion in value to be spent, by reason that the Merchant, who\r\nin the return of his Commodities brings such a quantity of Silk\r\nas he judgeth may be vented here, if he find an over value of his\r\nCommodities exported, to those he doth import, he will rather,\r\ninstead of raw Silks, return Silks by which he shall loose. As if\r\nour Gold were as our Silver in prices, by which the Turkey\r\nMerchant shall loose as much by bringing Gold from thence, as he\r\nshould if he brought Silver, is it not manifest, that instead of\r\nGold, which he now brings with his raw Silk, in return of his\r\nCommodities, he would carry both Gold and Silk into Italy, and\r\nimploy them in manufactured Silks, though he should sell them\r\nhere almost as cheap as he bought them, rather than return the\r\novervalue in Gold, by which he should loose? And so though the\r\nsame Proportion in quantity were vented here in Silk, yet a\r\ngreater Proportion in value would be vented.\r\nAt the same time may be said of divers other Commodities: and\r\nfor confirmation of this, it is to be observed, That from Italy,\r\nFrance and the Low Countries, and the East Indies, in all which\r\nplaces the values of Money are as high or higher than with us, we\r\ndraw hardly any Commodities but fully manufactured, and they\r\nreceive none of our Commodities but either not manufactured at\r\nall, or, but so much manufactured as the Severity and Penalty of\r\nthe Laws do otherwise prohibit to be exported: But in Spain where\r\nthe Moneys are yet of a lower value than with us, it is clean\r\ncontrary.\r\nAnd although it may be Objected that this Observation doth\r\nnot hold in Turkey and Muscovie, though in Turky the Silver, and\r\nin Muscovie both Gold and Silver be much higher valued than here\r\nin England;\r\nTo that it may be answered, That these barbarous Countries\r\nreceive our Manufactures by Necessity, because they afford none\r\nof their own."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 16"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Examinations of the Reasons for the not raising of Money."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The first and main Reason against the raising of Money, is,\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The INJUSTICE and OPPRESSION done to all those, who ar in place\r\nof Creditors to receive, all which are forced to receive less in\r\nIntrinsical value than is due unto them, and less in faculty and\r\nextent to supply their own uses. To which reason I never\r\nunderstood any answer made that could have examination but only\r\nthis: That however the Creditors do receive less in intrinsical\r\nvalue, and less in faculty and extent, to supplie their use by\r\nreason that as the Extrinsical value of the Money is raised, the\r\nprice of the things do likewise rise with it, yet that price doth\r\nnot rise but by degrees and time, in which time all these\r\nCreditors by renewing their Contracts do repair themselves, some\r\nsooner, some later, according to the state of their Contracts.\r\nBut then it is manifest that all those who have any Rents or\r\nother Rights which are defined to a certain sum in perpetuity,\r\nand the King for the best part of his Revenue are extreamly\r\ndamnified by the raising of Moneys without Repair, except there\r\nshould a Law be mae that all those kind of payments should be\r\npayable according to the values of Money current when they were\r\nfirst created, which, though it were an innovation full of Danger\r\nand Confusion,and Impracticable in this State, yet it seemeth to\r\nhave a foundation in Justice.\r\nA second Reason, made against the raising of Money, is this,\r\nIf you do raise your Moneys out of the Misconceipt to draw you\r\nmore Gold and Silver, the other Nations out of the same\r\nMisconceipt will raise the Money likewise; and so deprive you of\r\nyour end: but to this reason it may be answered, That we ought\r\nnot to raise our Moneys above our Neighbours, but only to a\r\nparity with them, and then if they be obstinate to out raise us,\r\nwe must rather undergo the Prejudice of a continual raising to a\r\nparity, thereby to keep our own, than to suffer other Nations by\r\nimparity to rob us of what we have: so as this Argument in\r\neffect, doth resort to that, which was formerly disputed, whether\r\ntruly and constantly more Gold and Silver be brought in by the\r\nraising of Money.\r\nThe two Arguments that follow against the raising of Money\r\nwill both receive one clear answer.\r\nThe First, That in raising of Money you raise the King of\r\nSpain's Commodities, and consequently enrich him.\r\nThe Second, That by raising of Money, you have less Silver\r\nand Gold out of Spain in Intrinsical value for your Commodities,\r\nthe answer thereunto is very plain and clear, which is this, That\r\nif the Position formerly laid down be true, which is, That as the\r\nvalue of Money is raised, so the price of Commodities riseth with\r\nit, Then it follows that neither the King of Spain shall be\r\nenriched by the raising of Money, because the Commodities for\r\nwhich he parts with his Money unto us, shall rise likewise in\r\nprice, nor shall we receive less of his Money in Intrinsical\r\nvalue for our Commodities, because the Extrinsical value is\r\nraised, that our Commodities will rise likewise so much the more\r\nin Extrinsical value.\r\nTo the last Argument, of the Confusion which the raising of\r\nMoney doth bring both by the stopp of Commerce at the present,\r\nand the fractions of Reckonings, it is answered, That no\r\nalteration in this Subject of Money is without Inconvenience; But\r\nif the position be true, that raising of Money is necessary to\r\npreserve that which we have, and to bring in more; then are those\r\npetty Inconveniences little considerable: and thus I have\r\nexamined as strictly as I can the Reasons alledged on both sides\r\nfor the raising and not raising of Moneys; but leave the Reader\r\nto his own Conclusion.\r\nI do now come to the Remedies, that by curious search I could\r\never learn to have been propounded either in this Estate or any\r\nforrein Estates, for the Inconveniences that may grow either by\r\nraising of Money, or not raising, or both of them, which I do\r\nmean likewise to examine, and shew as near as I can, the\r\nDifficulties that may grow in settling of the several Remedies\r\npropounded, and the evil Consequences that might grow of them, if\r\nthey were settled, and that so the Reader may more clearly judge\r\nwhich is the best: for which purpose I intend to begin with the\r\nPlainest and most easie, to the end that the more intricate may\r\nafterwards be better comprehended."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 17"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of Contracting with forrein Nations by Ambassadors to keep their\r\nMoneys at a certain standard."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Amongst all the Remedies propounded against the Alterations\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"of Moneys there is none more specious than this, nor more\r\nfrequent in mention, both in provisionall Edicts, which are made\r\nfor the Reformation of Moneys, and in Considerations held for the\r\npurpose, for it is said to advance it: That if we contract with\r\nother Nations for a certain and stable standard of Moneys which\r\nmay be equal, than we shall avoid all the Inconveniences that do\r\ngrow by the raising of Moneys, because we shall never raise them;\r\nand we shall avoid all the Inconveniences that do grow by the not\r\nraising of Moneys, because other Nations shall not raise theirs.\r\nBesides for this Remedy there is alledged the example of former\r\nAges, wherein it appears that in many Treaties with forrein\r\nNations our Kings did contract for the mutual standard of their\r\nMoneys.\r\nBut however the Proposition be specious and frequent, yet, of\r\nall other Remedies, if it be throughly examined, it will appear\r\nthe most difficult, or rather impossible, to be effected; and if\r\nit were effected, it would turn to no use, for thus stands the\r\nstate of this business, Almost all the Silver which is now drawn\r\nout of the Earth, cometh from the West Indies, all which intirely\r\naboardeth first in Spain, whence it is dispersed into other\r\nCountries Eastward; which do draw it unto them by setting an\r\nhigher price upon it: for, as if there were no Cloth in all the\r\nWorld but in England, no other country could have cloth except\r\nthey did pay dearer for it than in England; and by so much dearer\r\nby how much it were more remote from England, because to the\r\noriginal price, there must of necessitie be added an increase in\r\nregard of the time, the charge, and hazard of transporting it: so\r\nfares it with Silver, that all Countries which will draw from\r\nSpain, do necessarily set a greater price upon it, by how much\r\nthey are more remote from thence, and this is the Reason why the\r\nsphear of Silver seemeth to roll from the West to the East, until\r\nit come unto him, where it seemeth to fall into a Gulph. But of\r\nGold it is not so, because that comes in as great abundance from\r\nthe East as from the West.\r\nNow then it were a great Prejudice for England and France to\r\ncontract with Spain for a certain standard of Silver, except they\r\ncould likewise contract for the same standard with the Low\r\nCountries, and Italy, who draw part of their Silver from them, as\r\nthey draw theirs from Spain; for otherwise, they should give a\r\nstop to the coming in of their Silver, and should leave the issue\r\nof it open. Nor would Turkey contract, unless they could also\r\ncontract with Persia for the same, where Silver is yet higher\r\nthan in Turkey, and so forward into China; neither would the Low\r\nCountrie men contract, except they could contract for the same\r\nwith Hanse Towns, where Silver is higher than in the Low\r\nCountries; neither would the Hanse Towns contract, except they\r\ncould contract with Muscovie; neither would Muscovie contract,\r\nexcept they could contract with Persia; and so forward in all\r\nsuch places Silver is still at an higher and higher rate.\r\nbut suppose it was possible to draw all those Countries to a\r\ncertain contract, what would be the use of it? I did in a former\r\nChapter observe that most Countries, and particularly France and\r\nthe Low Countries do seldome or never raise their Moneys: But\r\nwhen People by Custom and general Use have raised the Money\r\nbefore hand beyond the Publick Declaration, and the State is\r\nforced to follow the People who in this Case they do not master,\r\nto what end is it then to contract with those Nations for that\r\nwhich is not in their Power to observe? And that which is\r\nalledged for the course of contracting, with forrein Nations, out\r\nof the example of former times, doth clearly convince the vanity\r\nof this Proposition, for it is manifest, as I have shewed in the\r\nformer Chapters that notwithstanding these Contracts, the Money\r\nwas continually from time to time raised."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 18"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of the Ordaining of solid Payments"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Solid payments are meant where Contracts are made for payment\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"of so many solid species of Money, or of so many double Pistoles,\r\nor so many French Crowns, or so many English Angels, or\r\nSoveraigns or Shillings, and therefore termed solid payments,\r\nbecause they are restrained to those solid species which are\r\ncontracted for, and to never alter in payment although the value\r\nof the species should alter; as however the value of Angels or\r\nSoveraigns which were coined for ten shillings, be raised to\r\neleven shillings, yet he which hath contracted to pay so many\r\nAngels or Soveraigns shall pay never awhit the less in number,\r\nbecause their value is raised, and so in the other species of\r\nFrench Crowns and Pistoles: But he that made a contract when\r\nAngels and Soveraigns were valued at ten shillings, to be paid,\r\nat such a day to come, one hundred pounds, before which day the\r\nvalue of Angels or Soveraigns was raised to eleven shillings;\r\nwhereas he should be paid at the time of his contract for one\r\nhundred pounds sterling, two hundred Angels or Soveraigns, he\r\nshall now be paid but one hundred fourscore and one Angels or\r\nSoveraigns and nine shillings, because the sum of a pound\r\nsterling is not restrained to any solid species, but is rather\r\nimaginary and abstracted from the matter guided according to the\r\nuncertain valuation of the species of Money, wherein the payment\r\nis made.\r\nThis proposition of ordaining all contracts for payments to\r\nbe restrained to solid species of Money, hath bin often agitated\r\nin France, as a soveraign Remedy against the main inconveniences\r\nwhich do arise in this subject of Money, for the discussing of\r\nthe truth and efficacie of which proposition, it will be\r\nnecessarie to relate the success thereof in that Kingdom, in the\r\nyears 1575 and 1576.\r\nThe people in France, contrary to the King's Ordinance, and\r\nin despight of all Remedies which could be thought of to prevent\r\nit, had raised both the Gold and Silver so excessively, as a\r\nFrench Crown in Gold was valued at seven livres and an half, and\r\nat eight livres, a Livre in France being the tenth art of a pound\r\nsterling, and is an abstracted sum consisting of twenty sols, as\r\nour pound sterling doth consist of twenty shillings, there being\r\nno certain species of Money called a Livre, and according to the\r\nvalue of Gold, their Silver likewise was overvalued, and the\r\nspecies of forreign Coins both of Gold and Silver were current\r\nlikewise at the like value in proportion; by means whereof it is\r\nhardly credible what quantities of Gold and Silver, both of\r\nForrein and Domestick Coins that Countrie did then abound with.\r\nBut their Base money which was not raised in proportion to the\r\nGold and Silver, and did really contain in Intrinsical value much\r\nmore than the Gold and Silver Coins, in proportion to the value\r\nat which they were current, was for the most part either\r\ntransported or secretly melted down to extract the Silver\r\nthereout.\r\nAnd if this had been all the Inconvenience, they would never\r\nhave complained; but in consequence of this, the prices of all\r\nthings did rise so excessively, that all such who lived upon\r\nPensions, or Wages, or Fees, or antient Rents did manifestly see\r\nthemselves unable to subsist: but above all, the King was most\r\nheavily prejudiced, so it was like to grow to some great\r\nConfusion in that State.\r\nHereupon in the year 1577, there was a new Ordinance made,\r\ntreated and published with the greatest deliberation and\r\nsolemnity that every any Edict was of this kind in France. And\r\nfirst the French Crown, weighing 2 deniers and 15 grains, after\r\nthe French weight, and 23 Carrats fine, from eight livres was\r\nreduced to the value of sixty Sols, which is equal to three\r\nlivres; and all the pieces of Silver of French coins, were\r\nreduced to a value answerable to that, the sols likewise, and\r\nother base Money coined proportionable thereunto, and to the end\r\nthey might never be again raised by the People to an higher\r\nvalue.\r\nFirst, All forrein coins both Gold and Silver, except\r\nPistollets and Doublons of Spain were upon great penalties\r\nforbidden to be brought in otherwise then as Bullion, and made\r\nincurrent. Then there were very severe Prohibitions made that no\r\nman should afterwards make Contracts of payment in livres or any\r\nother abstracted sums, but only in the solid species of Crowns:\r\nAnd to the end that payment might be made as well in Silver as\r\nGold, there were in Silver coined quarter-Crowns, and half\r\nquarter-Crowns, and the other species of Silver already extant\r\nwere valued proportionable to them, only sixty sols were made\r\nequal to a Crown, which held no proportion with a Crown either in\r\nname or in intrinsical value, by reason, that in the sols and\r\nother base Money, the Copper with which they are allayed is\r\nvalued, and there is a much greater charge laid on the coinage of\r\nthem than of other Moneys: yet notwithstanding it is very\r\nstrange, how well this Edict did keep the people of France in\r\norder for three or four and twenty years, so as in all that time,\r\nthe value of the Gold nor Silver was never raised.\r\nBut by degrees they did find that the Kingdom grew drained of\r\nthat great quantity of gold and silver with which it formerly\r\nabounded, and their commerce and Trade did visibly decay; they\r\nfound themselves full of forrein Manufactures, but their own\r\nManufactures had ill vent, and at length the people,\r\nnotwithstanding the Prohibition, began to take Forrein coins as\r\ncurrent, and received both them and their coins, at a higher\r\nvalue than the King's edict did admit, so as in the year 1602\r\ntheir complaint grew as loud and as sharp as in the year 1577,\r\nthough of a cleer contrary condition, and there grew new\r\nconsultations and enquiries into the Remedies of these\r\nInconveniences.\r\nMany who were very much taken with the former Edict of 1577,\r\ndid advise that the same Edict should be more rigidly maintained,\r\nand that all forrein coins should be absolutely banished, and\r\nthat the former Edict might be now reformed in that only point,\r\nwhich was deficient (viz.) That the Sols might either be coined\r\nof purer Silver, or if they did remain of the former Allay, that\r\nthe King would so dispose of the charge of the Allay and coinage\r\nas they might answer in their Intrinsical value to the gold and\r\nthe Silver; and that for the remedy of the Penury of Money,\r\nstrict sumptuary Laws might be put in practice against Forrein\r\nManufactures, and superfluous Commodities.\r\nBut against this it was objected, That now they found by\r\nexperience the effect of the former Edict of 1577, and this\r\naddition of sumptuary Laws would give little help, because the\r\nlicence of the times and difficulties in the thing it self were\r\nsuch as they would never be put in execution.,\r\nIn conclusion a new Edict was set forth in Anno 1602 by which\r\nthe Contracts in the solid species in Crowns were abolished and\r\nthe Contracts in Livres again authorised. The Crown in Gold was\r\nvalue at three Livres again authorised. The Crown in gold was\r\nvalued at three Libres and four sols, and all forrein coins were\r\nmade current in a proportionable rate: and upon it ensued that\r\nthe people did every day raise the price of all Gold both forrein\r\nand domestick higher and higher by degrees, so as in the year\r\n1614, the King by his Edict was enforced to make good the raising\r\nof the people, and to set a value upon the French Crown, of 3\r\nLivres and 15 sols, which is seven shillings and six pence\r\nsterling, and yet still the people raised it higher, and all\r\nother Gold in proportion, which hath yet this further\r\nInconvenience with it, That being raised by degrees, they cannot\r\nraise the Silver together with it, so as in time it will breed so\r\ngreat a Disproportion between the Silver and the Gold as they\r\nwill have little Silver left; and that such as through the\r\nexceeding lightness cannot with profit be made away.\r\nI shall not now need to speak any more of the Inconveniences\r\nwhich may grow by ordaining of solid payments because they have\r\nbeen sufficiently expressed in the relation of these proceedings\r\nin France. But I will only add this, that there is not true\r\nsoliditie in payments, but to contract for so much in weight and\r\nso much in fineness, for if you should ordain all payments to be\r\nmade in such or such species of Money, it is true that the\r\nraising of those species of Money could breed no alteration in\r\nyour payments: but suppose the Prince should coin these species,\r\neither baser in Allay or lighter in weight, then should your\r\npayment be subject to the same alteration as if you had\r\ncontracted for abstracted sums."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 19"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of equalizing the Exchange."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The Author of Lex Mercatoriae doth hold, That in those\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"countries where great great Banks are kept, the Bankers do by\r\ntheir Arts and Subtilties by the inequalite of the Exchange, draw\r\naway the Gold and Silver out of other Countries: as for Example;\r\nIn Holland, suppose a man were by Exchange to make over 100 pound\r\nsterling thither out of England, The Exchange, saiths he, is such\r\nwhen it is at most advantage for England, by the practise and\r\nsubtilties of the Banker, as you shall receive for your hundred\r\npound there, less in intrinsical value than you gave; and if you\r\nmake over a hundred pound out of Holland into England by Exchange\r\nyou shall receive more in Intrinsical value than you gave. And if\r\nthis Position absolutely be true, as that the contrary doth\r\nrarely or seldom happen, it necessarily follows, That it is more\r\nadvantage to carry over your Money thither in specie, than to\r\nmake it over by exchange, and it is more advantage to make over\r\nyour Money thence by exchange than to bring it over in specie.\r\nBut (saith he) if it be effectually ordained, That no man\r\nshall give his Money here, to receive less in intrinsical value\r\nthere by Exchange; and that no man shall give his Money there, to\r\nreceive more in intrinsical value here by Exchange: it is plain,\r\nThat no man shall have his Advantage to carry his Money thither\r\nin specie, nor no man shall have his Disadvantage to bring his\r\nMoney thence in specie: and if the same course be observed in all\r\nplaces and at all times, let other nations use what they please\r\nto raise or abase the values of their Money, they shall never\r\nprejudice the Kingdom by it.\r\nI have abstracted this Proportion in the plainest manner I\r\ncould, and purposely omitted to name the sums of the Exchange, to\r\navoid all Question about more or less, and all obscurity: and\r\ncertainly it carrieth with it a great appearance of Reason;\r\nneither do I find any strength in that Objection which is most\r\npressed against it, That this equallity cannot be made with other\r\ncountries, by Reason that a great part of the Payments is made in\r\nBase money: for, if Base money be so current, as for it you may\r\nhave so much purer Money as will answer the intrinsical value\r\nrequired for the Sum to be paid by Exchange, that Objection will\r\nfall: if it be not so current, you may except against the\r\nPayment.\r\nBut yet this Proposition, if it be narrowly examined will be\r\nfound subject to great Exceptions.\r\nAnd first, The Difficulty, I may say almost, the\r\nImpossibility of putting it in Execution is apparent, for\r\nalthough the intrinsical value be the principal Rule by which\r\nExchanges are squared, yet there are many other Circumstances\r\nwhich do vary and alter the Exchange, and this is for a main one;\r\nThat when there is much Money to be returned to one place by an\r\nAccident unlookt for, you shall (not) find Takers in Proportion,\r\nexcept what they make by the price of Exchange do invite them: if\r\nthen you will force men alwayes to give and take by Exchange at\r\none rate, when through accident there shall want Takers, you will\r\nforce the Giver to supply his Necessity, to send his Money in\r\nspecie, and so that which is propounded for a Remedy of\r\nExportation shall turn to a greater Exportation.\r\nBut suppose this Difficulty could be overcome, yet would it\r\nnot suffice to hinder Exportation; for, if in other Countries,\r\nthey should value your Money higher than their own, as in this\r\nDiscourse there are formerly Instances set down, of English Money\r\nhigher valued than their own, in France, in the Low-Countries,\r\nand at Francford Mart: he then which at these times would have\r\nmade over Money by exchange into those Parts, by this\r\nProposition, should have had but the intrinsical value in Money\r\nover in specie, would have had more than the intrinsical value.\r\nLastly, It is to be considered, That all Countries that do\r\nraise little or no Materials with themselves, (which is our Case\r\nin England) must not be so careful to hinder Exportation of the\r\nMaterials, as to provide for Importation for them; What Fruit\r\nthen shall we receive by this Equality of Exchange, (admitting\r\nthat it might be made, and that it would hinder the Exportation)\r\nif it should be recompenced by the same Degree of Impediment,\r\nwhich it would give to the Importation, which would necessarily\r\nfollow upon it; as for instance, If the Equality of Exchange will\r\ngive impediment to transport Silver out of England into Holland,\r\nwill not the same equality of Exchange give the same degree of\r\nImpediment to import Silver out of Spain into England?

And England being a Countrie\r\nable to send out more Commodities than it hath need to receive,\r\nwe shall of necessity return the overplus in Bullion.\r\nBut to examine the solid Truth of these Alligations, it will\r\nbe necessary to consider by what means this Reduction may be\r\neffected.\r\nFirst, Therefore if you will reduce Moneys to the antient\r\nvalues, either you must do it by several degrees, (this being the\r\nway by which the mischief grew) or you must do it all at once.\r\nAs for example of a Reduction by degrees, Silver is now\r\ncoined at five shillings and two pence an ounce, and Crown Gold\r\nat three pound eight shillings and four pence the ounce; begin\r\nthen, first to reduce by coining Silver at fourteen groats the\r\nOunce, and Crown Gold at three pound one shilling and six pence\r\nthe Ounce; and when it is thus settled, then some time after\r\nreduce them both, yet to a lower price, and so until you come to\r\nthe Original settlement. But is it not then manifest that if\r\nthese coins be so much heavier than the former, as this\r\nProportion doth make them, and yet go at the same price as the\r\nother did, yet as fast as they are coined, they will be melted or\r\ntransported for advantage?\r\nBesides our Merchants will (not) bring this Silver and gold\r\nunto you to so great a loss: on the other side, if you make all\r\nthe old Money uncurrent, and you do make it so many times\r\nuncurrent as you do reduce it towards the antient values, by\r\ndegrees the confusions will be so great as the Kingdom cannot\r\nbear them, and the continual new coining of your Money will\r\nconsume all the value of your Money in that charge: there is then\r\nno other way left but to leave the old Money still current, but\r\nabased so much in price as it is worse than the new Money in\r\nintrinsical value. But this is hardly possible, considering that\r\nthe fractions in the old Money will be so confused as no man\r\nshall know how to pay or receive it; besides all men of what\r\ncondition soever that are to pay Money, in what nature soever,\r\nshall pay ten in the Hundred more than they should otherwise have\r\ndone.\r\nBut suppose this Inconvenience might be sufferable for once,\r\nyet when they must return again, as often as by degrees you do\r\nreduce your Money towards the antient values, I do see no\r\npossibility to conquer them; it is then best to consider what\r\nwill follow of it, if this Reduction to the antient values be\r\nmade all at once, which is thus propounded.\r\nThat new Money should be coined at twenty pence an ounce,\r\nSilver; and that the old Money should be still left current at\r\nthe third part of the value for which now it goeth, as six pence\r\nto be current for two pence, and twelve pence for a groat, so as\r\nall Fractions should be avoided: and the gold should be reduced\r\nto a like Proportion, and that all contracts and payments, from\r\nsuch a day to come, should be made and paid in new Money or in\r\nold Money, valuing it only at the third part of the new Money;\r\nBut if the Proposition were simply thus, it were insupportable,\r\nfor then he that sits now at a rent of 10 l. a year, and is\r\nhardly able to pay it should in effect, after the day when the\r\nnew money is to be current, pay thirty pounds a year; and he that\r\nborrowed ten pounds before that day, after that day shall pay\r\nthirty, and so it would be of all other payments. And it is no\r\nsatisfaction to say, That would be no Injustice, because he that\r\npays Money, either for Debt or Rent, or any other waies, must\r\nreceive it from others, be it either in Debt, Rent, or for the\r\nprice of any thing to be sold, and so he shall pay no more in\r\nProportion than he shall receive: for it if be true, which is the\r\nmainest Benefit propounded by this Reduction, that as the price\r\nof Money shall be abased so the price of all things will abate in\r\nProportion, then he that is to raise his payments out of the\r\nprice of other things shall raise no more in intrinsical value\r\nthan he should have done before, yet he shall pay in intrinsical\r\nvalue thrice as much as he did before.\r\nTo solve this Objection, there are two ways propounded, but\r\neither of them have their Inconveniences;\r\nThe first is, that this payment in new Money shall only\r\nextend to future contracts and that all former contracts shall\r\neither be paid in old Money or in new Money valued at three times\r\nthe old Money: but if you admit of this, you shall by this\r\nReduction only raise a great rumour and confusion among the\r\npeople, and all the benefits propounded are quite blown away.\r\nBesides the Injustice, as it was very apparent to all that\r\nwere to pay Money in the former way, so it is as apparent in this\r\nway to all that are to receive Money, for that they shall receive\r\nin extrinsical value but two pence for six pence, and one\r\nshilling for 3 shillings, but above all others, the King would be\r\nmost prejudiced.\r\nThe second way of solving the former Objection is this, That\r\nall payments, for the future, should be made in new Money or in\r\nold, valuing the old a third part, and that in like manner all\r\nantient Contracts, Rents, and Rights reserved should be acquitted\r\nin new Money, or in old Money valued at the third part of the\r\nnew, and that his wold of antient Contracts and Rights, should be\r\ndefined from such a time as since which the prices of things have\r\nencreased, as the value of Money is by this Reduction to be\r\nabated; As for Example,\r\nSince the year of the eighteenth of Henry the Eighth, when he\r\nbegan to coin Base money, since which time generally the price of\r\nthings is trebled at the least, in some more, in some less. And\r\nthat all Contracts and payments reserved, since the eighteenth\r\nyear of Henry the Eighth, until the day when the new Money is\r\nmade current, should be acquitted in old Money, or in new Money\r\nvalued three times as much as the old: By this means the\r\nInjustice of the former ways seemeth to be equally parted, in\r\nthat some Receivers by this way should gain and some Receivers\r\nshould loose, and some Payers should gain and some should loose.\r\nBut this Proposition brings with it a new Inconvenience,\r\nwhich is, That this time of the eighteenth of Henry the Eighth,\r\nbeing so antient, it would breed many Controversies, as to what\r\npayments were contracted for or reserved before that time or not.\r\nBut suppose that this Reduction were effected, and that our\r\nMoneys were both by reputed valuation and by exchange compared\r\nwith Forrein Moneys, according to their true intrinsical value,\r\nyet do I not see that this Reformation, for all this, would be\r\nstable and permanent; for if afterwards other Nations shall by\r\ndegrees again diminish the Intrinsical value of their Moneys,\r\neither we must resolve to stand firm to this Reduction, and so to\r\ntake the hazard of all losses and Inconveniences which the not\r\nraising of our Moneys when our Neighbours raise theirs do bring\r\nwith it; or if we shall raise again as they shall raise theirs,\r\nthen all the benefit of this troublesome Reduction will be, That\r\nwe shall yet be three hundred years longer ere we do grow to so\r\ngreat a diminution in the Intrinsical value of our Moneys, as we\r\ndo at this present undergo."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 21"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of raising our Moneys according to the raising of our Neighbours"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Others do propound a clean contrary course to this Reduction\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"of the Moneys to the antient values; For they would have us to\r\nobserve precisely the raising of the price of Money by our\r\nNeighbours, and if not to preceed them, at the least to follow\r\nthem immediately. And for this purpose they insist upon two main\r\nArguments. The one drawn from Example, the other from Reason: for\r\nsay they, If we do observe those States, which do soonest and\r\nmost raise their Money, we shall find that they do most abound\r\nwith Money; and that Trades and Manufacturers do most flourish\r\nthere.\r\nAs for Example, the United Provinces, and the Arch-Dukes\r\nCountry, and the Hanns Towns; and they do confirm their instance\r\nby this reason, Forrein Nations when they raise their Moneys, do\r\nthereby make them of less Intrinsical value, than they are\r\nreputed.\r\nAs for Example, Three pounds two shillings sterling, is\r\nreputed equal with five pounds six shillings Flemish; and\r\nperadventure when the pound sterling was first cut into 62s they\r\nwere equal in intrinsical value, but now by the raising of\r\nMoneys, this five pounds six shillings Flemish, say they,\r\ncontains in intrinsical value no more than two pounds sixteen\r\nshillings.\r\nAnd again, say they, The Ryall of eight and the Rix Dollar\r\nare both of them reputed equal to five shillings sterling, but\r\nhold in intrinsical value less by ten in the hundred. Hence, (say\r\nthey,) it follows, That he that bestoweth here three pounds two\r\nshillings in English Cloth, and sells it beyond Sea for five\r\npounds six shillings Flemish, or for twelve Ryalls of eight, or\r\ntwelve Rix-Dollars, with two shillings, maketh his accompt that\r\nhe hath sold it as dear as he bought it, and whatsoever he can\r\nget more is gain towards his hazard, his time, and his charge;\r\nand by this means he doth undervalue the English commodity to the\r\nloss of the Realm, six shillings in three pound two shillings:\r\nBut on the other side, if he bestow his five pound six shillings\r\nFlemish, or his twelve Ryalls of eight, or Rix-Dollars, and two\r\nshillings in Forrein Commodities, he makes his Accompt that he\r\nsells them not here for as much as they cost him, except he have\r\nfor them three pound two shillings sterling, by which he\r\novervalues to us the forrein Commodities by six shillings in\r\nthree pound two shillings, by which means the Realm in general is\r\nimpoverished, but the Merchant in his particular saves himself,\r\nfor what is lost to him by the undervalue of the English\r\nCommodities is again made good unto him by the over-value of the\r\nforrein Commodities. And hence it follows that our Money wasts,\r\nour Manufactures decay, and their Money and Manufactures do\r\nincrease.\r\nAs for the objections made against raising of Moneys; they\r\nsay, They are not considerable in comparison of the benefits, for\r\nso as Trade and Manufactures may flourish and Money abound, what\r\nimports it though the price of things do rise, when as every man\r\nas he pays more, so he shall receive more: as for the King's\r\nloss, he shall be otherwise recompenced by the Riches of the\r\nSubjects.\r\nBut to come to the Examination of this Proposition and the\r\nReasons made for it.\r\nFirst, these valuations laid down of our Money in comparison\r\nwith Flemish Money and Ryalls and Dollars, for a foundation of\r\nthis Proposition is very uncertain; for as it is true, that as I\r\nhave heard in publick conference upon thee occasions, divers\r\nMerchants of great worth and experience to affirm these\r\nvaluations, so I have heard others of as great worth and\r\nexperience to deny them, affirming that they knew none other\r\nvaluation of our Money with forrein, but according to the\r\nIntrinsical value of either of them. And by the last Placcard of\r\nthe Low Countries, the English shilling is made current for one\r\nshilling nine pence Flemish, by which accompt three pound two\r\nshillings English will make five pound eight shillings and six\r\npence Flemish.\r\nBut admitting the valuations as they are set down in the\r\nProposition, yet it will appear, but a meer Sophism; for the\r\ntruth is, as it is set down in a former Chapter, That silver is\r\nhigher valued in France and England, than in Spain, and in the\r\nLow Countries than in either of them; and in the Hanns Towns than\r\nin the Low Countries; and so still higher, the further Eastward:\r\nBut of gold it is not so: and upon an exact computation it will\r\nbe found, That Gold is higher valued in England than in the Low\r\nCountries, and that a pound of fine gold reduced into the Riders\r\nof the Low Countries, makes but forty five Guilders, and seven\r\nStivers, and allowing ten Stivers and a half for twelve pence\r\nEnglish, as it is made current by the last Placcard, there the\r\nsaid sum amounts in sterling Money but to forty three pound\r\nthirteen shillings and a penny; but a pound of Gold fine makes in\r\ntwenty two shilling pieces, forty four pound, eight shillings\r\nfour pence sterling, which reduced into Guilders after the former\r\naccompt makes 446 and a half, so as the pound in fine Gold is\r\nvalued in Jacobus pieces, at 8 Guilders two Stivers and one half\r\nmore than in Riders, and in English Money is valued at fifteen\r\nshillings three pence more in Jacobus's than in Riders; so then\r\nit follows, that if England do loose any thing in the true price\r\nof her Commodities because Silver is higher valued in the Low\r\nCountries than in England, England gains again in the price of\r\nher Commodities, because Gold is higher valued in England than in\r\nthe Low Countries. Besides all which none of the Objections made\r\nagainst this Proposition are answered, but only elevated, and it\r\nis manifest, that all those who are to receive Money shall be\r\ncontinually oppressed with this continual raising of Money, and\r\nif we shall still vie one upon another who shall raise highest,\r\nin the End the Matter must necessarily come to a Confusion."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 22"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of introducing two different Species of Money"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The Difficulties and Debate of the former Proposition have\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"produced this, set down in the title of this Chapter: For if to\r\nlet our Money stand still in the same condition, when our\r\nNeighbours do raise theirs, be a means to drain away our own\r\nMoney from us, and to divert that increase of Stock which\r\notherwise should come unto us, and consequently occasion the\r\ndecay of our own Trades and Manufactures, and the increase of\r\nForrein, as in the former Propositions hath been disputed, Then\r\nit were good to raise our Moneys when our Neighbours raise\r\ntheirs. But if this raising of our Moneys do introduced an unjust\r\nOppression to all those, who do live upon the Rents of their\r\nLands, upon Pensions, upon Fees, upon Wages, or otherwise upon\r\nany other Reward of their Industry, if it most of all disables\r\nthe King, and in the end doth threaten an extream Confusion and\r\nDisorder, then is this good of Raising so allayed with the evil\r\nthat followeth it, that we were as good if not better to be\r\nwithout it: From these Considerations hath this Proposition\r\nrisen, by which, the Authors thereof do presume, that we may both\r\nraise our Moneys as we find occasion and yet not raise; though\r\nthey seem contradictory: and we receive all the Benefits, which\r\nthe raising of Money doth bring with it, and yet avoid all the\r\nInconveniences which are alledged to follow it. Now the\r\nPropositions which have been made in this kind, both here and in\r\nother parts are very many, and differing one from another in\r\ntheir Proportions, and in some other subtile and by\r\nconsiderations, which if they should be set down in particular,\r\nwould much perplex the Subject. I will therefore by supposition\r\nset down a Proposition in a plain and easie Proportion for the\r\nmore ready apprehension of the Reader.\r\nAs for Example, Suppose the King should coin new twenty\r\nshilling pieces, which should hold in intrinsical value but\r\neighteen shillings and four pence in Proportion to the present\r\nGold; and new shillings, which should hold but eleven pence in\r\nProportion to the shillings of the present standard, and then it\r\nshould be ordain'd, that all former Contracts already past,\r\nshould be acquitted in old Money, or else in new Money, valuing\r\nevery 20s but at 18s 4d and so in Proportion of lesser sums; but\r\nthat all new contracts should be paid afterwards in new Money, or\r\nelse in old, valuing every 18s 4d of the old Money at 20s of the\r\nnew. By this means, say the Authors of this proposition, we shall\r\nbring back our own Money at 20s and drain away the Money of our\r\nNeighbours, and trades and Manufactures shall flourish in\r\nconsequence; yet our Moneys are raised, and yet no man shall\r\nreceive any injustice by it, for both the King and all other\r\nLords of Lands or contracted upon former Wages, shall be paid in\r\nMoney formerly current, or else in new proportionable to the old.\r\nAnd all those which are to pay Money, either out of their own\r\nIndustry or Labours, or out of the fruits of the earth, or by any\r\nother means, when they do see that they must contract for new\r\nMoney, apparently, according to the Proportion set down, worse\r\nthan the old, they will help themselves by raising their price in\r\nProportion unto it. There may likewise be alledged Examples for\r\nthis Proposition, as in Ireland when sterling Money and Irish\r\nMoney are both current, the one a fourth worse than the other\r\nwithout any Inconvenience. And it seemeth that anciently before\r\nthe time of Edward the first in England, there were Moneys\r\ncurrent of several standards; for although there be a few Records\r\nleft of Mint matters, more antient than Edward the Third, yet\r\nAnno sexto Reg. Johannis membrana sptima Dorso, certain old Money\r\nof baser standard was made current; But so, as no Jew or Merchant\r\nstranger might buy Merchandize, or pay debts with it, or any\r\nthing else, (but only victum et vestitum with that old Money,)\r\nbut in grossa et forti Moneta. And in France, until the time of\r\nPhilip le Bell (who was contemporant with Edward the Second) it\r\nseemeth that there were used several species of Money, And\r\nEddicts were made what Contracts should be acquitted in one\r\nspecies and what in another.\r\nBut I will come now, as in the former, to the examination of\r\nthis Proposition. first, the extreme Confusion is to be\r\nconsidered which it will bring among the People by raising\r\nQuestions what is to be paid in old Money and what is to be paid\r\nin new Money.\r\nAs for example, a man who lent Money before the time\r\nappointed for the currency of this Money, after the day,\r\nreceiveth interest for it, and so lets it run on, Whether shall\r\nthis be interpreted an old contract or a new? and divers other\r\nQuestions of like nature will arise. But suppose that such\r\nPrudence were used before hand as all such Questions might be\r\nprevented, yet certainly the intricasie of the accounts between\r\nthe old Money and the new, by Reason of the confused Fractions\r\nwhich are in it, would be a great molestation to the People: But\r\nthere lurketh a much greater Inconvenience which would not be\r\ndiscovered but by length of time; which is when you have thus\r\nraised the price of your Money, when other Nations shall raise\r\ntheirs again beyond your new Money, you must then be enforced to\r\nmake a second new Money of less intrinsical value than the first,\r\nand then again, all Contracts between the first and the second\r\nnew Money, are to be acquitted in the first new Money, or in the\r\nsecond new Money, valued in Proportion to the first, and so in\r\nconsequence of time, a third new Money would be coined, and a\r\nfourth, and a fifth, and so forward; that by degrees both the\r\nmultiplicity of the Moneys, and the variety of the times of the\r\ncontracts would pass all humane comprehension.\r\nAs for Examples alledged, they make more against the\r\nProposition than for it; for I doubt not, but in the time of King\r\nJohn, and afore and after that, there were great Varieties and\r\nconfusions in the Moneys current, and the Histories of those\r\nTimes are full of Complaints upon that subject. And therefore\r\nthey do most highly magnify the Wisdom of King Edward the First,\r\nwho settled a uniformity in that Subject, by introducing one\r\ncertain species of sterling Coin.\r\nAnd for the Example of France, the Histories of that Country\r\ndo not only justifie that there were great Confusions in this\r\nSubject in those times, but by great Insurrections of the People\r\nand Rebellions upon that occasion, insomuch, as the reputed\r\nAuthors of those Inventions were sacrificed to appease the\r\npopular Rage."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Chapter 23"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Of Coining of Moneys without Distinction of Weights"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"The Proposition, intended under this Title, is this, That the\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Money, hereafter, both of Gold and Silver should be coined of the\r\nsame fineness, that the Silver and crown Gold now are, but that\r\nthere should be coined no pieces of a certain weight either of\r\ngold or silver, but that the Allay being certain, the weight\r\nshould remain uncertain; that all Money now current should be\r\nvalued by a certain weight.\r\nAs for Example, That every ounce weight of Silver should be\r\nvalued at 5s. and every ounce weight of Gold at twelve times as\r\nmuch, or thirteen times so much, or such a Proportion as should\r\nbe thought most equal; and that all former Contracts should be\r\nacquitted in weight, by reducing every 100 l. sterling, into 400\r\nounces of Silver, or a proportionable weight of Gold, but that\r\nall future Contracts should be directly made in weight, as in\r\npounds, ounces, and the Sections of the ounce, either in Silver\r\nor proportionable weight in Gold: That there should be only\r\ncoined a certain Proportion of small Moneys in Silver, not in\r\nvalue above a penny, or two pence sterling, of a certain weight\r\nfor the accommodation of small ordinary payments. But that all\r\nthe main mass of Money, both of Silver and Gold, should have no\r\ncertain weight imposed on it, but should be current according to\r\nthe weight it had, as it should fall out. The Authors of this\r\nProposition maintain.\r\nThat the first Institution of Money was in this manner. That\r\nthis Addition of certainty of weight to the Allay, by making the\r\nstamp to serve as a publick Testimony that the piece so stamped\r\nor coined is not only of such a fineness but of such weight also,\r\nhave given occasion to all the Inconveniences that have since\r\ngrown in this Subject of Money, and that there is no other way to\r\nreform these Inconveniences stablely and permanently but by\r\nreducing the Money to this original Institution.\r\nAnd therefore they say, That the imposing of certain weight\r\nto the piece by the stamp hath given the Opportunity to the Kings\r\nand Common-wealths to help themselves in their necessities,\r\ndiminishing the Intrinsical value, and marking the piece of such\r\na weight, when as really it weigheth not so much; and thus much\r\nmay be observed in the first part of this Discourse of the\r\nHistorie of the Moneys of the Grecians and the Romans and other\r\nmodern States.\r\nThey say likewise, That this diminution of the intrinsical\r\nvalue by subtracting from the true weight of which the several\r\npieces of Money were first marked, hath introduced that practice\r\nof draining of Money from other Nations, by raising the price of\r\nit, which is the Mischief now grown into this Subject.\r\nThey say, That it hath given occasion to the culling of the\r\nheavier Money from the lighter, which is one of the greatest\r\nInstruments of Exportation, that it hath also given the occasion\r\nof washing, scaling, and clipping of Money, mischiefs that are\r\nnow grown very frequent.\r\nLastly, It hath given occasion by the use and wearing of the\r\nold Money to raise the price of the new and weighty Money in the\r\nEstimation of the People, and consequently to melt the old.\r\nBut although it should be acknowledged that these\r\nInconveniences have been introduced by these forms of Coinage now\r\nin use, yet it remains to be considered how they would be\r\nreformed by this new form of Coining. And first it is true, if\r\nthe form were used, it were not possible for any King or State to\r\nmake any advantage either by the raising of the price of Money or\r\ndiminishing the weight: neither could they indeed make any\r\nAdvantage by addition of Allay, if the Proposition be truly\r\nobserved. As for the raising of Money by other Nations, It is\r\nplain that the Observation of this Proposition, here in England,\r\nwould not hinder them to raise still, as now they do; but then it\r\nis to be considered, whether their raising would turn to our\r\nDisadvantage as now it doth.\r\nAnd first, if other Nations raise their Money, they can\r\nneither by that raising make their Moneys valuable to us, nor\r\nmake our Money more valuable to them; when as before their\r\nraising or after their raising, they can give it no other value\r\nthan by weight, because the pieces are uncertain.\r\nBut it may be objected, That when our Neighbours raise their\r\nMoney, then will our Money (being al by weight) go further to be\r\ncoined into theirs, than it would have done before and\r\nconsequently for that profit will be transported until the price\r\nof their commodities do grow up unto their Money.\r\nTo which it may be answered, That they cannot set an higher\r\nprice upon the pieces of our Money as now they use to do, because\r\nthe piece hath no certain weight, then they cannot cull out the\r\npieces as (now they do) which over-weight, and so by converting\r\nthem into their own Money, make benefit of them, so as there is\r\nno way left unto them to make profit of our Money when it is\r\ntransported, but to deliver it into the Mint to be here coined\r\ninto their Money; in which case the Transporter must of necessity\r\nloose all the charge of the coinage here, together with the Kings\r\nTribute, and he must also loose the like charge in the place\r\nwhere he coins it a new. Both which put together would make so\r\ngreat a Proportion, as no raising for the drawing of Silver or\r\nGold, into any State at one time hath hath ever equalled it.\r\nBut yet this Scruple remains unsatisfied, That at least the\r\nBullion, which otherwise would have come unto you, will be in the\r\nmean time diverted until the price of Commodities be grown up to\r\nthe value of their Money as it is raised. But it is manifest,\r\nthat all other mischiefs set down before would be taken away by\r\nthis Proposition, as culling, washing, scaling and clipping of\r\nMoney, for that no benefit could possibly be made by them, and\r\nthat equality of Exchange formerly propounded would by this means\r\nbe brought the nearest to perfection of any other; for that the\r\nMerchant, first shall understand the true value of his own Money,\r\nand cannot make the account of Exchange in a forrein place, but\r\nby comparing their Moneys in true weight and fineness with his\r\nown; so as he cannot be deceived either by a false reputed value\r\nof his own Money, or of the Money which he is to receive by\r\nExchange, and therefore will not make his Exchange to loss,\r\nexcept he be induced thereunto by some other circumstances which\r\nhave no relation to the Subject of Money.\r\nBut having thus far debated of the Commodities and Benefits\r\nof this Proposition and prevention of former Inconveniences; It\r\nnow remains to be inquired what new Inconveniences this\r\nProposition would bring with it.\r\nAnd first, The alteration would be very strange, and with\r\ngreat difficulty would be received by the People in a matter that\r\nis of most general and continual use of all others, in stead of\r\naccounting by a pound sterling, angels, shillings, and groats, to\r\ncome now to accompt by Pound weights, Marks, Ounces, Scruples,\r\nand Drachmas; to which the only answer to be made is,\r\nThat although the Trouble and Difficultie would be very\r\ngreat, yet being once settled, it would be settled for ever,\r\nwhereas now the Trouble and Inconvenience which the People endure\r\nin this matter of Money is often renewed, but never amended.\r\nA second Objection is, The Extream molestation which the\r\nPeople should receive in the practice of it, when as every man\r\nshould be bound to carry scales in his pocket (as they say they\r\ndo in China) and upon every little payment be bound to weigh\r\ntheir Money.\r\nTo which it may be answered, That there have been antiently\r\nProclamations in England, and very lately in France, to avoid the\r\nfrequency of washing, clipping and scaling, to oblige the People\r\nto weigh their pieces of Silver as well as of Gold, but for the\r\nSilver, the People could never be brought unto it; whereas by\r\nthis Proposition, of Necessity, every man receives Money must be\r\ntied to weigh the Silver as well as the Gold, and all these\r\nInconveniences of scaling, washing, culling, and wearing, would\r\nbe avoided with a small part of that trouble to the People,which\r\nthe weighing of the several pieces of Silver would put them unto,\r\npartly because the least and most ordinary payments would be\r\naccommodated by the small pieces coined of a certain weight, and\r\npartly because the trouble of smaller payments would be\r\nrecompenced by the ease of the greater; for by this course a\r\nthousand pounds will be as soon weighed as twenty shillings can\r\nnow be reckoned.\r\nA third Objection may be made against it, That by this\r\nProposition Princes and States would be deprived of the means to\r\nmake secret benefit of their Moneys, which hath been continually\r\npractised, and especially in times of eminent necessity, even to\r\nthe preservation of Kingdomes.\r\nTo this is answered, That the Objection though it be true is\r\nyet of no weight, because that profit so made, is first made\r\nunjustly, and by the breach of publick Faith, and then it is but\r\na false seeming profit, and always mischievous to the People, and\r\nreally not good for the receivers of it. And (as it was formerly\r\ntouched) it may be observed, That after the decay of the Roman\r\nEmpire, the Reglements of the Mint of that great Monarchy being\r\nlost, through the Inundations of barbarous People (as many other\r\nexcellent Institutions were) the Jews (who by God's Curse were\r\ndispers'd into all Nations, and being suffered to acquire no\r\nnatural possessions, betook themselves to artificial possessions;\r\nespecially gave themselves to the Study of the nature of this\r\nmatter of Money as their Patrimony) in most Countries were\r\nimployed in the affairs of the Mint: and to them succeeded the\r\nItalians, as it may be observed here in England, where for some\r\nAges, after the expulsion of the Jews, there were no Masters of\r\nthe Mint but Italians of Lucca or Genoa: Now these People being\r\nsubtil Masters of their Art, and having no natural affection to\r\nthese Countries where they were imployed, but aiming only to keep\r\ntheir own Mills grinding, did by projects of colourable profit,\r\nabuse those States where they were trusted, and keep them in\r\ncontinual alteration of their Coin, which always in the end\r\nturned to diminution of the intrinsical value; and therefore,\r\nfinally this Proposition seemeth to me most strange and remote\r\nfrom common apprehension of all the rest; but, being duly\r\nweighed, the least Inconvenient and most likely to produce good\r\neffect of any of the others. And thus I have set down all the\r\nRemedies, that by enquiry I could learn, to have bin propounded\r\neither in England, or in other parts for the Inconveniences grown\r\ninto this Subject of Money, wherein all the particular Projects\r\nthat have made the same projects, varied only in form, or in some\r\nby circumstances, yet I do believe, that hardly (one) can be\r\nquoted, whereof the ground and essence is not here set down and\r\ndebated.\r\nAnd, if the Reader, that with attention and care shall\r\nhave made his way through this intricate Discourse, shall in the\r\nend complain that after all his pains, he finds himself as little\r\nresolved what is fit to be done in this subject as before,\r\nconsidering the variety and contrariety of the consideration\r\nincident unto it, I must apeal whether I did not from the\r\nbeginning profess to set down nothing but problematically, and\r\nthat my Scope was not to render the Reader able to find out the\r\nfittest course to govern this matter of Money and coin, but able\r\nto judge of what should be propounded by others: a point of so\r\ngreat Importance, that for want of that ability the wisest States\r\nand the greatest Councils of Christendom, for many Ages, have\r\nbeen abused by misterious names, and perplexed subtities of Mint\r\nmen, gold smiths, and Exchangers; who, as they had the whole\r\nknowledge of this subject in themselves, so they had their\r\nseveral Interests, and I conceive that I have performed all the\r\npoints that I have undertaken in this discourse; save on, which\r\nis that speaking of the several means of raising of Money, I said\r\nthat the Occasions thereof had been two,\r\nThe one for the drawing of Money from the neighbouring\r\nCountries, or preserving of their own.\r\nThe other, when the States without any such pretence, but\r\nforced only by the violence of Necessity to raise means of\r\nSubsistence for themselves, have doubled and trebled, nay\r\nsometimes sextupled the values of their Moneys, of which I\r\npromised to speak further: and for this purpose, I intend to set\r\ndown, --\r\nThe history of the most memorable Raisings that have been in\r\nthis kind, both in our Age and heretofore, of what nature they\r\nwere, and how these States did draw their Benefit and Subsistence\r\nout of them.\r\nSecondly, What other Extremities and Confusions, those\r\nRaisings did draw the said States, and the People thereof.\r\nThirdly, What Remedies these States have applyed to reduce\r\nand settle those Extremities and Confusions whereinto they were\r\nfallen, in which History I shall come to touch some Examples very\r\nmodern, as that which of late years was made by the Emperour\r\nwhich now reigns, especially in the higher parts of Germany, a\r\nraising so high and excessive as it equals any of the antient\r\nExamples, even of those mentioned by Pliny, to be practised by\r\nthe Romans in their great extremities in the Punick Wars, whether\r\nyou respect the excess of the Multiplication, or the Strangeness\r\nof the effects which it produced; the most famous Occasions,\r\nwhich I purpose to examine were,\r\nFirst, Those Raisings, mentioned by Pliny to be, by the\r\nRomans in the first Punick Wars, which was to make every piece of\r\nCoin current at six times the value of what it was before, since\r\nwhich time, although there were sundry raisings made by the\r\nRomans, yet none of them was neer this Proportion.\r\nIn the Kingdom of France, I cannot find any extraordinary\r\nraisings made of the Money, until the time of Phillip le Bell and\r\nCharles le Bell, and then the Kings of France, did raise an\r\nordinary tribute by coining Moneys of a base value, and when they\r\nwere dispersed in the Peoples hands, suddenly calling them back\r\nagain, and making them uncurrent, by which they got extreamly\r\nboth by the coinage and recalling them; for that none might\r\nexchange or melt these Moneys so recalled, but the Officers\r\nappointed by the King, which was a Gain of a most unjust and\r\ngrievous condition that ever was practised in any Kingdom, and\r\ndid accordingly produce great Tumults and Seditions there; yet\r\nhis practice did remain until the time of Charles the fifth,\r\notherwise called the wise, whereof (besides the Records of the\r\nMint in that Kingdom which do shew the perpetual alterations of\r\nthe Moneys in these times) I do remember two memorable Evidences\r\nout of Histories, of which one is,\r\nThat at what time the State of France, during the desolation\r\nof that Countrey by the English Wars, did grant unto the King the\r\nGabel of Salt, and the Impost upon Wine, they did particularly\r\nCovenant, That for such a space the King should not alter the\r\nstandards of his Coin.\r\nOne other is, that Hollingshead in his Chronicle making\r\nmention of a voyage made by the black Prince from Burdeaux into\r\nLanguedock doth cite the Letter of one Sir John Wingfield, a\r\nprincipal Servant to the Prince, wherein he saith, That the\r\nCountries and good Towns, which were wasted at this Journey,\r\nfound to the King of France every year more to the maintenance of\r\nhis War than half his Realm besides, except the Exchanges of his\r\nMoney which he maketh every year, and his Customes of Poitou. But\r\nthe standard of his Moneys was stabely kept from Charles the\r\nFifths time till the first year of Charles the Seventh, at which\r\ntime the English being in possession of the greatest part of\r\nFrance, Charles the Seventh having no other means to maintain the\r\nWars, did from the year one thousand four hundred seventeen, to\r\nthe year one thousand hundred twenty three, raise the silver by\r\nseveral degrees from eight livres nine sols the mark to 360\r\nlivres the mark, so as the Money was raised in six years above\r\nforty times the value of what it was before; of all which neither\r\nour Chronicles nor those of France do make but ???nder mention,\r\nin respect of what they speak of the Pucelle d'Orleans: And yet\r\nthe Truth of it is evident by the Records of the Mint: and all\r\nthose who have written of the affairs of the Mint, in that\r\nKingdom, do unanimously agree that this was the Principal mean by\r\nwhich is as strange as all the rest, is, that at one instant the\r\nMoney was reduced again to seven livres, ten sols the mark; and\r\nfrom that time there have not been any raising of Money in France\r\nof this nature, although the Moneys there have been continually\r\nraised ever since, either to follow the People, who did first\r\nraise their Moneys by their estimation, or to follow the raisings\r\nof other Nations, or to raise above other Nations, to draw their\r\nMoney into that Kingdom.\r\nIn England there is but one Example of raising in this kind,\r\nwhich was begun in the eighteenth year of Henry the Eighth, and\r\ncontinued in divers Princes Reigns after, and was not absolutely\r\nreduced, until the fourteenth year of Queen Elizabeth; and this\r\nraising, although it were far short in Proportion to those\r\nformerly recited, it was much more inexcusable than they were,\r\nfor that this Action though it be never justifiable, yet in a\r\ncase of extream and unresistable Necessitie, it may be excused,\r\nwhich was not the case of Henry the Eight, for although he wanted\r\nMoney, yet there were much more justifiable wayes to supply it;\r\nand it was not imployed to avoid his own ruin, but in ambitious\r\nEnterprises.\r\nThe next in time was that raising Money by the overmixture of\r\nally made in Ireland, in the three and fortieth year of Queen\r\nElizabeth's Reign, which although it were not excessive in\r\nProportion, and lasted but a small time, yet had very many\r\nmemorable Circumstances to be observed in it.\r\nThe last which I will mention is that which was made by the\r\nEmperor (which now lives) in the year --- who being reduced\r\nwithin the Walls of Vienna, and having almost nothing else left\r\nhim, but the Soverain title of the Empire, did by coining of the\r\nlesser and baser kind of Money five times baser than formerly it\r\nwas, extend five times further in use, for the present, than\r\notherwise he could have done, all those Moneys which he drew by\r\nway of assistance from the King of Spain, or from the Pope, or\r\nfrom other Princes of Italy; and besides, having a part of the\r\nprofit of the Mint in divers other parts of Germany, he did\r\nexceedingly support his Affairs at the present by that means; and\r\nit was a principal occasion by which he prevailed against the\r\nKing of Bohemia, who although for his part also, he raised his\r\nMoneys three times in value to what they were before (yet as he\r\nwas always a strict observer of the contributions of the Empire)\r\nhe coined no other small Moneys, but those of his own stamp, and\r\nthey were only current within his own Countries.\r\nNow all these several Raisings which I have mentioned, were\r\nnot all by one way, but indeed they were by all ways differing\r\nfrom one another; and as the Ways of making profit by the Raising\r\ndid differ, so the Inconveniences which follow did differ\r\nlikewise, and as the Inconveniences did differ, so the ways of\r\nReduction did differ also, all which will require a long and\r\ncurious Disquisition but I do leave it to a second breathing."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Lord Coke's Account of Coin and Coining"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Coin in 6 E. 1 was but 20d the ounce, but now it is above thrice\r\nso much: Stat. de Glocestr. c.
