There was his father's grave, and his father's\r\nfather's grave, and there were the places for my mother and\r\nfor my two brothers and for my sister and for me.  I counted\r\nthem all, when the others had gone back to the house.  I paced\r\nup and down alone, measuring the ground; there was\r\nroom enough for us all; and in the western corner where a\r\nyoung elm-tree was growing,--that would be my place, for I was\r\nthe youngest.  How tall would the elm-tree be then?  I had\r\nnever thought of it before.  It seemed to make me sad and\r\nrestless,--wishing for something, I knew not what,--longing to\r\nsee the world and to taste happiness before I must sleep\r\nbeneath the elm-tree.  Then I looked off to the blue hills,\r\nshadowy and dream-like, the boundary of the little world that\r\nI knew.  And there, in a cleft between the highest peaks I saw\r\na wondrous thing: for the place at which I was looking seemed\r\nto come nearer and nearer to me; I saw the trees, the rocks,\r\nthe ferns, the white road winding before me; the enfolding\r\nhills unclosed like leaves, and in the heart of them I saw a\r\nBlue Flower, so bright, so beautiful that my eyes filled with\r\ntears as I looked.
