But to me everything is so perfectly the same that I seem to be  living my youth over again; all the forgotten impressions of that  enchanting time come back to me.  At the moment they were powerful  enough; but they afterwards faded away.  What in the world became of  them?  Whatever becomes of such things, in the long intervals of  consciousness?  Where do they hide themselves away? in what unvisited  cupboards and crannies of our being do they preserve themselves?   They are like the lines of a letter written in sympathetic ink; hold  the letter to the fire for a while and the grateful warmth brings out  the invisible words.  It is the warmth of this yellow sun of Florence  that has been restoring the text of my own young romance; the thing  has been lying before me today as a clear, fresh page.  There have  been moments during the last ten years when I have fell so  portentously old, so fagged and finished, that I should have taken as  a very bad joke any intimation that this present sense of juvenility  was still in store for me.  It won't last, at any rate; so I had  better make the best of it.  But I confess it surprises me.  I have  led too serious a life; but that perhaps, after all, preserves one's  youth.  At all events, I have travelled too far, I have worked too  hard, I have lived in brutal climates and associated with tiresome  people.  When a man has reached his fifty-second year without being,  materially, the worse for wear--when he has fair health, a fair  fortune, a tidy conscience and a complete exemption from embarrassing  relatives--I suppose he is bound, in delicacy, to write himself  happy.  But I confess I shirk this obligation.  I have not been  miserable; I won't go so far as to say that--or at least as to write  it.  But happiness--positive happiness--would have been something  different.  I don't know that it would have been better, by all  measurements--that it would have left me better off at the present  time.  But it certainly would have made this difference--that I  should not have been reduced, in pursuit of pleasant images, to  disinter a buried episode of more than a quarter of a century ago.  I  should have found entertainment more--what shall I call it?--more  contemporaneous.  I should have had a wife and children, and I should  not be in the way of making, as the French say, infidelities to the  present.  Of course it's a great gain to have had an escape, not to  have committed an act of thumping folly; and I suppose that, whatever  serious step one might have taken at twenty-five, after a struggle,  and with a violent effort, and however one's conduct might appear to  be justified by events, there would always remain a certain element  of regret; a certain sense of loss lurking in the sense of gain; a  tendency to wonder, rather wishfully, what MIGHT have been.  What  might have been, in this case, would, without doubt, have been very  sad, and what has been has been very cheerful and comfortable; but  there are nevertheless two or three questions I might ask myself.   Why, for instance, have I never married--why have I never been able  to care for any woman as I cared for that one?  Ah, why are the  mountains blue and why is the sunshine warm?  Happiness mitigated by  impertinent conjectures--that's about my ticket."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"6th.--I knew it wouldn't last; it's already passing away.  But I have  spent a delightful day; I have been strolling all over the place.   Everything reminds me of something else, and yet of itself at the  same time; my imagination makes a great circuit and comes back to the  starting-point.  There is that well-remembered odour of spring in the  air, and the flowers, as they used to be, are gathered into great  sheaves and stacks, all along the rugged base of the Strozzi Palace.   I wandered for an hour in the Boboli Gardens; we went there several  times together.  I remember all those days individually; they seem to  me as yesterday.  I found the corner where she always chose to sit-- the bench of sun-warmed marble, in front of the screen of ilex, with  that exuberant statue of Pomona just beside it.  The place is exactly  the same, except that poor Pomona has lost one of her tapering  fingers.  I sat there for half an hour, and it was strange how near  to me she seemed.  The place was perfectly empty--that is, it was  filled with HER.  I closed my eyes and listened; I could almost hear  the rustle of her dress on the gravel.  Why do we make such an ado  about death?  What is it, after all, but a sort of refinement of  life?  She died ten years ago, and yet, as I sat there in the sunny  stillness, she was a palpable, audible presence.  I went afterwards  into the gallery of the palace, and wandered for an hour from room to  room.  The same great pictures hung in the same places, and the same  dark frescoes arched above them.  Twice, of old, I went there with  her; she had a great understanding of art.  She understood all sorts  of things.  Before the Madonna of the Chair I stood a long time.  The  face is not a particle like hers, and yet it reminded me of her.  But  everything does that.  We stood and looked at it together once for  half an hour; I remember perfectly what she said."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"8th.--Yesterday I felt blue--blue and bored; and when I got up this  morning I had half a mind to leave Florence.  But I went out into the  street, beside the Arno, and looked up and down--looked at the yellow  river and the violet hills, and then decided to remain--or rather, I  decided nothing.  I simply stood gazing at the beauty of Florence,  and before I had gazed my fill I was in good-humour again, and it was  too late to start for Rome.  I strolled along the quay, where  something presently happened that rewarded me for staying.  I stopped  in front of a little jeweller's shop, where a great many objects in  mosaic were exposed in the window; I stood there for some minutes--I  don't know why, for I have no taste for mosaic.  In a moment a little  girl came and stood beside me--a little girl with a frowsy Italian  head, carrying a basket.  I turned away, but, as I turned, my eyes  happened to fall on her basket.  It was covered with a napkin, and on  the napkin was pinned a piece of paper, inscribed with an address.   This address caught my glance--there was a name on it I knew.  It was  very legibly written--evidently by a scribe who had made up in zeal  what was lacking in skill.  Contessa Salvi-Scarabelli, Via  Ghibellina--so ran the superscription; I looked at it for some  moments; it caused me a sudden emotion.

But he hesitated, very  properly, to talk with a perfect stranger about a lady whom he knew,  and he had not the art to conceal his hesitation.  I instantly felt  it to be singular that though he regarded me as a perfect stranger, I  had not the same feeling about him.  Whether it was that I had seen  him before, or simply that I was struck with his agreeable young  face--at any rate, I felt myself, as they say here, in sympathy with  him.  If I have seen him before I don't remember the occasion, and  neither, apparently, does he; I suppose it's only a part of the  feeling I have had the last three days about everything.

I stopped and looked at my companion, and he blushed a  little.  "And Bianca Salvi," I continued, "was the most charming  woman in the world."  He blushed a little more, and I laid my hand on  his shoulder.  "Do you know why I tell you this?  Because you remind  me of what I was when I knew her--when I loved her."  My poor young  Englishman gazed at me with a sort of embarrassed and fascinated  stare, and still I went on.  "I say that\'s the reason I told you  this--but you\'ll think it a strange reason.  You remind me of my  younger self.  You needn\'t resent that--I was a charming young  fellow.  The Countess Salvi thought so.

"You don\'t know why a stranger should  suddenly address you in this way and pretend to read your thoughts.   Doubtless you think me a little cracked.  Perhaps I am eccentric; but  it\'s not so bad as that.  I have lived about the world a great deal,  following my profession, which is that of a soldier.  I have been in  India, in Africa, in Canada, and I have lived a good deal alone.   That inclines people, I think, to sudden bursts of confidence.  A  week ago I came into Italy, where I spent six months when I was your  age.  I came straight to Florence--I was eager to see it again, on  account of associations.  They have been crowding upon me ever so  thickly.  I have taken the liberty of giving you a hint of them."

He continues to represent to me, in the  most extraordinary manner, my own young identity; the correspondence  is perfect at all points, save that he is a better boy than I.  He is  evidently acutely interested in his Countess, and leads quite the  same life with her that I led with Madame de Salvi.  He goes to see  her every evening and stays half the night; these Florentines keep  the most extraordinary hours.  I remember, towards 3 A.M., Madame de  Salvi used to turn me out.--\"Come, come,\" she would say, \"it's time  to go.  If you were to stay later people might talk.\"  I don't know  at what time he comes home, but I suppose his evening seems as short  as mine did.  Today he brought me a message from his Contessa--a very  gracious little speech.  She remembered often to have heard her  mother speak of me--she called me her English friend.  All her  mother's friends were dear to her, and she begged I would do her the  honour to come and see her.  She is always at home of an evening.   Poor young Stanmer (he is of the Devonshire Stanmers--a great  property) reported this speech verbatim, and of course it can't in  the least signify to him that a poor grizzled, battered soldier, old  enough to be his father, should come to call upon his inammorata.   But I remember how it used to matter to me when other men came;  that's a point of difference.  However, it's only because I'm so old.   At twenty-five I shouldn't have been afraid of myself at fifty-two.   Camerino was thirty-four--and then the others!  She was always at  home in the evening, and they all used to come.  They were old  Florentine names.  But she used to let me stay after them all; she  thought an old English name as good.  What a transcendent coquette! .  . . But basta cosi as she used to say.  I meant to go tonight to Casa  Salvi, but I couldn't bring myself to the point.  I don't know what  I'm afraid of; I used to be in a hurry enough to go there once.

She is a  wonderful likeness of her mother; I couldn't get over it.  Beautiful  like her mother, and yet with the same faults in her face; but with  her mother's perfect head and brow and sympathetic, almost pitying,  eyes.  Her face has just that peculiarity of her mother's, which, of  all human countenances that I have ever known, was the one that  passed most quickly and completely from the expression of gaiety to  that of repose.  Repose in her face always suggested sadness; and  while you were watching it with a kind of awe, and wondering of what  tragic secret it was the token, it kindled, on the instant, into a  radiant Italian smile.  The Countess Scarabelli's smiles tonight,  however, were almost uninterrupted.  She greeted me--divinely, as her  mother used to do; and young Stanmer sat in the corner of the sofa-- as I used to do--and watched her while she talked.  She is thin and  very fair, and was dressed in light, vaporous black that completes  the resemblance.  The house, the rooms, are almost absolutely the  same; there may be changes of detail, but they don't modify the  general effect.  There are the same precious pictures on the walls of  the salon--the same great dusky fresco in the concave ceiling.  The  daughter is not rich, I suppose, any more than the mother.

The gentleman in question had demanded satisfaction for  his outraged honour; but for some reason or other (the Countess, to  do her justice, did not tell me that her husband was a coward), he  had not as yet obtained it.  The duel with Camerino had come on  first; in an access of jealous fury the Count had struck Camerino in  the face; and this outrage, I know not how justly, was deemed  expiable before the other.  By an extraordinary arrangement (the  Italians have certainly no sense of fair play) the other man was  allowed to be Camerino's second.  The duel was fought with swords,  and the Count received a wound of which, though at first it was not  expected to be fatal, he died on the following day.  The matter was  hushed up as much as possible for the sake of the Countess's good  name, and so successfully that it was presently observed that, among  the public, the other gentleman had the credit of having put his  blade through M. de Salvi.  This gentleman took a fancy not to  contradict the impression, and it was allowed to subsist.
