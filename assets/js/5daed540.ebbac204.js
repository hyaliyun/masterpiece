They knew fairly well what to expect, and were\r\nnot disturbed by their new conditions.  Though they had\r\napparently gained a good deal in weight as a result of their\r\nethereal journey, this did not incommode them; for though\r\nJupiter's volume is thirteen hundred times that of the earth, on\r\naccount of its lesser specific gravity, it has but three hundred\r\ntimes the mass--i. e., it would weigh but three hundred times as\r\nmuch.  Further, although a cubic foot of water or anything else\r\nweighs 2.5 as much as on earth, objects near the equator, on\r\naccount of Jupiter's rapid rotation, weigh one fifth less than\r\nthey do at the poles, by reason of the centrifugal force.\r\nInfluenced by this fact, and also because they were 483,000,000\r\nmiles from the sun, instead of 92,000,000 as on earth, they had\r\nsteered for the northern limit of Jupiter's tropics.  And, in\r\naddition to this, they could easily apply the apergetic power in\r\nany degree to themselves when beyond the limits of the Callisto,\r\nand so be attracted to any extent, from twice the pull they\r\nreceive from gravitation on earth to almost nothing."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Bearwarden and Ayrault shouldered their rifles, while Dr.\r\nCortlandt took a repeating shot-gun with No. 4 shot, and, having\r\nalso some hunting-knives and a sextant, all three set out in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction.  The ground was rather soft, and a warm\r\nvapor seemed to rise from it.  To the east the sky was veiled by\r\ndense clouds of smoke from the towering volcanoes, while on their\r\nleft the forest seemed to extend without limit.

Although the sun was still far\r\nabove the horizon, the rapidity with which it was descending\r\nshowed that the short night of less than five hours would soon be\r\nupon them; and though short it might be very dark, for they were\r\nin the tropics, and the sun, going down perpendicularly, must\r\nalso pass completely around the globe, instead of, as in northern\r\nlatitudes on earth in summer, approaching the horizon obliquely,\r\nand not going far below it.

At\r\npresent the earth's axis--that is, the line passing through its\r\ncentre and the two poles--is inclined to the ecliptic about\r\ntwenty-three and a half degrees.

In one case the\r\nsun's rays are caused to shine more perpendicularly, and in the\r\nother more obliquely.  This wabbling, like that of a top, is the\r\nsole cause of the seasons; since, owing to the eccentricity of\r\nour orbit, the earth is actually fifteen hundred thousand miles\r\nnearer the sun during our winter, in the northern hemisphere,\r\nthan in summer.  That there is no limit to a planet's\r\ninclination, and that inclination is not essential, we have\r\nastronomical proof.

Picture to\r\nyourselves the ascending currents at the equator moving off to\r\nthe poles from which they came.  As they move north they are\r\ncontinually coming to parts of the globe having smaller circles\r\nof latitude than those they have left, and therefore not moved\r\nforward as rapidly by the earth\'s daily rotation as the latitudes\r\nnearer the equator.  The winds consequently run ahead of the\r\nsurface, and so move east of north--the earth turning towards the\r\neast--while the heavier colder surface currents, rushing towards\r\nthe equator to take the place of the ascending column, coming\r\nfrom regions where the surface whirls comparatively slowly to\r\nthose where it is rotating faster, are continually left behind,\r\nand so move southwest; while south of the equator a corresponding\r\nmotion results.  Though this is not the most exact explanation,\r\nit may serve to make the action clear.  I will add, that if any\r\none prefers a colder or a warmer climate than that of the place\r\nin which he lives, he need only go north or south for an hour;\r\nor, if he prefers his own latitude, he can rise a few thousand\r\nfeet in the air, or descend to one of the worked-out coal-mines\r\nwhich are now used as sanitariums, and secure his object by a\r\nslight change of altitude.

Whether, when apergy is developed,\r\ngravitation is temporarily annulled, or reversed like the late\r\nattraction of a magnet when the current is changed, or whether it\r\nis merely overpowered, in which case your motion will be the\r\nresultant of the two, is an unsettled and not very important\r\npoint; for, though we know but little more of the nature of\r\nelectricity than was known a hundred years ago, this does not\r\nprevent our producing and using it.\""}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Jupiter, when in opposition," he continued, "is about\r\n380,000,000 miles from us, and it takes light, which travels at\r\nthe rate of 190,000 miles a second, just thirty-four minutes to\r\nreach the earth from Jupiter.

As it takes but\r\nlittle longer to complete a revolution than Mars does to rotate\r\non its axis, it remains in the Martial sky one hundred and\r\nthirty-two hours between rising and setting, passing through all\r\nthe phases from new moon to full and back again four times; that\r\nis, it swings four times around Mars before going below the\r\nhorizon.

It would be\r\nbetter, therefore, to have such a sun as you describe and\r\naccompany it in a yacht or private car like this, well stocked\r\nwith oxygen and provisions.  When passing through meteoric swarms\r\nor masses of solid matter, collision with which is the most\r\nserious risk we run, the car could follow behind its sun instead\r\nof revolving around it, and be kept from falling into it by\r\npartially reversing the attraction.

The\r\nCarboniferous period is essentially one of  great forest growth;\r\nso there would be nothing out of the way in supposing the spot,\r\nnotwithstanding its length of twenty-seven thousand miles and its\r\nbreadth of eight thousand miles, to have been forest.  It\r\noccurred in what would correspond to the temperate region on\r\nearth.  Now, though the axis of this planet is practically\r\nstraight, the winds of course change their direction, and so the\r\ntemperature does vary from day to day.  What is more probable\r\nthan that, owing perhaps to a prolonged norther or cold spell, a\r\nlong strip of forest lying near the frost line was brought a few\r\ndegrees below it, so that the leaves changed their colours as\r\nthey do on earth?  It would, it seems to me, be enough to give\r\nthe surface a distinct colour; and the fact that the spot\'s\r\ngreatest length was east and west, or along the lines of\r\nlatitude, so that the whole of that region might have been\r\nexposed to the same conditions of temperature, strengthens this\r\nhypothesis.  The strongest objection is, that the spot is said to\r\nhave moved; but the motion--five seconds--was so slight that it\r\nmight easily have been an error in observation, or the first area\r\naffected by the cold may have been enlarged on one side.  It\r\nseems to me that the stability the spot DID have would make the\r\ncloud theory impossible on earth, and much more so here, with the\r\nfar more rapid rotation and more violent winds.  It may also have\r\nbeen a cloud of smoke from a volcano in eruption, such as we saw\r\non our arrival, though it is doubtful whether in that case it\r\nwould have remained nearly stationary while going through its\r\ngreatest intensity and fading, which would look as though the\r\nturned leaves had fallen off and been gradually replaced by new\r\nones; and, in addition to this, the spot since it was first\r\nnoticed has never entirely disappeared, which might mean a\r\nvolcanic region constantly emitting smoke, or that the surface,\r\ndoubtless from some covering whose colour can change, is normally\r\nof a different shade from the surrounding region.  In any case,\r\nwe have as yet seen nothing that would indicate a permanently\r\nclouded atmosphere."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Though they had walked a considerable distance, the water was not\r\nmuch cooled; and though the stream's descent was so slight that\r\non earth its current would have been very slow, here it rushed\r\nalong like a mountain torrent, the reason, of course, being that\r\na given amount of water on Jupiter would depress a spring balance\r\n2.55 times as much as on the earth."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"It is strange," said Ayrault, "that, notwithstanding its great\r\nspeed, the water remains so hot; you would think its motion would\r\ncool it."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"So it does," answered the professor.

One round was enough to put it\r\nin the water, each explosion removing several cubic feet of wood.\r\nBy repeating this process on other trees they soon had enough\r\nlarge timber for buoyancy, so that they had but to superimpose\r\nlighter cross-logs and bind the whole together with pliable\r\nbranches and creepers to form a substantial raft.  The doctor\r\nclimbed on, after which Bearwarden and Ayrault cast off, having\r\nprepared long poles for navigating.  With a little care they kept\r\ntheir bark from catching on projecting roots, and as the stream\r\ncontinued to widen till it was about one hundred yards across,\r\ntheir work became easy.  Carried along at a speed of two or three\r\nmiles an hour, they now saw that the water and the banks they\r\npassed were literally alive with reptiles and all sorts of\r\namphibious creatures, while winged lizards sailed from every\r\noverhanging branch into the water as they approached.

At a\r\nsignal from Cortlandt, who was to attract the monster's\r\nattention, the wings were to advance simultaneously.  These\r\narrangements they carried out to the letter.  When Bearwarden and\r\nAyrault had gone about twenty-five yards on either side, the\r\ndoctor imitated the peculiar grunting sound of an alligator, at\r\nwhich the colossal monster turned and faced him, while Bearwarden\r\nand Ayrault moved to the attack.  The plan of this was good, for,\r\nwith his attention fixed on three objects, the dinosaur seemed\r\nconfused, and though Bearwarden and Ayrault had good angles from\r\nwhich to shoot, there was no possibility of their hitting each\r\nother.  They therefore advanced steadily with their rifles half\r\nup.  Though their own danger increased with each step, in the\r\nevent of their missing, the chance of their shooting wild\r\ndecreased, the idea being to reach the brain through the eye.\r\nCortlandt's part had also its risks, for, being entirely\r\ndefenceless with his shot-gun against the large creature, whose\r\nattention it was his duty to attract, he staked all on the\r\nmarksmanship of his friends.  Not considering this, however, he\r\nstood his ground, having the thumb-piece on his Winchester\r\nmagazine shoved up and ready to make a noisy diversion if\r\nnecessary in behalf of either wing.  Having aroused the monster's\r\ncuriosity, Cortlandt sprang up, waving his arms and his gun.  The\r\ndinosaur lowered his head as if to charge, thereby bringing it to\r\na level with the rifles, either of which could have given it the\r\nfatal shot.  But as their fingers pressed the triggers the\r\nreptile soared up thirty feet in the air.  Ayrault pulled for his\r\nfirst sight, shooting through the lower jaw, and shivering that\r\nmember, while Bearwarden changed his aim and sighted straight for\r\nthe heart.  In an instant the monster was down again, just\r\nmissing Ayrault's head as he stepped back, and Bearwarden's rifle\r\npoured a stream of explosive balls against its side, rending and\r\nblowing away the heavy scales.  Having drawn the dinosaur's\r\nattention to himself, he retreated, while Ayrault renewed the\r\nattack.

But they knew that, if pressed for time,\r\nthey could rise above the limits of the atmosphere, and move with\r\nplanetary speed; while, if they wished a still easier method of\r\npursuing their observation, they had but to remain poised between\r\nthe sun and Jupiter, beyond the latter's upper air, and\r\nphotograph or map it as it revolved before them."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"By sunset they had gone a hundred miles.

The coast-line ran\r\nalmost due north and south, while the volcanoes that dotted it,\r\nand that had been luminous during the night, now revealed their\r\nnature only by lines of smoke and vapours.

The mountains and\r\ncliffs had been but little cut down by water and frost action,\r\nand seemed in the full vigour of their youth, which was what the\r\ntravellers had a right to expect on a globe that was still\r\ncooling and shrinking, and consequently throwing up ridges in the\r\nshape of mountains far more rapidly than a planet as matured and\r\nquiescent as the earth.

Either the proximity of the\r\ninternal heat to the surface prevents water from freezing in all\r\nlatitudes, or Jupiter's axis has always been very nearly\r\nperpendicular to its orbit, and consequently the thermometer has\r\nnever been much below thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit; for, at the\r\nconsiderable distance we are now from the sun, it is easy to\r\nconceive that, with the axis much inclined, there might be cold\r\nweather, during the Northern hemisphere's winter, that would last\r\nfor about six of our years, even as near the equator as this.\r\nThe substantiation of an ice-cap at the pole will disprove the\r\nfirst hypothesis; for what we took for ice before alighting may\r\nhave been but banks of cloud, since, having been in the plane of\r\nthe planet's equator at the time, we had naturally but a very\r\noblique view of the poles; while the absence of glacial scratches\r\nshows, I take it, that though the axis may have been a good deal\r\nmore inclined than at present, it has not, at all events since\r\nJupiter's Palaeozoic period, been as much so as that of Uranus or\r\nVenus.  The land on Jupiter, corresponding to the Laurentian\r\nHills on earth, must even here have appeared at so remote a\r\nperiod that the first surface it showed must long since have been\r\nworn away, and therefore any impressions it received have also\r\nbeen erased."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"Comparing this land with the photographs we took from space, I\r\nshould say it is the eastern of the two crescent-shaped\r\ncontinents we found apparently facing each other.  Their present\r\nform I take to be only the skeleton outline of what they will be\r\nat the next period of Jupiter's development.  They will, I\r\npredict, become more like half moons than crescents, though the\r\nprofile may be much indented by gulfs and bays, their superficial\r\narea being greatly increased, and the intervening ocean\r\ncorrespondingly narrowed.  We know that North America had a very\r\ndifferent shape during the Cretaceous or even the Middle Tertiary\r\nperiod from what it has now, and that the Gulf of Mexico extended\r\nup the valley of the Mississippi as far as the Ohio, by the\r\npresence of a great coral reef in the Ohio River near Cincinnati.\r\nWe know also that Florida and the Southeastern Atlantic States\r\nare a very recent addition to the continent, while the pampas of\r\nthe Argentine Republic have, in a geological sense, but just been\r\nupheaved from the sea, by the fact that the rivers are all on the\r\nsurface, not having had time to cut down their channels below the\r\nsurrounding country.  By similar reasoning, we know that the\r\ncanon of the Colorado is a very old region, though the\r\nprecipitateness of its banks is due to the absence of rain, for a\r\nlocal water-supply would cut back the banks, having most effect\r\nwhere they were steepest, since at those points it would move\r\nwith the greatest speed.  Thus the majestic canon owes its\r\nexistence to two things: the length of time the river has been at\r\nwork, and the fact that the water flowing through it comes from\r\nanother region where, of course, there is rain, and that it is\r\nmerely in transit, and so affects only the bed on which it moves.\r\nGranting that this is the eastern of the two continents we\r\nobserved, it evidently corresponds more in shape to the Eastern\r\nhemisphere on earth than to the New World, both of which are set\r\nfacing one another, since both drain towards the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nBut the analogy here holds also, for the past outlines of the\r\nEastern hemisphere differed radically from what they are now.\r\nThe Mediterranean Sea was formerly of far greater extent than we\r\nsee it to-day, and covered nearly the whole of northern Africa\r\nand the old upheaved sea-bottom that we see in the Desert of\r\nSahara.  Much of this great desert, as we know, has a\r\nconsiderable elevation, though part of it is still below the\r\nlevel of the Mediterranean."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"Perhaps a more striking proof of this than are the remains of\r\nfishes and marine life that are found there, is the dearth of\r\nnatural harbours and indentations in Africa's northern coast,\r\nwhile just opposite, in southern Europe, there are any number;\r\nwhich shows that not enough time has elapsed since Africa's\r\nupheaval for liquid or congealed water to produce them.  Many of\r\nEurope's best harbours, and Boston's, in our country, have been\r\ndug out by slow ice-action in the oft-recurring Glacial periods.\r\nThe Black and Caspian Seas were larger than we now find them;\r\nwhile the Adriatic extended much farther into the continent,\r\ncovering most of the country now in the valley of the Po.  In\r\nEurope the land has, of course, risen also, but so slowly that\r\nthe rivers have been able to keep their channels cut down; proof\r\nof their ability to perform which feat we see when an ancient\r\nriver passes through a ridge of hills or mountains.  The river\r\nhad doubtless been there long before the mountains began to rise,\r\nbut their elevation was so gradual that the rate of the river's\r\ncutting down equalled or exceeded their coming up; proof of which\r\nwe have in the patent fact that the ancient river's course\r\nremains unchanged, and is at right angles to the mountain chain.\r\nFrom all of which we see that the Eastern hemisphere's crescent\r\nhollow--of which, I take it, the Mediterranean, Black, and\r\nCaspian Sea depressions are the remains--has been gradually\r\nfilled in, by the elevation of the sea's bottom, and the\r\nextension of deltas from the detrital matter brought from the\r\nhigh interior of the continents by the rivers, or by the combined\r\naction of the two.  Now, since the Gulf of Mexico has been\r\nconstantly growing smaller, and the Mediterranean is being\r\ninvaded by the land, I reason that similar causes will produce\r\nlike effects here, and give to each continent an area far greater\r\nthan our entire globe.  The stormy ocean we behold in the west,\r\nwhich corresponds to our Atlantic, though it is far more of a\r\nmare clausum in the geographical sense, is also destined to\r\nbecome a calm and placid inland sea.  There are, of course,\r\nmodifications of and checks to the laws tending to increase the\r\nland area.  England was formerly joined to the continent, the\r\nland connecting the two having been rather washed away by the\r\nwaves and great tides than by any sinking of the English\r\nChannel's bottom, the whole of which is comparatively shallow.\r\nAnother case of this kind is seen in Cape Cod and the islands of\r\nMartha's Vineyard and Nantucket, all of which are washing away so\r\nrapidly that they would probably disappear before the next\r\nGlacial period, were we not engaged in preventing its recurrence.\r\nThese detached islands and sand-bars once formed one large\r\nisland, which at a still earlier time undoubtedly was joined to\r\nthe mainland.  The sands forming the detached masses are in a\r\ngreat processional march towards the equator, but it is the\r\nresult simply of winds and waves, there being no indication of\r\nsubsidence.  Along the coast of New Jersey we see denudation and\r\nsinking going on together, the well-known SUNKEN FOREST being an\r\ninstance of the latter.  The border of the continent proper also\r\nextends many miles under the ocean before reaching the edge of\r\nthe Atlantic basin.  Volcanic eruptions sometimes demolish parts\r\nof headlands and islands, though these recompense us in the\r\namount of material brought to the surface, and in the increased\r\ndistance they enable water to penetrate by relieving the interior\r\nof part of its heat, for any land they may destroy.\""}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                       CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                    A JOVIAN NIAGARA.\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Four days later, after crossing a ridge of mountains that the\r\npressure on the aneroid barometer showed to be about thirty-two\r\nthousand feet high, and a stretch of flat country a few miles in\r\nwidth, they came to a great arm of the sea.

After a while the obstructions disappeared, but the\r\nwater continued to rush and surge along at a speed of ten or\r\ntwelve miles an hour, so that it would be easily navigable only\r\nfor logs or objects moving in one direction.

The two theories\r\nthat try to account for its genesis are the ring theory and the\r\nnebulous.  We know that the sun is constantly emitting vast\r\nvolumes of heat and light, and that, with the exception of the\r\nheat resulting from the impact of falling meteors, it receives\r\nnone from outside, the principal source being the tremendous\r\nfriction and pressure between the cooling and shrinking strata\r\nwithin the great mass of the sun itself.  A seeming paradox\r\ntherefore comes in here, which must be considered:  If the sun\r\nwere composed entirely of gas, it would for a time continue to\r\ngrow hotter; but the sun is incessantly radiating light and heat,\r\nand consequently becoming smaller.  Therefore the farther back we\r\ngo the hotter we find the sun, and also the larger, till, instead\r\nof having a diameter of eight hundred and eighty thousand miles,\r\nit filled the space now occupied by the entire solar system.\r\nHere is where the two theories start.  According to the first,\r\nthe revolving nebulous mass threw off a ring that became the\r\nplanet Neptune, afterwards another that contained the material\r\nfor Uranus, and so on, the lightest substance in the sun being\r\nthrown off first, by which they accounted for the lightness of\r\nthe four great planets, and finally Mars, the earth, and the\r\nsmall dense planets near the sun.  The advocates of this theory\r\npointed to Saturn's rings as an illustration of the birth of a\r\nplanet, or, rather, in that case a satellite.  According to this,\r\nthe major planets have had a far longer separate existence than\r\nthe minor, which would account for their being so advanced\r\nnotwithstanding their size.  This theory may again come into\r\ngeneral acceptance, but for the present it has been discredited\r\nby the nebulous.  According to this second theory, at the time\r\nthe sun filled all the space inside of Neptune's, orbit, or\r\nextended even farther, several centres of condensation were\r\nformed within the nebulous, gaseous mass.  The greatest centre\r\nbecame the sun, and the others, large and small, the planets,\r\nwhich--as a result of the spiral motion of the whole, such as is\r\nnow going on before our eyes in the great nebulae of fifty- one\r\nM. Canuin venaticorum, and many others--began to revolve about\r\nthe greatest central body of gas.  As the separate masses cooled,\r\nthey shrank, and their surfaces or extreme edges, which at first\r\nwere contiguous, began to recede, which recession is still going\r\non with some rapidity on the part of the sun, for we may be sure\r\nits diameter diminishes as its density increases.  According to\r\neither theory, as I see it, the major planets, on account of\r\ntheir distance from the central mass, have had longer separate\r\nexistences than the minor, and are therefore more advanced than\r\nthey would be had all been formed at the same time."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"This theory explains the practical uniformity in the chemical\r\ncomposition of all members of this system by assuming that they\r\nwere all once a part of the same body, and you may say brothers\r\nand sisters of the sun, instead of its offspring.  It also makes\r\nsize the only factor determining temperature and density, but of\r\ncourse modified by age, since otherwise Jupiter would have a far\r\nless developed crust than that with which we find it.  I have\r\nalways considered the period from the molten condition to that\r\nwith a crust as comparatively short, which stands to reason, for\r\nradiation has then no check; and the period from the formation of\r\nthe crust, which acts as a blanket, to the death of a planet, as\r\nvery long.  I have not found this view clearly set forth in any\r\nof the books I have read, but it seems to me the simplest and\r\nmost natural explanation.  Now, granted that the solar system was\r\nonce a nebula, on which I think every one will agree--the same\r\nforces that changed it into a system of sun and planets must be\r\nat work on fifty-one M.

A\r\ncurious fact in connection with this spot is, that it moves with\r\na velocity of some two hundred and sixty miles per hour greater\r\nthan the red spot.  Denning obtained one hundred and sixty-nine\r\nobservations of this bright marking during the years 1880-1883,\r\nand determined the period as nine hours, fifty minutes, eight and\r\nseven tenths seconds (five and a half minutes less than that of\r\nthe red spot).  Although the latter is now somewhat faint, the\r\nwhite spot gives promise of remaining visible for many years.\r\nDuring the year 1886 a large number of observations of Jupiter\r\nwere made at the Dearborn Observatory, Chicago, U. S., by Prof.\r\nG. W. Hough, using the eighteen-and-a-half-inch refractor of the\r\nobservatory.  Inasmuch as these observations are not only of high\r\nintrinsic interest, but are in conflict, to some extent, with\r\nprevious records, a somewhat full abstract of them will be\r\nuseful:  The object of general interest was the great red spot.\r\nThe outline, shape, and size of this remarkable object has\r\nremained without material change from the year 1879, when it  was\r\nfirst observed here, until the present time.  According to our\r\nobservations, during the whole of this period it has shown a\r\nsharp and well-defined outline, and at no time has it coalesced\r\nor been joined to any belt in its proximity, as has been alleged\r\nby some observers.  During the year 1885 the middle of the spot\r\nwas very much paler in colour than the margins, causing it to\r\nappear as an elliptical ring.  The ring form has continued up to\r\nthe present time.  While the outline of the spot has remained\r\nvery constant, the colour has changed materially from year to\r\nyear.  During the past three years (1884- '86) it has at times\r\nbeen very faint, so as barely to be visible.  The persistence of\r\nthis object for so many years leads me to infer that the formerly\r\naccepted theory, that the phenomena seen on the surface of the\r\nplanet are atmospheric, is no longer tenable.  The statement so\r\noften made in text-books, that in the course of a few days or\r\nmonths the whole aspect of the planet may be changed, is\r\nobviously erroneous.  The oval white spots on the southern\r\nhemisphere of the planet, nine degrees south of the equator, have\r\nbeen systematically observed at every opposition during the past\r\neight years.  They are generally found in groups of three or\r\nmore, but are rather difficult to observe.  The rotation period\r\ndeduced from them is nearly the same as from the great red spot.\r\nThese spots usually have a slow drift in longitude of about five\r\nseconds daily in the direction of the planet's rotation, when\r\nreferred to the great red spot; corresponding to a rotation\r\nperiod of twenty seconds less than the latter.'"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"This shows," continued Bearwarden, "that as long ago as towards\r\nthe close of the nineteenth century the old idea that we saw\r\nnothing but the clouds in Jupiter\'s atmosphere was beginning to\r\nchange; and also how closely the two English writers and Prof.\r\nHough were studying the subject, though their views did not\r\nentirely agree.  A white spot is merely a storm-centre passing\r\nround and round the planet, the wind running a little ahead of\r\nthe surface, which accounts for its rapid rotation compared with\r\nthe red spot, which is a fixture.  A critic may say we have no\r\nsuch winds on earth; to which I reply, that winds on a planet of\r\nJupiter\'s size, with its rate of rotation--though it is\r\n480,000,000 miles from the sun and the internal heat is so near\r\nthe surface--and with land and water arranged as they are, may\r\nand indeed must be very different from those prevailing on earth,\r\nthe conditions producing and affecting them being so changed.\r\nThough the storm-centre moves two hundred and sixty miles an\r\nhour, the wind need not blow at that rate."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Later they saw several smaller spots drifting eastward, but\r\nconcluded that any seaworthy ship might pass safely through them,\r\nfor, though they were hurricanes of great violence, the waves\r\nwere small."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"There would be less danger," said Bearwarden, "of shipping seas\r\nhere than there is on earth; the principal risk to travellers\r\nwould be that of being blown from the deck.

We know that the earth\'s\r\ndays were formerly but half or a quarter as long as now, having\r\nlasted but six or eight hours.  The explanation of the elongation\r\nis simple: the earth rotates in about twenty-four hours, while\r\nthe moon encircles it but once in nearly twenty- eight days, so\r\nthat our satellite is continually drawing the oceans backward\r\nagainst its motion.

This same action is of\r\ncourse taking place in Jupiter and the great planets, in this\r\ncase there being five moons at work.  Our moon, we know, rotates\r\non its axis but once while it revolves about the earth, this\r\nbeing no doubt due to its own comparative smallness and the great\r\nattraction of the earth, which must have produced tremendous\r\ntides before the lunar oceans disappeared from its surface."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In crossing the orbits of the satellites, they passed near\r\nGanymede, Jupiter's largest moon."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"This," said Cortlandt, "was discovered by Galileo in\r\n1610.

The\r\nmatter now in Ganymede, however, doubtless remained part of the\r\nJupiter-system nebula till after Mercury's creation, and, being\r\npart of so great a mass, did not cool very rapidly.  I should say\r\nthat this satellite has about the same relation to Jupiter that\r\nJupiter has to the sun, and is therefore younger in point of time\r\nas well as of development than the most distant Callisto, and\r\nolder, at all events in years, than Europa and Io, both of which\r\nare nearer.  This supposition is corroborated by the fact that\r\nEuropa, the smallest of these four, is also the densest, having a\r\nspecific gravity of 2.14, its smallness having enabled it to\r\novertake Ganymede in development, notwithstanding the latter's\r\nstart.  In the face of the evidence before us we must believe\r\nthis, or else that, perhaps, as in the case of the asteroid\r\nHilda, something like a collision has rejuvenated it.  This might\r\naccount for its size, and for the Nautical Almanac's statement\r\nthat there is a 'small and variable' inclination to its orbit,\r\nwhile Io and Europa revolve exactly in the plane of Jupiter's\r\nequator.\""}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"They had about as long a journey before them as they had already\r\nmade in going from the earth to Jupiter.

Since there were no way stations, in the shape\r\nof planets or asteroids, between Jupiter and Saturn, they kept\r\nthe maximum repulsion on Jupiter as long as possible, and moved\r\nat tremendous speed.  Saturn was somewhat in advance of Jupiter\r\nin its orbit, so that their course from the earth had been along\r\ntwo sides of a triangle with an obtuse angle between.

There were two motions.  The ring revolved\r\nabout Saturn, and the particles vibrated among themselves,\r\nevidently kept apart by a mutual repulsion, which seemed both to\r\nincrease and decrease faster than gravitation; for on approaching\r\none another they were more strongly repelled than attracted, but\r\nwhen they separated the repulsion decreased faster than the\r\nattraction, so that after a time divergence ceased, and they\r\nremained at fixed distances."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Callisto soon became imbued with motion also, but nothing\r\never struck it.

They were somewhat\r\npuzzled by the approach of certain light-centres, which seemed to\r\ncontain nothing but this concentrated brightness.  Occasionally\r\none of these centres would glow very brightly near them, and\r\nsimultaneously recede.  At such times the Callisto also glowed,\r\nand itself recoiled slightly.

All kinds of\r\nsuppositions have been advanced in explanation of these rings.\r\nSome writers have their thickness, looked at from the thin edge,\r\nas four hundred miles, some one hundred, and some but forty.  One\r\nastronomer of the nineteenth century, a man of considerable\r\neminence, was convinced that they consisted of sheets of liquid.\r\nNow, it should be obvious that no liquid could maintain itself\r\nhere for a minute, for it would either fall upon the planet as a\r\ncrushing hail, or, if dependent for its shape on its own\r\ntenacity, it would break if formed of the toughest steel, on\r\naccount of the tremendous weight.  Any number of theories have\r\nbeen advanced by any number of men, but in weight we have the\r\nrub.  No one has ever shown how these innumerable fragments\r\nmaintain themselves at a height of but a few thousand miles above\r\nSaturn, withstanding the giant\'s gravitation-pull.  Their rate of\r\nrevolution, though rapid, does not seem fast enough to sustain\r\nthem.  Neither have I ever seen it explained why the small\r\nfragments do not fall upon the large ones, though many\r\nastronomers have pictured the composition of these rings as we\r\nfind they exist.  Nor do we know why the molecules of a gas are\r\ndriven farther apart by heat, while their activity is also\r\nincreased, though if this activity were revolution about one\r\nanother to develop the centrifugal, it would not need to be as\r\nstrong then as when they are cold and nearer together.  There may\r\nbe explanations, but I have found none in any of the literature I\r\nhave read.  It seems to me that all this leads to but one\r\nconclusion, viz.: apergy is the constant and visible companion of\r\ngravitation, on these great planets Jupiter and Saturn, perhaps\r\non account of some peculiar influence they possess, and also in\r\ncomets, in the case of large masses, while on earth it appears\r\nnaturally only among molecules--those of gases and every other\r\nsubstance."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"I should go a step further," said Bearwarden, "and say our earth\r\nhas the peculiarity, since it does not possess the influence\r\nnecessary to generate naturally a great or even considerable\r\ndevelopment of apergy.

The eyes of all but the highest\r\nangels require some light, and can be dazzled by an excess; but\r\nthis attribute of divinity nothing can obscure, and it is the\r\nsense that will first enable us to know God.

"Progress depends\r\nlargely on your command of the forces of Nature.  At present your\r\nprincipal sources of power are food, fuel, electricity, the heat\r\nof the interior of the earth, wind, and tide.  From the first two\r\nyou cannot expect much more than now, but from the internal heat\r\neverywhere available, tradewinds, and falling water, as at\r\nNiagara, and from tides, you can obtain power almost without\r\nlimit.  Were this all, however, your progress would be slow; but\r\nthe Eternal, realizing the shortness of your lives, has given you\r\npower with which to rend the globe.  You have the action of all\r\nuncombined chemicals, atmospheric electricity, the excess or\r\nfroth of which you now see in thunderstorms, and the electricity\r\nand magnetism of your own bodies.  There is also molecular and\r\nsympathetic vibration, by which Joshua not understandingly\r\nlevelled the walls of Jericho; and the power of your minds over\r\nmatter, but little more developed now than when I moved in the\r\nflesh upon the earth.  By lowering large quantities of\r\nhigh-powered explosives to the deepest parts of the ocean bed,\r\nand exploding them there, you can produce chasms through which\r\nsome water will be forced towards the heated interior by the\r\nenormous pressure of its own weight.  At a comparatively slight\r\ndepth it will be converted into steam and produce an earthquake.\r\nThis will so enlarge your chasm, that a great volume of water\r\nwill rush into the red-hot interior, which will cause a series of\r\nsuch terrific eruptions that large islands will be upheaved.  By\r\nthe reduction of the heat of that part of the interior there will\r\nalso be a shrinkage, which, in connection with the explosions,\r\nwill cause the earth\'s solid crust to be thrown up in folds till\r\nwhole continents appear.  Some of the water displaced by the new\r\nland will also, as a result of the cooling, be able permanently\r\nto penetrate farther, thereby decreasing by that much the amount\r\nof water in the oceans, so that the tide-level in your existing\r\nseaports will be but slightly changed.  By persevering in this\r\nwork, you will become so skilled that it will be possible to\r\nevoke land of whatever kind you wish, at any place; and by having\r\nhigh table-land at the equator, sloping off into low plains\r\ntowards north and south, and maintaining volcanoes in eruption at\r\nthe poles to throw out heat and start warm ocean currents, it\r\nwill be possible, in connection with the change you are now\r\nmaking in the axis, to render the conditions of life so easy that\r\nthe earth will support a far larger number of souls.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"With the powers at your disposal you can also alter and improve\r\nexisting continents, and thereby still further increase the\r\nnumber of the children of men.

People\r\ncame from other cities to hear my sermons, and the biographical\r\nwriters have honoured my memory by saying that I was a great man.\r\nI was contemporaneous with Daniel Webster and Henry Clay.\r\nShortly after I reached threescore and ten, according to earthly\r\nyears, I caught what I considered only a slight cold, for I had\r\nalways had good health, but it became pneumonia.  My friends,\r\nchildren, and grandchildren came to see me, and all seemed going\r\nwell, when, without warning, my physician told me I had but a few\r\nhours to live.  I could scarcely believe my ears; and though, as\r\na Churchman, I had ministered to others and had always tried to\r\nlead a good life, I was greatly shocked.  I suddenly remembered\r\nall the things I had left undone and all the things I intended to\r\ndo, and the old saying, 'Hell is paved with good intentions,'\r\ncrossed my mind very forcibly.  In less than an hour I saw the\r\nphysician was right; I grew weaker and my pulse fluttered, but my\r\nmind remained clear.  I prayed to my Creator with all my soul, 'O\r\nspare me a little, that I may recover my strength, before I go\r\nhence, and be no more seen.'  As if for an answer, the thought\r\ncrossed my brain, 'Set thine house in order, for thou shalt not\r\nlive, but die.'  I then called my children and made disposition\r\nof such of my property and personal effects as were not covered\r\nby my will.  I also gave to each the advice that my experience\r\nhad shown me he or she needed.  Then came another wave of remorse\r\nand regret, and again an intense longing to pray; but along with\r\nthe thought of sins and neglected duties came also the memory of\r\nthe honest efforts I had made to obey my conscience, and these\r\nwere like rifts of sunshine during a storm.  These thoughts, and\r\nthe blessed promises of religion I had so often preached in the\r\nchurches of my diocese, were an indescribable comfort, and saved\r\nme from the depths of blank despair.  Finally my breathing became\r\nlaboured, I had sharp spasms of pain, and my pulse almost\r\nstopped.  I felt that I was dying, and my sight grew dim.  The\r\ncrisis and climax of life were at hand.  'Oh!' I thought, with\r\nthe philosophers and sages, 'is it to this end I lived?  The\r\nflower appears, briefly blooms amid troublous toil, and is gone;\r\nmy body returns to its primordial dust, and my works are buried\r\nin oblivion.  The paths of life and glory lead but to the grave.'\r\nMy soul was filled with conflicting thoughts, and for a moment\r\neven my faith seemed at a low ebb.  I could hear my children's\r\nstifled sobs, and my darling wife shed silent tears.  The thought\r\nof parting from them gave me the bitterest wrench.  With my\r\nfleeting breath I gasped these words, 'That mercy I showed\r\nothers, that show thou me.'  The darkened room grew darker, and\r\nafter that I died.  In my sleep I seemed to dream.  All about\r\nwere refined and heavenly flowers, while the most delightful\r\nsounds and perfumes filled the air.  Gradually the vision became\r\nmore distinct, and I experienced an indescribable feeling of\r\npeace and repose.

Sometimes I seemed to be miles in air; countless suns and\r\ntheir planets shone, and dazzled my eyes, while no\r\nbird-of-paradise was as happy or free as I.  Gradually it came to\r\nme that I was awake, and that it was no dream.  Then I remembered\r\nmy last moments, and perceived that I had died.

They, however, excited the\r\ncreature's ire; for, sweeping around quickly, it made straight\r\nfor Cortlandt, breathing at him when near, and almost\r\noverpowering the three men with the malodorous, poisonous cloud\r\nit exhaled.  Instantly Bearwarden fired several revolver bullets\r\ndown its throat, while Ayrault pulled both barrels almost\r\nsimultaneously, with the muzzles but a few inches from its side.\r\nIn this case the initial velocity of the heavy buckshot was so\r\ngreat, and they were still so close together, that they\r\npenetrated the leathery hide, tearing a large hole.

Tree after tree was passed, and finally\r\nthey saw an open space twelve or fifteen acres in area at the\r\ncentre of the grove, when they were arrested by a curious sound\r\nof munching.  Peering among the trunks of the huge trees, they\r\nadvanced cautiously, but stopped aghast.  In the opening were at\r\nleast a hundred dragons devouring the toadstools with which the\r\nground was covered.  Many of them were thirty to forty feet long,\r\nwith huge and terribly long, sharp claws, and jaws armed with\r\ngleaming batteries of teeth.  Though they had evidently lungs,\r\nand the claws and mouth of an animal, they reminded the observers\r\nin many respects of insects enormously exaggerated, for their\r\nwings, composed of a sort of transparent scale, were small, and\r\nmoved, as they had already seen, at far greater speed than those\r\nof a bird.  Their projecting eyes were also set rigidly in their\r\nheads instead of turning, and consisted of a number of flat\r\nsurfaces or facets, like a fly's eye, so that they could see\r\nbackward and all around, each facet seeing anything the rays from\r\nwhich came at right angles to its surface.  This beautiful grove\r\nwas doubtless their feeding-ground, and, as such, was likely to\r\nbe visited by many more.  Concluding it would be wise to let\r\ntheir wounded game escape, the three men were about to retreat,\r\nhaving found it difficult to breathe the air even at that\r\ndistance from the monsters, when the wounded dragon that they had\r\nobserved moving about in a very restless manner, and evidently\r\nsuffering a good deal from the effect of its wounds, espied them,\r\nand, with a roar that made the echoes ring, started towards them\r\nslowly along the ground, followed by the entire herd, the nearer\r\nof which now also saw them.  Seeing that their lives were in\r\ndanger, the hunters quickly regained the open, and then stretched\r\ntheir legs against the wind.  The dragons came through the trees\r\non the ground, and then, raising themselves by their wings, the\r\nwhole swarm, snorting, and darkening the air with their deadly\r\nbreath, made straight for the men, who by comparison looked like\r\nLilliputians.  With the slug from his right barrel Bearwarden\r\nended the wounded dragon's career by shooting him through the\r\nhead, and with his left laid low the one following.  Ayrault also\r\nkilled two huge monsters, and Cortlandt killed one and wounded\r\nanother.  Their supply of prepared cartridges was then exhausted,\r\nand they fell back on their revolvers and ineffective spreading\r\nshot.  Resolved to sell their lives dearly, they retreated,\r\nkeeping their backs to the wind, with the poisonous dragons in\r\nfront.  But the breeze was very slight, and they were being\r\nrapidly blinded and asphyxiated by the loathsome fumes, and\r\ndeafened by the hideous roaring and snapping of the dragons'\r\njaws.  Realizing that they could not much longer reply to the\r\ndiabolical host with lead, they believed their last hour had\r\ncome, when the ground on which they were making their last stand\r\nshook, there was a rending of rocks and a rush of imprisoned\r\nsteam that drowned even the dragons' roar, and they were\r\nseparated from them by a long fissure and a wall of smoke and\r\nvapour.  Struggling back from the edge of the chasm, they fell\r\nupon the ground, and then for the first time fully realized that\r\nthe earthquake had saved them, for the dragons could not come\r\nacross the opening, and would not venture to fly through the\r\nsmoke and steam.  When they recovered somewhat from the shock,\r\nthey cut a number of cartridges in the same way that they had\r\nprepared those that had done them such good service, and kept one\r\nbarrel of each gun loaded with that kind."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"We may thank Providence," said Bearwarden, "for that escape.

Dumfounded at this\r\nunmistakable manifestation of the phenomenon they thought they\r\nhad seen on landing, he called his companions, and, choosing\r\nanother mushroom, the three watched it closely.  Presently,\r\nwithout the least noise or commotion, that also disappeared,\r\nleaving no trace, and the same fate befell a number of others.\r\nAt a certain point of their development they vanished as\r\ncompletely as a bubble of air coming to the surface of water,\r\nexcept that they caused no ripple, leaving merely a small\r\ndepression where they had stood.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Well," said Bearwarden, "in all my travels I never have seen\r\nanything like this.

They\r\nfound that in the animal and plant forms of life Nature had\r\noften, by some seeming accident, struck out in a course very\r\ndifferent from any on the earth.  Many of the animals were bipeds\r\nand tripeds, the latter arranged in tandem, the last leg being\r\nevidently an enormously developed tail, by which the creature\r\npropelled itself as with a spring.  The quadrupeds had also\r\nsometimes wings, and their bones were hollow, like those of\r\nbirds.  Whether this great motive and lifting power was the\r\nresult of the planet's size and the power of gravitation, or\r\nwhether some creatures had in addition the power of developing a\r\ndegree of apergetic repulsion to offset it, as they suspected in\r\nthe case of the boa-constrictor that fell upon Cortlandt on\r\nJupiter, they could not absolutely ascertain.  Life was far less\r\nprolific on Saturn than on Jupiter, doubtless as a result of its\r\ngreater distance from the sun, and of its extremes of climate,\r\nalmost all organic life being driven to the latitudes near the\r\nequator.  There were, as on Jupiter, many variations from the\r\nforms of life to which they were accustomed, and adaptations to\r\nthe conditions in which they found themselves; but, with the\r\nexception of the strange manifestations of spirit life, they\r\nfound the workings of the fundamental laws the same.  Often when\r\nthey woke at night the air was luminous, and they were convinced\r\nthat if they remained there long enough it would be easy to\r\ndevise some telegraphic code of light-flashes by which they could\r\ncommunicate with the spirit world, and so get ideas from the host\r\nof spirits that had already solved the problem of life and death,\r\nbut who were not as yet sufficiently developed to be able to\r\nreturn to the earth.  One day they stopped to investigate what\r\nthey had supposed to be an optical illusion.  They observed that\r\nleaves and other light substances floated several inches above\r\nthe surface of the water in the pools.  On coming to the edge and\r\nmaking tests, they found a light liquid, as invisible as air,\r\nsuperimposed upon the water, with sufficient buoyancy to sustain\r\ndry wood and also some forms of life.  They also observed that\r\ninsects coming close to the surface and apparently inhaling it,\r\nrapidly increased in size and weight, from which they concluded\r\nit must throw off nitrogen, carbon, or some other nourishment in\r\nthe form of gas.  The depth upon the water was unaffected by\r\nrain, which passed through it, but depended rather on the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere, from which it was evidently\r\ncondensed.  There seemed also to be a relation between the amount\r\nof this liquid and the activity of the spirits.  Finally, when\r\ntheir ammunition showed signs of running low, they decided to\r\nreturn to the Callisto, go in it to the other side of the planet,\r\nand resume their investigations there.  Accordingly, they set out\r\nto retrace their steps, returning by a course a few miles to one\r\nside of the way they had come, and making the cave their\r\nobjective point.

A man\'s soul can never die; a manifestation of the\r\nsoul is the spirit; this has entity, consciousness, and will, and\r\nthese also live forever.  As in the natural or material life, as\r\nI shall call it, will affects the material first.  Thus, a child\r\nhas power to move its hand or a material object, as a toy, before\r\nit can become the medium in a psychological seance.  So it is\r\nhere.  Before becoming visible to your eyes, I, by my will, draw\r\ncertain material substances in the form of gases from the ground,\r\nwater, or air around me.  These take any shape I wish--not\r\nnecessarily that of man, though it is more natural to appear as\r\nwe did on earth--and may absorb a portion of light, and so be\r\nable to cast a shadow or break up the white rays into prismatic\r\ncolours, or they may be wholly invisible.  By an effort of the\r\nwill, then, I combine and condense these gases--which consist\r\nprincipally of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon--into\r\nflesh, blood, water, or anything else.  You have already learned\r\non earth that, by the application of heat, every solid and every\r\nliquid substance, which is solid or liquid simply because of the\r\ntemperature at which you find it, can be expanded into gas or\r\ngases; and that by cold and pressure every gas can be reduced to\r\na liquid or a solid.  On earth the state of a substance, whether\r\nsolid, liquid, or gaseous, depends simply upon those two\r\nconditions.  Here neither thermal nor barometric changes are\r\nrequired, for, by mastering the new natural laws that at death\r\nbecome patent to our senses, we have all the necessary control.\r\nIt requires but an effort of my will to be almost instantly\r\nclothed in human form, and but another effort to rearrange the\r\nmolecules in such a way as to make the envelope visible.  Some\r\nwho have been dead longer, or had a greater natural aptitude than\r\nI, have advanced further, and all are learning; but the\r\ndifference in the rate at which spirits acquire control of\r\npreviously unknown natural laws varies far more than among\r\nindividuals on earth.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"These forms of organic life do not disintegrate till after\r\ndeath; here in the natural state they break down and dissolve\r\ninto their structural elements in full bloom, as was done by the\r\nfungi.

The slight fall you noticed\r\nin temperature was because the specific heat of these gases is\r\nhigh, and to become gas while in the solid state they had to\r\nwithdraw some warmth from the air.  The fatal breath of the\r\nwinged lizards--or dragons, as you call them--results from the\r\nsame cause, the action of their digestion breaking up the fungus,\r\nwhich does not kill them, because they exhale the poisonous part\r\nin gaseous form with their breath.

The planets\r\nnearest the sun receive such burning rays that their surfaces are\r\nred-hot, and at the equator at perihelion are molten.  These are\r\nnot seen from the earth, because, rising or setting almost\r\nsimultaneously with the sun, they are lost in its rays.  The\r\ngreat planet beyond Neptune's orbit is perhaps the most\r\ninteresting.  This we call Cassandra, because it would be a\r\nprophet of evil to any visitor from the stars who should judge\r\nthe solar system by it.  This planet is nearly as large as\r\nJupiter, being 80,000 miles in diameter, but has a specific\r\ngravity lighter than Saturn.  Bode's law, you know, says, Write\r\ndown 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96.  Add 4 to each, and get 4, 7, 10,\r\n16, 28, 52, 100; and this series of numbers represents very\r\nnearly the relative distances of the planets from the sun.\r\nAccording to this law, you would expect the planet next beyond\r\nNeptune to be about 5,000,000,000 miles from the sun.  But it is\r\nabout 9,500,000,000, so that there is a gap between Neptune and\r\nCassandra, as between Mars and Jupiter, except that in\r\nCassandra's case there are no asteroids to show where any planet\r\nwas; we must, then, suppose it is an exception to Bode's law, or\r\nthat there was a planet that has completely disappeared.  As\r\nCassandra would be within the law if there had been an\r\nintermediary planet, we have good prima facie reason for\r\nbelieving that it existed.  Cassandra takes, in round numbers, a\r\nthousand years to complete its orbit, and from it the sun, though\r\nbrighter, appears no larger than the earth's evening or morning\r\nstar.  Cassandra has also three large moons; but these, when\r\nfull, shine with a pale-grey light, like the old moon in the new\r\nmoon's arms, in that terrestrial phenomenon when the earth, by\r\nreflecting the crescent's light, and that of the sun, makes the\r\ndark part visible.  The temperature at Cassandra's surface is but\r\nlittle above the cold of space, and no water exists in the liquid\r\nstate, it being as much a solid as aluminum or glass.  There are\r\nrivers and lakes, but these consist of liquefied hydrogen and\r\nother gases, the heavier liquid collected in deep Places, and the\r\nlighter, with less than half the specific gravity of ether,\r\nfloating upon it without mixing, as oil on water.  When the\r\nheavier penetrates to a sufficient depth, the interior being\r\nstill warm, it is converted into gas and driven back to the\r\nsurface, only to be recondensed on reaching the upper air.  Thus\r\nit may happen that two rains composed of separate liquids may\r\nfall together.  There being but little of any other atmosphere,\r\nmuch of it consists of what you might call the vapour of\r\nhydrogen, and many of the well-known gases and liquids on earth\r\nexist only as liquids and solids; so that, were there mortal\r\ninhabitants on Cassandra, they might build their houses of blocks\r\nof oxygen or chlorine, as you do of limestone or marble, and use\r\nice that never melts, in place of glass, for transparence.  They\r\nwould also use mercury for bullets in their rifles, just as\r\ninhabitants of the intra-Vulcan planets at the other extreme\r\nmight, if their bodies consisted of asbestos, or were in any\r\nother way non-combustibly constituted, bathe in tin, lead, or\r\neven zinc, which ordinarily exist in the liquid state, as water\r\nand mercury do on the earth."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"Though Cassandra's atmosphere, such as it is, is mostly clear,\r\nfor the evaporation from the rivers and icy mediterraneans is\r\nslight, the brightness of even the highest noon is less than an\r\nearthly twilight, and the stars never cease to shine.  The dark\r\nbase of the rocky cliffs is washed by the frigid tide, but there\r\nis scarcely a sound, for the pebbles cannot be moved by the\r\nweightless waves, and an occasional murmur is all that is heard.\r\nGreat rocks of ice reflect the light of the grey moons, and never\r\na leaf falls or a bird sings.  With the exception of the mournful\r\nripples, the planet is silent as the grave.  The animal and plant\r\nkingdoms do not exist; only the mineral and spiritual worlds.  I\r\nsay spiritual, because there are souls upon it; but it is the\r\nhome of the condemned in hell.  Here dwell the transgressors who\r\ndied unrepentant, and those who were not saved by faith.  This is\r\nthe one instance in which I do not enjoy my developed sight, for\r\nI sometimes glance in their direction, and the vision that meets\r\nme, as my eyes focus, distresses my soul.

Compared\r\nwith the splendour of Sirius, with its diameter of twelve million\r\nmiles, the sun, measuring but eight hundred and forty thousand,\r\nbecomes insignificant; and this giant's system includes groups\r\nand clusters of planets, many with three times the mass of\r\nJupiter, five and six together, each a different colour,\r\nrevolving about a common centre, while they swing about their\r\nprimary.  Their numerous moons have satellites encircling them,\r\nwith orbits in some cases at right angles to the plane of the\r\necliptic, so that they shine perpendicularly on what correspond\r\nto the arctic and antarctic regions, while their axes are so\r\ninclined that the satellites turn a complete somersault at each\r\nrevolution, producing glistening effects of ice and snow at the\r\npoles.

Many\r\nquadrillions of miles away, so far that your most powerful\r\ntelescopes have not yet caught a glimmer, rests in its serene\r\ngrandeur a star that we call Cosmos, because it is the centre of\r\nthis universe.

Even the effects of\r\ngravitation are modified by the changed condition; for these\r\nsystems are spread out flat, like the rings of this planet, and\r\nthe ether of space is luminous instead of black, as here.  These\r\nsystems are but in a later stage of development than ours; and in\r\nthe course of evolution our visible universe will be changed in\r\nthe same way, as I can explain.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"In incalculable ages, the forward motion of the planets and\r\ntheir satellites will be checked by the resistance of the ether\r\nof space and the meteorites and solid matter they encounter.\r\nMeteorites also overtake them, and, by striking them as it were\r\nin the rear, propel them, but more are encountered in front--an\r\nillustration of which you can have by walking rapidly or riding\r\non horseback on a rainy day, in which case more drops will strike\r\nyour chest than your back.  The same rule applies to bodies in\r\nspace, while the meteorites encountered have more effect than\r\nthose following, since in one case it is the speed of the meteor\r\nminus that of the planet, and in the other the sum of the two\r\nvelocities.  With this checking of the forward motion, the\r\ncentrifugal force decreases, and the attraction of the central\r\nbody has more effect.  When this takes place the planet or\r\nsatellite falls slightly towards the body around which it\r\nrevolves, thereby increasing its speed till the centrifugal force\r\nagain balances the centripetal.  This would seem to make it\r\ndescend by fits and starts, but in reality the approach is nearly\r\nconstant, so that the orbits are in fact slightly spiral.  What\r\nis true of the planets and satellites is also true of the stars\r\nwith reference to Cosmos; though many even of these have\r\nsubordinate motions in their great journey.  Though the\r\nsatellites of the moons revolve about the primaries in orbits\r\ninclined at all kinds of angles to the planes of the ecliptics,\r\nand even the moons vary in their paths about the planets, the\r\nplanets themselves revolve about the stars, like those of this\r\nsystem about the sun, in substantially the same plane; and what\r\nis true of the planets is even more true of the stars in their\r\norbits about Cosmos, so that when, after incalculable ages, they\r\ndo fall, they strike this monster sun at or near its equator, and\r\nnot falling perpendicularly, but in a line varying but slightly\r\nfrom a tangent, and at terrific speed, they cause the colossus to\r\nrotate more and more rapidly on its own axis, till it must become\r\ngreatly flattened at the poles, as the earth is slightly, and as\r\nJupiter and Saturn are a good deal.

As Cosmos\r\nwaxes greater from the result of these continual accretions, its\r\nattraction for the stars will increase, until those coming from\r\nthe outer regions of its universe will move at such terrific\r\nspeed in their spiral orbits that before coming in contact they\r\nwill be almost invisible, having already absorbed all solid\r\nmatter revolving about themselves.  These accessions of moving\r\nmatter, continually received at and near its equator, will cause\r\nCosmos to spread out like Saturn's rings till it becomes flat,\r\nthough the balance of forces will be so perfect that it is\r\ndoubtful whether an animal or a man placed there would feel much\r\nchange."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"But these universes--or, more accurately, divisions of the\r\nuniverse--already planes, though the vast surfaces are not so\r\nflat as to preclude beautiful and gently rolling slopes, are\r\nspirit-lands, and will be inhabited only by spirits.

Thus no one can give any one else anything he\r\ncannot obtain himself; and if he could, since it would be no\r\nsacrifice on his part, he would derive no great moral comfort\r\nfrom it.

It follows, then, that with\r\nGod as our limit, which we of course can never reach, their\r\nlimit, in the geometrical sense, must be total separation from\r\nHim.

Since it is dreadful to\r\nthink that such unsoothed anguish should continue forever, I have\r\noften pondered whether it might not be that, by a form of\r\ninvolution and reversal of the past law, the spirit that came to\r\nlife evolved from the, mineral, plant, and animal worlds, may\r\nmercifully retrace its steps one by one, till finally the soul\r\nshall penetrate the solid rock and hide itself by becoming part\r\nof the planet.

Has a direful misfortune\r\nbefallen this brother, or has a slave been set free?  Let us\r\nsuppose for a moment that the first has occurred.  'Vanity of\r\nvanities,' said the old preacher.  'Calamity of calamities,' says\r\nthe new.  That soul's probationary period is ended; his record,\r\non which he must go, is forever made.  He has been in the flesh,\r\nlet us say, one, two, three or four score years; before him are\r\nthe countless aeons of eternity.

No slumber or forgetfulness can\r\nease his lot in hades, and after his condemnation at the last\r\njudgment he must forever face the unsoftened realities of\r\neternity.  No evil thing or thought can find lodgment in heaven.\r\nIf it could, heaven would not be a happy place; neither can any\r\nman improve in the abyss of hell.  As the horizon gradually\r\ndarkens, and this soul recedes from God, the time spent in the\r\nflesh must come to seem the most infinitesimal moment, more\r\nevanescent than the tick of a clock.
