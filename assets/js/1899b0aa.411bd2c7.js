But at ten o'clock\r\nThe liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls\r\nThe rival candidates growled and came to blows.\r\nThen proved the idiot's tale of yester-eve\r\nA word of warning. Suddenly on the streets\r\nWalked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills\r\nThat looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.\r\nNo man of this degenerate day could lift\r\nThe boulders which he threw, and when he spoke\r\nThe windows rattled, and beneath his brows\r\nThatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,\r\nHis small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.\r\nAnd as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked\r\nA song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,\r\nThe champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned\r\nTo terrify the liberals.

He was scarce\r\nThree-fourths the other's bulk, but steel his arms,\r\nAnd with a tiger's heart. Two men he killed\r\nAnd many wounded in the days before,\r\nAnd no one feared.\r\nBut when the hog-eyed one\r\nSaw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,\r\nThe bristles o'er his red eyes twitched with rage,\r\nThe song he rumbled lowered.

Come, hog-eyed coward!\r\nCome, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!\r\nCome, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!\r\nTake out your gun, you duffer, give me reason\r\nTo draw and kill you. Take your billy out.\r\nI'll crack your boar's head with a piece of brick!\"\r\nBut never a word the hog-eyed one returned\r\nBut trod about the court-house, followed both\r\nBy troops of boys and watched by all the men.\r\nAll day, they walked the square.

Then rose to heaven\r\nThe frightened cries of boys, and yells of men\r\nForth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike\r\nMoved this way and now that, drew in his head\r\nAs if his neck to shorten, and bent down\r\nTo break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;\r\nOTwixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength\r\nStriking his fists against the invulnerable chest\r\nOf hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in\r\nTo part them, others stayed them, and the fight\r\nSpread among dozens; many valiant souls\r\nWent down from clubs and bricks.\r\nBut tell me, Muse,\r\nWhat god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?\r\nWith one last, mighty struggle did he grasp\r\nThe murderous hands and turning kick his foe.\r\nThen, as if struck by lightning, vanished all\r\nThe strength from hog--eyed Allen, at his side\r\nSank limp those giant arms and o'er his face\r\nDread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.\r\nAnd those great knees, invincible but late,\r\nShook to his weight. And quickly as the lion\r\nLeaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike\r\nSmite with a rock the temple of his foe,\r\nAnd down he sank and darkness o'er his eyes\r\nPassed like a cloud.\r\nAs when the woodman fells\r\nSome giant oak upon a summer's day\r\nAnd all the songsters of the forest shrill,\r\nAnd one great hawk that has his nestling young\r\nAmid the topmost branches croaks, as crash\r\nThe leafy branches through the tangled boughs\r\nOf brother oaks, so fell the hog--eyed one\r\nAmid the lamentations of the friends\r\nOf A.
