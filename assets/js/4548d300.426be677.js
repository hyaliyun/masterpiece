"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of\r\nman, that Thou visitest him?" A divine visit is a joy to be\r\ntreasured whenever we are favoured with it. David speaks of it\r\nwith great solemnity. The Psalmist was not content barely to\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"speak"}),' of it; but he wrote it down in plain terms, that it might\r\nbe known throughout all generations: "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Thou hast visited me in the\r\nnight"}),'." Beloved, if God has ever visited you, you also will\r\nmarvel at it, will carry it in your memory, will speak of it to\r\nyour friends, and will record it in your diary as one of the\r\nnotable events of your life. Above all, you will speak of it to\r\nGod Himself, and say with adoring gratitude, "Thou hast visited me\r\nin the night." It should be a solemn part of worship to remember\r\nand make known the condescension of the Lord, and say, both in\r\nlowly prayer and in joyful psalm, "Thou hast visited me."\r\nTo you, beloved friends, who gather with me about this\r\ncommunion table, I will speak of my own experience, nothing\r\ndoubting that it is also yours. If our God has ever visited any of\r\nus, personally, by His Spirit, two results have attended the\r\nvisit: ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"it has been sharply searching, and it has been sweetly\r\nsolacing"}),'.\r\nWhen first of all the Lord draws nigh to the heart, the\r\ntrembling soul perceives clearly the searching character of His\r\nvisit. Remember how Job answered the Lord: "I have heard of Thee\r\nby the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth Thee, wherefore\r\nI abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." We can read of God,\r\nand hear of God, and be little moved; but when we feel His\r\npresence, it is another matter. I thought my house was good enough\r\nfor kings; but when the King of kings came to it, I saw that it\r\nwas a hovel quite unfit for His abode. I had never known sin to be\r\nso "exceeding sinful" if I had not known God to be so perfectly\r\nholy. I had never understood the depravity of my own nature if I\r\nhad not known the holiness of God\'s nature. When we see Jesus, we\r\nfall at His feet as dead; till then, we are alive with\r\nvainglorious life. If letters of light traced by a mysterious hand\r\nupon the wall caused the joints of Belshazzar\'s loins to be\r\nloosed, what awe overcomes our spirits when we see the Lord\r\nHimself! In the presence of so much light our spots and wrinkles\r\nare revealed, and we are utterly ashamed. We are like Daniel, who\r\nsaid, "I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there\r\nremained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me\r\ninto corruption." It is when the Lord visits us that we see our\r\nnothingness, and ask, "Lord, what is man?"\r\nI do remember well when God first visited me; and assuredly\r\nit was the night of nature, of ignorance, of sin. His visit had\r\nthe same effect upon me that it had upon Saul of Tarsus when the\r\nLord spake to him out of heaven. He brought me down from the high\r\nhorse, and caused me to fall to the ground; by the brightness of\r\nthe light of His Spirit He made me grope in conscious blindness;\r\nand in the brokenness of my heart I cried, "Lord, what wilt Thou\r\nhave me to do?" I felt that I had been rebelling against the Lord,\r\nkicking against the pricks, and doing evil even as I could; and my\r\nsoul was filled with anguish at the discovery. Very searching was\r\nthe glance of the eye of Jesus, for it revealed my sin, and caused\r\nme to go out and weep bitterly. As when the Lord visited Adam, and\r\ncalled him to stand naked before Him, so was I stripped of all my\r\nrighteousness before the face of the Most High. Yet the visit\r\nended not there; for as the Lord God clothed our first parents in\r\ncoats of skins, so did He cover me with the righteousness of the\r\ngreat sacrifice, and He gave me songs in the night It was night,\r\nbut the visit was no dream: in fact, I there and then ceased to\r\ndream, and began to deal with the reality of things.\r\nI think you will remember that, when the Lord first visited\r\nyou in the night, it was with you as with Peter when Jesus came to\r\nhim. He had been toiling with his net all the night, and nothing\r\nhad come of it; but when the Lord Jesus came into his boat, and\r\nbade him launch out into the deep, and let down his net for a\r\ndraught, he caught such a great multitude of fishes that the boat\r\nbegan to sink. See! the boat goes down, down, till the water\r\nthreatens to engulf it, and Peter, and the fish, and all. Then\r\nPeter fell down at Jesus knees, and cried, "Depart from me; for I\r\nam a sinful man, O Lord!" The presence of Jesus was too much for\r\nhim: his sense of unworthiness made him sink like his boat, and\r\nshrink away from the Divine Lord. I remember that sensation well;\r\nfor I was half inclined to cry with the demoniac of Gadara, "What\r\nhave I to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of God most high?" That\r\nfirst discovery of His injured love was overpowering; its very\r\nhopefulness increased my anguish; for then I saw that I had slain\r\nthe Lord who had come to save me. I saw that mine was the hand\r\nwhich made the hammer fall, and drove the nails that fastened the\r\nRedeemer\'s hands and feet to the cruel tree.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "My conscience felt and own\'d the guilt,\r\n    And plunged me in despair;\r\n I saw my sins His blood had spilt,\r\n    And help\'d to nail Him there."\r\n\r\n This is the sight which breeds repentance: "They shall look \n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'upon Him whom they have pierced, and mourn for Him."

He tells us, "And when I saw Him, I fell at His\r\nfeet as dead." Yes, even when we begin to see that He has put away\r\nour sin, and removed our guilt by His death, we feel as if we\r\ncould never look up again, because we have been so cruel to our\r\nbest Friend. It is no wonder if we then say, "It is true that He\r\nhas forgiven me; but I never can forgive myself. He makes me live,\r\nand I live in Him; but at the thought of His goodness I fall at\r\nHis feet as dead. Boasting is dead, self is dead, and all desire\r\nfor anything beyond my Lord is dead also."

Oh, that the Lord would come\r\nagain to us as at the first, and like a consuming fire discover\r\nand destroy the dross which now alloys our gold! The word visit\r\nbrings to us who travel the remembrance of the government officer\r\nwho searches our baggage; thus doth the Lord seek out our secret\r\nthings. But it also reminds us of the visits of the physician, who\r\nnot only finds out our maladies, but also removes them. Thus did\r\nthe Lord Jesus visit us at the first.\r\nSince those early days, I hope that you and I have had many\r\nvisits from our Lord. Those first visits were, as I said, sharply\r\nsearching; but the later ones have been sweetly solacing. Some of\r\nus have had them, especially in the night, when we have been\r\ncompelled to count the sleepless hours. "Heaven\'s gate opens when\r\nthis world\'s is shut." The night is still; everybody is away; work\r\nis done; care is forgotten, and then the Lord Himself draws near.\r\nPossibly there may be pain to be endured, the head may be aching,\r\nand the heart may be throbbing; but if Jesus comes to visit us,\r\nour bed of languishing becomes a throne of glory. Though it is\r\ntrue "He giveth His beloved sleep," yet at such times He gives\r\nthem something better than sleep, namely; His own presence, and\r\nthe fulness of joy which comes with it. By night upon our bed we\r\nhave seen the unseen. I have tried sometimes not to sleep under an\r\nexcess of joy, when the company of Christ has been sweetly mine.\r\n"Thou hast visited me in the night." Believe me, there are\r\nsuch things as personal visits from Jesus to His people. He has\r\nnot left us utterly. Though He be not seen with the bodily eye by\r\nbush or brook, nor on the mount, nor by the sea, yet doth He come\r\nand go, observed only by the spirit, felt only by the heart.

Delightful and instructive as it is to behold\r\nthe likeness of Christ by meditation, yet the enjoyment of His\r\nactual presence is something more. I may wear my friend\'s portrait\r\nabout my person, and yet may not be able to say, "Thou hast\r\nvisited me."\r\nIt is the actual, though spiritual, coming of Christ which we\r\nso much desire.

By spiritual we do not mean\r\nunreal; in fact, the spiritual takes the lead in real-ness to\r\nspiritual men. I believe in the true and real presence of Jesus\r\nwith His people: such presence has been real to my spirit. Lord\r\nJesus, Thou Thyself hast visited me. As surely as the Lord Jesus\r\ncame really as to His flesh to Bethlehem and Calvary, so surely\r\ndoes He come really by His Spirit to His people in the hours of\r\ntheir communion with Him.

The outline of it\r\nis taken from one who will never complain of me, for to the great\r\nloss of the Church she has left these lower choirs to sing above.\r\nMiss Havergal, last and loveliest of our modern poets, when her\r\ntones were most mellow, and her language most sublime, has been\r\ncaught up to swell the music of heaven. Her last poems are\r\npublished with the title, "Under His Shadow," and the preface\r\ngives the reason for the name. She said, "I should like the title\r\nto be, \'Under His Shadow.\' I seem to see four pictures suggested\r\nby that: under the shadow of a rock, in a weary plain; under the\r\nshadow of a tree; closer still, under the shadow of His wing;\r\nnearest and closest, in the shadow of His hand. Surely that hand\r\nmust be the pierced hand, that may oftentimes press us sorely, and\r\nyet evermore encircling, upholding, and shadowing."\r\n"Under His Shadow," is our afternoon subject, and we will in\r\na few words enlarge on the Scriptural plan which Miss Havergal has\r\nbequeathed to us. Our text is, "He that dwelleth in the secret\r\nplace of the most High shall abide ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"under the shadow"}),' of the\r\nAlmighty." The shadow of God is not the occasional resort, but the\r\nconstant abiding-place, of the saint. Here we find not only our\r\nconsolation, but our habitation. We ought never to be out of the\r\nshadow of God. It is to dwellers, not to visitors, that the Lord\r\npromises His protection. "He that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"dwelleth"}),' in the secret place\r\nof the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty:"\r\nand that shadow shall preserve him from nightly terror and ghostly\r\nill, from the arrows of war and of pestilence, from death and from\r\ndestruction. Guarded by Omnipotence, the chosen of the Lord are\r\nalways safe; for as they dwell in the holy place, hard by the\r\nmercy-seat, where the blood was sprinkled of old, the pillar of\r\nfire by night, the pillar of cloud by day, which ever hangs over\r\nthe sanctuary, covers them also. Is it not written, "In the time\r\nof trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion, in the secret of His\r\ntabernacle shall He hide me"? What better security can we desire?\r\nAs the people of God, we are always under the protection of the\r\nMost High. Wherever we go, whatever we suffer, whatever may be our\r\ndifficulties, temptations, trials, or perplexities, we are always\r\n"under the shadow of the Almighty." Over all who maintain their\r\nfellowship with God the most tender guardian care is extended.\r\nTheir heavenly Father Himself interposes between them and their\r\nadversaries. The experience of the saints, albeit they are all\r\nunder the shadow, yet differs as to the form in which that\r\nprotection has been enjoyed by them, hence the value of the four\r\nfigures which will now engage our attention.\r\nI. We will begin with the first picture which Miss Havergal\r\nmentions, namely, the rock sheltering the weary traveller:--"',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"The\r\nshadow of a great rock in a weary land"}),"\" (Isaiah xxxii. 2).\r\nNow, I take it that this is where we begin to know our Lord's\r\nshadow. He was at the first to us ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"a refuge in time of trouble"}),'.\r\nWeary was the way, and great was the heat; our lips were parched,\r\nand our souls were fainting; we sought for shelter, and we found\r\nnone; for we were in the wilderness of sin and condemnation, and\r\nwho could bring us deliverance, or even hope? Then we cried unto\r\nthe Lord in our trouble, and He led us to the Rock of ages, which\r\nof old was cleft for us. We saw our interposing Mediator coming\r\nbetween us and the fierce heat of justice, and we hailed the\r\nblessed screen. The Lord Jesus was unto us a covering for sin, and\r\nso a covert from wrath. The sense of divine displeasure, which had\r\nbeaten upon our conscience, was removed by the removal of the sin\r\nitself, which we saw to be laid on Jesus, who in our place and\r\nstead endured its penalty.\r\nThe shadow of a rock is remarkably cooling, and so was the\r\nLord Jesus eminently comforting to us. The shadow of a rock is\r\nmore dense, more complete, and more cool than any other shade; and\r\nso the peace which Jesus gives passeth all understanding, there is\r\nnone like it. No chance beam darts through the rock-shade, nor can\r\nthe heat penetrate as it will do in a measure through the foliage\r\nof a forest. Jesus is a complete shelter, and blessed are they who\r\nare "under His shadow." Let them take care that they abide there,\r\nand never venture forth to answer for themselves, or to brave the\r\naccusations of Satan.\r\nAs with sin, so with sorrow of every sort: the Lord is the\r\nRock of our refuge. No sun shall smite us, nor, any heat, because\r\nwe are never out of Christ. The saints know where to fly, and they\r\nuse their privilege.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "When troubles, like a burning sun,\r\n    Beat heavy on their head,\r\n To Christ their mighty Rock they run,\r\n    And find a pleasing shade."\r\n\r\n There is, however, something of awe about this great shadow. \n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['A rock is often so high as to be terrible, and we tremble in\r\npresence of its greatness. The idea of littleness hiding behind\r\nmassive greatness is well set forth; but there is no tender\r\nthought of fellowship, or gentleness: even so, at the first, we\r\nview the Lord Jesus as our shelter from the consuming heat of\r\nwell-deserved punishment, and we know little more. It is most\r\npleasant to remember that this is only one panel of the four-fold\r\npicture. Inexpressibly dear to my soul is the deep cool rock-shade\r\nof my blessed Lord, as I stand in Him a sinner saved; yet is there\r\nmore.\r\nII. Our second picture, that of the tree, is to be found in\r\nthe Song of Solomon ii. 3:--"',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"As the apple tree among the trees of\r\nthe wood, so is my Beloved among the sons. I sat down under His\r\nshadow with great delight, and His fruit was sweet to my taste"}),'."\r\nHere we have not so much refuge from trouble as special ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"rest\r\nin times of joy"}),'. The spouse is happily wandering through a wood,\r\nglancing at many trees, and rejoicing in the music of the birds.\r\nOne tree specially charms her: the citron with its golden fruit\r\nwins her admiration, and she sits under its shadow with great\r\ndelight; such was her Beloved to her, the best among the good, the\r\nfairest of the fair, the joy of her joy, the light of her delight.\r\nSuch is Jesus to the believing soul.\r\nThe sweet influences of Christ are intended to give us a\r\nhappy rest, and we ought to avail ourselves of them; "I sat down\r\nunder His shadow." This was Mary\'s better part, which Martha well-\r\nnigh missed by being cumbered. That is the good old way wherein we\r\nare to walk, the way in which we find rest unto our souls. Papists\r\nand papistical persons, whose religion is all ceremonies, or all\r\nworking, or all groaning, or all feeling, have never come to an\r\nend. We may say of their religion as of the law, that it made\r\nnothing perfect; but under the gospel there is something finished,\r\nand that something is the sum and substance of our salvation, and\r\ntherefore there is rest for us, and we ought to sing, "I sat\r\ndown."\r\nDear friends, is Christ to each one of us a place of sitting\r\ndown? I do not mean a rest of idleness and self-content,--God\r\ndeliver us from that; but there is rest in a conscious grasp of\r\nChrist, a rest of contentment with Him as our all in all. God give\r\nus to know more of this! This shadow is also meant to yield\r\nperpetual solace, for the spouse did not merely come under it, but\r\nthere she sat down as one who meant to stay. Continuance of repose\r\nand joy is purchased for us by our Lord\'s perfected work. Under\r\nthe shadow she found food; she had no need to leave it to find a\r\nsingle needful thing, for the tree which shaded also yielded\r\nfruit; nor did she need even to rise from her rest, but sitting\r\nstill she feasted on the delicious fruit. You who know the Lord\r\nJesus know also what this meaneth.\r\nThe spouse never wished to go beyond her Lord. She knew no\r\nhigher life than that of sitting under the Well-beloved\'s shadow.\r\nShe passed the cedar, and oak, and every other goodly tree, but\r\nthe apple-tree held her, and there she sat down. "Many there be\r\nthat say, who will show us any good? But as for us, O Lord, our\r\nheart is fixed, our heart is fixed, resting on Thee. We will go no\r\nfurther, for Thou art our dwelling-place, we feel at home with\r\nThee, and sit down beneath Thy shadow." Some Christians cultivate\r\nreverence at the expense of childlike love; they kneel down, but\r\nthey dare not sit down. Our Divine Friend and Lover wills not that\r\nit should be so; He would not have us stand on ceremony with Him,\r\nbut come boldly unto Him.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "Let us be simple with Him, then,\r\n    Not backward, stiff or cold,\r\n As though our Bethlehem could be\r\n    What Sina was of old."\r\n\r\n Let us use His sacred name as a common word, as a household \n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'word, and run to Him as to a dear familiar friend. Under His\r\nshadow we are to feel that we are at home, and then He will make\r\nHimself at home to us by becoming food unto our souls, and giving\r\nspiritual refreshment to us while we rest. The spouse does not\r\nhere say that she reached up to the tree to gather its fruit, but\r\nshe sat down on the ground in intense delight, and the fruit came\r\nto her where she sat. It is wonderful how Christ will come down to\r\nsouls that sit beneath His shadow; if we can but be at home with\r\nChrist, He will sweetly commune with us. Has He not said, "Delight\r\nthyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of\r\nthine heart"?\r\nIn this second form of the sacred shadow, the sense of awe\r\ngives place to that of restful delight in Christ.

Oh! get you to\r\nthe apple-tree, and find out who is the fairest among the fair.\r\nMake the Light of heaven the delight of your heart, and then be\r\nfilled with heart's-ease, and revel in complete content.\r\nIII. The third view of the one subject is,--the shadow of his\r\nwings,--a precious word. I think the best specimen of it, for it\r\noccurs several times, is in that blessed Psalm, the sixty-third,\r\nverse seven:--\r\n\"",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Because Thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of\r\nThy wings will I rejoice"}),'."\r\nDoes not this set forth our Lord as ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"our trust in hours of\r\ndepression?"}),' In the Psalm now open before us, David was banished\r\nfrom the means of grace to a dry and thirsty land, where no water\r\nwas. What is much worse, he was in a measure away from all\r\nconscious enjoyment of God. He says, "Early will I seek Thee. My\r\nsoul thirsteth for Thee." He sings rather of memories than of\r\npresent communion with God. We also have come into this condition,\r\nand have been unable to find any present comfort. "Thou hast been\r\nmy help," has been the highest note we could strike, and we have\r\nbeen glad to reach to that. At such times, the light of God\'s face\r\nhas been withdrawn, but our faith has taught us to rejoice under\r\nthe shadow of His wings. Light there was none; we were altogether\r\nin the shade, but it was a warm shade. We felt that God who had\r\nbeen near must be near us still, and therefore we were quieted.\r\nOur God cannot change, and therefore as He was our help He must\r\nstill be our help, our help even though He casts a shadow over us,\r\nfor it must be the shadow of His own eternal wings. The metaphor\r\nis, of course, derived from the nestling of little birds under the\r\nshadow of their mother\'s wings, and the picture is singularly\r\ntouching and comforting. The little bird is not yet able to take\r\ncare of itself, so it cowers down under the mother, and is there\r\nhappy and safe. Disturb a hen for a moment, and you will see all\r\nthe little chickens huddling together, and by their chirps making\r\na kind of song. Then they push their heads into her feathers, and\r\nseem happy beyond measure in their warm abode. When we are very\r\nsick and sore depressed, when we are worried with the care of\r\npining children, and the troubles of a needy household, and the\r\ntemptations of Satan, how comforting it is to run to our God,--\r\nlike the little chicks run to the hen,--and hide away near His\r\nheart, beneath His Wings. Oh, tried ones, press closely to the\r\nloving heart of your Lord, hide yourselves entirely beneath His\r\nwings! Here awe has disappeared, and rest itself is enhanced by\r\nthe idea of loving trust. The little birds are safe in their\r\nmother\'s love, and we, too, are beyond measure secure and happy in\r\nthe loving favour of the Lord.\r\nIV. The last form of the shadow is that of the hand, and\r\nthis, it seems to me, points to power and position in service.\r\nTurn to Isaiah xlix. 2:--\r\n"',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"And He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow\r\nof His hand hath He kid me, and made me a polished shaft; in His\r\nquiver hath He hid me"}),'."\r\nThis undoubtedly refers to the Saviour, for the passage\r\nproceeds:--"And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in\r\nwhom I will be glorified. Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I\r\nhave spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my\r\njudgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God. And now, saith\r\nthe Lord that formed me from the womb to be His servant, to bring\r\nJacob again to Him, though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be\r\nglorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.\r\nAnd He said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be My servant\r\nto raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of\r\nIsrael: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that\r\nthou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth." Our Lord\r\nJesus Christ was hidden away in the hand of Jehovah, to be used by\r\nHim as a polished shaft for the overthrow of His enemies, and the\r\nvictory of His people. Yet, inasmuch as it is Christ, it is also\r\nall Christ\'s servants, since as He is so are we also in this\r\nworld; and to make quite sure of it, we have the same expression\r\nin the sixteenth verse of the fifty-first chapter, where, speaking\r\nof His people, He says, "I have covered thee in the shadow of Mine\r\nhand." Is not this an excellent minister\'s text? Every one of you\r\nwho will speak a word for Jesus shall have a share in it. This is\r\nwhere those who are workers for Christ should long to be,--"in the\r\nshadow of His hand," to achieve His eternal purpose. What are any\r\nof God\'s servants without their Lord but weapons out of the\r\nwarrior\'s hand, having no power to do anything? We ought to be as\r\nthe arrows of the Lord which He shoots at His enemies; and so\r\ngreat is His hand of power, and so little are we as His\r\ninstruments, that He hides us away in the hollow of His hand,\r\nunseen until He darts us forth. As workers, we are to be hidden\r\naway in the hand of God, or to quote the other figure, "in His\r\nquiver hath He hid me:" we are to be unseen till He uses us. It is\r\nimpossible for us not to be known somewhat if the Lord uses us,\r\nbut we may not aim at being noticed, but, on the contrary, if we\r\nbe as much used as the very chief of the apostles, we must\r\ntruthfully add, "though I be nothing." Our desire should be that\r\nChrist should be glorified, and that self should be concealed.\r\nAlas! there is a way of always showing self in what we do, and we\r\nare all too ready to fall into it. You can visit the poor in such\r\na way that they will feel that his lordship or her ladyship has\r\ncondescended to call upon poor Betsy; but there is another way of\r\ndoing the same thing so that the tried child of God shall know\r\nthat a brother beloved or a dear sister in Christ has shown a\r\nfellow-feeling for her, and has talked to her heart. There is a\r\nway of preaching, in which a great divine has evidently displayed\r\nhis vast learning and talent; and there is another way of\r\npreaching, in which a faithful servant of Jesus Christ, depending\r\nupon his Lord, has spoken in his Master\'s name, and left a rich\r\nunction behind. Within the hand of God is the place of acceptance,\r\nand safety; and for service it is the place of power, as well as\r\nof concealment. God only works with those who are in His hand; and\r\nthe more we lie hidden there, the more surely will He use us ere\r\nlong. May the Lord do unto us according to His word, "I have put\r\nMy words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of My\r\nhand." In this case we shall feel all the former emotions\r\ncombined: awe that the Lord should condescend to take us into His\r\nhand, rest and delight that He should deign to use us, trust that\r\nout of weakness we shall now be made strong, and to this will be\r\nadded an absolute assurance that the end of our being must be\r\nanswered, for that which is urged onward by the Almighty hand\r\ncannot miss its mark.\r\nThese are mere surface thoughts. The subject deserves a\r\nseries of discourses. Your best course, my beloved friends, will\r\nbe to enlarge upon these hints by a long personal experience of\r\nabiding under the shadow of the Almighty. May God the Holy Ghost\r\nlead you into it, and keep you there, for Jesus\' sake!']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:'                 UNDER THE APPLE TREE.\r\n\r\n "I sat down under His shadow with great delight, and His \n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"fruit was sweet to my taste.\"--Solomon's Song ii. 3."}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Christ ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"known should be Christ used"}),'. The spouse knew her Beloved\r\nto be like a fruit-bearing tree, and at once she sat under His\r\nshadow, and fed upon His fruit. It is a pity that we know so much\r\nabout Christ, and yet enjoy Him so little. May our experience keep\r\npace with our knowledge, and may that experience be composed of a\r\npractical using of our Lord! Jesus casts a shadow, let us sit\r\nunder it: Jesus yields fruit, let us taste the sweetness of it.\r\nDepend upon it that the way to learn more is to use what you know;\r\nand, moreover, the way to learn a truth thoroughly is to learn it\r\nexperimentally. You know a doctrine beyond all fear of\r\ncontradiction when you have proved it for yourself by personal\r\ntest and trial. The bride in the song as good as says, "I am\r\ncertain that my Beloved casts a shadow, for I have sat under it,\r\nand I am persuaded that He bears sweet fruit, for I have tasted of\r\nit." The best way of demonstrating the power of Christ to save is\r\nto trust in Him and be saved yourself; and of all those who are\r\nsure of the divinity of our holy faith, there are none so certain\r\nas those who feel its divine power upon themselves. You may reason\r\nyourself into a belief of the gospel, and you may by further\r\nreasoning keep yourself orthodox; but a personal trial, and an\r\ninward knowing of the truth, are incomparably the best evidences.\r\nIf Jesus be as an apple tree among the trees of the wood, do not\r\nkeep away from Him, but sit under His shadow, and taste His fruit.\r\nHe is a Saviour; do not believe the fact and yet remain unsaved.\r\nAs far as Christ is known to you, so far make use of Him. Is not\r\nthis sound common-sense?\r\nWe would further remark that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"we are at liberty to make every\r\npossible use of Christ"}),". Shadow and fruit may both be enjoyed.\r\nChrist in His infinite condescension exists for needy souls. Oh,\r\nlet us say it over again: it is a bold word, but it is true,--as\r\nChrist Jesus, our Lord exists for the benefit of His people. A\r\nSaviour only exists to save. A physician lives to heal. The Good\r\nShepherd lives, yea, dies, for His sheep. Our Lord Jesus Christ\r\nhath wrapped us about His heart; we are intimately interwoven with\r\nall His offices, with all His honours, with all His traits of\r\ncharacter, with all that He has done, and with all that He has yet\r\nto do. The 'sinners' Friend lives for sinners, and sinners may\r\nhave Him and use Him to the uttermost. He is as free to us as the\r\nair we breathe. What are fountains for, but that the thirsty may\r\ndrink? What is the harbour for but that storm-tossed barques may\r\nthere find refuge? What is Christ for but that poor guilty ones\r\nlike ourselves may come to Him and look and live, and afterwards\r\nmay have all our needs supplied out of His fulness?\r\nWe have thus the door set open for us, and we pray that the\r\nHoly Spirit may help us to enter in while we notice in the text\r\ntwo things which we pray that you may enjoy to the full. First,\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the heart's rest in Christ:"}),' "I sat down under His shadow with\r\ngreat delight." And, secondly, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the heart's refreshment in\r\nChrist:"}),' "His fruit was sweet to my taste."\r\nI. To begin with, we have here the heart\'s rest in Christ. To\r\nset this forth, let us notice the character of the person who\r\nuttered this sentence. She who said, "I sat down under His shadow\r\nwith great delight," was one who ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"had known before what weary\r\ntravel meant, and therefore valued rest;"}),' for the man who has\r\nnever laboured knows nothing of the sweetness of repose. The\r\nloafer who has eaten bread he never earned, from whose brow there\r\nnever oozed a drop of honest sweat, does not deserve rest, and\r\nknows not what it is. It is to the labouring man that rest is\r\nsweet; and when at last we come, toil-worn with many miles of\r\nweary plodding, to a shaded place where we may comfortably sit\r\ndown, then are we filled with delight.\r\nThe spouse had been seeking her Beloved, and in looking for\r\nHim she had asked where she was likely to find Him. "Tell me,"\r\nsays she, "O Thou whom my soul loveth, where Thou feedest, where\r\nThou makest Thy flock to rest at noon." The answer was given to\r\nher, "Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock." She did go\r\nher way; but, after a while, she came to this resolution: "I will\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"sit down"}),' under His shadow."\r\nMany of you have been sorely wearied with going your way to\r\nfind peace. Some of you tried ceremonies, and trusted in them, and\r\nthe priest came to your help; but he mocked your heart\'s distress.\r\nOthers of you sought by various systems of thought to come to an\r\nanchorage; but, tossed from billow to billow, you found no rest\r\nupon the seething sea of speculation. More of you tried by your\r\ngood works to gain rest to your consciences. You multiplied your\r\nprayers, you poured out floods of tears, you hoped, by almsgiving\r\nand by the like, that some merit might accrue to you, and that\r\nyour heart might feel acceptance with God, and so have rest. You\r\ntoiled and toiled, like the men that were in the vessel with Jonah\r\nwhen they rowed hard to bring their ship to land, but could not,\r\nfor the sea wrought and was tempestuous. There was no escape for\r\nyou that way, and so you were driven to another way, even to rest\r\nin Jesus. My heart looks back to the time when I was under a sense\r\nof sin, and sought with all my soul to find peace, but could not\r\ndiscover it, high or low, in any place beneath the sky; yet when\r\n"I saw one hanging on a tree," as the Substitute for sin, then my\r\nheart sat down under His shadow with great delight. My heart\r\nreasoned thus with herself,--Did Jesus suffer in my stead? Then I\r\nshall not suffer. Did He bear my sin? Then I do not bear it. Did\r\nGod accept His Son as my Substitute? Then He will never smite\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"me"}),'. Was Jesus acceptable with God as my Sacrifice?

Did\r\nwe not read just now her exclamation,--"Look not upon me, for I am\r\nblack, because the sun hath looked upon me"?

Did\r\nthe great Sun--that Sun without variableness or shadow of a\r\nturning--ever dart upon you His hottest rays,--the rays of his\r\nholiness and justice? Did you cower down beneath the scorching\r\nbeams of that great Light, and say, "We are consumed by Thine\r\nanger"? If you have ever felt ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"that"}),", you have found it a very\r\nblessed thing to come under the shadow of Christ's atoning\r\nsacrifice. A shadow, you know, is cast by a body coming between us\r\nand the light and heat; and our Lord's most blessed body has come\r\nbetween us and the scorching sun of divine justice, so that we sit\r\nunder the shadow of His mediation with great delight.\r\nAnd now, if any other sun begins to scorch us, we fly to our\r\nLord. If domestic trouble, or business care, or Satanic\r\ntemptation, or inward corruption, oppresses us, we hasten to\r\nJesus' shadow, to hide under Him, and there \"sit down\" in the cool\r\nrefreshment with great delight. The interposition of our blessed\r\nLord is the cause of our inward quiet. The sun cannot scorch ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"me"}),",\r\nfor it scorched ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Him"}),". My troubles need not trouble me, for He has\r\ntaken my trouble, and I have left it in His hands. \"I sat down\r\nunder His shadow.\"\r\nMark well these two things concerning the spouse. She knew\r\nwhat it was to be weary, and she knew what it was to be sunburnt;\r\nand just in proportion as you also know these two things, your\r\nvaluation of Christ will rise. You who have never pined under the\r\nwrath of God have never prized the Saviour. Water is of small\r\nvalue in this land of brooks and rivers, and so you commonly\r\nsprinkle the roads with it; but I warrant you that, if you were\r\nmaking a day's march over burning sand, a cup of cold water would\r\nbe worth a king's ransom; and so to thirsty souls Christ is\r\nprecious, but to none beside.\r\nNow, when the spouse was sitting down, restful and delighted,\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"she was overshadowed"}),'. She says, "I sat down ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"under His shadow"}),'."\r\nI do not know a more delightful state of mind than to feel quite\r\novershadowed by our beloved Lord. Here is my black sin, but there\r\nis His precious blood overshadowing my sin, and hiding it for\r\never. Here is my condition by nature, an enemy to God; but He who\r\nreconciled me to God by His blood has overshadowed that also, so\r\nthat I forget that I was once an enemy in the joy of being now a\r\nfriend. I am very weak; but He is strong, and His strength\r\novershadows my feebleness. I am very poor; but He hath all riches,\r\nand His riches overshadow my poverty. I am most unworthy; but He\r\nis so worthy that if I use His name I shall receive as much as if\r\nI were worthy: His worthiness doth overshadow my unworthiness. It\r\nis very precious to put the truth the other way, and say, If there\r\nbe anything good in me, it is not good when I compare myself with\r\nHim, for His goodness quite eclipses and overshadows it. Can I say\r\nI love Him? So I do, but I hardly dare call it love, for His love\r\novershadows it. Did I suppose that I served Him? So I would; but\r\nmy poor service is not worth mentioning in comparison with what He\r\nhas done for me. Did I think I had any degree of holiness? I must\r\nnot deny what His Spirit works in me; but when I think of His\r\nimmaculate life, and all His divine perfections, where am I? What\r\nam I? Have you not sometimes felt this? Have you not been so\r\novershadowed and hidden under your Lord that you became as\r\nnothing? I know myself what it is to feel that if I die in a\r\nworkhouse it does not matter so long as my Lord is glorified.\r\nMortals may cast out my name as evil, if they like; but what\r\nmatters it since His dear name shall one day be printed in stars\r\nathwart the sky? Let Him overshadow me; I delight that it should\r\nbe so.\r\nThe spouse tells us that, when she became quite overshadowed,\r\nthen ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"she felt great delight"}),'. Great "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"I"}),'" never has great\r\ndelight, for it cannot bear to own a greater than itself, but the\r\nhumble believer finds his delight in being overshadowed by his\r\nLord. In the shade of Jesus we have more delight than in any\r\nfancied light of our own. The spouse had ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"great"})," delight. I trust\r\nthat you Christian people do have great delight; and if not, you\r\nought to ask yourselves whether you really are the people of God.\r\nI like to see a cheerful countenance; ay, and to hear of raptures\r\nin the hearts of those who are God's saints! There are people who\r\nseem to think that religion and gloom are married, and must never\r\nbe divorced. Pull down the blinds on Sunday, and darken the rooms;\r\nif you have a garden, or a rose in flower, try to forget that\r\nthere are such beauties: are you not to serve God as dolorously as\r\nyou can? Put your book under your arm, and crawl to your place of\r\nworship in as mournful a manner as if you were being marched to\r\nthe whipping-post. Act thus if you will; but give me that religion\r\nwhich cheers my heart, fires my soul, and fills me with enthusiasm\r\nand delight,--for that is likely to be the religion of heaven, and\r\nit agrees with the experience of the Inspired Song.\r\nAlthough I trust that we know what delight means, I question\r\nif we have enough of it to describe ourselves as ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"sitting down"})," in\r\nthe enjoyment of it. Do you give yourselves enough time to sit at\r\nJesus' feet? ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"There"}),' is the place of delight, do you abide in it?\r\nSit down under His shadow. "I have no leisure," cries one. Try and\r\nmake a little. Steal it from your sleep if you cannot get it\r\nanyhow else. Grant leisure to your heart. It would be a great pity\r\nif a man never spent five minutes with his wife, but was forced to\r\nbe always hard at work. Why, that is slavey, is it not? Shall we\r\nnot then have time to commune with our Best-beloved? Surely,\r\nsomehow or other, we can squeeze out a little season in which we\r\nshall have nothing else to do but to sit down under His shadow\r\nwith great delight! When I take my Bible, and want to feed on it\r\nfor myself, I generally get thinking about preaching upon the\r\ntext, and what I should say to you from it. This will not do; I\r\nmust get away from that, and forget that there is a Tabernacle,\r\nthat I may sit personally at Jesus\' feet. And, oh, there is an\r\nintense delight in being overshadowed by Him! He is near you, and\r\nyou know it. His dear presence is as certainly with you as if you\r\ncould see Him, for His influence surrounds you.\r\nOften have I felt as if Jesus leaned over me, as a friend\r\nmight look over my shoulder. Although no cool shade comes over\r\nyour brow, yet you may as much feel His shadow as if it did, for\r\nyour heart grows calm; and if you have been wearied with the\r\nfamily, or troubled with the church, or vexed with yourself, you\r\ncome down from the chamber where you have seen your Lord, and you\r\nfeel braced for the battle of life, ready for its troubles and its\r\ntemptations, because you have seen the Lord. "I sat down" said\r\nshe, "under His shadow with ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"great delight"}),'." How great that\r\ndelight was she could not tell, but she sat down as one\r\noverpowered with it, needing to sit still under the load of bliss.\r\nI do not like to talk much about the secret delights of\r\nChristians, because there are always some around us who do not\r\nunderstand our meaning; but I will venture to say this much--that\r\nif worldlings could but even guess what are the secret joys of\r\nbelievers, they would give their eyes to share with us. We have\r\ntroubles, and we admit it, we expect to have them; but we have\r\njoys which are frequently excessive. We should not like that\r\nothers should be witnesses of the delight which now and then\r\ntosses our soul into a very tempest of joy. You know what it\r\nmeans, do you not? When you have been quite alone with the\r\nheavenly Bridegroom, you wanted to tell the angels of the sweet\r\nlove of Christ to you, a poor unworthy one. You even wished to\r\nteach the golden harps fresh music, for seraphs know not the\r\nheights and depths of the grace of God as you know them.\r\nThe spouse had great delight, and we know that she had, for\r\nthis one reason, that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"she did not forget it"}),'. This verse and the\r\nwhole Song are a remembrance of what she had enjoyed. She says, "I\r\nsat down under His shadow." It may have been a month, it may have\r\nbeen years ago; but she had not forgotten it. The joys of\r\nfellowship with God are written in marble. "Engraved as in eternal\r\nbrass" are memories of communion with Christ Jesus. "Above\r\nfourteen years ago," says the apostle, "I knew a man." Ah, it was\r\nworth remembering all those years! He had not told his delight,\r\nbut he had kept it stored up. He says, "I knew a man in Christ\r\nabove fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or\r\nwhether out of the body, I cannot tell:)" so great had his\r\ndelights been. When we look back, we forget birthdays, holidays,\r\nand bonfire-nights which we have spent after the manner of men,\r\nbut we readily recall our times of fellowship with the Well-\r\nbeloved. We have known our Tabors, our times of transfiguration\r\nfellowship, and like Peter we remember when we were "with Him in\r\nthe holy mount." Our head has leaned upon the Master\'s bosom, and\r\nwe can never forget the intense delight; nor will we fail to put\r\non record for the good of others the joys with which we have been\r\nindulged.\r\nNow I leave this first part of the subject, only noticing how\r\nbeautifully natural it is. There was a tree, and she sat down\r\nunder the shadow: there was nothing strained, nothing formal. So\r\nought true piety ever to be consistent with common-sense, with\r\nthat which seems most fitting, most comely, most wise, and most\r\nnatural. There is Christ, we may enjoy Him, let us not despise the\r\nprivilege.\r\nII. The second part of our subject is, the heart\'s\r\nrefreshment in Christ. His fruit was sweet to my taste. Here I\r\nwill not enlarge, but give you thoughts in brief which you can\r\nbeat out afterwards. ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"She did not feast upon the fruit of the tree\r\ntill first she was under the shadow of it."})," There is no knowing\r\nthe excellent things of Christ till you trust Him. Not a single\r\nsweet apple shall fall to the lot of those who are outside the\r\nshadow. Come and trust Christ, and then all that there is in\r\nChrist shall be enjoyed by you. O unbelievers, what you miss! If\r\nyou will but sit down under His shadow, you shall have all things;\r\nbut if you will not, neither shall any good thing of Christ's be\r\nyours.\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"But as soon as ever she was under the shadow, then the fruit\r\nwas all hers"}),'. "I sat down under His shadow," saith she, and then,\r\n"His fruit was sweet to my taste." Dost thou believe in Jesus,\r\nfriend? Then Jesus Christ Himself is thine; and if thou dost own\r\nthe tree, thou mayest well eat the fruit. Since He Himself becomes\r\nthine altogether, then His redemption and the pardon that comes of\r\nit, His living power, His mighty intercession, the glories of His\r\nSecond Advent, and all that belong to Him are made over to thee\r\nfor thy personal and present use and enjoyment. All things are\r\nyours, since Christ is yours. Only mind you imitate the spouse:\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"when she found that the fruit was hers, she ate it"}),". Copy her\r\nclosely in this. It is a great fault in many believers, that they\r\ndo not appropriate the promises, and feed on them. Do not err as\r\nthey do. Under the shadow you have a right to eat the fruit. Deny\r\nnot yourselves the sacred entertainment.\r\nNow, it would appear, as we read the text, that ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"she obtained\r\nthis fruit without effort"}),'. The proverb says, "He who would gain\r\nthe fruit must climb the tree." But she did not climb, for she\r\nsays, "I sat down under His shadow." I suppose the fruit dropped\r\ndown to her. I know that it is so with us. We no longer spend our\r\nmoney for that which is not bread, and our labour for that which\r\nsatisfieth not; but we sit under our Lord\'s shadow, and we eat\r\nthat which is good, and our soul delights itself in sweetness.\r\nCome Christian, enter into the calm rest of faith, by sitting down\r\nbeneath the cross, and thou shalt be fed even to the full.\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"The spouse rested while feasting:"}),' she sat and ate. So, O\r\ntrue believer, rest whilst thou art feeding upon Christ! The\r\nspouse says, "I sat, and I ate." Had she not told us in the former\r\nchapter that the King ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"sat"})," at His table? See how like the Church\r\nis to her Lord, and the believer to his Saviour! We sit down also,\r\nand we eat, even as the King doth. Right royally are we\r\nentertained. His joy is in us, and His peace keeps our hearts and\r\nminds.\r\nFurther, notice that, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"as the spouse fed upon this fruit, she\r\nhad a relish for it."}),' It is not every palate that likes every\r\nfruit. Never dispute with other people about tastes of any sort,\r\nfor agreement is not possible. That dainty which to one person is\r\nthe most delicious is to another nauseous; and if there were a\r\ncompetition as to which fruit is preferable to all the rest, there\r\nwould probably be almost as many opinions as there are fruits. But\r\nblessed is he who hath a relish for Christ Jesus! Dear hearer, is\r\nHe sweet to you? Then He is yours. There never was a heart that\r\ndid relish Christ but what Christ belonged to that heart. If thou\r\nhast been feeding on Him, and He is sweet to thee, go on feasting,\r\nfor He who gave thee a relish gives thee Himself to satisfy thine\r\nappetite.\r\nWhat are the fruits which come from Christ? Are they not\r\npeace with God, renewal of heart, joy in the Holy Ghost, love to\r\nthe brethren? Are they not regeneration, justification,\r\nsanctification, adoption, and all the blessings of the covenant of\r\ngrace? And are they not each and all sweet to our taste? As we\r\nhave fed upon them, have we not said, "Yes, these things are\r\npleasant indeed. There is none like them. Let us live upon them\r\nevermore"? Now, sit down, sit down and feed. It seems a strange\r\nthing that we should have to persuade people to do that, but in\r\nthe spiritual world things are very different from what they are\r\nin the natural. In the case of most men, if you put a joint of\r\nmeat before them, and a knife and fork, they do not need many\r\narguments to persuade them to fall to. But I will tell you when\r\nthey will not do it, and that is when they are full: and I will\r\nalso tell you when they will do it, and that is when they are\r\nhungry. Even so, if thy soul is weary after Christ the Saviour,\r\nthou wilt feed on Him; but if not, it is useless for me to preach\r\nto thee, or bid thee come. However, thou that art there, sitting\r\nunder His shadow, thou mayest hear Him utter these words: "Eat, O\r\nfriend: drink, yea, drink abundantly." Thou canst not have too\r\nmuch of these good things: the more of Christ, the better the\r\nChristian.\r\nWe know that the spouse feasted herself right heartily with\r\nthis food from the tree of life, for ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"in after days she wanted\r\nmore"}),'. Will you kindly read on in the fourth verse? The verse\r\nwhich contains our text describes, as it were, her first love to\r\nher Lord, her country love, her rustic love. She went to the wood,\r\nand she found Him there like an apple tree, and she enjoyed Him as\r\none relishes a ripe apple in the country. But she grew in grace,\r\nshe learned more of her Lord, and she found that her Best-beloved\r\nwas a King. I should not wonder but what she learned the doctrine\r\nof the Second Advent, for then she began to sing, "He brought me\r\nto the banqueting house." As much as to say,--He did not merely\r\nlet me know Him out in the fields as the Christ in His\r\nhumiliation, but He brought me into the royal palace; and, since\r\nHe is a King, He brought forth a banner with His own brave\r\nescutcheon, and He waved it over me while I was sitting at the\r\ntable, and the motto of that banneret was love.\r\nShe grew very full of this. It was such a grand thing to find\r\na great Saviour, a triumphant Saviour, an exalted Saviour! But it\r\nwas too much for her, and she became sick of soul with the\r\nexcessive glory of what she had learned; and do you see what her\r\nheart craves for? She longs for her first simple joys, those\r\ncountrified delights. "Comfort me with apples," she says. Nothing\r\nbut the old joys will revive her. Did you ever feel like that? I\r\nhave been satiated with delight in the love of Christ as a\r\nglorious exalted Saviour when I have seen Him riding on His white\r\nhorse, and going forth conquering and to conquer; I have been\r\noverwhelmed when I have beheld Him in the midst of the throne,\r\nwith all the brilliant assembly of angels and archangels adoring\r\nHim, and my thought has gone forward to the day when He shall\r\ndescend with all the pomp of God, and make all kings and princes\r\nshrink into nothingness before the infinite majesty of His glory.\r\nThen I have felt as though, at the sight of Him, I must fall at\r\nHis feet as dead; and I have wanted somebody to come and tell me\r\nover again "the old, old story" of how He died in order that I\r\nmight be saved. His throne overpowers me, let me gather fruit from\r\nHis cross. Bring me apples from "the tree" again. I am awe-struck\r\nwhile in the palace, let me get away to the woods again. Give me\r\nan apple plucked from the tree, such as I have given out to boys\r\nand girls in His family, such an apple as this, "Come unto Me all\r\nye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Or\r\nthis: "This man receiveth sinners." Give me a promise from the\r\nbasket of the covenant. Give me the simplicity of Christ, let me\r\nbe a child and feast on apples again, if Jesus be the apple tree.\r\nI would fain go back to Christ on the tree in my stead, Christ\r\novershadowing me, Christ feeding me. This is the happiest state to\r\nlive in. Lord, evermore give us these apples! You recollect the\r\nold story we told, years ago, of Jack the huckster who used to\r\nsing,--']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "I\'m a poor sinner, and nothing at all,\r\n But Jesus Christ is my all in all."\r\n\r\n Those who knew him were astonished at his constant composure. \n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'They had a world of doubts and fears, and so they asked him why he\r\nnever doubted. "Well," said he, "I can\'t doubt but what I am a\r\npoor sinner, and nothing at all, for I know that, and feel it\r\nevery day. And why should I doubt that Jesus Christ is my all in\r\nall? for He says He is." "Oh!" said his questioner, "I have my ups\r\nand downs." "I don\'t," says Jack;" I can never go up, for I am a\r\npoor sinner, and nothing at all; and I cannot go down, for Jesus\r\nChrist is my all in all." He wanted to join the church, and they\r\nsaid he must tell his experience. He said, "All my experience is\r\nthat I am a poor sinner, and nothing at all, and Jesus Christ is\r\nmy all in all." "Well," they said, "when you come before the\r\nchurch-meeting, the minister may ask you questions."

"Why," said one\r\nbrother, "I sometimes feel so full of grace, I feel so advanced in\r\nsanctification, that I begin to be very happy." "I never do," said\r\nJack; "I am a poor sinner, and nothing at all." "But then," said\r\nthe other, "I go down again, and think I am not saved, because I\r\nam not as sanctified as I used to be." "But I never doubt my\r\nsalvation," said Jack, "because Jesus Christ is my all in all, and\r\nHe never alters." That simple story is grandly instructive, for it\r\nsets forth a plain man\'s faith in a plain salvation; it is the\r\nlikeness of a soul under the apple tree, resting in the shade, and\r\nfeasting on the fruit.\r\nNow, at this time I want you to think of Jesus, not as a\r\nPrince, but as an apple tree; and when this is done, I pray you to\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"sit down under His shadow"}),".

You who have come often, and have entered\r\ninto the palace, and are reclining at the banqueting table, you\r\nlords and peers of Christianity, come to the common wood and to\r\nthe common apple tree where poor saints are shaded and fed.

I am not sure that there are such persons, for those\r\nbelievers with whom I have been most intimate have had a varied\r\nexperience; and those whom I have known, who have boasted of their\r\nconstant perfectness, have not been the most reliable of\r\nindividuals. I hope there is a spiritual region attainable where\r\nthere are no clouds to hide the Sun of our soul; but I cannot\r\nspeak with positiveness, for I have not traversed that happy land.\r\nEvery year of my life has had a winter as well as a summer, and\r\nevery day its night. I have hitherto seen clear shinings and heavy\r\nrains, and felt warm breezes and fierce winds. Speaking for the\r\nmany of my brethren, I confess that though the substance be in us,\r\nas in the teil-tree and the oak, yet we do lose our leaves, and\r\nthe sap within us does not flow with equal vigour at all seasons.\r\nWe have our downs as well as our ups, our valleys as well as our\r\nhills. We are not always rejoicing; we are sometimes in heaviness\r\nthrough manifold trials. Alas! we are grieved to confess that our\r\nfellowship with the Well-beloved is not always that of rapturous\r\ndelight; but we have at times to seek Him, and cry, "Oh, that I\r\nknew where I might find Him!" This appears to me to have been in a\r\nmeasure the condition of the spouse when she cried, "Until the day\r\nbreak, and the shadows flee away, turn, my Beloved."\r\nI. These words teach us, first, that communion may be broken.\r\nThe spouse had lost the company of her Bridegroom: conscious\r\ncommunion with Him was gone, though she loved her Lord, and sighed\r\nfor Him. In her loneliness she was sorrowful; but ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"she had by no\r\nmeans ceased to love Him"}),", for she calls Him her Beloved, and\r\nspeaks as one who felt no doubt upon that point. Love to the Lord\r\nJesus may be quite as true, and perhaps quite as strong, when we\r\nsit in darkness as when we walk in the light. Nay, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"she had not\r\nlast her assurance of His love to her"}),', and of their mutual\r\ninterest in one another; for she says, "My Beloved is mine, and I\r\nam His;" and yet she adds, "Turn, my Beloved." The condition of\r\nour graces does not always coincide with the state of our joys. We\r\nmay be rich in faith and love, and yet have so low an esteem of\r\nourselves as to be much depressed.\r\nIt is plain, from this Sacred Canticle, that the spouse may\r\nlove and be loved, may be confident in her Lord, and be fully\r\nassured of her possession of Him, and yet there may for the\r\npresent be mountains between her and Him. Yes, we may even be far\r\nadvanced in the divine life, and yet be exiled for a while from\r\nconscious fellowship. There are nights for men as well as babes,\r\nand the strong know that the sun is hidden quite as well as do the\r\nsick and the feeble. Do not, therefore, condemn yourself, my\r\nbrother, because a cloud is over you; cast not away your\r\nconfidence; but the rather let faith burn up in the gloom, and let\r\nyour love resolve to come at your Lord again whatever be the\r\nbarriers which divide you from Him.\r\nWhen Jesus is absent from a true heir of heaven, sorrow will\r\nensue. The healthier our condition, the sooner will that absence\r\nbe perceived, and the more deeply will it be lamented. This sorrow\r\nis described in the text as darkness; this is implied in the\r\nexpression, "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Until the day break"}),'." Till Christ appears, no day\r\nhas dawned for us. We dwell in midnight darkness; the stars of the\r\npromises and the moon of experience yield no light of comfort till\r\nour Lord, like the sun, arises and ends the night. We must have\r\nChrist with us, or we are benighted: we grope like blind men for\r\nthe wall, and wander in dismay.\r\nThe spouse also speaks of shadows. "Until the day break, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"and\r\nthe shadows flee away"}),'." Shadows are multiplied by the departure\r\nof the sun, and these are apt to distress the timid. We are not\r\nafraid of real enemies when Jesus is with us; but when we miss\r\nHim, we tremble at a shade. How sweet is that song, "Yea, though I\r\nwalk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no\r\nevil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort\r\nme!" But we change our note when midnight is now come, and Jesus\r\nis not with us: then we people the night with terrors: spectres,\r\ndemons, hobgoblins, and things that never existed save in fancy,\r\nare apt to swarm about us; and we are in fear where no fear is.\r\nThe spouse\'s worst trouble was that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the back of her Beloved\r\nwas turned to her"}),', and so she cried, "Turn, my Beloved." When His\r\nface is towards her, she suns herself in His love; but if the\r\nlight of His countenance is withdrawn, she is sorely troubled. Our\r\nLord turns His face from His people though He never turns His\r\nheart from His people. He may even close His eyes in sleep when\r\nthe vessel is tossed by the tempest, but His heart is awake all\r\nthe while. Still, it is pain enough to have grieved Him in any\r\ndegree: it cuts us to the quick to think that we have wounded His\r\ntender heart. He is jealous, but never without cause. If He turns\r\nHis back upon us for a while, He has doubtless a more than\r\nsufficient reason. He would not walk contrary to us if we had not\r\nwalked contrary to Him. Ah, it is sad work this! The presence of\r\nthe Lord makes this life the preface to the life celestial; but\r\nHis absence leaves us pining and fainting, neither doth any\r\ncomfort remain in the land of our banishment. The Scriptures and\r\nthe ordinances, private devotion and public worship, are all as\r\nsun-dials,--most excellent when the sun shines, but of small avail\r\nin the dark. O Lord Jesus, nothing can compensate us for Thy loss!\r\nDraw near to Thy beloved yet again, for without Thee our night\r\nwill never end.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "See!

The man who has\r\nknown the joy of communion with Christ, if he loses it, will never\r\nbe content until it is restored. Hast thou ever entertained the\r\nPrince Emmanuel? Is He gone elsewhere? Thy chamber will be dreary\r\ntill He comes back again. "Give me Christ or else I die," is the\r\ncry of every spirit that has lost, the dear companionship of\r\nJesus. We do not part with such heavenly delights without many a\r\npang. It is not with us a matter of "maybe He will return, and we\r\nhope He will;" but it must be, or we faint and die. We cannot live\r\nwithout Him; and this is a cheering sign; for the soul that cannot\r\nlive without Him shall not live without Him: He comes speedily\r\nwhere life and death hang on His coming. If you must have Christ\r\nyou shall have Him. This is just how the matter stands: we must\r\ndrink of this well or die of thirst; we must feed upon Jesus or\r\nour spirit will famish.\r\nII. We will now advance a step, and say that when communion\r\nwith Christ is broken, there are great difficulties in the way of\r\nits renewal. It is much easier to go down hill than to climb to\r\nthe same height again. It is far easier to lose joy in God than to\r\nfind the lost jewel. The spouse speaks of "mountains" dividing her\r\nfrom her Beloved: she means that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the difficulties were great"}),".\r\nThey were not little hills, but mountains, that closed up her way.\r\nMountains of remembered sin, Alps of backsliding, dread ranges of\r\nforgetfulness, ingratitude, worldliness, coldness in prayer,\r\nfrivolity, pride, unbelief. Ah me, I cannot teach you all the dark\r\ngeography of this sad experience! Giant walls rose before her like\r\nthe towering steeps of Lebanon. How could she come at her Beloved?\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"The dividing difficulties were many"}),' as well as great. She\r\ndoes not speak of "a mountain", but of "mountains": Alps rose on\r\nAlps, wall after wall. She was distressed to think that in so\r\nshort a time so much could come between her and Him of whom she\r\nsang just now, "His left hand is under my head, and His right hand\r\ndoth embrace me." Alas, we multiply these mountains of Bether with\r\na sad rapidity! Our Lord is jealous, and we give Him far too much\r\nreason, for hiding His face. A fault, which seemed so small at the\r\ntime we committed it, is seen in the light of its own\r\nconsequences, and then it grows and swells till it towers aloft,\r\nand hides the face of the Beloved. Then has our sun gone down, and\r\nfear whispers, "Will His light ever return? Will it ever be\r\ndaybreak? Will the shadows ever flee away?" It is easy to grieve\r\naway the heavenly sunlight, but ah, how hard to clear the skies,\r\nand regain the unclouded brightness!\r\nPerhaps the worst thought of all to the spouse was the dread\r\nthat ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the dividing barrier might be permanent"}),". It was high, but\r\nit might dissolve; the walls were many, but they might fall; but,\r\nalas, they were mountains, and these stand fast for ages! She felt\r\nlike the Psalmist, when he cried, \"My sin is ever before me.\" The\r\npain of our Lord's absence becomes: intolerable when we fear that\r\nwe are hopelessly shut out from Him. A night one can bear, hoping\r\nfor the morning; but what if the day should never break? And you\r\nand I, if we have wandered away from Christ, and feel that there\r\nare ranges of immovable mountains between Him and us, will feel\r\nsick at heart. We try to pray, but devotion dies on our lips. We\r\nattempt to approach the Lord at the communion table, but we feel\r\nmore like Judas than John. At such times we have felt that we\r\nwould give our eyes once more to behold the Bridegroom's face, and\r\nto know that He delights in us as in happier days. Still there\r\nstand the awful mountains, black, threatening, impassable; and in\r\nthe far-off land the Life of our life is away, and grieved.\r\nSo the spouse seems to have come to the conclusion that ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the\r\ndifficulties in her way were insurmountable by her own power"}),'. She\r\ndoes not even think of herself going over the mountains to her\r\nBeloved, but she cries, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee\r\naway, turn, my Beloved, and be Thou like a roe or a young hart\r\nupon the mountains of Bether." She will not try to climb the\r\nmountains, she knows she cannot: if they had been less high, she\r\nmight have attempted it; but their summits reach to heaven. If\r\nthey had been less craggy or difficult, she might have tried to\r\nscale them; but these mountains are terrible, and no foot may\r\nstand upon their lone crags. Oh, the mercy of utter self-despair!\r\nI love to see a soul driven into that close corner, and forced\r\ntherefore to look to God alone. The end of the creature is the\r\nbeginning of the Creator. Where the sinner ends the Saviour\r\nbegins. If the mountains can be climbed, we shall have to climb\r\nthem; but if they are quite impassable, then the soul cries out\r\nwith the prophet, "Oh, that Thou wouldest rend the heavens, that\r\nThou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at Thy\r\npresence. As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the\r\nwaters to boil, to make Thy name known to Thine adversaries, that\r\nthe nations may tremble at Thy presence. When Thou didst terrible\r\nthings which we looked not for, Thou camest down, the mountains\r\nflowed down at Thy presence." Our souls are lame, they cannot move\r\nto Christ, and we turn our strong desires to Him, and fix our\r\nhopes alone upon Him; will He not remember us in love, and fly to\r\nus as He did to His servant of old when He rode upon a cherub, and\r\ndid fly, yea, He did fly upon the wings of the wind?\r\nIII. Here arises that prayer of the text which fully meets\r\nthe case. "Turn, my Beloved, and be Thou like a roe or a young\r\nhart upon the mountains of division." Jesus can come to us when we\r\ncannot go to Him. The roe and the young hart, or, as you may read\r\nit, the gazelle and the ibex, live among the crags of the\r\nmountains, and leap across the abyss with amazing agility. For\r\nswiftness and sure-footedness they are unrivalled. The sacred poet\r\nsaid, "He maketh my feet like hinds\' feet, and setteth me upon my\r\nhigh places," alluding to the feet of those creatures which are so\r\nfitted to stand securely on the mountain\'s side. Our blessed Lord\r\nis called, in the title of the twenty-second Psalm, "the Hind of\r\nthe morning "; and the spouse in this golden Canticle sings, "My\r\nBeloved is like a roe or a young hart; behold He cometh, leaping\r\nupon the mountains, skipping upon the hills."\r\nHere I would remind you that this prayer is one that we may\r\nfairly offer, because ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"it is the way of Christ to come to us"}),' when\r\nour coming to Him is out of the question. "How?" say you. I answer\r\nthat of old He did this; for we remember "His great love wherewith\r\nHe loved us even when we were dead in trespasses and in sins." His\r\nfirst coming into the world in human form, was it not because man\r\ncould never come to God until God had come to him? I hear of no\r\ntears, or prayers, or entreaties after God on the part of our\r\nfirst parents; but the offended Lord spontaneously gave the\r\npromise that the Seed of the woman should bruise the serpent\'s\r\nhead. Our Lord\'s coming into the world was unbought, unsought,\r\nunthought of; he came altogether of His own free will, delighting\r\nto redeem.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "With pitying eyes, the Prince of grace\r\n    Beheld our helpless grief;\r\n He saw, and (oh, amazing love!)\r\n    He ran to our relief."\r\n\r\n His incarnation was a type of the way in which He comes to us \n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['by His Spirit. He saw us cast out, polluted, shameful, perishing;\r\nand as He passed by, His tender lips said, "Live!" In us is\r\nfulfilled that word, "I am found of them that sought Me not." We\r\nwere too averse to holiness, too much in bondage to sin, ever to\r\nhave returned to Him if He had not turned to us. What think you?\r\nDid He come to us when we were enemies, and will He not visit us\r\nnow that we are friends? Did He come to us when we were dead\r\nsinners, and will He not hear us now that we are weeping saints?\r\nIf Christ\'s coming to the earth was after this manner, and if His\r\ncoming to each one of us was after this style, we may well hope\r\nthat now He will come to us in like fashion, like the dew which\r\nrefreshes the grass, and waiteth not for man, neither tarrieth for\r\nthe sons of men. Besides, He is coming again in person, in the\r\nlatter-day, and mountains of sin, and error, and idolatry, and\r\nsuperstition, and oppression stand in the way of His kingdom; but\r\nHe will surely come and overturn, and overturn, till He shall\r\nreign over all. He will come in the latter-days, I say, though He\r\nshall leap the hills to do it, and because of that I am sure we\r\nmay comfortably conclude that He will draw near to us who mourn\r\nHis absence so bitterly. Then let us bow our heads a moment, and\r\nsilently present to His most excellent Majesty the petition of our\r\ntext: "Turn, my Beloved, and be Thou like a roe or a young hart\r\nupon the mountains of division."\r\nOur text gives us sweet assurance that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"our Lord is at home\r\nwith those difficulties"}),' which are quite insurmountable by us.\r\nJust as the roe or the young hart knows the passes of the\r\nmountains, and the stepping-places among the rugged rocks, and is\r\nvoid of all fear among the ravines and the precipices, so does our\r\nLord know the heights and depths, the torrents and the caverns of\r\nour sin and sorrow. He carried the whole of our transgression, and\r\nso became aware of the tremendous load of our guilt. He is quite\r\nat home with the infirmities of our nature; He knew temptation in\r\nthe wilderness, heart-break in the garden, desertion on the cross.\r\nHe is quite at home with pain and weakness, for "Himself took our\r\ninfirmities, and bare our sicknesses." He is at home with\r\ndespondency, for He was "a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with\r\ngrief." He is at home even with death, for He gave up the ghost,\r\nand passed through the sepulchre to resurrection. O yawning gulfs\r\nand frowning steeps of woe, our Beloved, like hind or hart, has\r\ntraversed your glooms! O my Lord, Thou knowest all that divides me\r\nfrom Thee; and Thou knowest also that I am far too feeble to climb\r\nthese dividing mountains, so that I may come at Thee; therefore, I\r\npray Thee, come Thou over the mountains to meet my longing spirit!\r\nThou knowest each yawning gulf and slippery steep, but none of\r\nthese can stay Thee; haste Thou to me, Thy servant, Thy beloved,\r\nand let me again live by Thy presence.\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"It is easy, too, for Christ to come over the mountains for\r\nour relief"}),'. It is easy for the gazelle to cross the mountains, it\r\nis made for that end; so is it easy for Jesus, for to this purpose\r\nwas He ordained from of old that He might come to man in his worst\r\nestate, and bring with Him the Father\'s love. What is it that\r\nseparates us from Christ? Is it a sense of sin? You have been\r\npardoned once, and Jesus can renew most vividly a sense of full\r\nforgiveness. But you say, "Alas! I have sinned again: fresh guilt\r\nalarms me." He can remove it in an instant, for the fountain\r\nappointed for that purpose is opened, and is still full. It is\r\neasy for the dear lips of redeeming love to put away the child\'s\r\noffences, since He has already obtained pardon for the criminal\'s\r\niniquities. If with His heart\'s blood He won our pardon from our\r\nJudge, he can easily enough bring us the forgiveness of our\r\nFather. Oh, yes, it is easy enough for Christ to say again, "Thy\r\nsins be forgiven"! "But I feel so unfit, so unable to enjoy\r\ncommunion." He that healed all manner of bodily diseases can heal\r\nwith a word your spiritual infirmities. Remember the man whose\r\nankle-bones received strength, so that he ran and leaped; and her\r\nwho was sick of a fever, and was healed at once, and arose, and\r\nministered unto her Lord. "My grace is sufficient for thee; for My\r\nstrength is made perfect in weakness." "But I have such\r\nafflictions, such troubles, such sorrows, that I am weighted down,\r\nand cannot rise into joyful fellowship." Yes, but Jesus can make\r\nevery burden light, and cause each yoke to be easy. Your trials\r\ncan be made to aid your heavenward course instead of hindering it.\r\nI know all about those heavy weights, and I perceive that you\r\ncannot lift them; but skilful engineers can adapt ropes and\r\npulleys in such a way that heavy weights lift other weights.

I can understand eminent saints and\r\nbeloved disciples being greatly indulged, but I am a worm, and no\r\nman; utterly below such condescension." Say you so? Know you not\r\nthat the worthiness of Christ covers your unworthiness, and He is\r\nmade of God unto you wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and\r\nredemption? In Christ, the Father thinks not so meanly of you as\r\nyou think of yourself; you are not worthy to be called His child,\r\nbut He does call you so, and reckons you to be among His jewels.\r\nListen, and you shall hear Him say," Since thou wast precious in\r\nMy sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee.

As in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye the dead shall be raised incorruptible, so in\r\na moment can our dead affections rise to fulness of delight.

In the sacred\r\nemblems now upon this supper table, Jesus is already among us.\r\nFaith cries, "He has come!" Like John the Baptist, she gazes\r\nintently on Him, and cries, "Behold the Lamb of God!" At this\r\ntable Jesus feeds us with His body and His blood. His corporeal\r\npresence we have not, but His real spiritual presence we perceive.\r\nWe are like the disciples when none of them durst ask Him, "Who\r\nart Thou?" knowing that it was the Lord. He is come. He looketh\r\nforth at these windows,--I mean this bread and wine; showing\r\nHimself through the lattices of this instructive and endearing\r\nordinance. He speaks. He saith, "The winter is past, the rain is\r\nover and gone." And so it is; we feel it to be so: a heavenly\r\nspringtide warms our frozen hearts. Like the spouse, we\r\nwonderingly cry, "Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the\r\nchariots of Amminadib." Now in happy fellowship we see the\r\nBeloved, and hear His voice; our heart burns; our affections glow;\r\nwe are happy, restful, brimming over with delight. The King has\r\nbrought us into his banqueting-house, and His banner over us is\r\nlove. It is good to be here!\r\nFriends, we must now go our ways. A voice saith, "Arise, let\r\nus go hence." O Thou Lord of our hearts, go with us! Home will not\r\nbe home without Thee. Life will not be life without Thee. Heaven\r\nitself would not be heaven if Thou wert absent. Abide with us.

(Rev\r\niii. 19.) He abhors sin in her as much as in the ungodly world,\r\nnay even more, for He sees in her an evil which is not to be found\r\nin the transgressions of others,--sin against love and grace.

At all\r\nseasons believers are very near the heart of the Lord Jesus, they\r\nare always as the apple of His eye, and the jewel of His crown.\r\nOur name is still on His breastplate, and our persons are still in\r\nHis gracious remembrance. He never thinks lightly of His people;\r\nand certainly in all the compass of His Word there is not one\r\nsyllable which looks like contempt of them. They are the choice\r\ntreasure and peculiar portion of the Lord of hosts; and what king\r\nwill undervalue his own inheritance? What loving husband will\r\ndespise his own wife? Let others call the Church what they may,\r\nJesus does not waver in His love to her, and does not differ in\r\nHis judgment of her, for He still exclaims, "How fair and how\r\npleasant art thou, O love, for delights!" (Sol. Song vii. 6.)\r\nLet us remember that He who pronounces the Church and each\r\nindividual believer to be "all fair" is none other than the\r\nglorious Son of God, who is "very God of very God." Hence His\r\ndeclaration is decisive, since infallibility has uttered it. There\r\ncan be no mistake where the all-seeing Jehovah is the Judge. If He\r\nhas pronounced her to be incomparably fair, she is so, beyond a\r\ndoubt; and though hard for our poor puny faith to receive, it is\r\nnevertheless as divine a verity as any of the undoubted doctrines\r\nof revelation.\r\nHaving thus pronounced her ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"positively"})," full of beauty, He\r\nnow confirms His praise by ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"a precious negative"}),': "There is no\r\nspot in thee." As if the thought occurred to the Bridegroom that\r\nthe carping world would insinuate that He had only mentioned her\r\ncomely parts, and had purposely omitted those features which were\r\ndeformed or defiled, He sums all up by declaring her universally\r\nand entirely fair, and utterly devoid of stain. A spot may soon be\r\nremoved, and is the very least thing that can disfigure beauty,\r\nbut even from this little blemish the Church is delivered in her\r\nLord\'s sight. If He had said there is no hideous scar, no horrible\r\ndeformity, no filthy ulcer, we might even then have marvelled; but\r\nwhen He testifies that she is free from the slightest spot, all\r\nthese things are included, and the depth of wonder is increased.\r\nIf He had but promised to remove all spots, we should have had\r\neternal reason for joy; but when He Speaks of it as already done,\r\nwho can restrain the most intense emotions of satisfaction and\r\ndelight? O my soul, here is marrow and fatness for thee; eat thy\r\nfull, and be abundantly glad therein!\r\nChrist Jesus has no quarrel with His spouse. She often\r\nwanders from Him, and grieves His Holy Spirit, but He does not\r\nallow her faults to affect His love. He sometimes chides, but it\r\nis always in the tenderest manner, with the kindest intentions;--\r\nit is "My love" even then. There is no remembrance of our follies,\r\nHe does not cherish ill thoughts of us, but He pardons, and loves\r\nas well after the offence as before it. It is well for us it is\r\nso, for if Jesus were as mindful of injuries as we are, how could\r\nHe commune with us? Many a time a believer will put himself out of\r\nhumour with the Lord for some slight turn in providence, but our\r\nprecious Husband knows our silly hearts too well to take any\r\noffence at our ill manners.\r\nIf He were as easily provoked as we are, who among us could\r\nhope for a comfortable look or a kind salutation? but He is "ready\r\nto pardon, . . . slow to anger." (Neh. ix. 17.) He is like Noah\'s\r\nsons, He goes backward, and throws a cloak over our nakedness; or\r\nwe may compare Him to Apelles, who, when he painted Alexander, put\r\nhis finger over the scar on the cheek, that it might not be seen\r\nin the picture. "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither\r\nhath He seen perverseness in Israel" (Num. xxiii. 21); and hence\r\nHe is able to commune with the erring sons of men.\r\nBut the question returns,--How is this? Can it be explained,\r\nso as not to clash with the most evident fact that sin remaineth\r\neven in the hearts of the regenerate? Can our own daily bewailings\r\nof sin allow of anything like perfection as a present attainment?\r\nThe Lord Jesus saith it, and therefore it must be true; but in\r\nwhat sense is it to be understood? How are we "all fair" though we\r\nourselves feel that we are black, because the sun hath looked upon\r\nus? (Sol. Song i. 6.) The answer is ready, if we consider the\r\nanalogy of faith.\r\n1. In the matter of justification, the saints are complete\r\nand without sin. As Durham says, these words are spoken "in\r\nrespect of the imputation of Christ\'s righteousness wherewith they\r\nare adorned, and which they have put on, which makes them very\r\nglorious and lovely, so that they are beautiful beyond all others,\r\nthrough His comeliness put upon them."\r\nAnd Dr. Gill excellently expresses the same idea, when he\r\nwrites, "though all sin is seen by God, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"in articulo providentiae,\r\nin the matter of providence"}),", wherein nothing escapes His all-\r\nseeing eye; yet ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"in articula iustificationis, in the matter of\r\njustification"}),", He sees no sin in His people, so as to reckon it\r\nto them, or condemn them for it; for they all stand 'holy and\r\nunblameable and unreproveable in His sight.'\" (Col. i. 22.) The\r\nblood of Jesus removes all stain, and His righteousness confers\r\nperfect beauty; and, therefore, in the Beloved, the true believer\r\nis at this hour as much accepted and approved, in the sight of\r\nGod, as He will be when He stands before the throne in heaven. The\r\nbeauty of justification is at its fulness the moment a soul is by\r\nfaith received into the Lord Jesus. This is righteousness so\r\ntranscendent that no one can exaggerate its glorious merit. Since\r\nthis righteousness is that of Jesus, the Son of God, it is\r\ntherefore divine, and is, indeed, the holiness of God; and, hence,\r\nKent was not too daring when, in a bold flight of rapture, he\r\nsang,--"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "In thy Surety thou art free,\r\n His dear hands were pierced for thee;\r\n With His spotless vesture on,\r\n Holy as the Holy One.\r\n\r\n "Oh, the heights and depths of grace,\r\n Shining with meridian blaze;\r\n Here the sacred records show\r\n Sinners black, but comely too!"\r\n\r\n 2.

In prospect of this, the Church is viewed\r\nas being virtually what she is soon to be actually. Nor is this a\r\nfrivolous antedating of her excellence; for be it ever remembered\r\nthat the Representative, in whom she is accepted, is actually\r\ncomplete in all perfections and glories at this very moment. As\r\nthe Head of the body is already without sin, being none other than\r\nthe Lord from heaven, it is but in keeping that the whole body\r\nshould be pronounced comely and fair through the glory of the\r\nHead. The fact of her future perfection is so certain that it is\r\nspoken of as if it were already accomplished, and indeed it is so\r\nin the mind of Him to whom a thousand years are but as one day.\r\n"Christ often expounds an honest believer, from His own heart,\r\npurpose and design; in which respect they get many titles,\r\notherwise unsuitable to their present condition.

Let us\r\nmagnify the name of our Jesus, who loves us so well that He will\r\noverleap the dividing years of our pilgrimage, that He may give us\r\neven now the praise which seems to be only fitted for the\r\nperfection of Paradise.

The virgins called her "the fairest among\r\nwomen"; they saw and admired, but it was reserved for her Lord to\r\nlove her. Who can fully tell the excellence of His love? Oh, how\r\nHis heart goeth forth after His redeemed! As for the love of David\r\nand Jonathan, it is far exceeded in Christ. No tender husband was\r\never so fond as He. No figures can completely set forth His\r\nheart\'s affection, for it surpasses all the love that man or woman\r\nhath heard or thought of. Our blessed Lord, Himself, when He would\r\ndeclare the greatness of it, was compelled to compare one\r\ninconceivable thing with another, in order to express His own\r\nthoughts. "As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you."\r\n(John xv. 9.) All the eternity, fervency, immutability, and\r\ninfinity which are to be found in the love of Jehovah the Father,\r\ntowards Jehovah-Jesus the Son, are copied to the letter in the\r\nlove of the Lord Jesus towards His chosen ones. Before the\r\nfoundation of the world He loved His people, in all their\r\nwanderings He loved them, and unto the end He will abide in His\r\nlove. (John xiii. 1.) He has given them the best proof of His\r\naffection, in that He gave Himself to die for their sins, and hath\r\nrevealed to them complete pardon as the result of His death. The\r\nwilling manner of His death is further confirmation of His\r\nboundless love. How Christ did delight in the work of our\r\nredemption! "Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written\r\nof Me, I delight to do Thy will, O my God." (Psalm xl. 7, 8.) When\r\nHe came into the world to sacrifice His life for us, it was a\r\nfreewill offering. "I have a baptism to be baptized with." (Luke\r\nxii. 50.) Christ was to be, as it were, baptized in His own blood,\r\nand how did He thirst for that time! "How am I straitened till it\r\nbe accomplished." There was no hesitation, no desire to be quit of\r\nHis engagement. He went to His crucifixion without once halting by\r\nthe way to deliberate whether He should complete His sacrifice.\r\nThe stupendous mass of our fearful debt He paid at once, asking\r\nneither delay nor diminution. From the moment when He said, "Not\r\nMy will, but Thine, be done" (Luke xxii. 42), His course was swift\r\nand unswerving; as if He had been hastening to a crown rather than\r\nto a cross. The fulness of time was His only remembrancer; He was\r\nnot driven by bailiffs to discharge the obligations of His Church,\r\nbut joyously, even when full of sorrow, He met the law, answered\r\nits demands, and cried, "It is finished."\r\nHow hard it is to talk of love so as to convey out meaning\r\nwith it! How often have our eyes been full of tears when we have\r\nrealized the thought that Jesus loves us! How has our spirit been\r\nmelted within us at the assurance that He thinks of us and bears\r\nus on His heart! But we cannot kindle the like emotion in others,\r\nnor can we give, by word of mouth, so much as a faint idea of the\r\nbliss which coucheth in that exclamation, "Oh, how He loves!"\r\nCome, reader, canst thou say of thyself, "He loved me"? (Gal. ii.\r\n20.) Then look down into this sea of love, and endeavour to guess\r\nits depth. Doth it not stagger thy faith, that He should love\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"thee?"}),' Or, if thou hast strong confidence, say, does it not\r\nenfold thy spirit in a flame of admiring and adoring gratitude? O\r\nye angels, such love as this ye never knew! Jesus doth not bear\r\nyour names upon His hands, or call you His bride. No! this highest\r\nfellowship he reserves for worms whose only return is tearful,\r\nhearty thanksgiving and love.\r\nIII. Let us note that Christ delights to think upon his\r\nChurch, and to look upon her beauty. As the bird returneth often\r\nto its nest, and as the wayfarer hastens to his home, so doth the\r\nmind continually pursue the object of its choice. We cannot look\r\ntoo often upon that face which we love; we desire always to have\r\nour precious things in our sight. It is even so with our Lord\r\nJesus. From all eternity, "His delights were with the sons of\r\nmen;" His thoughts rolled onward to the time when His elect should\r\nbe born into the world; He viewed them in the mirror of His fore-\r\nknowledge. "In thy book," He says, "all my members were written,\r\nwhich in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of\r\nthem." (Ps. cxxxix. 16.) When the world was set upon its pillars,\r\nHe was there, and He set the bounds of the people according to the\r\nnumber of the children of Israel. Many a time, before His\r\nincarnation, He descended to this earth in the similitude of a\r\nman; on the plains of Mamre (Gen. xviii.), by the brook of Jabbok\r\n(Gen. xxxii. 24-30), beneath the walls of Jericho (Josh. v. 13),\r\nand in the fiery furnace of Babylon (Dan. iii. 19-25), the Son of\r\nman did visit His people. Because His soul delighted in them, He\r\ncould not rest away from them, for His heart longed after them.\r\nNever were they absent from His heart, for He had written their\r\nnames upon His hands, and graven them upon His heart. As the\r\nbreast-plate containing the names of the tribes of Israel was the\r\nmost brilliant ornament worn by the high priest, so the names of\r\nChrist\'s elect were His most precious Jewels, which He ever hung\r\nnearest His heart. We may often forget to meditate upon the\r\nperfections of our Lord, but He never ceases to remember us. He\r\ncares not one half so much for any of His most glorious works as\r\nHe does for His children. Although His eye seeth everything that\r\nhath beauty and excellence in it, He never fixes His gaze anywhere\r\nwith that admiration and delight which He spends upon His\r\npurchased ones. He charges His angels concerning them, and calls\r\nupon those holy beings to rejoice with Him over His lost sheep.\r\n(Luke xv. 4-7.) He talked of them to Himself, and even on the tree\r\nof doom He did not cease to soliloquize concerning them. He saw of\r\nthe travail of His soul, and He was abundantly satisfied.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:" \"That day acute of ignominious woe,\r\n Was, notwithstanding, in a perfect sense,\r\n 'The day of His heart's gladness,' for the joy\r\n That His redeem'd should be brought home at last\r\n (Made ready as in robes of bridal white),\r\n Was set before Him vividly,--He look'd;--\r\n And for that happiness anticipate,\r\n Endurance of all torture, all disgrace,\r\n Seem'd light infliction to His heart of love.\"\r\n\r\n Like a fond mother, Christ Jesus, our thrice-blessed Lord, \n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['sees every dawning of excellence, and every bud of goodness in us,\r\nmaking much of our litties, and rejoicing over the beginnings of\r\nour graces. As He is to be our endless song, so we are His\r\nperpetual prayer. When He is absent He thinks of us, and in the\r\nblack darkness He has a window through which He looks upon us.\r\nWhen the sun sets in one part of the earth, he rises in another\r\nplace beyond our visible horizon; and even so Jesus, our Sun of\r\nRighteousness, is only pouring light upon His people in a\r\ndifferent way, when to our apprehension He seems to have set in\r\ndarkness. His eye is ever upon the vineyard, which is His Church:\r\n"I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any\r\nhurt it, I will keep it night and day." (Isa. xxvii. 3.) He will\r\nnot trust to His angels to do it, for it is His delight to do all\r\nwith His own hands. Zion is in the centre of His heart, and He\r\ncannot forget her, for every day His thoughts are set upon her.\r\nWhen the bride by her neglect of Him hath hidden herself from His\r\nsight, He cannot be quiet until again He looks upon her. He calls\r\nher forth with the most wooing words, "O My dove, that art in the\r\nclefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let Me see\r\nthy countenance; let Me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice,\r\nand thy countenance is comely." (Sol. Song ii. 14.) She thinks\r\nherself unmeet to keep company with such a Prince, but He entices\r\nher from her lurking-place, and inasmuch as she comes forth\r\ntrembling, and bashfully hides her face with her veil, He bids her\r\nuncover her face, and let her Husband gaze upon her. She is\r\nashamed to do so, for she is black in her own esteem, and\r\ntherefore He urges that she is comely to Him.\r\nNor is He content with looking, He must feed His ears as well\r\nas His eyes, and therefore He commends her speech, and intreats\r\nher to let Him hear her voice. See how truly our Lord rejoiceth in\r\nus. Is not this unparalleled love! We have heard of princes who\r\nhave been smitten by the beauty of a peasant\'s daughter, but what\r\nof that? Here is the Son of God doting upon a worm, looking with\r\neyes of admiration upon a poor child of Adam, and listening with\r\njoy to the lispings of poor flesh and blood. Ought we not to be\r\nexceedingly charmed by such matchless condescension? And should\r\nnot our hearts as much delight in Him as He doth in us? O\r\nsurprising truth! Christ Jesus rejoices over His poor, tempted,\r\ntried, and erring people.\r\nIV. It is not to be forgotten that sometimes the Lord Jesus\r\ntells His people His love thoughts. "He does not think it enough\r\nbehind her back to tell it, but in her very presence, He says,\r\n\'Thou art all fair, My love.\' It is true, this is not His ordinary\r\nmethod; He is a wise lover, that knows when to keep back the\r\nintimation of love, and when to let it out; but there are times\r\nwhen He will make no secret of it; times when He will put it\r\nbeyond all dispute in the souls of His people."\r\nThe Holy Spirit is often pleased in a most gracious manner to\r\nwitness with our spirits of the love of Jesus. He takes of the\r\nthings of Christ, and reveals them unto us. No voice is heard from\r\nthe clouds, and no vision is seen in the night, but we have a\r\ntestimony more sure than either of these. If an angel should fly\r\nfrom heaven, and inform the saint personally of the Saviour\'s love\r\nto him, the evidence would not be one whir more satisfactory than\r\nthat which is borne in the heart by the Holy Ghost. Ask those of\r\nthe Lord\'s people who have lived the nearest to the gates of\r\nheaven, and they will tell you that they have had seasons when the\r\nlove of Christ towards them has been a fact so clear and sure,\r\nthat they could no more doubt it than they could question their\r\nown existence.\r\nYes, beloved believer, you and I have had times of refreshing\r\nfrom the presence of the Lord, and then our faith has mounted to\r\nthe topmost heights of assurance. We have had confidence to lean\r\nour heads upon the bosom of our Lord, and we have had no more\r\nquestion about our Master\'s affection than John had when in that\r\nblessed posture, nay, nor so much; for the dark question, "Lord,\r\nis it I that shall betray Thee?" has been put far from us. He has\r\nkissed us with the kisses of His love, and killed our doubts by\r\nthe closeness of His embrace. His love has been sweeter than wine\r\nto our souls. We felt that we could sing, "His left hand is under\r\nmy head, and His right hand doth embrace me." (Sol. Song viii. 3.)\r\nThen all earthly troubles were light as the chaff of the\r\nthreshing-floor, and the pleasures of the world as tasteless as\r\nthe white of an egg. We would have welcomed death as the messenger\r\nwho would introduce us to our Lord to whom we were in haste to be\r\ngone; for His love had stirred us to desire more of Him, even His\r\nimmediate and glorious presence. I have, sometimes, when the Lord\r\nhas assured me of His love, felt as if I could not contain more\r\njoy and delight. My eyes ran down with tears of gratitude. I fell\r\nupon my knees to bless Him, but rose again in haste, feeling as if\r\nI had nothing more to ask for, but must stand up and praise Him;\r\nthen have I lifted my hands to heaven, longing to fill my arms\r\nwith Him; panting to talk with Him, as a man talketh with his\r\nfriend, and to see Him in His own person, that I might tell Him\r\nhow happy He had made His unworthy servant, and might fall on my\r\nface, and kiss His feet in unutterable thankfulness and love. Such\r\na banquet have I had upon one word of my Beloved,--"',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"thou art\r\nMine"}),",\"--that I wished, like Peter, to build tabernacles in that\r\nmount, and dwell for ever. But, alas, we have not, all of us, yet\r\nlearned how to preserve that blessed assurance. We stir up our\r\nBeloved and awake Him, then He leaves our unquiet chamber, and we\r\ngrope after Him, and make many a weary journey trying to find Him.\r\nIf we were wiser and more careful, we might preserve the\r\nfragrance of Christ's words far longer; for they are not like the\r\nordinary manna which soon rotted, but are comparable to that omer\r\nof it which was put in the golden pot, and preserved for many\r\ngenerations. The sweet Lord Jesus has been known to write his\r\nlove-thoughts on the heart of His people in so clear and deep a\r\nmanner, that they have for months, and even for years, enjoyed an\r\nabiding sense of His affection. A few doubts have flitted across\r\ntheir minds like thin clouds before a summer's sun, but the warmth\r\nof their assurance has remained the same for many a gladsome day.\r\nTheir path has been a smooth one, they have fed in the green\r\npastures beside the still waters, for His rod and staff have\r\ncomforted them, and His right hand hath led them. I am inclined to\r\nthink that there is more of this in the Church than some men would\r\nallow. We have a goodly number who dwell upon the hills, and\r\nbehold the light of the sun. There are giants in these days,\r\nthough the times are not such as to allow them room to display\r\ntheir gigantic strength; in many a humble cot, in many a crowded\r\nworkshop, in many a village manse there are to be found men of the\r\nhouse of David, men after God's own heart, anointed with the holy\r\noil. It is, however, a mournful truth, that whole ranks in the\r\narmy of our Lord are composed of dwarfish Littlefaiths. The men of\r\nfearful mind and desponding heart are everywhere to be seen. Why\r\nis this? Is it the Master's fault, or ours? Surely ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"He"})," cannot be\r\nblamed. Is it not then a matter of enquiry in our own souls, Can I\r\nnot grow stronger? Must I be a mourner all my days? How can I get\r\nrid of my doubts? The answer must be: yes, you can be comforted,\r\nbut only the mouth of the Lord can do it, for anything less than\r\nthis will be unsatisfactory.\r\nI doubt not that there are means, by the use of which those\r\nwho are now weak and trembling may attain unto boldness in faith\r\nand confidence in hope; but I see not how this can be done unless\r\nthe Lord Jesus Christ manifest His love to them, and tell them of\r\ntheir union to Him. This He will do, if we seek it of Him. The\r\nimportunate pleader shall not lack his reward. Haste thee to Him,\r\nO timid one, and tell Him that nothing will content thee but a\r\nsmile from His own face, and a word from His own lips! Speak to\r\nHim, and say, \"O my Lord Jesus, I cannot rest unless I know that\r\nThou lovest me! I desire to have proof of Thy love under Thine own\r\nhand and seal.\r\nI cannot live upon guesses and surmises; nothing but\r\ncertainty will satisfy my trembling heart. Lord, look upon me, if,\r\nindeed, Thou lovest me, and though I be less than the least of all\r\nsaints, say unto my soul, 'I am thy salvation.'\" When this prayer\r\nis heard, the castle of despair must totter; there is not one\r\nstone of it which can remain upon another, if Christ whispers\r\nforth His love. Even Despondency and Much-afraid will dance, and\r\nReady-to-Halt leap upon his crutches.\r\nOh, for more of these Bethel visits, more frequent\r\nvisitations from the God of Israel! Oh, how sweet to hear Him say\r\nto us, as He did to Abraham, \"Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield,\r\nand thy exceeding great reward.\" (Gen. xv. 1.) To be addressed as\r\nDaniel was of old, \"O man greatly beloved\" (Dan. x. 19), is worth\r\na thousand ages of this world's joy. What more can a creature want\r\nthis side of heaven to make him peaceful and happy than a plain\r\navowal of love from his Lord's own lips? Let me ever hear Thee,\r\nspeak in mercy to my soul, and, O my Lord, I ask no more while\r\nhere I dwell in the land of my pilgrimage!\r\nBrethren, let us labour to obtain a confident assurance of\r\nthe Lord's delight in us, for this, as it enables Him to commune\r\nwith us, will be one of the readiest ways to produce a like\r\nfeeling in our hearts towards Him. Christ is well pleased with us;\r\nlet us approach Him with holy familiarity; let us unbosom our\r\nthoughts to Him, for His delight in us will secure us an audience.\r\nThe child may stay away from the father, when he is conscious that\r\nhe has aroused his father's displeasure, but why should we keep at\r\na distance when Christ Jesus is smiling upon us? No! since His\r\nsmiles attract us, let us enter into His courts, and touch His\r\ngolden sceptre.

When that soul\r\nenters the nearer circle of inspiration, and reads the wonderful\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"words"}),' of God, it is still more enraptured, and its admiration is\r\nheightened. In revelation, we see the same all-glorious Lord as in\r\ncreation, but the vision is more clear, and the consequent love is\r\nmore intense.\r\nThe Word is an inner court to the Creation; but there is yet\r\nan innermost sanctuary, and blessed are they who enter it, and\r\nhave fellowship with the Lord Himself. We come to Christ, and in\r\ncoming to Him we come to God; for Jesus says, "He that hath seen\r\nMe hath seen the Father." When we know the Lord Jesus, we stand\r\nbefore the mercy-seat, where the glory of Jehovah shineth forth. I\r\nlike to think of the text as belonging to those who are as priests\r\nunto God, and stand in the Holy of holies, while they say, "Yea,\r\nHe is altogether lovely." His works are marvellous, His words are\r\nfull of majesty, but He Himself is altogether lovely.\r\nCan we come into this inner circle? All do not enter here.\r\nAlas! many are far off from Him, and are blind to His beauties.\r\n"He was despised and rejected of men," and He is so still. They do\r\nnot see God in His works, but dream that these wonders were\r\nevolved, and not created by the Great Primal Cause. As for His\r\nwords, they seem to them as idle tales, or, at best, as inspired\r\nonly in the same sense as the language of Shakespeare or Spenser.\r\nThey see not the Lord in the stately aisles of Holy Scripture; and\r\nhave no vision of ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Himself"}),'. May He, who openeth the eyes of the\r\nblind, have pity on them!\r\nCertain others are in a somewhat happier position, for they\r\nare enquirers after Christ. They are like the persons who, in the\r\nninth verse of the chapter, asked, "What is thy Beloved more than\r\nanother beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy Beloved\r\nmore than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?" They want\r\nto know who this Jesus is. But they have not seen Him yet, and\r\ncannot join with the spouse in saying, "He is altogether lovely."\r\nIf we enter this sacred inner circle, we must become\r\nwitnesses, as she does who speaks of Christ, "Yea, He is\r\naltogether lovely." She knows what He is, for she has seen Him.\r\nThe verses which precede the text are a description of every\r\nfeature of the heavenly Bridegroom; all His members are there set\r\nforth with richness of Oriental imagery. The spouse speaks what\r\nshe knows. Have we, also, seen the Lord? Are we His familiar\r\nacquaintances? If so, may the Lord help us to understand our text!\r\nIf we are to know the full joy of the text, we must come to\r\nour Lord as His intimates. He permits us this high honour, since,\r\nin this ordinance, He makes us His table-companions. He says,\r\n"Henceforth I call you not servants; but I have called you\r\nfriends." He calls upon us to eat bread with Him; yea, to partake\r\nof Himself, by eating His flesh and drinking His blood. Oh, that\r\nwe may pass beyond the outward signs into the closest intimacy\r\nwith ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Himself!"}),' Perhaps, when you are at home, you will examine\r\nthe spouse\'s description of her Lord. It is a wonderful piece of\r\ntapestry. She has wrought into its warp and woof all things\r\ncharming, sweet, and precious. In Him she sees all lovely\r\ncolours,--"My Beloved is white and ruddy." In comparison with Him\r\nall others fail, for He is "chief among ten thousand" chieftains.\r\nShe cannot think of Him as comparable to anything less valuable\r\nthan "fine gold." She sees, soaring in the air, birds of divers\r\nwing; and these must aid her, whether it be the raven or the dove.\r\nThe rivers of waters, and the beds of spices and myrrh-dropping\r\nlilies, must come into the picture, with sweet flowers and goodly\r\ncedars. All kinds of treasured things are in Him; for He is like\r\nto gold rings set with the beryl, and bright ivory overlaid with\r\nsapphires, and pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold.\r\nShe labours to describe His beauty and His excellency, and strains\r\nall comparisons to their utmost use, and somewhat more; and yet\r\nshe is conscious of failure, and therefore sums up all with the\r\npithy sentence, "Yea, He is altogether lovely."\r\nIf the Holy Spirit will help me, I should like to lift the\r\nveil, that we may, in sacred contemplation, look on our Beloved.\r\nI. We would do so, first, with reverent emotions. In the\r\nwords before us, "Yea, He is altogether lovely," two emotions are\r\ndisplayed, namely, admiration and affection.\r\nIt is ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"admiration"}),' which speaks of Him as "altogether lovely"\r\nor beautiful. This admiration rises to the highest degree. The\r\nspouse would fain show that her Beloved is more than any other\r\nbeloved; therefore she cries, "He is altogether lovely." Surely no\r\none else has reached that point. Many are lovely, but no one save\r\nJesus is "altogether lovely." We see something that is lovely in\r\none, and another point is lovely in another; but all loveliness\r\nmeets in Him. Our soul knows nothing which can rival Him: He is\r\nthe gathering up of all sorts of loveliness to make up one perfect\r\nloveliness. He is the climax of beauty; the crown of glory; the\r\nuttermost of excellence.\r\nOur admiration of Him, also, is unrestrained. The spouse\r\ndared to say, even in the presence of the daughters of Jerusalem,\r\nwho were somewhat envious, "Yea, He is altogether lovely." They\r\nknew not, as yet, His perfections; they even asked, "What is thy\r\nBeloved more than another beloved?" But she was not to be blinded\r\nby their want of sympathy, neither did she withhold her testimony\r\nfrom fear of their criticism. To her, He was "altogether lovely",\r\nand she could say no less. Our admiration of Christ is such that\r\nwe would tell the kings of the earth that they have no majesty in\r\nHis presence; and tell the wise men that He alone is wisdom; and\r\ntell the great and mighty that He is the blessed and only\r\nPotentate, King of kings, and Lord of lords.\r\nOur admiration of our Lord is inexpressible. We can never\r\ntell all we know of our Lord; yet all our knowledge is little. All\r\nthat we know is, that His love passeth knowledge, that His\r\nexcellence baffles understanding, that His glory is unutterable.\r\nWe can embrace Him by our love, but we can scarcely touch Him with\r\nour intellect, He is so high, so glorious.

"He is altogether"--not beautiful, nor admirable,--\r\nbut "lovely." All His beauties are loving beauties towards us, and\r\nbeauties which draw our hearts towards Him in humble love. He\r\ncharms us, not by a cold comeliness, but by a living loveliness,\r\nwhich wins our hearts. His is an approachable beauty, which not\r\nonly overpowers us with its glory, but holds us captive by its\r\ncharms. We love Him: we cannot do otherwise, for "He is altogether\r\nlovely." He has within Himself and unquenchable flame of love,\r\nwhich sets our soul on fire. He is all love, and all the love in\r\nthe world is less than His. Put together all the loves of husband\r\nwives, parents, children, brothers, sisters, and they only make a\r\ndrop compared with His great deeps of love, unexplored and\r\nunexplorable. This love of His has a wonderful power to beget love\r\nin unlovely hearts, and to nourish it into a mighty force. " It is\r\na torrent which sweeps all before it when its founts break forth\r\nwithin the soul. It is a Gulf Stream in which all icebergs melt.\r\nWhen our heart is full of love to Jesus, His loveliness becomes\r\nthe passion of the soul, and sin and self are swept away. May we\r\nfeel it now!\r\nThere He stands: we know Him by the thorn-crown, and the\r\nwounds, and the visage more marred than that of any man! He\r\nsuffered all this for us. O Son of man! O Son of God! With the\r\nspouse, we feel, in the inmost depths of our soul, that Thou art\r\n"altogether lovely."\r\nII. Now would I lift the veil a second time, with deep\r\nsolemnity, not so much to suggest emotions as to secure your\r\nintelligent assurance of the fact that "He is altogether lovely."\r\nWe say this with absolute certainty. The spouse places a "Yea"\r\nbefore her enthusiastic declaration, because she is sure of it.\r\nShe sees her Beloved, and sees Him to be altogether lovely. This\r\nis no fiction, no dream, no freak of imagination, no outburst of\r\npartiality. The highest love to Christ does not make us speak more\r\nthan the truth; we are as reasonable when we are filled with love\r\nto Him as ever we were in our lives; nay, never are we more\r\nreasonable than when we are carried clean away by a clear\r\nperception of His superlative excellence.\r\nLet us meditate upon the proof of our assertion. "He is\r\naltogether lovely" ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"in His person"}),'. He is God. The glory of\r\nGodhead I must leave in lowly silence. Yet is our Jesus also man,\r\nmore emphatically man than any one here present this afternoon,\r\nfor we are English, American, French, German, Dutch, Russian; but\r\nChrist is man, the second Adam, the Head of the race: as truly as\r\nHe is very God of very God, so is He man, of the substance of His\r\nmother. What a marvellous union! The miracle of miracles! In his\r\nincomparible personality He is altogether lovely; for in Him we\r\nsee how God comes down to man in condescension, and how man goes\r\nup to God in close relationship. There is no other such as He, in\r\nall respects, even in heaven itself: in His personality He must\r\never stand alone, in the eyes of both God and man, "altogether\r\nlovely."\r\nAs for ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"His character"}),', time would fail us to enter upon that\r\nvast subject; but the more we know of the character of our Lord,\r\nand the more we grow like Him, the more lovely will it appear to\r\nus. In all aspects, it is lovely; in all its minutiae and details,\r\nit is perfect; and as a whole, it is perfection\'s model. Take any\r\none action of His, look into its mode, its spirit, its motive, and\r\nall else that can be revealed by a microscopic examination, and it\r\nis "altogether lovely." Consider his life, as a whole, in\r\nreference to God, to man, to His friends, to His foes, to those\r\naround Him, and to the ages yet to be, and you shall find it\r\nabsolutely perfect. More than that: there is such a thing as a\r\ncold perfection, with which one can find no fault, and yet it\r\ncommands no love; but in Christ, our Well-beloved, every part of\r\nHis character attracts. To a true heart, the life of Christ is as\r\nmuch an object of love as of reverence: "He is altogether lovely."\r\nWe must ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"love"})," that which we see in Him: admiration is not the\r\nword. When cold critics commend Him, their praise is half an\r\ninsult: what know these frozen hearts of our Beloved? As for a\r\nword against Him, it wounds us to the soul. Even an omission of\r\nHis praise is a torture to us. If we hear a sermon which has no\r\nChrist in it, we weary of it. If we read a book that contains a\r\nslighting syllable of Him, we abhor it. He, Himself, has become\r\neverything to us now, and only in the atmosphere of fervent love\r\nto Him can we feel at home.\r\nPassing from His character to ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"His sacrifice;"}),' there\r\nespecially "He is altogether lovely." You may have read\r\n"Rutherford\'s Letters"; I hope you have. How wondrously he writes,\r\nwhen he describes his Lord in garments red from His sweat of\r\nblood, and with hands bejewelled with His wounds! When we view His\r\nbody taken down from the cross, all pale and deathly, and wrapped\r\nin the cerements of the grave, we see a strange beauty in Him. He\r\nis to us never more lovely than when we read in our Beloved\'s\r\nwhite and red that His Sacrifice is accomplished, and He has been\r\nobedient unto death for us. In Him, as the sacrifice once offered,\r\nwe see our pardon, our life, our heaven, our all. So lovely is\r\nChrist in His sacrifice, that He is for ever most pleasing to the\r\ngreat Judge of all, ay, so lovely to His Father, that He makes us\r\nalso lovely to God the Father, and we are "accepted in the\r\nBeloved." His sacrifice has such merit and beauty in the sight of\r\nheaven, that in Him God is well pleased, and guilty men become in\r\nHim pleasant unto the Lord. Is not His sacrifice most sweet to us?\r\nHere our guilty conscience finds peace; here we see ourselves made\r\ncomely in His comeliness. We cannot stand at Calvary, and see the\r\nSaviour die, and hear Him cry, "It is finished," without feeling\r\nthat "He is altogether lovely." Forgive me that I speak so coolly!\r\nI dare not enter fully into a theme which would pull up the\r\nsluices of my heart.\r\nRemember what He was when He rose from the grave on the third']}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["day.

To His people He will then be "altogether\r\nlovely." Angels will adore Him, saints made perfect will fall on\r\ntheir faces before Him; and we ourselves shall feel that, at last,\r\nour heaven is complete. We shall see Him, and being like Him, we\r\nshall be satisfied.\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Every feature of our Lord is lovely."}),' You cannot think of\r\nanything that has to do with Him which is unworthy of our praise.\r\nAll over glorious is our Lord. The spouse speaks of His head, His\r\nlocks, His eyes, His cheeks, His lips, His hands, His legs, His\r\ncountenance, His mouth; and when she has mentioned them all, she\r\nsums up with reference to all by saying, "Yea, He is altogether\r\nlovely."\r\nThere is ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"nothing unlovely about Him"}),'. Certain persons would\r\nbe beautiful were it not for a wound or a bruise, but our Beloved\r\nis all the more lovely for His wounds; the marring of His\r\ncountenance has enhanced its charms. His scars are, for glory and\r\nfor beauty, the jewels of our King. To us He is lovely even from\r\nthat side which others dread: His very frown has comfort in it to\r\nHis saints, since He only frowns on evil. Even His feet, which are\r\n"like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace," are lovely\r\nto us for His sake; these are His poor saints, who are sorely\r\ntried, but are able to endure the fire. Everything of Christ,\r\neverything that partakes of Christ, everything that hath a flavour\r\nor savour of Christ, is lovely to us.\r\nThere is ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"nothing lacking about His loveliness"}),". Some would\r\nbe very lovely were there a brightness in their eyes, or a colour\r\nin their countenances: but something is away. The absence of a\r\ntooth or of an eyebrow may spoil a countenance, but in Christ\r\nJesus there is no omission of excellence. Everything that should\r\nbe in Him is in Him; everything that is conceivable in perfection\r\nis present to perfection in Him.\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"In Him is nothing excessive"}),". Many a face has one feature in\r\nit which is overdone; but in our Lord's character everything is\r\nbalanced and proportionate. You never find His kindness lessening\r\nHis holiness, nor His holiness eclipsing His wisdom, nor His\r\nwisdom abating His courage, nor His courage injuring His meekness.\r\nEverything is in our Lord that should be there, and everything in\r\ndue measure. Like rare spices, mixed after the manner of the\r\napothecary, our Lord's whole person, and character, and sacrifice,\r\nare as incense sweet unto the Lord.\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Neither is there anything in our Lord which is incongruous\r\nwith the rest"}),'. In each one of us there is, at least, a little\r\nthat is out of place. We could not be fully described without the\r\nuse of a "but." If we could all look within, and see ourselves as\r\nGod sees us, we should note a thousand matters, which we now\r\npermit, which we should never allow again. But in the Well-beloved\r\nall is of a piece, all is lovely; and when the sum of the whole is\r\nadded up, it comes to an absolute perfection of loveliness: "Yea,\r\nHe is altogether lovely."\r\nWe are sure that the Lord Jesus must be Himself exceedingly\r\nlovely, since ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"He gives loveliness to His people"}),". Many saints are\r\nlovely in their lives; one reads biographies of good men and women\r\nwhich make us wish to grow like them; yet all the loveliness of\r\nall the most holy among men has come from Jesus their Lord, and is\r\na copy of His perfect beauty. Those who write well do so because\r\nHe sets the copy.\r\nWhat is stranger and more wonderful still, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"our Lord Jesus\r\nmakes sinners lovely."}),' In their natural state, men are deformed\r\nand hideous to the eye of God; and as they have no love to God, so\r\nHe has no delight in them. He is weary of them, and is grieved\r\nthat He made men upon the earth. The Lord is angry with the wicked\r\nevery day. Yet, when our Lord Jesus comes in, and covers these\r\nsinful ones with His righteousness, and, at the same time, infuses\r\ninto them His life, the Lord is well pleased with them for His\r\nSon\'s sake. Even in heaven, the infinite Jehovah sees nothing\r\nwhich pleases Him like His Son. The Father from eternity loved His\r\nOnly-begotten, and again and again He hath said of Him, "This is\r\nMy beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." What higher encomium\r\ncan be passed upon Him?\r\nIf we had time to think over this subject, we should say of\r\nour Lord that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"He is lovely in every office."})," He is the most\r\nadmirable Priest, and King, and Prophet that ever yet exercised\r\nthe office. He is a lovely Shepherd of a chosen flock, a lovely\r\nFriend, lovely Husband, a lovely Brother: He is admirable in every\r\nposition that He occupies for our sakes.\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Our Lord's loveliness appears in every condition:"}),' in the\r\nmanger, or in the temple; by the well, or on the sea; in the\r\ngarden, or on the cross; in the tomb, or in the resurrection; in\r\nHis first, or in His second coming. He is not as the herb, which\r\nflowers only at one season; or as the tree, which loses its leaves\r\nin winter; or as the moon, which waxes and wanes; or as the sea,\r\nwhich ebbs and flows. In every condition, and at every time, "He\r\nis altogether lovely."\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"He is lovely, whichever way we look at Him."}),' If we view Him\r\nas in the past, entering into a covenant of peace on our behalf;\r\nor, in the present, yielding Himself to us as Intercessor,\r\nRepresentative, and Forerunner; or, in the future, coming,\r\nreigning, and glorifying His people; "He is altogether lovely."\r\nBehold Him from heaven, view Him from the gates of hell, regard\r\nHim as he goes before, look up to Him as He sits above; He is as\r\nbeautiful from one point of view as from another; "Yea, He is\r\naltogether lovely." Wherever we may be, He is the same in His\r\nperfection. How lovely He was to my eyes when I was sinking in\r\ndespair! To see Him suffering for my sin upon the tree, was as the\r\nopening of the gates of the morning to my darkened soul. How\r\nlovely He is to us when we are sick, and the hours of night seem\r\nlengthened into days! "He giveth songs in the night." How lovely\r\nhas He been to us when the world has frowned, and friends have\r\nforsaken, and worldly goods have been scant! To see "the King in\r\nHis beauty" is a sight sufficient, even if we never saw another\r\nray of comfort. How blessed, when we lie dying, to hear Him say,\r\n"I am the resurrection and the life"! Mark that word; He says not,\r\n"I will give you resurrection and life," but, "I am the\r\nresurrection and the life." Blessed are the eyes which can see\r\nthat in Jesus which is really in Him. When we think of seeing Him\r\nas He is, and being like Him, how heaven approaches us! We shall\r\nsoon behold the beatific vision, of which He will be the centre\r\nand the sun. At the thought thereof our soul takes wing, and our\r\nimagination soars aloft, while our faith, with eagle eye, beholds\r\nthe glory. As we think of that glad period, when we shall be with\r\nour Beloved for ever, we are ready to swoon away with delight. It\r\nis near, far nearer than we think.\r\nIII. The little time which we can give to this meditation has\r\nrun out, and therefore I hasten to a close. I have bidden you look\r\nat our Lord as "altogether lovely" with reverent emotions, and\r\nwith absolute certainty. Now, to conclude, think of Him with\r\npractical results. "He is altogether lovely." What shall we do for\r\nthis chief among ten thousand?\r\nFirst, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"we will tell others of Him"}),'. For that cause was our\r\ntext spoken. The daughters of Jerusalem asked the spouse, "What is\r\nthy Beloved more than another beloved?" Her answer is here: "He is\r\naltogether lovely." It is a great joy to praise our Lord to\r\nenquiring minds. We, who are preachers, have a glorious time of it\r\nwhen we extol our Lord. If we had nothing to do but to preach\r\nChrist, and had no discipline to administer, no sin to battle\r\nwith, no doubts to drive away, we should have a heavenly service.\r\nFor my part, I wish I could be bound over to play only upon this\r\none string. Paul did well when he turned ignoramus, and determined\r\nto know nothing among the Corinthians save Jesus Christ, and Him\r\ncrucified. As the harp of Anacreon would resound love alone, so\r\nwould I have but one sole subject for my ministry,--the love and\r\nloveliness of my Lord. Then to speak would be its own reward; and\r\nto study and prepare discourses would be only a phase of rest.\r\nFain would I make my whole ministry to speak of Christ and His\r\nsurpassing loveliness.\r\nYou who are not preachers cannot do better than speak much of\r\nJesus, as opportunity offers. Make ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Him"}),' the theme of\r\nconversation. People talk about ministers; but we beg you to talk\r\nof our Master. Our undecided neighbours are always talking of\r\nhypocrites and inconsistent professors; but we would say to them,\r\n"Never mind about His followers: talk about the Master Himself."\r\nHis followers, by themselves considered, never were worth your\r\nwords; but what a theme is this,-- "He is altogether lovely"! Our\r\nLord\'s people are far worthier than the world thinks them to be;\r\nfor my part, I rejoice in the many gracious and beautiful\r\ncharacters with which I meet, but even if all the ill reports we\r\nhear were true, this would not detract from the loveliness of our\r\nLord, who is infinitely beyond all praise.\r\nThe next practical result of viewing the loveliness of our\r\nblessed Lord is, that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"we appropriate Him to ourselves"}),', grasping\r\nHim with our two hands of faith and love, and making the rest of\r\nthe verse to be our own: "This is my Beloved, and this is my\r\nFriend, O daughters of Jerusalem!" Since He is so amiable, He must\r\nbe "my Beloved"; my heart clings to Him. Since He is admirable, I\r\nrejoice that He is "my Friend"; my soul trusts in Him. The heart\r\nthat most appreciates Jesus is the most eager to appropriate Him.\r\nHe who beholds Jesus as "altogether lovely" will never rest till\r\nhe is altogether sure that Jesus is altogether his own. I think I\r\nmay also add that appreciation is in great measure the seal of\r\nappropriation, for the soul that values Christ most is the soul\r\nthat hath most surely taken possession of Christ. Sometimes a\r\nheart prizes the Lord very highly, and tremblingly longs for Him;\r\nbut it is my conviction that the very fact of prizing Him argues a\r\nmeasure of possession of Him. Jesus never wins a heart to which He\r\nrefuses His love. If thou lovest Him, He loves thee: be sure of\r\nthat. No soul ever cries, "Yea, He is altogether lovely," without\r\nsooner or later adding, "This is my Beloved, and this is my\r\nFriend."\r\nRest not, any one of you, till you know of a surety that\r\nJesus is yours. Do not be content with a hope, struggle after the\r\nfull assurance of faith. This is to be had, and you ought not to\r\nbe content without it. It may be your lifelong song, "My Beloved\r\nis mine, and I am His." You need not pine in the shade: the sun is\r\nshining, "walk in the light." Away with the idea that we cannot\r\nknow whether we are condemned or forgiven, in Christ or out of\r\nHim! We may know, we must know; and, as we appreciate our Lord, we\r\nshall know. Either Jesus is ours, or He is not. If He is, let us\r\nrejoice in the priceless possession. If He is not ours, let us at\r\nonce lay hold upon Him by faith; for, the moment we trust Him, He\r\nis ours. The enjoyment of religion lies in assurance: a mere hope\r\nis scant diet.\r\nOnce more, it is a fair fruit of our delight in our Lord that\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"our valuation of Him becomes a bond of union between us and\r\nothers"}),'. The spouse cries, "This is my Beloved, and this is my\r\nFriend, O daughters of Jerusalem!" and they reply, "Whither is thy\r\nBeloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither is thy Beloved\r\nturned aside, that we may seek Him with thee?" Thus, you see, they\r\ninstitute a companionship through the Well-beloved. Few of us, in\r\nthis room, would ever have known each other, had it not been for\r\nour common admiration of the Lord Jesus. We should have gone on\r\nwalking past each other by the sea to this day, and we should have\r\nmissed much cheering fellowship. Our Lord has become our centre;\r\nwe meet in Him, and feel that in Him we are partakers of one life.\r\nWe seek our Well-beloved together, and around His table we find\r\nHim together; and finding Him, we have found one another, and the\r\nlost jewel of Christian love glitters on every bosom. We have\r\ndiffering views on certain parts of divine truth; and I do not\r\nknow that it is wrong for us to differ where the Holy Spirit has\r\nleft truth without rigidly defining it. We are bound each one\r\ndevoutly to use his judgment in the interpretation of the Sacred\r\nWord; but we all agree in this one clear judgment: "Yea, He is\r\naltogether lovely." This is the point of union. Those who\r\nenthusiastically love the same person are on the way to loving\r\neach other. This is growingly our case; and it is the same with\r\nall spiritual people. Professors quarrel, but possessors are at\r\none. We hear much discourse upon "the Unity of the Church" as a\r\nthing to be desired, and we may heartily agree with it; but it\r\nwould be well also to remember that in the true Church of Christ\r\nreal union already exists. Our Lord prayed for those whom the\r\nFather had given Him, that they might be one, and the Father\r\ngranted the prayer: the Lord\'s own people are one. In this room we\r\nhave an example of how closely we are united in Christ. Some of\r\nyou are more at home in this assembly, taken out of all churches,\r\nthan you are in the churches to which you nominally belong.

The Lord Jesus had for ever delighted Himself with\r\nthe sons of men, and he ever stood prepared to reveal and\r\ncommunicate that delight to His people; but they were incapable of\r\nreturning His affection or enjoying His fellowship, having fallen\r\ninto a state so base and degraded, that they were dead to Him, and\r\ncareless concerning Him. It was therefore needful that something\r\nshould be done for them, and in them, before they could hold\r\nconverse with Jesus, or feel concord with Him. This preparation\r\nbeing a work of grace and a result of previous union, Jesus\r\ndetermined that, even in the preparation for communion, there\r\nshould be communion. If they must be washed before they could\r\nfully converse with Him, He would commune with them in the\r\nwashing; and if they must be enriched by gifts before they could\r\nhave full access to Him, He would commune with them in the giving.\r\nHe has therefore established a fellowship in imparting His grace,\r\nand in partaking of it.\r\nThis order of fellowship we have called "The Communion of\r\nCommunication," and we think that a few remarks will prove that we\r\nare not running beyond the warranty of Scripture.\r\nThe word koinwnia, or communion, is frequently employed by\r\ninspired writers in the sense of communication or contribution.\r\nWhen, in our English version, we read, "For it hath pleased them\r\nof Macedonia and Achaia to make ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"a certain contribution"}),' for the\r\npoor saints which are at Jerusalem" (Romans xv. 26), it is\r\ninteresting to know that the word koinonia used, as if to show\r\nthat the generous gifts of the Church in Achaia to its sister\r\nChurch at Jerusalem was a communion. Calvin would have us notice\r\nthis, because, saith he, "The word here employed well expresses\r\nthe feeling by which it behoves us to succour the wants of our\r\nbrethren, even because there is to be a common and mutual regard\r\non account of the union of the body." He would not have strained\r\nthe text if he had said that there was in the contribution the\r\nvery essence of communion. Gill, in his commentary upon the above\r\nverse, most pertinently remarks, "Contribution, or communion, as\r\nthe word signifies, it being one part of the communion of churches\r\nand of saints to relieve their poor by communicating to them." The\r\nsame word is employed in Hebrews xiii. 16, and is there translated\r\nby the word "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"communicate"}),'." "But to do good, and to communicate,\r\nforget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased." It\r\noccurs again in 2 Corinthians ix. 13, "And for your liberal\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"distribution"})," unto them, and unto all men;\" and in numerous other\r\npassages the careful student will observe the word in various\r\nforms, representing the ministering of the saints to one another\r\nas an act of fellowship. Indeed, at the Lord's supper, which is\r\nthe embodiment of communion, we have ever been wont to make a\r\nspecial contribution for the poor of the flock, and we believe\r\nthat in the collection there is as true and real an element of\r\ncommunion as in the partaking of the bread and wine. The giver\r\nholds fellowship with the receiver when he bestows his benefaction\r\nfor the Lord's sake, and because of the brotherhood existing\r\nbetween him and his needy friends. The teacher holds communion\r\nwith the young disciple when he labours to instruct him in the\r\nfaith, being moved thereto by a spirit of Christian love. He who\r\nintercedes for a saint because he desires his well-being as a\r\nmember of the one family, enters into fellowship with his brother\r\nin the offering of prayer. The loving and mutual service of\r\nchurch-members is fellowship of a high degree. And let us remember\r\nthat the recipient communes with the benefactor: the communion is\r\nnot confined to the giver, but the heart overflowing with\r\nliberality is met by the heart brimming with gratitude, and the\r\nlove manifested in the bestowal is reciprocated in the acceptance.\r\nWhen the hand feeds the mouth or supports the head, the divers\r\nmembers feel their union, and sympathize with one another; and so\r\nis it with the various portions of the body of Christ, for they\r\ncommune in mutual acts of love.\r\nNow, this meaning of the word communion furnishes us with\r\nmuch instruction, since it indicates the manner in which\r\nrecognized fellowship with Jesus is commenced and maintained,\r\nnamely, by giving and receiving, by ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"communication"})," and reception.\r\nThe Lord's supper is the divinely-ordained exhibition of\r\ncommunion, and therefore in it there is the breaking of bread and\r\nthe pouring forth of wine, to picture the free gift of the\r\nSaviour's body and blood to us; and there is also the eating of\r\nthe one and the drinking of the other, to represent the reception\r\nof these priceless gifts by us. As without bread and wine there\r\ncould be no Lord's supper, so without the gracious bequests of\r\nJesus to us there would have been no communion between Him and our\r\nsouls: and as participation is necessary before the elements truly\r\nrepresent the meaning of the Lord's ordinance, so is it needful\r\nthat we should receive His bounties, and feed upon His person,\r\nbefore we can commune with Him.\r\nIt is one branch of this mutual communication which we have\r\nselected as the subject of this address. \"Looking unto Jesus,\" who\r\nhath delivered us from our state of enmity, and brought us into\r\nfellowship with Himself, we pray for the rich assistance of the\r\nHoly Spirit, that we may be refreshed in spirit, and encouraged to\r\ndraw more largely from the covenant storehouse of Christ Jesus the\r\nLord.\r\nWe shall take a text, and proceed at once to our delightful\r\ntask. \"",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"And of His fulness have all we received, and grace for\r\ngrace"}),'." (John i. 16.)\r\nAs the life of grace is first begotten in us by the Lord\r\nJesus, so is it constantly sustained by Him. We are always drawing\r\nfrom this sacred fountain, always deriving sap from this divine\r\nroot; and as Jesus communes with us in the bestowing of mercies,\r\nit is our privilege to hold fellowship with Him in the receiving\r\nof them.\r\nThere is this difference between Christ and ourselves, He\r\nnever gives without manifesting fellowship, but we often receive\r\nin so ill a manner that communion is not reciprocated, and we\r\ntherefore miss the heavenly opportunity of its enjoyment. We\r\nfrequently receive grace insensibly, that is to say, the sacred\r\noil runs through the pipe, and maintains our lamp, while we are\r\nunmindful of the secret influence. We may also be the partakers of\r\nmany mercies which, through our dulness, we do not perceive to be\r\nmercies at all; and at other times well-known blessings are\r\nrecognized as such, but we are backward in tracing them to their\r\nsource in the covenant made with Christ Jesus.\r\nFollowing out the suggestion of our explanatory preface, we\r\ncan well believe that when the poor saints received the\r\ncontribution of their brethren, many of them did in earnest\r\nacknowledge the fellowship which was illustrated in the generous\r\noffering, but it is probable that some of them merely looked upon\r\nthe material of the gift, and failed to see the spirit moving in\r\nit. Sensual thoughts in some of the receivers might possibly, at\r\nthe season when the contribution was distributed, have\r\nmischievously injured the exercise of spirituality; for it is\r\npossible that, after a period of poverty, they would be apt to\r\ngive greater prominence to the fact that their need was removed\r\nthan to the sentiment of fellowship with their sympathizing\r\nbrethren. They would rather rejoice over famine averted than\r\nconcerning fellowship manifested. We doubt not that, in many\r\ninstances, the mutual benefactions of the Church fail to reveal\r\nour fellowship to our poor brethren, and produce in them no\r\nfeelings of communion with the givers.\r\nNow this sad fact is an illustration of the yet more\r\nlamentable statement which we have made. We again assert that, as\r\nmany of the partakers of the alms of the Church are not alive to\r\nthe communion contained therein, so the Lord\'s people are never\r\nsufficiently attentive to fellowship with Jesus in receiving His\r\ngifts, but many of them are entirely forgetful of their privilege,\r\nand all of them are too little aware of it. Nay, worse than this,\r\nhow often doth the believer pervert the gifts of Jesus into food\r\nfor his own sin and wantonness! We are not free from the\r\nfickleness of ancient Israel, and well might our Lord address us\r\nin the same language: "Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon\r\nthee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread My skirt\r\nover thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and\r\nentered into a covenant with Thee, saith the Lord God, and thou\r\nbecamest Mine. Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly\r\nwashed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. I\r\nclothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers?\r\nskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee\r\nwith silk. I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets\r\nupon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. And I put a jewel on thy\r\nforehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon\r\nthine head. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy\r\nraiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou\r\ndidst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding\r\nbeautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. And thy renown\r\nwent forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect\r\nthrough My comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord\r\nGod. But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the\r\nharlot because of thy renown." (Ezek. xvi. 8-16.)\r\nOught not the mass of professors to confess the truth of this\r\naccusation? Have not the bulk of us most sadly departed from the\r\npurity of our love? We rejoice, however, to observe a remnant of\r\nchoice spirits, who live near the Lord, and know the sweetness of\r\nfellowship. These receive the promise and the blessing, and so\r\ndigest them that they become good blood in their veins, and so do\r\nthey feed on their Lord that they grow up into Him. Let us imitate\r\nthose elevated minds, and obtain their high delights. There is no\r\nreason why the meanest of us should not be as David, and David as\r\nthe servant of the Lord. We may now be dwarfs, but growth is\r\npossible; let us therefore aim at a higher stature. Let the\r\nsucceeding advice be followed, and, the Holy Spirit helping us, we\r\nshall have attained thereto.\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Make every time of need a time of embracing thy Lord"}),'. Do\r\nnot leave the mercy-seat until thou hast clasped Him in thine\r\narms. In every time of need He has promised to give thee grace to\r\nhelp, and what withholdeth thee from obtaining sweet fellowship as\r\na precious addition to the promised assistance? Be not as the\r\nbeggar who is content with the alms, however grudgingly it may be\r\ncast to him; but, since thou art a near kinsman, seek a smile and\r\na kiss with every benison He gives thee. Is He not better than His\r\nmercies? What are they without Him? Cry aloud unto Him, and let\r\nthy petition reach His ears, "O my Lord, it is not enough to be a\r\npartaker of Thy bounties, I must have Thyself also; if Thou dost\r\nnot give me Thyself with Thy favours, they are but of little use\r\nto me! O smile on me, when Thou blessest me, for else I am still\r\nunblest! Thou puttest perfume into all the flowers of Thy garden,\r\nand fragrance into Thy spices; if Thou withdrawest Thyself, they\r\nare no more pleasant to me. Come, then, my Lord, and give me Thy\r\nlove with Thy grace." Take good heed, Christian, that thine own\r\nheart is in right tune, that when the fingers of mercy touch the\r\nstrings, they may resound with full notes of communion. How sad is\r\nit to partake of favour without rejoicing in it! Yet such is often\r\nthe believer\'s case. The Lord casts His lavish bounties at our\r\ndoors, and we, like churls, scarcely look out to thank Him. Our\r\nungrateful hearts and unthankful tongues mar our fellowship, by\r\ncausing us to miss a thousand opportunities for exercising it.\r\nIf thou wouldst enjoy communion with the Lord Jesus in the\r\nreception of His grace, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"endeavor to be always sensibly drawing\r\nsupplies from Him"}),".

Let no mercy come into\r\nthine house unsung. Note in thy memory the list of thy Master's\r\nbenefits. Wherefore should the Lord's bounties be hurried away in\r\nthe dark, or buried in forgetfulness? Keep the gates of thy soul\r\never open, and sit thou by the wayside to watch the treasures of\r\ngrace which God the Spirit hourly conveys into thy heart from\r\nJehovah--Jesus, thy Lord.\r\nNever let an hour pass without drawing upon the bank of\r\nheaven. If all thy wants seem satisfied, look steadfastly until\r\nthe next moment brings another need, and then delay not, but with\r\nthis warrant of necessity, hasten to thy treasury again. Thy\r\nnecessities are so numerous that thou wilt never lack a reason for\r\napplying to the fulness of Jesus; but if ever such an occasion\r\nshould arise, enlarge thine heart, and then there will be need of\r\nmore love to fill the wider space. But do not allow any\r\nsupposititious riches of thine own to suspend thy daily receivings\r\nfrom the Lord Jesus. You have constant need of Him. You need His\r\nintercession, His upholding, His sanctification; you need that He\r\nshould work all your works in you, and that He should preserve you\r\nunto the day of His appearing. There is not one moment of your\r\nlife in which you can do without Christ. Therefore be always at\r\nHis door, and the wants which you bemoan shall be remembrances to\r\nturn your heart unto your Saviour. Thirst makes the heart pant for\r\nthe waterbrooks, and pain reminds man of the physician.

No exception has\r\never been made to the universal curse on those of the first Adam's\r\nseed who have no interest in the second Adam. Christ is the only\r\nZoar in which God's Lots can find a shelter from the destruction\r\nof Sodom. Out of Him, the withering blast of the fiery furnace of\r\nGod's wrath consumes every green herb, and it is only in Him that\r\nthe soul can live. As when the prairie is on fire, men see the\r\nheavens wrapped in sheets of flame, and in hot haste they fly\r\nbefore the devouring element. They have but one hope.

Although the skies are molten with the heat, the sun\r\ndarkened with the smoke, and the earth utterly consumed in the\r\nfire, they know that they are secure while the cooling flood\r\nembraces them. Christ Jesus is the only escape for a sinner\r\npursued by the fiery wrath of God, and we would have the believer\r\nremember this. Our own works could never shelter us, for they have\r\nproved but refuges of lies. Had they been a thousand times more\r\nand better, they would have been but as the spider's web, too\r\nflail to hang eternal interests upon. There was but one name, one\r\nsacrifice, one blood, by which we could escape. All other attempts\r\nat salvation were a grievous failure. For, \"though a man could\r\nscourge out of his body rivers of blood, and in neglect of himself\r\ncould outlast Moses or Elias; though he could wear out his knees\r\nwith prayer, and had his eyes nailed on heaven; though he could\r\nbuild hospitals for all the poor on earth, and exhaust the mines\r\nof India in alms; though he could walk like an angel of light, and\r\nwith the glittering of an outward holiness dazzle the eyes of all\r\nbeholders; nay (if it were possible to be conceived) though he\r\nshould live for a thousand years in a perfect and perpetual\r\nobservation of the whole law of God, if the only exception to his\r\nperfection were the very least deviation from the law, yet such a\r\nman as this could no more appear before the tribunal of God's\r\njustice, than stubble before a consuming fire.\" How, then, with\r\nthine innumerable sins, couldst thou escape the damnation of hell,\r\nmuch less become the recipient of bounties so rich and large?\r\nBlessed window of heaven, sweet Lord Jesus, let Thy Church for\r\never adore Thee, as the only channel by which mercies can flow to\r\nher.

Thorns and briars were all our growth naturally, but He\r\nbought us with a price, He hedged us about, and set us apart for\r\nHimself, and then He planted and cultivated us.

I have been thinking of\r\nthe advantages of my own position towards the Lord, and lamenting\r\nwith great shamefacedness that I am not bringing forth such fruit\r\nto Him as my position demands. Considering our privileges,\r\nadvantages, and opportunities, I fear that many of us have need to\r\nfeel great searchings of heart. Perhaps to such the text may be\r\nhelpful, and it will not be without profit to any one of us, if\r\nthe Lord will bless our meditation upon it.\r\nI. Our first thought, in considering these words, is that our\r\nposition as the Lord\'s vineyard is a very favourable one: "My\r\nWell-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill." No people\r\ncould be better placed for serving Christ than we are. I hardly\r\nthink that any man is better situated for glorifying God than I\r\nam. I do not think that any women could be in better positions for\r\nserving Christ than some of you, dear sisters, now occupy. Our\r\nheavenly Father has placed us just where He can do the most for\r\nus, and where we can do the most for Him. Infinite wisdom has\r\noccupied itself with carefully selecting the soil, and site, and\r\naspect of every tree in the vineyard. We differ greatly, and need\r\ndiffering situations in order to fruitfulness: the place which\r\nwould suit one might be too trying for another. Friend, the Lord\r\nhas planted you in the right spot: your station may not be the\r\nbest in itself, but it is the best for you. We are in the best\r\npossible position for some present service at this moment; the\r\nprovidence of God has put us on a vantage ground for our immediate\r\nduty: "My Well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill."\r\nLet us think of ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the times in which we live"})," as calling upon\r\nus to be very fruitful when we compare them with the years gone\r\nby. Time was when we could not have met thus happily in our own\r\nroom: if we had been taken in the act of breaking bread, or\r\nreading God's Word, we should have been haled off to prison, and\r\nperhaps put to death. Our forefathers scarcely dared to lift up\r\ntheir voices in a psalm of praise, lest the enemy should be upon\r\nthem. Truly, the lines have fallen unto us in pleasant places;\r\nyea, we have a goodly heritage, in a very fruitful hill.\r\nWe do not even live in times when error is so rampant as to\r\nbe paramount. There is too much of it abroad; but taking a broad\r\nview of things, I venture to say that there never was a time when\r\nthe truth had a wider sway than it has now, or when the gospel was\r\nmore fully preached, or when there was more spiritual activity.\r\nBlack clouds of error hover over us; but at the same time we\r\nrejoice that, from John o' Groat's House to the Land's End, Christ\r\nis preached by ten thousand voices, and even in the dark parts of\r\nthe earth the name of Jesus is shining like a candle in the house.\r\nIf we had the pick of the ages in which to live, we could not have\r\nselected a better time for fruitbearing than that which is now\r\noccurrent: this age is \"a very fruitful hill.\"\r\nThat this is the case some of us know positively, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"because we\r\nhave been fruitful."})," Look back, brothers and sisters, upon times\r\nwhen your hearts were warm, and your zeal was fervent, and you\r\nserved the Lord with gladness. I join with you in those happy\r\nmemories. Then we could run with the swiftest, we could fight with\r\nthe bravest, we could work with the strongest, we could suffer\r\nwith the most patient. The grace of God has been upon certain of\r\nus in such an unmistakable manner that we have brought forth all\r\nthe fruits of the Spirit. Perhaps to-day we look back with deep\r\nregret because we are not so fruitful as we once were: if it be\r\nso, it is well that our regrets should multiply, but we must\r\nchange each one of them into a hopeful prayer. Remember, the vine\r\nmay have changed, but the soil is the same. We have still the same\r\nmotives for being fruitful, and even more than we used to have.\r\nWhy are we not more useful? Has some spiritual phylloxera taken\r\npossession of the vines, or have we become frost-bitten, or sun-\r\nburnt? What is it that withholds the vintage? Certainly, if we\r\nwere fruitful once, we ought to be more fruitful now. The fruitful\r\nhill is not exhausted; what aileth us that our grapes are so few?\r\nWe are planted on a fruitful hill, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"for we are called to work\r\nwhich of all others is the most fruitful"}),'. Blessed and happy is\r\nthe man who is called to the Christian ministry; for this service\r\nhas brought more glory to Christ than any other. You, beloved\r\nfriends, are not called to be rulers of nations, nor inventors of\r\nengines, nor teachers of sciences, nor slayers of men; but we are\r\nsoul-winners, our work is to lead men to Jesus. Ours is, of all\r\nthe employments in the world, the most fruitful in benefits to men\r\nand glory to God. If we are not serving God in the gospel of His\r\nSon with all our might and ability, then we have a heavy\r\nresponsibility resting upon us. "Our Well-beloved hath a vineyard\r\nin a very fruitful hill:" there is not a richer bit of soil\r\noutside Immanuel\'s land than the holy ministry for souls. Certain\r\nof us are teachers, and gather the young about us while we speak\r\nof Jesus. This also is choice soil. Many teachers have gathered a\r\ngrand vintage from among the little ones, and have not been a whit\r\nbehind pastors and evangelists in the glory of soul-winning. Dear\r\nteachers, your vines are planted in a very fruitful hill. But I do\r\nnot confine myself to preachers and teachers; for all of us, as we\r\nhave opportunities of speaking for the Lord Jesus Christ, and\r\nprivately talking to individuals, have also a fertile soil to grow\r\nin. If we do not glorify God by soul-winning, we shall be greatly\r\nblamable, since of all forms of service it is most prolific in\r\npraise of God.\r\nAnd what is more, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the very circumstances with which we are\r\nsurrounded"}),' all tend to make our position exceedingly favourable\r\nfor fruit-bearing. In this little company we have not one friend\r\nwho is extremely poor; but if such were among us, I should say the\r\nsame thing. Christ has gathered some of His choicest clusters from\r\nthe valley of poverty. Many eminent saints have never owned a foot\r\nof land, but lived upon their weekly wage, and found scant fare at\r\nthat. Yes, by the grace of God, the vale of poverty has blossomed\r\nas the rose. It so happens, however, that the most of us here have\r\na competence, we have all that we need, and something over to give\r\nto the poor and to the cause of God. Surely we ought to be\r\nfruitful in almsgiving, in caring for the sick, and in all manner\r\nof sweet and flagrant influences. "Give me neither poverty nor\r\nriches," is a prayer that has been answered for most of us; and if\r\nwe do not now give honour unto God, what excuse can we make for\r\nour barrenness? I am speaking to some who are singularly healthy,\r\nwho are never hindered by aches and pains; and to others who have\r\nbeen prospered in business for twenty years at a stretch: yours is\r\ngreat indebtedness to your Lord: in your case, "My Well-beloved\r\nhath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill." Give God your strength\r\nand your wealth, my brother, while they last: see that all His\r\ncare of thee is not thrown away. Others of us seldom know many\r\nmonths together of health, but have often had to suffer sorely in\r\nbody; this ought to make us fruitful, for there is much increase\r\nfrom the tillage of affliction. Has not the Master obtained the\r\nrichest of all fruit from bleeding vines? Do not His heaviest\r\nbunches come from vines which have been sharply cut and pruned\r\ndown to the ground? Choice flavours, dainty juices, and delicious\r\naromas come mostly from the use of the keen-edged knife of trial.\r\nSome of us are at our best for fruitbearing when in other respects\r\nwe are at our worst. Thus I might truly say that, whatever our\r\ncircumstances may be, whether we are poor or rich, in health or in\r\naffliction, each one of our cases has its advantages, and we are\r\nplanted "in a very fruitful hill."\r\nFurthermore, when I look at our spiritual condition_, I must\r\nsay for myself, and I think for you also, "My Well-beloved hath a\r\nvineyard in a very fruitful hill." For what has God done for us?\r\nTo change the question,--what has God not done for us? What more\r\ncould He say than to us He hath said? What more could He do than\r\nto us He hath done? He hath dealt with us like a God. He has loved\r\nus up from the pit, He has loved us up to the cross, and up to the\r\ngates of heaven; He has quickened us, forgiven us, and renewed us;\r\nHe dwells in us, comforts us, instructs us, upholds us, preserves\r\nus, guides us, leads us, and He will surely perfect us. If we are\r\nnot fruitful, to His praise, how shall we excuse ourselves? Where\r\nshall we hide our guilty heads? Shall yonder sea suffice to lend\r\nus briny tears wherewith to weep over our ingratitude?\r\nII. I go a step further, by your leave, and say that our\r\nposition, as the Lord\'s vineyard, is favourable to the production\r\nof the fruit which He loves best. I believe that my own position\r\nis the most favourable for the production of the fruit that the\r\nLord loves best in me, and that your position is the same. What is\r\nthis fruit?\r\nFirst, it is ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"faith"}),'. Our Lord is very delighted to see faith\r\nin His people. The trust which clings to Him with childlike\r\nconfidence is pleasant to His loving heart. Our position is such\r\nthat faith ought to be the easiest thing in the world to us. Look\r\nat the promises He has given us in His Word: can we not believe\r\nthem? Look at what the Father has done for us in the gift of His\r\ndear Son: can we not trust Him after that? Our daily experience\r\nall goes to strengthen our confidence in God. Every mercy asks,\r\n"Will you not trust Him?" Every want that is supplied cries, "Can\r\nyou not trust Him?" Every sorrow sent by the great Father tests\r\nour faith, and drives us to Him on whom we repose, and so\r\nstrengthens and confirms our confidence in God. Mercies and\r\nmiseries alike operate for the growth of faith. Some of us have\r\nbeen called upon to trust God on a large scale, and that necessity\r\nhas been a great help towards fruit-bearing. The more troubles we\r\nhave, the more is our vine digged about, and the more nourishment\r\nis laid to its roots. If faith does not ripen under trial, when\r\nwill it ripen? Our afflictions fertilize the soil wherein faith\r\nmay grow.\r\nAnother choice fruit is ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"love"}),'. Jesus delights in love. His\r\ntender heart delights to see its love returned. Am I not of all\r\nmen most bound to love the Lord? I speak for each brother and\r\nsister here, is not that your language? Do you not all say, "Lives\r\nthere a person beneath yon blue sky who ought to love Jesus more\r\nthan I should do?" Each sister soliloquizes, "Sat there ever a\r\nwoman in her chamber who had more reason for loving God than I\r\nhave?" No, the sin which has been forgiven us should make us love\r\nour Saviour exceeding much. The sin which has been prevented in\r\nother cases should make us love our Preserver much. The help which\r\nGod has sent us in hours of need, the guidance which He has given\r\nin times of difficulty, the joy which He has poured into us in\r\ndays of fellowship, and the quiet He has breathed upon us in\r\nseasons of trial,--all ought to make us love Him. Along our life-\r\nroad, reasons for loving God are more numerous than the leaves\r\nupon the olives. He has hedged us about with His goodness, even as\r\nthe mountains and the sea are round our present resting-place.\r\nLook backward as far as time endures, and then look far beyond\r\nthat, into the eternity which has been, and you will see the\r\nLord\'s great love set upon us: all through time and eternity\r\nreasons have been accumulating which constrain us to love our\r\nLord. Now turn sharply round, and gaze before you, and all along\r\nthe future faith can see reasons for loving God, golden milestones\r\non the way that is yet to be traversed, all calling for our loving\r\ndelight in God.\r\nChrist is also very pleased with the fruit of ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"hope"}),", and we\r\nare so circumstanced that we ought to produce much of it. The aged\r\nought to look forward, for they cannot expect to see much more on\r\nearth. Time is short, and eternity is near; how precious is a good\r\nhope through grace! We who are not yet old ought to be exceedingly\r\nhopeful; and the younger folk, who are just beginning the\r\nspiritual life, should abound in hope most fresh and bright. If\r\nany man has expectations greater than I have, I should like to see\r\nhim. We have the greatest of expectations. Have you never felt\r\nlike Mercy in her dream, when she laughed and when Christiana\r\nasked her what made her laugh, she said that she had had a vision\r\nof things yet to be revealed?\r\nSelect any fruit of the Spirit you choose, and I maintain\r\nthat we are favourably circumstanced for producing it; we are\r\nplanted upon a very fruitful hill.

Are we not planted on a very fruitful hill?\r\nAs we think of His passion for our sake, we feel that"]})," a wall\r\nis set about us to the north"]}),', to keep back every sharp blast that\r\nmight destroy the tender grapes. No wrath is dreaded now, for\r\nJesus has borne it for us; behold the tokens of His all-sufficient\r\nsacrifice!

This word is addressed to the people of\r\nGod under captivity in Babylon, and we know that the Lord referred\r\nto the Egyptian redemption; for He says in the third verse, "I\r\ngave Egypt for thy ransom." Egypt was a great country, and a rich\r\ncountry, for we read of "all the treasures of Egypt", but God gave\r\nthem for His chosen: He would give all the nations of the earth\r\nfor His Israel. This was a wonderful stay to the people of God:\r\nthey constantly referred to Egypt and the Red Sea, and made their\r\nnational song out of it. In all Israel\'s times of disaster, and\r\ncalamity, and trial, they joyfully remembered that the Lord had\r\nredeemed them when they were a company of slaves, helpless and\r\nhopeless, under a tyrant who cast their firstborn children into\r\nthe Nile, a tyrant whose power was so tremendous that all the\r\narmies of the world could not have wrought their deliverance from\r\nhis iron hand. The very nod of Pharaoh seemed to the inhabitants\r\nof Egypt to be omnipotent; he was a builder of pyramids, a master\r\nof all the sciences of peace and the arts of war. What could the\r\nIsraelites have done against him? Jehovah came to their relief in\r\ntheir dire extremity. His plagues followed each other in quick\r\nsuccession. The dread volleys of the Lord\'s artillery confounded\r\nHis foes. At last He smote all the firstborn of Egypt, the chief\r\nof all their strength. Then was Egypt glad that Israel departed,\r\nand the Lord brought forth His people with silver and gold. All\r\nthe chivalry of Egypt was overthrown and destroyed at the Red Sea,\r\nand the timbrels of the daughters of Israel sounded joyously upon\r\nits shores. This redemption out of Egypt is so remarkable that it\r\nis remembered even in heaven. The Old Testament song is woven into\r\nthat of the New Covenant; for there they "sing the song of Moses\r\nthe servant of God, and the song of the Lamb." The first\r\nredeemption was so wonderful a type and prophecy of the other that\r\nit is no alloy to the golden hymn of eternal glory, but readily\r\nmelts into the same celestial chant. Other types may cease to be\r\nremembered, but this was so much a fact as well as a type that it\r\nshall be had in memory for ever and ever.

When we cannot see our\r\nway, or cannot make out what to do, we need not be at all troubled\r\nconcerning it; for the Lord Jehovah can see a way out of every\r\nintricacy. There never was a problem so hard to solve as that\r\nwhich is answered in redemption. Herein was the tremendous\r\ndifficulty--How can God be just, and yet the Saviour of sinners?\r\nHow can He fulfil His threatenings, and yet forgive sin? If that\r\nproblem been left to angels and men, they could never worked it\r\nout throughout eternity; but God has solved it through freely\r\ndelivering up His own Son. In the glorious sacrifice of Jesus we\r\nsee the justice of God magnified; for He laid sin on the blessed\r\nLord, who had become one with His chosen. Jesus identified Himself\r\nwith His people, and therefore their sin was laid upon Him, and\r\nthe sword of the Lord awoke against Him. He was not taken\r\narbitrarily to be a victim, but He was a voluntary Sufferer. His\r\nrelationship amounted to covenant oneness with His people, and "it\r\nbehoved Christ to suffer." Herein is a wisdom which must be more\r\nthan equal to all minor perplexities. Hear this, then, O poor soul\r\nin suspense! The Lord says, "I have redeemed thee. I have already\r\nbrought thee out of the labyrinth in which thou wast lost by sin,\r\nand therefore I will take thee out of the meshes of the net of\r\ntemptation, and lead thee through the maze of trial; I will bring\r\nthe blind by a way that they know not, and lead them in paths\r\nwhich they have not known. I will bring again from Bashan, I will\r\nbring up My people from the depths of the sea." Let us commit our\r\nway unto the Lord. Mine is a peculiarly difficult one, but I know\r\nthat my Redeemer liveth, and He will lead me by a right way. He\r\nwill be our Guide even unto death; and after death He will guide\r\nus through those tracks unknown of the mysterious region, and\r\ncause us to rest with Him for ever.\r\nSo also, if at any time we are in great ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"poverty"}),', or in\r\ngreat straitness of means for the Lord\'s work, and we are,\r\ntherefore, afraid that we shall never get our needs supplied, let\r\nus cast off such fears as we listen to the music of these words:\r\n"Fear not: for I have redeemed thee." God Himself looked down from\r\nheaven, and saw that there was no man who could give to Him a\r\nransom for his brother, and each man on his own part was\r\nhopelessly bankrupt; and then, despite our spiritual beggary, He\r\nfound the means of our redemption. What then? Let us hear the use\r\nwhich the Holy Spirit makes of this fact: "He that spared not His\r\nown Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with\r\nHim also freely give us all things?" We cannot have a want which\r\nthe Lord will not supply. Since God has given us Jesus, He will\r\ngive us, not some things, but "all things." Indeed, all things are\r\nours in Christ Jesus. No necessity of his life can for a single\r\nmoment be compared to that dread necessity which the Lord has\r\nalready supplied. The infinite gift of God\'s own Son is a far\r\ngreater one than all that can be included in the term "all\r\nthings": wherefore, it is a grand argument to the poor and needy,\r\n"Fear not: for I have redeemed thee." Perplexity and poverty are\r\nthus effectually met.\r\nWe are at times troubled by a sense of our personal\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"insignificance"}),'. It seems too much to hope that God\'s infinite\r\nmind should enter into our mean affairs. Though David said, "I am\r\npoor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me," we are not always\r\nquite prepared to say the same. We make our sorrows great under\r\nthe vain idea that they are too small for the Lord to notice. I\r\nbelieve that our greatest miseries spring from those little\r\nworries which we hesitate to bring to our heavenly Father. Our\r\ngracious God puts an end to all such thoughts as these by saying\r\n"Fear not for I have redeemed thee." You are not of such small\r\naccount as you suppose. The Lord would never be wasteful of His\r\nsacred expenditure.\r\nHe bought you with a price, and therefore He sets great store\r\nby you. Listen to what the Lord says: "Since thou wast precious in\r\nMy sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee:\r\ntherefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life." It\r\nis amazing that the Lord should think so much of us as to give\r\nJesus for us. "What is man that Thou art mindful of him?" Yet\r\nGod\'s mind is filled with thoughts of love towards man. Know ye\r\nnot that His only-begotten Son entered this world, and became a\r\nman?

Will He dedicate the walls with the infinite sacrifice\r\nof the Lamb of God? Will He give up the choicest treasure He ever\r\nhad, the chosen of God and precious, to be the corner-stone, and\r\nthen not finish the work He has begun? It is impossible. If He has\r\nredeemed us, He has, in that act, given us the pledge of all\r\nthings.\r\nSee how the gifts of God are bound to this redemption. "I\r\nhave redeemed thee. I have called thee."

Here is a chain in which each link is joined to\r\nall the rest, so that it cannot be separated. If God had only gone\r\nso far as to make a promise, He would not have drawn back from it;\r\nif God had gone as far as to swear an oath by Himself, He would\r\nnot have failed to keep it; but when He went beyond promise and\r\noath, and in very deed the sacrifice was slain, and the covenant\r\nwas ratified: why, then it would be blasphemous to imagine that He\r\nwould afterwards disannul it, and turn from His solemn pledge.\r\nThere is no going back on the part of God, and consequently His\r\nredemption will redeem, and in redeeming it will secure us all\r\nthings. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" With the\r\nblood-mark upon us we may well cease to fear. How can we perish?\r\nHow can we be deserted in the hour of need? We have been bought\r\nwith too great a price for our Redeemer to let us slip. Therefore,\r\nlet us march on with confidence, hearing our Redeemer say to us,\r\n"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and\r\nthrough the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou\r\nwalkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall\r\nthe flame kindle upon thee."

But it was not His face only, His\r\nwhole form was marred more than the sons of men. The contour of\r\nHis bodily manhood showed marks of singular assaults of sorrow,\r\nsuch as had never bowed another form so low.

I cannot\r\nconceive that He was deformed or ungainly; but despite His natural\r\ndignity, His worn and emaciated appearance marked Him out as "the\r\nMan of sorrows", and to the carnal eye His whole natural and\r\nspiritual form had in it nothing which evoked admiration; even as\r\nthe prophet said, "When we shall see Him, there is no beauty that\r\nwe should desire Him."

He was so sincere,\r\nso transparent, so child-like and true, that whatever stirred\r\nwithin Him was apparent to those about Him, so far as they were\r\ncapable of understanding His great soul. We read of Him that He\r\nwas "moved with compassion." The Greek word means that He\r\nexperienced a wonderful emotion of His whole nature, He was\r\nthrilled with it, and His disciples saw how deeply He felt for the\r\npeople, who were as sheep without a shepherd. Though He did not\r\ncommit Himself to men, He did not conceal Himself, but wore His\r\nheart upon His sleeve, and all could see what He was, and knew\r\nthat He was full of grace and truth. We are, therefore, not\r\nsurprised, when we devoutly consider our Lord\'s character, that\r\nHis visage and form should indicate the inward agonies of His\r\ntender spirit; it could not be that His face should be untrue to\r\nHis heart. The ploughers made deep furrows upon His soul as well\r\nas upon His back, and His heart was rent with inward convulsions,\r\nwhich could not but affect His whole appearance. Those eyes saw\r\nwhat those around Him could not see; those shoulders bore a\r\nconstant burden which others could not know; and, therefore, His\r\ncountenance and form betrayed the fact. O dear, dear Saviour, when\r\nwe think of Thee, and of Thy majesty and purity, we are again\r\nastonished that woes should come upon Thee so grievously as to mar\r\nThy visage and Thy form!\r\nNow think, dear friends, what were the causes of this\r\nmarring. It was not old age that had wrinkled His brow, for He was\r\nstill in the prime of life, neither was it a personal sickness\r\nwhich had caused decay; much less was it any congenital weakness\r\nand disease, which at length betrayed itself, for in His flesh\r\nthere was no possibility of impurity, which would, in death, have\r\nled to corruption. It was occasioned, first, by His constant\r\nsympathy with the suffering. There was a heavy wear and tear\r\noccasioned by the extraordinary compassion of His soul. In three\r\nyears it had told upon Him most manifestly, till His visage was\r\nmarred more than that of any other man. To Him there was a kind of\r\nsucking up into Himself of all the suffering of those whom He\r\nblessed. He always bore upon Him the burden of mortal woe. We read\r\nof Christ healing all that were sick, "that it might be fulfilled\r\nwhich was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our\r\ninfirmities, and bare our sicknesses." Yes, He took those\r\ninfirmities and sicknesses in some mystical way to Himself, just\r\nas I have heard of certain trees, which scatter health, because\r\nthey themselves imbibe the miasma, and draw up into themselves\r\nthose noxious vapours which otherwise would poison mankind. Thus,\r\nwithout being themselves polluted, they disinfect the atmosphere\r\naround them. This, our Saviour did, but the cost was great to Him.\r\nYou can imagine, living as He did in the midst of one vast\r\nhospital, how constantly He must have seen sights that grieved and\r\npained Him. Moreover, with a nature so pure and loving, He must\r\nhave been daily tortured with the sin, and hypocrisy, and\r\noppression which so abounded in His day. In a certain sense, He\r\nwas always laying down His life for men, for He was spent in their\r\nservice, tortured by their sin, and oppressed with their sorrow.\r\nThe more we look into that marred visage, the more shall we be\r\nastonished at the anguish which it indicated.\r\nDo not wonder that He was more marred than any man, for He\r\nwas more sensitive than other men. No part of Him was callous, He\r\nhad no seared conscience, no blunted sensibility, no drugged and\r\ndeadened nerve. His manhood was in its glory, in the perfection in\r\nwhich Adam was when God made him in His own image, and therefore\r\nHe was ill-housed in such a fallen world. We read of Christ that\r\nHe was "grieved for the hardness of their hearts," "He marvelled\r\nbecause of their unbelief," "He sighed deeply in His spirit," "He\r\ngroaned in the spirit, and was troubled." This, however, was only\r\nthe beginning of the marring.\r\nHis deepest griefs and most grievous marring came of ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"His\r\nsubstitutionary work"}),', while bearing the penalty of our sin. One\r\nword recalls much of His woe: it is, "Gethsemane."

He had\r\nwashed their feet, but they could not watch with Him one hour; and\r\nin that garden He wrestled with our deadly foe, till His sweat was\r\nas it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground, and as\r\nHart puts it, He--']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "Bore all Incarnate God could bear,\r\n With strength enough, but none to spare."\r\n\r\n I do verily believe that verse to be true.

He is not yet exalted\r\nand extolled in any of our hearts as He deserves to be. I would we\r\nloved Him a thousand times as much as we do, but our whole heart\r\ngoeth after Him, does it not? Would we not die for Him? Would we\r\nnot set Him on a throne as high as seven heavens, and then think\r\nthat we had not done enough for Him, who is now our all in all,\r\nand more than all?\r\nYou notice what is said, concerning the Christ, as the most\r\nastonishing thing of all: "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"So shall He sprinkle many nations"}),'."\r\nNow is it the glory of our risen Lord, at this moment, that His\r\nprecious blood is to save many nations. Before the throne, men of\r\nall nations shall sing, "Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us\r\nunto God by Thy blood." Not the English nation alone shall be\r\npurified by His atoning blood, but many nations shall He sprinkle\r\nwith His reconciling blood, even as Israel of old was sprinkled\r\nwith the blood of sacrifice. We read in the tenth chapter of the\r\nEpistle to the Hebrews, at the twenty-second verse, of "having our\r\nhearts sprinkled from an evil conscience," and this is effected by\r\nthat precious blood by which we have been once purged so\r\neffectually that we have no more consciousness of sins, but enter\r\ninto perfect peace. The blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes\r\nof an heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctified to the purifying\r\nof the flesh, and much more doth the blood of Christ purge our\r\nconscience from dead works, to serve the living God.\r\nThe sprinkling of the blood was meant also to confirm the\r\ncovenant: thus Moses "sprinkled both the book and all the people,\r\nsaying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined\r\nunto you." Our Lord Himself said, "This is My blood of the new\r\ncovenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins." But\r\nis it not a wonderful thing that He should die as a malefactor on\r\nthe tree, amid scorn and ridicule, and yet that He is this day\r\nbringing nations into covenant with God? Once so despised, and\r\nnow: so mighty! God has given Him "for a covenant of the people,\r\nfor a light of the Gentiles." Many nations shall by Him be joined\r\nin covenant with the God of the whole earth. Do not fall into the\r\nerroneous idea that this world is like a great ship-wrecked\r\nvessel, soon to go to pieces on an iron-bound coast; but rather\r\nlet us expect the conversion of the world to the Lord Jesus. As a\r\nreward for the travail of His soul, He shall cause many nations to\r\n"exult with joy", for so some read the passage; the peoples of the\r\nearth shall not only be astonished at His griefs, but they shall\r\nadmire His glories, adore His perfections, and be filled with an\r\namazement of joy at His coming and kingdom.

Strong were the indissoluble bands of\r\nlove which then united Jesus to the souls whom He determined to\r\nredeem. Not bars of brass, or triple steel, could have been more\r\nreal and effectual bonds. True love, of all things in the\r\nuniverse, has the greatest cementing force, and will bear the\r\ngreatest strain, and endure the heaviest pressure: who shall tell\r\nwhat trials the Saviour's love has borne; and how well it has\r\nsustained them? Never union was more true than this. As the soul\r\nof Jonathan was knit to the soul of David so that he loved David\r\nas his own soul, so was our glorious Lord united and joined to us\r\nby the ties of fervent, faithful love. Love has a most potent\r\npower in effecting and sustaining union, but never does it display\r\nits force so well as when we see it bringing the Creator into\r\noneness with the creature, the divine into alliance with the\r\nhuman.

As every heir of\r\nflesh and blood has a personal interest in Adam, because he is the\r\ncovenant head and representative of the race as considered under\r\nthe law of works; so, under the law of grace, every redeemed soul\r\nis one with the Lord from heaven, since He is the Second Adam, the\r\nSponsor and Substitute of the elect in the new covenant of love.\r\nThe apostle Paul declares that Levi was in the loins of Abraham\r\nwhen Melchizedek met him: it is equally true that the believer was\r\nin the loins of Jesus Christ, the Mediator, when in old eternity\r\nthe covenant settlements of grace were decreed, ratified, and made\r\nsure for ever. Thus, whatever Christ hath done, He hath wrought\r\nfor the whole body of His Church. We were crucified in Him, and\r\nburied with Him (read Col. ii. 10-13), and to make it still more\r\nwonderful, we are risen with Him, and have even ascended with Him\r\nto the seats on high (Eph. ii. 6).

Thus, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"He became one with\r\nus in our nature"}),', for in Holy Scripture all partakers of flesh\r\nand blood are regarded as of one family. By the fact of common\r\ndescent from Adam, all men are of one race, seeing that "God hath\r\nmade of one blood all nations that dwell upon the face of the\r\nearth." Hence, in the Bible, man is spoken of universally as "thy\r\nbrother" (Lev. xix. 17; Job xxii. 6; Matt. v. 23, 24; Luke xvii.\r\n3; Rom. xiv. 10, &c., &c.); and "thy neighbour" (Exod. xx. 16;\r\nLev. xix. 13-18; Matt. v. 43; Rom. xiii. 9; James ii. 8); to whom,\r\non account of nature and descent, we are required to render\r\nkindness and goodwill. Now, although our great Melchizedek in His\r\ndivinity is without father, without mother, without descent,\r\nhaving neither beginning of days nor end of life, and is both in\r\nessence and rank at an infinite remove from fallen manhood; yet as\r\nto His manhood He is to be reckoned as one of ourselves. He was\r\nborn of a woman, He hung upon her breasts, and was dandled upon\r\nher knee; He grew from infancy to youth and thence to manhood, and\r\nin every stage He was a true and real partaker of our humanity. He\r\nis as certainly of the race of Adam as He is divine. He is God\r\nwithout fiction or metaphor, and He is man beyond doubt or\r\ndispute. The Godhead was not humanized, and so diluted; and the\r\nmanhood was not transformed into divinity, and so rendered more\r\nthan human. Never was any man more a portion of His kind than was\r\nthe Son of man, the Man of sorrows and the Acquaintance of grief.\r\nHe is man\'s Brother, for He bore the whole nature of man. "The\r\nWord was made flesh, and dwelt among us." He who was very God of\r\nvery God made Himself a little lower than the angels, and took\r\nupon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of\r\nmen.\r\nThis was done with the most excellent design with regard to\r\nour redemption, inasmuch as it was necessary that, as ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"man"})," had\r\nsinned, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"man"}),' should suffer; but doubtless it had a further\r\nmotive, the honouring of the Church, and the enabling of her Lord\r\nto sympathize with her. The apostle most sweetly remarks,\r\n"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,\r\nHe also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death\r\nHe might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the\r\ndevil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their\r\nlifetime subject to bondage" (Heb. ii. 14, 15); and again, "For we\r\nhave not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling\r\nof our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are,\r\nyet without sin" (Heb. iv. 15). Thus, in ties of blood, Jesus, the\r\nSon of man, is one with all the heirs of heaven: "For which cause\r\nHe is not ashamed to call them brethren" (Heb. ii. 11). What\r\nreason we have here for the strongest consolation and delight,\r\nseeing that, "Both He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified\r\nare all of one." We can say of our Lord as poor Naomi said of\r\nbounteous Boaz, "The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next\r\nkinsmen." Overwhelmed by the liberality of our blessed Lord, we\r\nare often led to cry with Ruth, "Why have I found grace in thine\r\neyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a\r\nstranger?" and are we not ready to die with wonder when, in answer\r\nto such a question, He tells us that He is our Brother, bone of\r\nour bone, and flesh of our flesh?\r\nIf, in all our straits and distresses, we would always\r\ntreasure in our minds the remembrance of our Redeemer\'s manhood,\r\nwe should never bemoan the absence of a sympathizing heart, since\r\nwe should always have His abundant compassion for our consolation.\r\nHe is no stranger, He is able to enter into the heart\'s\r\nbitterness, for He has Himself tasted the wormwood and the gall.\r\nLet us never doubt His power to sympathize with us in our\r\ninfirmities and sorrows.\r\nThere is one aspect of this subject of our natural union to\r\nChrist which it were improper to pass over in silence, for it is\r\nvery precious to the believer. While the Lord Jesus takes upon\r\nHimself our nature (2 Peter i. 4), He restores in us that image of\r\nGod (Gen. i. 27) which was blotted and defaced by the fall of\r\nAdam. He raises us from the degradation of sin to the dignity of\r\nperfection. So that, in a two-fold sense, the Head and members are\r\nof one nature, and not like that monstrous image which\r\nNebuchadnezzar saw in his dream. The head was of fine gold, but\r\nthe belly and the thighs were of brass, the legs of iron, and the\r\nfeet, part of iron and part of clay. Christ\'s mystical body is no\r\nabsurd combination of opposites; the Head is immortal, and the\r\nbody is immortal, too, for thus the record stands, "Because I\r\nlive, ye shall live also." "As is the heavenly, such are they also\r\nthat are heavenly." "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we\r\nshall also bear the image of the heavenly:" and this shall in a\r\nfew more years be more fully manifest to us, for "this corruptible\r\nmust put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on\r\nimmortality."

There are periods when\r\nJesus gives us a heavenly Elysium of rest; we cannot describe the\r\ndivine repose of our hearts at such times. We read, in the\r\nGospels, that when Jesus hushed the storm, "there was a great\r\ncalm," not simply "a calm", but a great calm, unusual, absolute,\r\nperfect, memorable. It reminds us of the stillness which John\r\ndescribes in the Revelation: "I saw four angels standing on the\r\nfour corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,\r\nthat the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on\r\nany tree;" not a ripple stirred the waters, not a leaf moved on\r\nthe trees.\r\nAssuredly, our Lord has given a blessed rest to those who\r\ntrust Him, and follow Him. They are often unable to inform others\r\nas to their deep peace, and the reasons upon which it is founded;\r\nbut they know it, and it brings them an inward wealth compared\r\nwith which the fortune of an ungodly millionaire is poverty\r\nitself.

I will give only one more answer to\r\nthe question, "Why should we have this rest?" ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"It will prepare us\r\nfor heaven"}),'. I was reading a book, the other day, in which I met\r\nwith this expression,--"The streets of heaven begin on earth."\r\nThat is true; heaven is not so far away as some people think.\r\nHeaven is the place of perfect holiness, the place of sinless\r\nservice, the place of eternal glory; and there is nothing that\r\nwill prepare us for heaven like this rest that Jesus gives. Heaven\r\nmust be in us before we are in heaven; and he who has this rest\r\nhas heaven begun below. Enoch was virtually in heaven while he\r\nwalked with God on the earth, and he had only to continue that\r\nholy walk to find himself actually in heaven.

Let us keep on coming to\r\nHim, as the apostle says, "to whom coming," continually coming,\r\nand never going away. When we wake in the morning, let us come to\r\nChrist in the act of renewed communion with Him; all the day long,\r\nlet us keep on coming to Him even while we are occupied with the\r\naffairs of this life; and at night, let our last waking moments be\r\nspent in coming to Jesus.

"Take My yoke\r\nupon you, . . . and ye shall find rest unto your souls." Christ\r\nbids us wear ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"His"})," yoke; not make one for ourselves.

But no; that brave\r\nheart will sing "an hymn." Our glorious Jesus plays the man beyond\r\nall other men. Boldest of the sons of men, He quails not in the\r\nhour of battle, but tunes His voice to loftiest psalmody. The\r\ngenius of that Christianity of which Jesus is the Head and\r\nFounder, its object, spirit, and design, are happiness and joy,\r\nand they who receive it are able to sing in the very jaws of\r\ndeath.\r\nThis remark, however, is quite a secondary one to the next:\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"our Lord's complete fulfilment of the law is even more worthy of\r\nour attention"}),'. It was customary, when the Passover was held, to\r\nsing, and this is the main reason why the Saviour did so. During\r\nthe Passover, it was usual to sing the hundred and thirteenth, and\r\nfive following Psalms, which were called the "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Hallel"}),'." The first\r\ncommences, you will observe, in our version, with "Praise ye the\r\nLord!" or, "Hallelujah!" The hundred and fifteenth, and the three\r\nfollowing, were usually sung as the closing song of the Passover.\r\nNow, our Saviour would not diminish the splendour of the great\r\nJewish rite, although it was the last time that He would celebrate\r\nit. No; there shall be the holy beauty and delight of psalmody;\r\nnone of it shall be stinted; the "Hallel" shall be full and\r\ncomplete. We may safely believe that the Saviour sang through, or\r\nprobably chanted, the whole of these six Psalms; and my heart\r\ntells me that there was no one at the table who sang more devoutly\r\nor more cheerfully than did our blessed Lord. There are some parts\r\nof the hundred and eighteenth Psalm, especially, which strike us\r\nas having sounded singularly grand, as they flowed from His\r\nblessed lips. Note verses 22, 23, 24. Particularly observe those\r\nwords, near the end of the Psalm, and think you hear the Lord\r\nHimself singing them, "God is the Lord, which hath shewed us\r\nlight: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the\r\naltar. Thou art my God, and I will praise Thee: Thou art my God, I\r\nwill exalt Thee. O give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good: for\r\nHis mercy endureth for ever."\r\nBecause, then, it was the settled custom of Israel to recite\r\nor sing these Psalms, our Lord Jesus Christ did the same; for He\r\nwould leave nothing unfinished. Just as, when He went down into\r\nthe waters of baptism, He said, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all\r\nrighteousness," so He seemed to say, when sitting at the table,\r\n"Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness; therefore let us\r\nsing unto the Lord, as God\'s, people in past ages have done."\r\nBeloved, let us view with holy wonder the strictness of the\r\nSaviour\'s obedience to His Father\'s will, and let us endeavour to\r\nfollow in His steps, in all things, seeking to be obedient to the\r\nLord\'s Word in the little matters as well as in the great ones.\r\nMay we not venture to suggest another and deeper reason? Did\r\nnot the singing of "an hymn" at the supper show ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the holy\r\nabsorption of the Saviour's soul in His Father's will?"}),' If,\r\nbeloved, you knew that at--say ten o\'clock to-night--you would be\r\nled away to be mocked, and despised, and scourged, and that to-\r\nmorrow\'s sun would see you falsely accused, hanging, a convicted\r\ncriminal, to die upon a cross, do you think that you could sing\r\ntonight, after your last meal? I am sure you could not, unless\r\nwith more than earth born courage and resignation your soul could\r\nsay, "Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the\r\naltar." You would sing if your spirit were like the Saviour\'s\r\nspirit; if, like Him, you could exclaim, "Not as I will, but as\r\nThou wilt;" but if there should remain in you any selfishness, any\r\ndesire to be spared the bitterness of death, you would not be able\r\nto chant the "Hallel" with the Master. Blessed Jesus, how wholly\r\nwert Thou given up! how perfectly consecrated! so that, whereas\r\nother men sing when they are marching to their joys, Thou didst\r\nsing on the way to death; whereas other men lift up their cheerful\r\nvoices when honour awaits them, Thou hadst a brave and holy sonnet\r\non Thy lips when shame, and spitting, and death were to be Thy\r\nportion.\r\nThis singing of the Saviour also teaches us ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the whole-\r\nheartedness of the Master in the work which He was about to do"}),'.\r\nThe patriot-warrior sings as he hastens to battle; to the strains\r\nof martial music he advances to meet the foeman; and even thus the\r\nheart of our all-glorious Champion supplies Him with song even in\r\nthe dreadful hour of His solitary agony.

He has a baptism to be baptized\r\nwith, and He is straitened until it be accomplished.

We will now consider the singing of the disciples. ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"They"}),'\r\nunited in the "Hallel"--like true Jews, they joined in the\r\nnational song. Israel had good cause to sing at the Passover, for\r\nGod had wrought for His people what He had done for no other\r\nnation on the face of the earth. Every Hebrew must have felt his\r\nsoul elevated and rejoiced on the Paschal night. He was "a citizen\r\nof no mean city", and the pedigree which he could look back upon\r\nwas one, compared with which kings and princes were but of\r\nyesterday.\r\nRemembering the fact commemorated by the Paschal supper,\r\nIsrael might well rejoice. They sang of their nation in bondage,\r\ntrodden beneath the tyrannical foot of Pharaoh; they began the\r\nPsalm right sorrowfully, as they thought of the bricks made\r\nwithout straw, and of the iron furnace; but the strain soon\r\nmounted from the deep bass, and began to climb the scale, as they\r\nsang of Moses the servant of God, and of the Lord appearing to him\r\nin the burning bush. They remembered the mystic rod, which became\r\na serpent, and which swallowed up the rods of the magicians; their\r\nmusic told of the plagues and wonders which God had wrought upon\r\nZoan; and of that dread night when the first-born of Egypt fell\r\nbefore the avenging sword of the angel of death, while they\r\nthemselves, feeding on the lamb which had been slain for them, and\r\nwhose blood was sprinkled upon the lintel and upon the side-posts\r\nof the door, had been graciously preserved. Then the song went up\r\nconcerning the hour in which all Egypt was humbled at the feet of\r\nJehovah, whilst as for His people, He led them forth like sheep,\r\nby the hand of Moses and Aaron, and they went by the way of the\r\nsea, even of the Red Sea. The strain rose higher still as they\r\ntuned the song of Moses, the servant of God, and of the Lamb.\r\nJubilantly they sang of the Red Sea, and of the chariots of\r\nPharaoh which went down into the midst thereof, and the depths\r\ncovered them till there was not one of them left. It was a\r\nglorious chant indeed when they sang of Rahab cut in pieces, and\r\nof the dragon wounded at the sea, by the right hand of the Most\r\nHigh, for the deliverance of the chosen people.\r\nBut, beloved, if I have said that Israel could so properly\r\nsing, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"what shall I say of those of us who are the Lord's\r\nspiritually redeemed?"}),' We have been emancipated from a slavery\r\nworse than that of Egypt: "with a high hand and with an\r\noutstretched arm," hath God delivered us. The blood of Jesus\r\nChrist, the Lamb of God\'s Passover, has been sprinkled on our\r\nhearts and consciences. By faith we keep the Passover, for we have\r\nbeen spared; we have been brought out of Egypt; and though our\r\nsins did once oppose us, they have all been drowned in the Red Sea\r\nof the atoning blood of Jesus: "the depths have covered them,\r\nthere is not one of them left." If the Jew could sing a "great\r\nHallel", our "Hallel" ought to be more glowing still; and if every\r\nhouse in "Judea\'s happy land" was full of music when the people\r\nate the Paschal feast, much more reason have we for filling every\r\nheart with sacred harmony tonight, while we feast upon Jesus\r\nChrist, who was slain, and has redeemed us to God by His blood.\r\nIII. The time has now come for me to say how earnestly I\r\ndesire you to "sing an hymn."\r\nI do not mean to ask you to use your voices, but let your\r\nhearts be brimming with the essence of praise. Whenever we repair\r\nto the Lord\'s table, which represents to us the Passover, we ought\r\nnot to come to it as to a funeral. Let us select solemn hymns, but\r\nnot dirges. Let us sing softly, but none the less joyfully. These\r\nare no burial feasts; those are not funeral cakes which lie upon\r\nthis table, and yonder fair white linen cloth is no winding-sheet.\r\n"This is My body," said Jesus, but the body so represented was no\r\ncorpse, we feed upon a living Christ. The blood set forth by\r\nyonder wine is the fresh life-blood of our immortal King. We view\r\nnot our Lord\'s body as clay-cold flesh, pierced with wounds, but\r\nas glorified at the right hand of the Father. We hold a happy\r\nfestival when we break bread on the first day of the week. We come\r\nnot hither trembling like bondsmen, cringing on our knees as\r\nwretched serfs condemned to eat on their knees; we approach as\r\nfreemen to our Lord\'s banquet, like His apostles, to recline at\r\nlength or sit at ease; not merely to eat bread which may belong to\r\nthe most sorrowful, but to drink wine which belongs to men whose\r\nsouls are glad. Let us recognize the rightness, yea, the duty of\r\ncheerfulness at this commemorative supper; and, therefore, let us\r\n"sing an hymn."\r\nBeing satisfied on this point, perhaps you ask, "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"What hymn\r\nshall we sing?"}),'" Many sorts of hymns were sung in the olden time:\r\nlook down the list, and you will scarcely find one which may not\r\nsuit us now.\r\nOne of the earliest of earthly songs was ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the war-song"}),'.

Even thus of old did the\r\npeople of God extol Him for His mighty acts, singing aloud with\r\nthe high-sounding cymbals: "Sing unto the Lord, for He hath\r\ntriumphed gloriously . . .

"He was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a\r\npillow."\r\nHe had ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"perfect confidence in God"})," that all was well. The\r\nwaves might roar, the winds might rage, but He was not at all\r\ndisquieted by their fury. He knew that the waters were in the\r\nhollow of His Father's hand, and that every wind was but the\r\nbreath of His Father's mouth; and so He was not troubled; nay, He\r\nhad not even a careful thought, He was as much at ease as on a\r\nsunny day. His mind and heart were free from every kind of care,\r\nfor amid the gathering tempest He deliberately laid Himself down,\r\nand slept like a weary child. He went to the hinder part of the\r\nship, most out of the gash of the spray; He took a pillow, and put\r\nit under His head, and with fixed intent disposed Himself to\r\nslumber. It was His own act and deed to go to sleep in the storm;\r\nHe had nothing for which to keep awake, so pure and perfect was\r\nHis confidence in the great Father. What an example this is to us!\r\nWe have not half the confidence in God that we ought to have, not\r\neven the best of us.

He did not doubt that He was the\r\nSon of the Highest. I may not question God\'s power to deliver, but\r\nI may sometimes question my right to expect deliverance; and if\r\nso, my comfort vanishes. Our Lord had no doubts of this kind. He\r\nhad long before heard that word, "This is My beloved Son, in whom\r\nI am well pleased;" He had so lived and walked with God that the\r\nwitness within Him was continuous, so He had no question about the\r\nFather\'s love to Him as His own Son.

The devil knows that, and therefore\r\nhe will come to us with his insinuating suggestion, "If thou be\r\nthe son of God." If we have the Spirit of adoption in us, we shall\r\nput the accuser to rout at once, by opposing the Witness within to\r\nhis question from without.

He takes no watch, He makes no fret; but He\r\ngoes to sleep. Whatever comes, He has left all in the hands of the\r\ngreat Caretaker; and what more is needful? If a watchman were set\r\nto guard my house, I should be foolish if I also sat up for fear\r\nof thieves. Why have a watchman if I cannot trust him to watch?\r\n"Cast thy burden upon the Lord;" but when thou hast done so, leave\r\nit with the Lord, and do not try to carry it thyself. That is to\r\nmake a mock of God, to have the name of God, but not the reality,\r\nof God. Lay down every care, even as Jesus did when He went calmly\r\nto the hinder part of the ship, and quietly took a pillow, and\r\nwent to sleep.\r\nBut I think I hear someone say, "I could do that if mine were\r\nsolely care about myself." Yes, perhaps you could; and yet you\r\ncannot cast upon God your burden of care about your children. But\r\nyour Lord trusted the Father with those dear to Him. Do you not\r\nthink that Christ\'s disciples were as precious to Him as our\r\nchildren are to us? If that ship had been wrecked, what would have\r\nbecome of Peter? What would have become of "that disciple whom\r\nJesus loved"? Our Lord regarded with intense affection those whom\r\nHe had chosen and called, and who had been with Him in His\r\ntemptation, yet He was quite content to leave them all in the care\r\nof His Father, and go to sleep.\r\nYou answer, "Yes, but there is a still wider circle of people\r\nwatching to see what will happen to me, and to the cause of Christ\r\nwith which I am connected. I am obliged to care, whether I will or\r\nno." Is your case, then, more trying than your Lord\'s? Do you\r\nforget that "there were also with Him many other little ships"?\r\nWhen the storm was tossing His barque, their little ships were\r\neven more in jeopardy; and He cared for them all. He was the Lord\r\nHigh Admiral of the Lake of Gennesaret that night. The other ships\r\nwere a fleet under His convoy, and His great heart went out to\r\nthem all. Yet He went to sleep, because He had left in His\r\nFather\'s care even the solicitudes of His charity and sympathy.\r\nWe, my brethren, who are much weaker than He, shall find strength\r\nin doing the same.\r\nHaving left everything with His Father, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"our Lord did the\r\nvery wisest thing possible"}),'. He did just what the hour demanded.\r\n"Why," say you, "He went to sleep!" That was the best thing Jesus\r\ncould do; and sometimes it is the best thing we can do. Christ was\r\nweary and worn; and when anyone is exhausted, it is his duty to go\r\nto sleep if he can. The Saviour must be up again in the morning,\r\npreaching and working miracles, and if He does not sleep, He will\r\nnot be fit for His holy duty; it is incumbent upon Him to keep\r\nHimself in trim for His service. Knowing that the time to sleep\r\nhas come, the Lord sleeps, and does well in sleeping. Often, when\r\nwe have been fretting and worrying, we should have glorified God\r\nfar more had we literally gone to sleep. To glorify God by sleep\r\nis not so difficult as some might think; at least, to our Lord it\r\nwas natural. Here you are worried, sad, wearied; the doctor\r\nprescribes for you; his medicine does you no good; but oh! if you\r\nenter into full peace with God, and go to sleep, you will wake up\r\ninfinitely more refreshed than by any drug. The sleep which the\r\nLord giveth to His beloved is balmy indeed. Seek it as Jesus\r\nsought it. Go to bed, brother, and you will better imitate your\r\nLord than by putting yourself into ill humour, and worrying other\r\npeople.\r\nThere is a spiritual sleep in which we ought to imitate\r\nJesus. How often I have worried my poor brain about my great\r\nchurch, until I have come to my senses, and then I have said to\r\nmyself, "How foolish you are! Can you not depend upon God? Is it\r\nnot far more His cause than yours?" Then I have taken my load in\r\nprayer, and left it with the Lord. I have said, "In God\'s name,\r\nthis matter shall never worry me again," and I have left my urgent\r\ncare with Him, and ended it for ever. I have so deliberately given\r\nup many a trying case into the Lord\'s care that, when any of my\r\nfriends have said to me, "What about so and so?" I have simply\r\nanswered, "I do not know, and I am no longer careful to know. The\r\nLord will interpose in some way or other, but I will trouble no\r\nmore about it." No mischief has ever come through any matter which\r\nI have left in the divine keeping. The staying of my hand has been\r\nwisdom. "Stand still, and see the salvation of God," is God\'s own\r\nprecept. Here let us follow Jesus. Having a child\'s confidence in\r\nthe great Father, He retires to the stern of the ship, selects a\r\npillow, deliberately lies down upon it, and goes to sleep; and\r\nthough the ship is filling with water, and rolls and pitches, He\r\nsleeps on. Nothing can break the peace of His tranquil soul. Every\r\nsailor on board reels to and fro, and staggers like a drunken man,\r\nand is at his wits\' end; but Jesus is neither at his wits\' end,\r\nnor does He stagger, for He rests in perfect innocence, and\r\nundisturbed confidence. His heart is happy in God, and therefore\r\ndoth He remain in repose. Oh, for grace to copy Him!\r\nII. But here notice, dear friends, The difference between the\r\nMaster and His disciples; for while He was in a great calm, they\r\nwere in a great storm. Here see their failure. They were just as\r\nwe are, and we are often just as they were.\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"They gave way to fear"}),". They were sorely afraid that the\r\nship would sink, and that they would all perish. In thus yielding\r\nto fear, _they forgot the solid reasons for courage which lay near\r\nat hand; _for, in truth, they were safe enough. Christ is on board\r\nthat vessel, and if the ship goes down, He will sink with them.\r\nThe heathen mariner took courage during a storm from the fact that\r\nCaesar was on board the ship that was tossed by stormy winds; and\r\nshould not the disciples feel secure with Jesus on board? Fear\r\nnot, ye carry Jesus and His cause! Jesus had come to do a work,\r\nand His disciples might have known that He could not perish with\r\nthat work unaccomplished. Could they not trust Him? They had seen\r\nHim multiply the loaves and fishes, and cast out devils, and heal\r\nall manner of sicknesses; could they not trust Him to still the\r\nstorm? Unreasonable unbelief! Faith in God is true prudence, but\r\nto doubt God is irrational. It is the height of absurdity and\r\nfolly to question omnipotent love.\r\nAnd ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the disciples were so unwise as to do the Master a very\r\nill turn"}),'. He was sadly weary, and sorely needed sleep; but they\r\nhastened to Him, and aroused Him in a somewhat rough and\r\nirreverent manner. They were slow to do so, but their fear urged\r\nthem; and therefore they awoke Him, uttering ungenerous and\r\nunloving words: "Master, carest Thou not that we perish?" Shame on\r\nthe lips that asked so harsh a question! Did they not upon\r\nreflection greatly blame themselves? He had given them no cause\r\nfor such hard speeches; and, moreover, it was unseemly in them to\r\ncall Him "Master," and then to ask Him, "Carest Thou not that we\r\nperish?" Is He to be accused of such hard-heartednesses to let His\r\nfaithful disciples perish when He has power to deliver them? Alas,\r\nwe, too, have been guilty of like offences! I think I have known\r\nsome of Christ\'s disciples who have appeared to doubt the wisdom\r\nor the love of their Lord. They did not quite say that He was\r\nmistaken, but they said that He moved in a mysterious way; they\r\ndid not quite complain that He was unkind to them, but they\r\nwhispered that they could not reconcile His dealings with His\r\ninfinite love. Alas, Jesus has endured much from our unbelief! May\r\nthis picture help us to see our spots, and may the love of our\r\ndear Lord remove them!\r\nIII. I have spoken to you of the Master\'s calm and of the\r\ndisciples\' failure; now let us think of the great calm which Jesus\r\ncreated. "There was a great calm."\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"His voice produced it"}),". They say that if oil be poured upon\r\nthe waters they will become smooth, and I suppose there is ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"some"}),"\r\ntruth in the statement; but there is all truth in this, that if\r\nGod speaks, the storm subsides into a calm, so that the waves of\r\nthe sea are still. It only needs our Lord Jesus to speak in the\r\nheart of any one of us, and immediately the peace of God, which\r\npasseth all understanding, will possess us. No matter how drear\r\nyour despondency, nor how dread your despair, the Lord can at once\r\ncreate a great calm of confidence. What a door of hope this opens\r\nto any who are in trouble! If I could speak a poor man rich, and a\r\nsick one well, I am sure I would do so at once; but Jesus is\r\ninfinitely better than I am, and therefore I know that He will\r\nspeak peace to the tried and troubled heart.\r\nNote, too, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"that this calm came at once"}),'. "Jesus arose, and\r\nrebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the\r\nwind ceased, and there was a great calm." As soon as Jesus spoke,\r\nall was quiet. I have met with a very large number of persons in\r\ntrouble of mind, and I have seen a few who have slowly come out\r\ninto light and liberty; but more frequently deliverance has come\r\nsuddenly. The iron gate has opened of its own accord, and the\r\nprisoner has stepped into immediate freedom. "The snare is broken,\r\nand we are escaped." What a joy it is to know that rest is so near\r\neven when the tempest rages most furiously!\r\nNote, also, that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the Saviour coupled this repose with\r\nfaith"}),', for He said to the disciples as soon as the calm came,\r\n"Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?" Faith\r\nand the calm go together. If thou believest, thou shalt rest; if\r\nthou wilt but cast thyself upon thy God, surrendering absolutely\r\nto His will, thou shalt have mercy, and joy, and light. Even if we\r\nhave no faith, the Lord will sometimes give us the blessing that\r\nwe need, for He delights to do more for us than we have any right\r\nto expect of Him; but usually the rule of His kingdom is,\r\n"According to your faith be it unto you."\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"This great calm is very delightful"}),', and concerning this I\r\ndesire to bear my personal testimony. I speak from my own\r\nknowledge when I say that it passeth all understanding. I was\r\nsitting, the other night, meditating on God\'s mercy and love, when\r\nsuddenly I found in my own heart a most delightful sense of\r\nperfect peace. I had come to Beulah-land, where the sun shines\r\nwithout a cloud. "There was a great calm." I felt as mariners\r\nmight do who have been tossed about in broken water, and all on a\r\nsudden, they cannot tell why, the ocean becomes as unruffled as a\r\nmirror, and the sea-birds come and sit in happy circles upon the\r\nwater. I felt perfectly content, yea, undividedly happy. Not a\r\nwave of trouble broke upon the shore of my heart, and even far out\r\nto sea in the deeps of my being all was still. I knew no\r\nungratified wish, no unsatisfied desire. I could not discover a\r\nreason for uneasiness, or a motive for fear. There was nothing\r\napproaching to fanaticism in my feelings, nothing even of\r\nexcitement: my soul was waiting upon God, and delighting herself\r\nalone in Him. Oh, the blessedness of this rest in the Lord! What\r\nan Elysium it is! I must be allowed to say a little upon this\r\npurple island in the sea of my life: it was none other than a\r\nfragment of heaven. We often talk about our great spiritual\r\nstorms, why should we not speak of our great calms? If ever we get\r\ninto trouble, what a noise we make of it! Why should we not sing\r\nof our deliverances?\r\nLet us survey our mercies. Every sin that we have ever\r\ncommitted is forgiven. "The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,\r\ncleanseth us from all sin." The power of sin within us is broken;\r\nit "shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law\r\nbut under grace." Satan is a vanquished enemy; the world is\r\novercome by our Lord Jesus, and death is abolished by Him. All\r\nprovidence works for our good. Eternity has no threat for us, it\r\nbears within its mysteries nothing but immortality and glory.\r\nNothing can harm us. The Lord is our shield, and our exceeding\r\ngreat reward. Wherefore, then, should we fear? The Lord of hosts\r\nis with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge. To the believer, peace\r\nis no presumption: he is warranted in enjoying "perfect peace"--a\r\nquiet which is deep, and founded on truth, which encompasses all\r\nthings, and is not broken by any of the ten thousand disturbing\r\ncauses which otherwise might prevent our rest. "Thou wilt keep him\r\nin perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee; because he trusteth\r\nin Thee." Oh, to get into that calm, and remain in it till we come\r\nto that world where there is no more sea!\r\nA calm like that which ruled within our Saviour should we be\r\nhappy enough to attain to it, will give us in our measure the\r\npower to make outside matters calm. He that hath peace can make\r\npeace. We cannot work miracles, and yet the works which Jesus did\r\nshall we do also. Sleeping His sleep, we shall awake in His rested\r\nenergy, and treat the winds and waves as things subject to the\r\npower of faith, and therefore to be commanded into quiet. We shall\r\nspeak so as to console others: our calm shall work marvels in the\r\nlittle ships whereof others are captains. We, too, shall say,\r\n"Peace! Be still." Our confidence shall prove contagious, and the\r\ntimid shall grow brave: our tender love shall spread itself, and\r\nthe contentious shall cool down to patience. Only the matter must\r\nbegin within ourselves. We cannot create a calm till we are in a\r\ncalm. It is easier to rule the elements than to govern the\r\nunruliness of our wayward nature. When grace has made us masters\r\nof our fears, so that we can take a pillow and fall asleep amid\r\nthe hurricane, the fury of the tempest is over.

He might have looked upon the great mass, and have said,\r\n"What is the chaff to the wheat?" for here it was piled up upon\r\nthe threshing-floor, heap upon heap; and yet, after His decease,\r\nHis disciples might have been counted by a few scores, for those\r\nwho had spiritually received Him were but few. Many were called,\r\nbut few were chosen. Yet, wherever one was blessed, our Saviour\r\ntook note of it; it touched a chord in His soul. He never could be\r\nunaware when virtue had gone out of Him to heal a sick one, or\r\nwhen power had gone forth with His ministry to save a sinful one.\r\nOf all the crowd that gathered round the Saviour upon the day of\r\nwhich our text speaks, I find nothing said about one of them\r\nexcept this solitary "somebody" who had touched Him. The crowd\r\ncame, and the crowd went; but little is recorded of it all. Just\r\nas the ocean, having advanced to full tide, leaves but little\r\nbehind it when it retires again to its channel, so the vast\r\nmultitude around the Saviour left only this one precious deposit--\r\none "somebody" who had touched Him, and had received virtue from\r\nHim.\r\nAh, my Master, it may be so again this evening! These Sabbath\r\nmornings, and these Sabbath evenings, the crowds come pouring in\r\nlike a mighty ocean, filling this house, and then they all retire\r\nagain; only here and there is a "somebody" left weeping for sin, a\r\n"somebody" left rejoicing in Christ, a "somebody" who can say, "I\r\nhave touched the hem of His garment, and I have been made whole."\r\nThe whole of my other hearers are not worth the "somebodies." The\r\nmany of you are not worth the few, for the many are the pebbles,\r\nand the few are the diamonds; the many are the heaps of husks, and\r\nthe few are the precious grains. May God find them out at this\r\nhour, and His shall be all the praise!\r\nJesus said, "Somebody hath touched Me," from which we observe\r\nthat, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"in the use of means and ordinances, we should never be\r\nsatisfied unless we get into personal contact with Christ"}),", so\r\nthat we touch Him, as this woman touched His garment. Secondly,\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"if we can get into such personal contact, we shall have a bless-\r\ning:"}),' "I perceive that virtue is gone out of Me;" and, thirdly,\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"if we do get a blessing, Christ will know it;"}),' however obscure\r\nour case may be, He will know it, and He will have us let others\r\nknow it; He will speak, and ask such questions as will draw us\r\nout, and manifest us to the world.\r\nI. First, then, in the use of all means and ordinances, let\r\nit be our chief aim and object to come into personal contact with\r\nthe Lord Jesus Christ.\r\nPeter said, "The multitude throng Thee, and press Thee," and\r\nthat is true of the multitude to this very day; but of those who\r\ncome where Christ is in the assembly of His saints, a large\r\nproportion only come because it is their custom to do so. Perhaps\r\nthey hardly know why they go to a place of worship. They go\r\nbecause they always did go, and they think it wrong not to go.\r\nThey are just like the doors which swing upon their hinges; they\r\ntake no interest in what is done, at least only in the exterior\r\nparts of the service; into the heart and soul of the business they\r\ndo not enter, and cannot enter. They are glad if the sermon is\r\nrather short, there is so much the less tedium for them. They are\r\nglad if they can look around and gaze at the congregation, they\r\nfind in that something to interest them; but getting near to the\r\nLord Jesus is not the business they come upon. They have not\r\nlooked at it in that light. They come and they go; they come and\r\nthey go; and it will be so till, by-and-by, they will come for the\r\nlast time, and they will find out in the next world that the means\r\nof grace were not instituted to be matters of custom, and that to\r\nhave heard Jesus Christ preached, and to have rejected Him, is no\r\ntrifle, but a solemn thing for which they will have to answer in\r\nthe presence of the great Judge of all the earth.\r\nOthers there are who come to the house of prayer, and try to\r\nenter into the service, and do so in a certain fashion; but it is\r\nonly self-righteously or professionally. They may come to the\r\nLord\'s table; perhaps they attend to baptism; they may even join\r\nthe church. They are baptized, yet not by the Holy Spirit; they\r\ntake the Lord\'s supper, but they take not the Lord Himself; they\r\neat the bread, but they never eat His flesh; they drink the wine,\r\nbut they never drink His blood; they have been buried in the pool,\r\nbut they have never been buried with Christ in baptism, nor have\r\nthey risen again with Him into newness of life. To them, to read,\r\nto sing, to kneel, to hear, and so on, are enough. They are\r\ncontent with the shell, but the blessed spiritual kernel, the true\r\nmarrow and fatness, these they know nothing of. These are the\r\nmany, go into what church or meeting-house you please. They are in\r\nthe press around Jesus, but they do not touch Him. They come, but\r\nthey come not into contact with Jesus. They are outward, external\r\nhearers only, but there is no inward touching of the blessed\r\nperson of Christ, no mysterious contact with the ever-blessed\r\nSaviour, no stream of life and love flowing from Him to them. It\r\nis all mechanical religion. Of vital godliness, they know nothing.\r\nBut, "somebody," said Christ, "somebody hath touched Me," and\r\nthat is the soul of the matter. O my hearer, when you are in\r\nprayer alone, never be satisfied with having prayed; do not give\r\nit up till you have touched Christ in prayer; or, if you have not\r\ngot to Him, at any rate sigh and cry until you do! Do not think\r\nyou have prayed, but try again. When you come to public worship, I\r\nbeseech you, rest not satisfied with listening to the sermon, and\r\nso on, as you all do with sufficient attention; to that I bear you\r\nwitness;--but do not be content unless you get at Christ the\r\nMaster, and touch Him. At all times when you come to the communion\r\ntable, count it to have been no ordinance of grace to you unless\r\nyou have gone right through the veil into Christ\'s own arms, or at\r\nleast have touched His garment, feeling that the first object, the\r\nlife and soul of the means of grace, is to touch Jesus Christ\r\nHimself; and except "somebody" hath touched Him, the whole has\r\nbeen a mere dead performance, without life or power.\r\nThe woman in our text was not only amongst those who were in\r\nthe crowd, but she touched Jesus; and therefore, beloved, let me\r\nhold her up to your example in some respects, though I would to\r\nGod that in other respects you might excel her.\r\nNote, first, she felt that it was of no use being in the\r\ncrowd, of no use to be in the same street with Christ, or near to\r\nthe place where Christ was, but ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"she must get at Him; she must\r\ntouch Him"}),". She touched Him, you will notice, under ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"many\r\ndifficulties"}),'. There was a great crowd. She was a woman. She was\r\nalso a woman enfeebled by a long disease which had drained her\r\nconstitution, and left her more fit to be upon a bed than to be\r\nstruggling in the seething tumult. Yet, notwithstanding that, so\r\nintense was her desire, that she urged on her way, I doubt not\r\nwith many a bruise, and many an uncouth push, and at last, poor\r\ntrembler as she was, she got near to the Lord. Beloved, it is not\r\nalways easy to get at Jesus. It is very easy to kneel down to\r\npray, but not so easy to reach Christ in prayer. There is a child\r\ncrying, it is your own, and its noise has often hindered you when\r\nyou were striving to approach Jesus; or a knock will come at the\r\ndoor when you most wish to be retired. When you are sitting in the\r\nhouse of God, your neighbour in the seat before you may\r\nunconsciously distract your attention. It is not easy to draw near\r\nto Christ, especially coming as some of you do right away from the\r\ncounting-house, and from the workshop, with a thousand thoughts\r\nand cares about you. You cannot always unload your burden outside,\r\nand come in here with your hearts prepared to receive the gospel.\r\nAh! it is a terrible fight sometimes, a real foot-to-foot fight\r\nwith evil, with temptation, and I know not what. But, beloved, do\r\nfight it out, do fight it out; do not let your seasons for prayer\r\nbe wasted, nor your times for hearing be thrown away; but, like\r\nthis woman, be resolved, with all your feebleness, that you will\r\nlay hold upon Christ. And oh! if you be resolved about it, if you\r\ncannot get to Him, He will come to you, and sometimes, when you\r\nare struggling against unbelieving thoughts, He will turn and say,\r\n"Make room for that poor feeble one, that she may come to Me, for\r\nMy desire is to the work of My own hands; let her come to Me, and\r\nlet her desire be granted to her."\r\nObserve, again, that this woman touched Jesus ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"very\r\nsecretly"}),'. Perhaps there is a dear sister here who is getting near\r\nto Christ at this very moment, and yet her face does not betray\r\nher. It is so little contact that she has gained with Christ that\r\nthe joyous flush, and the sparkle of the eye, which we often see\r\nin the child of God, have not yet come to her. She is sitting in\r\nyonder obscure corner, or standing in this aisle, but though her\r\ntouch is secret, it is true. Though she cannot tell another of it,\r\nyet it is accomplished. She has touched Jesus. Beloved, that is\r\nnot always the nearest fellowship with Christ of which we talk the\r\nmost. Deep waters are still. Nay, I am not sure but what we\r\nsometimes get nearer to Christ when we think we are at a distance\r\nthan we do when we imagine we are near Him, for we are not always\r\nexactly the best judges of our own spiritual state, and we may be\r\nvery close to the Master, and yet for all that we may be so\r\nanxious to get closer that we may feel dissatisfied with the\r\nmeasure of grace which we have already received. To be satisfied\r\nwith self, is no sign of grace; but to long for more grace, is\r\noften a far better evidence of the healthy state of the soul.\r\nFriend, if thou canst not come to the table to-night publicly,\r\ncome to the Master in secret. If thou darest not tell thy wife, or\r\nthy child, or thy father, that thou art trusting in Jesus, it need\r\nnot be told as yet. Thou mayest do it secretly, as he did to whom\r\nJesus said, "When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."\r\nNathanael retired to the shade that no one might see him; but\r\nJesus saw him, and marked his prayer, and He will see thee in the\r\ncrowd, and in the dark, and not withhold His blessing.\r\nThis woman also came into contact with Christ ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"under a very\r\ndeep sense of unworthiness"}),'. I dare say she thought, "If I touch\r\nthe Great Prophet, it will be a wonder if He does not strike me\r\nwith some sudden judgment," for she was a woman ceremonially un-\r\nclean. She had no right to be in the throng. Had the Levitical law\r\nbeen strictly carried out, I suppose she would have been confined\r\nto her house; but there she was wandering about, and she must\r\nneeds go and touch the holy Saviour. Ah! poor heart, you feel to-\r\nnight that you are not fit to touch the skirts of the Master\'s\r\nrobe, for you are so unworthy. You never felt so undeserving\r\nbefore as you do to-night. In the recollection of last week and\r\nits infirmities, in the remembrance of the present state of your\r\nheart, and all its wanderings from God, you feel as if there never\r\nwas so worthless a sinner in the house of God before. "Is grace\r\nfor me?" say you. "Is Christ for me?" Oh! yes, unworthy one. Do\r\nnot be put off without it. Jesus Christ does not save the worthy,\r\nbut the unworthy. Your plea must not be righteousness, but guilt.\r\nAnd you, too, child of God, though you are ashamed of yourself,\r\nJesus is not ashamed of you; and though you feel unfit to come,\r\nlet your unfitness only impel you with the greater earnestness of\r\ndesire. Let your sense of need make you the more fervent to\r\napproach the Lord, who can supply your need.\r\nThus, you see, the woman came under difficulties, she came\r\nsecretly, she came as an unworthy one, but still she obtained the\r\nblessing.\r\nI have known many staggered with that saying of Paul\'s, "He']}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation\r\nto himself." Now, understand that this passage does not refer to\r\nthe unworthiness of those persons who come to the Lord\'s table;\r\nfor it does not say, "He that eateth and drinketh ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"being\r\nunworthy"}),'." It is not an adjective; it is an adverb: "He that\r\neateth and drinketh unworth_ily_," that is to say, he who shall\r\ncome to the outward and visible sign of Christ\'s presence, and\r\nshall eat of the bread in order to obtain money being a member of\r\nthe church, knowing himself to be a hypocrite, or who shall do it\r\njestingly, trifling with the ordinance: such a person would be\r\neating and drinking unworthily, and he will be condemned. The\r\nsense of the passage is, not "damnation", as our version reads it,\r\nbut "condemnation." There can be no doubt that members of the\r\nchurch, coming to the Lord\'s table in an unworthy manner, do\r\nreceive condemnation. They are condemned for so doing, and the\r\nLord is grieved. If they have any conscience at all, they ought to\r\nfeel their sin; and if not, they may expect the chastisements of\r\nGod to visit them. But, O sinner, as to coming to Christ,--which\r\nis a very different thing from coming to the Lord\'s table,--as to\r\ncoming to Christ, the more unworthy you feel yourself to be, the\r\nbetter. Come, thou filthy one, for Christ can wash thee. Come,\r\nthou loathsome one, for Christ can beautify thee. Come utterly\r\nruined and undone, for in Jesus Christ there is the strength and\r\nsalvation which thy case requires.\r\nNotice, once again, that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"this woman touched the Master very\r\ntremblingly, and it was only a hurried touch, but still it was the\r\ntouch of faith"}),'. Oh, beloved, to lay hold on Christ! Be thankful\r\nif you do but get near Him for a few minutes. "Abide with me,"\r\nshould be your prayer; but oh, if He only give you a glimpse, be\r\nthankful! Remember that a touch healed the woman. She did not\r\nembrace Christ by the hour together. She had but a touch, and she\r\nwas healed; and oh, may you have a sight of Jesus now, my beloved!\r\nThough it be but a glimpse, yet it will gladden and cheer your\r\nsouls. Perhaps you are waiting on Christ, desiring His company,\r\nand while you are turning it over in your mind you are asking,\r\n"Will He ever shine upon me? Will He ever speak loving words to\r\nme? Will He ever let me sit at His feet? Will He ever permit me to\r\nlean my head upon His bosom?" Come and try Him. Though you should\r\nshake like an aspen leaf, yet come. They sometimes come best who\r\ncome most tremblingly, for when the creature is lowest then is the\r\nCreator highest, and when in our own esteem we are less than\r\nnothing and vanity, then is Christ the more fair and lovely in our\r\neyes. One of the best ways of climbing to heaven is on our hands\r\nand knees. At any rate, there is no fear of falling when we are in\r\nthat position, for--']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "He that is down need fear no fall."\r\n\r\n Let your lowliness of heart, your sense of utter nothingness, \n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:['instead of disqualifying you, be a sweet medium for leading you to\r\nreceive more of Christ. The more empty I am, the more room is\r\nthere for my Master. The more I lack, the more He will give me.\r\nThe more I feel my sickness, the more shall I adore and bless Him\r\nwhen He makes me whole.\r\nYou see, the woman did really touch Christ, and so I come\r\nback to that. Whatever infirmity there was in the touch, it was a\r\nreal touch of faith. She did reach Christ Himself. She did not\r\ntouch Peter; that would have been of no use to her, any more than\r\nit is for the parish priest to tell you that you are regenerate\r\nwhen your life soon proves that you are not. She did not touch\r\nJohn or James; that would have been of no more good to her than it\r\nis for you to be touched by a bishop\'s hands, and to be told that\r\nyou are confirmed in the faith, when you are not even a believer,\r\nand therefore have no faith to be confirmed in. She touched the\r\nMaster Himself; and, I pray you, do not be content unless you can\r\ndo the same. Put out the hand of faith, and touch Christ. Rest on\r\nHim. Rely on His bloody sacrifice, His dying love, His rising\r\npower, His ascended plea; and as you rest in Him, your vital\r\ntouch, however feeble, will certainly give you the blessing your\r\nsoul needs.\r\nThis brings us to the second part of our discourse, upon\r\nwhich I will say only a little.\r\nII. The woman in the crowd did touch Jesus, and, having done\r\nso, she received virtue from Him.\r\nThe healing energy streamed at once through the finger of\r\nfaith into the woman. In Christ, there is healing for all\r\nspiritual diseases. There is a speedy healing, a healing which\r\nwill not take months nor years, but which is complete in one\r\nsecond. There is in Christ a sufficient healing, though your\r\ndiseases should be multiplied beyond all bounds. There is in\r\nChrist an all-conquering power to drive out every ill. Though,\r\nlike this woman, you baffle physicians, and your case is reckoned\r\ndesperate beyond all parallel, yet a touch of Christ will heal\r\nyou. What a precious, glorious gospel I have to preach to sinners!\r\nIf they touch Jesus, no matter though the devil himself were in\r\nthem, that touch of faith would drive the devil out of them.\r\nThough you were like the man into whom there had entered a legion\r\nof devils, the word of Jesus would cast them all into the deep,\r\nand you should sit at His feet, clothed, and in your right mind.\r\nThere is no excess or extravagance of sin which the power of Jesus\r\nChrist cannot overcome. If thou canst believe, whatever thou\r\nmayest have been, thou shalt be saved. If thou canst believe,\r\nthough thou hast been lying in the scarlet dye till the warp and\r\nwoof of thy being are ingrained therewith, yet shall the precious\r\nblood of Jesus make thee white as snow. Though thou art become\r\nblack as hell itself, and only fit to be cast into the pit, yet if\r\nthou trustest Jesus, that simple faith shall give to thy soul the\r\nhealing which shall make thee fit to tread the streets of heaven,\r\nand to stand before Jehovah-Rophi\'s face, magnifying the Lord that\r\nhealeth thee.\r\nAnd now, child of God, I want you to learn the same lesson.\r\nVery likely, when you came in here, you said,--"Alas! I feel very\r\ndull; my spirituality is at a very low ebb; the place is hot, and\r\nI do not feel prepared to hear; the spirit is willing, but the\r\nflesh is weak; I shall have no holy enjoyment to-day!" Why not?\r\nWhy, the touch of Jesus could make you live if you were dead, and\r\nsurely it will stir the life that is in you, though it may seem to\r\nyou to be expiring! Now, struggle hard, my beloved, to get at\r\nJesus! May the Eternal Spirit come and help you, and may you yet\r\nfind that your dull, dead times can soon become your best times.\r\nOh! what a blessing it is that God takes the beggar up from the\r\ndunghill! He does not raise us when He sees us already up, but\r\nwhen He finds us lying on the dunghill, then He delights to lift\r\nus up, and set us among princes. Or ever you are aware, your soul\r\nmay become like the chariots of Ammi-nadib. Up from the depths of\r\nheaviness to the very heights of ecstatic worship you may mount as\r\nin a single moment if you can but touch Christ crucified. View Him\r\nyonder, with streaming wounds, with thorn-crowned head, as in all\r\nthe majesty of His misery, He expires for you!\r\n"Alas!" say you, "I have a thousand doubts tonight." Ah! but\r\nyour doubts will soon vanish when you draw nigh to Christ. He\r\nnever doubts who feels the touch of Christ, at least, not while\r\nthe touch lasts, for observe this woman! She felt in her body that\r\nshe was made whole, and so shall you, if you will only come into\r\ncontact with the Lord. Do not wait for evidences, but come to\r\nChrist for evidences. If you cannot even dream of a good thing in\r\nyourselves, come to Jesus Christ as you did at the first. Come as\r\nif you never had come at all. Come to Jesus as a sinner, and your\r\ndoubts shall flee away.\r\n"Ay!" saith another, "but my sins come to my remembrance, my\r\nsins since conversion." Well, return to Jesus, when your guilt\r\nseems to return. The fountain is still open, and that fountain,\r\nyou will remember, is not only open for sinners, but for saints;\r\nfor what saith the Scripture--"There shall be a fountain opened\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem"}),',"--\r\nthat is, for you, churchmembers, for you, believers in Jesus? The\r\nfountain is still open. Come, beloved, come to Jesus anew, and\r\nwhatever be your sins, or doubts, or heaviness, they shall all\r\ndepart as soon as you can touch your Lord.\r\nIII. And now the last point is--and I will not detain you\r\nlong upon it--if somebody shall touch Jesus, the Lord will know\r\nit.\r\nI do not know your names; a great number of you are perfect\r\nstrangers to me. It matters nothing; your name is "somebody", and\r\nChrist will know you. You are a total stranger, perhaps, to\r\neverybody in this place; but if you get a blessing, there will be\r\ntwo who will know it,--you will, and Christ will. Oh! if you\r\nshould look to Jesus this day, it may not be registered in our\r\nchurch-book, and we may not hear of it; but still it will be\r\nregistered in the courts of heaven, and they will set all the\r\nbells of the New Jerusalem a-ringing, and all the harps of angels\r\nwill take a fresh lease of music as soon as they know that you are\r\nborn again.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "With joy the Father doth approve\r\n    The fruit of His eternal love;\r\n The Son with joy looks down and sees\r\n    The purchase of His agonies;\r\n The Spirit takes delight to view\r\n    The holy soul He formed anew;\r\n And saints and angels join to sing\r\n    The growing empire of their King."\r\n\r\n "Somebody!"

It is due to us to let us know. You cannot guess what joy\r\nit gives us when we hear of sick ones being healed by our Master.\r\nSome of you, perhaps, have known the Lord for months, and you have\r\nnot yet come forward to make an avowal of it; we beg you to do so.\r\nYou may come forward tremblingly, as this woman did; you may\r\nperhaps say, "I do not know what I should tell you." Well, you\r\nmust tell us what she told the Lord; she told Him all the truth.\r\nWe do not want anything else. We do not desire any sham experi-\r\nence. We do not want you to manufacture feelings like somebody\r\nelse\'s that you have read of in a book. Come and tell us what you\r\nhave felt. We shall not ask you to tell us what you have not felt,\r\nor what you do not know. But, if you have touched Christ, and you\r\nhave been healed, I ask it, and I think I may ask it as your duty,\r\nas well as a favour to us, to come and tell us what the Lord hath\r\ndone for your soul.\r\nAnd you, believers, when you come to the Lord\'s table, if you\r\ndraw near to Christ, and have a sweet season, tell it to your\r\nbrethren.

Take home food for\r\nthose of the family who cannot come for it. God grant that you may\r\nhave always something sweet to tell of what you have\r\nexperimentally known of precious truth, for while the sermon may\r\nhave been sweet in itself, it comes with a double power when you\r\ncan add, "and there was a savour about it which I enjoyed, and\r\nwhich made my heart leap for joy"!\r\nWhoever you may be, my dear friend, though you may be nothing\r\nbut a poor "somebody", yet if you have touched Christ, tell others\r\nabout it, in order that they may come and touch Him, too; and the\r\nLord bless you, for Christ\'s sake!

For instance, the ordinance of baptism as it was\r\nadministered by the apostles betokened the burial of the believer\r\nwith Christ, and his rising with his Lord into newness of life.\r\nMen must needs exchange immersion for sprinkling, and the\r\nintelligent believer for an unconscious child, and so the\r\nordinance is slain.

By some, the wine has been taken away\r\naltogether, or reserved only for a priestly caste; and the simple\r\nbread has been changed into a consecrated host. As for the table,\r\nthe very emblem of fellowship in all nations--for what expresses\r\nfellowship better than surrounding a table, and eating and\r\ndrinking together?--this, forsooth, must be put away, and an altar\r\nmust be erected, and the bread and wine which were to help us to\r\nremember the Lord Jesus are changed into an "unbloody sacrifice",\r\nand so the whole thing becomes an unscriptural celebration instead\r\nof a holy institution for fellowship. Let us be warned by these\r\nmistakes of others never either to add to or take from the Word of\r\nGod so much as a single jot or tittle. Keep upon the foundation of\r\nthe Scriptures, and you stand safely, and have an answer for those\r\nwho question you; yea, and an answer which you may render at the\r\nbar of God; but once allow your own whim, or fancy, or taste, or\r\nyour notion of what is proper and right, to rule you, instead of\r\nthe Word of God, and you have entered upon a dangerous course, and\r\nunless the grace of God prevent, boundless mischief may ensue. The\r\nBible is our standard authority; none may turn from it. The wise\r\nman says, in Ecclesiastes, "I counsel thee to keep the King\'s\r\ncommandment;" we would repeat his advice, and add to it the sage\r\nprecept of the mother of our Lord, at Cana, when she said, "What-\r\nsoever He saith unto you, do it."\r\nWe shall now ask you in contemplation to gaze upon the first\r\ncelebration of the Lord\'s supper. You perceive at once that there\r\nwas no altar in that large upper room. There was a table, a table\r\nwith bread and wine upon it, but no altar; and Jesus did not\r\nkneel,--there is no sign of that,--but He sat down, I doubt not,\r\nafter the Oriental mode of sitting, that is to say, by a partial\r\nreclining, He sat down with His apostles. Now, He who ordained\r\nthis supper knew how it ought to be observed, and as the first\r\ncelebration of it was the model for all others, we may be assured\r\nthat the right way of coming to this communion is to assemble\r\naround a table, and to sit or recline while we eat and drink\r\ntogether of bread and wine in remembrance of our Lord.\r\nWhile we see the Saviour sitting down with His twelve\r\napostles, let us enquire, first, _what did this make them? _Then,\r\nsecondly, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"what did this imply?"})," And, thirdly, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"what further may\r\nwe legitimately infer from it?"}),"\r\nI. First, then, we see the Great Master, the Lord, the King\r\nin Zion, sitting down at the table to eat and drink with His\r\ntwelve apostles,--what did this make them?\r\nNote what they were at first. By His first calling of them\r\nthey became His ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"followers"}),', for He said unto them, "Follow Me."\r\nThat is to say, they were convinced, by sundry marks and signs,\r\nthat He was the Messias, and they, therefore, became His\r\nfollowers. Followers may be at a great distance from their leader,\r\nand enjoy little or no intercourse with him, for the leader may be\r\ntoo great to be approached by the common members of his band. In\r\nthe case of the disciples, their following was unusually close,\r\nfor their Master was very condescending, but still their inter-\r\ncourse was not always of the most intimate kind at first, and\r\ntherefore it was not at the first that He called them to such a\r\nfestival as this supper. They began with following, and this is\r\nwhere we must begin. If we cannot enter as yet into closer\r\nassociation with our Lord, we may, at least, know His voice by His\r\nSpirit, and follow Him as the sheep follow the shepherd. The most\r\nimportant way of following Him is to trust Him, and then\r\ndiligently to imitate His example. This is a good beginning, and\r\nit will end well, for those who walk with Him to-day shall rest\r\nwith Him hereafter; those who tread in His footsteps shall sit on\r\nHis throne.\r\nBeing His followers, they came next to be His ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"disciples"}),". A\r\nman may have been a follower for a while, and yet may not have\r\nreached discipleship. A follower may follow blindly, and hear a\r\ngreat deal which he does not understand; but when he becomes a\r\ndisciple, his Master instructs him, and leads him into truth. To\r\nexplain, to expound, to solve difficulties, to clear away doubts,\r\nand to make truth intelligible, is the office of a teacher amongst\r\nhis disciples. Now, it was a very blessed thing for the followers\r\nto become disciples, but still disciples are not necessarily so\r\nintimate with their Master as to sit and eat with him. Socrates\r\nand Plato knew many in the Academy whom they did not invite to\r\ntheir homes. My brethren, if Jesus had but called us to be His\r\ndisciples, and no more we should have had cause for great\r\nthankfulness; if we had been allowed to sit at His feet, and had\r\nnever shared in such an entertainment as that before us, we ought\r\nto have been profoundly grateful; but now that He has favoured us\r\nwith a yet higher place, let us never be unfaithful to our\r\ndiscipleship. Let us daily learn of Jesus, let us search the Bible\r\nto see what it was that He taught us, and then by the aid of His\r\nHoly Spirit let us scrupulously obey. Yet is there a something\r\nbeyond.\r\nBeing the Lord's disciples, the chosen ones next rose to\r\nbecome His ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"servants"}),", which is a step in advance, since the\r\ndisciple may be but a child, but the servant has some strength,\r\nhas received some measure of training, and renders somewhat in\r\nreturn. Their Master gave them power to preach the gospel, and to\r\nexecute commissions of grace, and happy were they to be called to\r\nwait upon such a Master, and aid in setting up His kingdom. My\r\ndear brethren and sisters, are you all Christ's servants\r\nconsciously? If so, though the service may at times seem heavy\r\nbecause your faith is weak, yet be very thankful that you are\r\nservants at all, for it is better to serve God than to reign over\r\nall the kingdoms of this world. It is better to be the lowest\r\nservant of Christ than to be the greatest of men, and remain\r\nslaves to your own lusts, or be mere men-pleasers. His yoke is\r\neasy, and His burden is light. The servant of such a Master should\r\nrejoice in his calling; yet is there something beyond.\r\nTowards the close of His life, our Master revealed the yet\r\nnearer relation of His disciples, and uttered words like these:\r\n\"Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not\r\nwhat his lord doeth, but I have called you ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"friends"}),', for all\r\nthings that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you."\r\nThis is a great step in advance. The friend, however humble,\r\nenjoys much familiarity with his friend. The friend is told what\r\nthe servant need not know. The friend enjoys a communion to which\r\nthe mere servant, disciple, or follower has not attained. May we\r\nknow this higher association, this dearer bond of relationship!\r\nMay we not be content without the enjoyment of our Master\'s\r\nfriendship! "He that hath friends must show himself friendly;" and\r\nif we would have Christ\'s friendship, we must befriend His cause,\r\nHis truth, and His people. He is a Friend that loveth at all\r\ntimes; if you would enjoy His friendship, take care to abide in\r\nHim.\r\nNow note that, on the night before His Passion, our Lord led\r\nHis friends a step beyond ordinary friendship. The mere follower\r\ndoes not sit at table with his leader; the disciple does not claim\r\nto be a fellow-commoner with his master; the servant is seldom\r\nentertained at the same table with his lord; the befriended one is\r\nnot always invited to be a guest; but here the Lord Jesus made His\r\nchosen ones to be ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"His table-companions;"}),' He lifted them up to sit\r\nwith Him at the same table, to eat of the same bread, and drink of\r\nthe same cup with Himself. From that position He has never\r\ndegraded them; they were representative men, and where the Lord\r\nplaced them, He has placed all His saints permanently. All the\r\nLord\'s believing people are sitting, by sacred privilege and\r\ncalling, at the same table with Jesus, for truly, our fellowship\r\nis with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. He has come into\r\nour hearts, and He sups with us, and we with Him; we are His\r\ntable-companions, and shall eat bread with Him in the kingdom of\r\nGod.\r\nTable-companions, then, that is the answer to the question,\r\n"What did this festival make the apostles?" This festival shows\r\nall the members of the Church of Christ to be, through divine\r\ngrace, table-companions with one another, and with Christ Jesus\r\ntheir Lord.\r\nII. So now we shall pass on, in the second place, to ask,\r\nwhat did this table-companionship imply?\r\nIt implied, first of all, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"mutual fidelity"}),'. This solemn\r\neating and drinking together was a pledge of faithfulness to one\r\nanother. It must have been so understood, or otherwise there would\r\nhave been no force in the complaint: "He that eateth bread with Me\r\nhath lifted up his heel against Me." Did not this mean that,\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"because"}),' Judas had eaten bread with his Lord, he was bound not to\r\nbetray Him, and so to lift up his heel against Him? This was the\r\nseal of an implied covenant; having eaten together, they were\r\nunder bond to be faithful to one another. Now, as many of you as\r\nare really the servants and friends of Christ may know that the\r\nLord Jesus, in eating with you at His table, pledges Himself to be\r\nfaithful to you. The Master never plays the Judas,--the Judas is\r\namong the disciples. There is nothing traitorous in the Lord; He\r\nis not only able to keep that which we have committed to Him, but\r\nHe is faithful, and will do it. He will be faithful, not only as\r\nto the great and main matter, but also to every promise He has\r\nmade. Know ye then, assuredly, that your Master would not have\r\nasked you to His table to eat bread with Him if He intended to\r\ndesert you. He has received you as His honoured guests, and fed\r\nyou upon His choicest meat, and thereby He does as good as say to\r\nyou, "I will never leave you, come what may, and in all times of\r\ntrial, and depression, and temptation, I will be at your right\r\nhand, and you shall not be moved, and to the very last you shall\r\nprove My faithfulness and truth."\r\nBut, beloved, you do not understand this supper unless you\r\nare also reminded of the faithfulness that is due from you to your\r\nLord, for the feast is common, and the pledge mutual. In eating\r\nwith Him, you plight your troth to the Crucified, Beloved, how\r\nhave you kept your pledge during the past year? You have eaten\r\nbread with Him, and I trust that in your hearts you have never\r\ngone so far aside as to lift up your heel against Him, but have\r\nyou always honoured Him as you should? Have you acted as guests\r\nshould have done? Can you remember His love to you, and put your\r\nlove to Him side by side with it, without being ashamed? From this\r\ntime forth, may the Holy Ghost work in our souls a jealous\r\nfidelity to the Well-beloved which shall not permit our hearts to\r\nwander from Him, or suffer our zeal for His glory to decline!\r\nAgain, remember that there is in this solemn eating and\r\ndrinking together a pledge of fidelity between the disciples\r\nthemselves, as well as between the disciples and their Lord. Judas\r\nwould have been a traitor if he had betrayed Peter, or John, or\r\nJames: so, when ye come to the one table, my brethren, ye must\r\nhenceforth be true to one another. All bickerings and jealousies\r\nmust cease, and a generous and affectionate spirit must rule in\r\nevery bosom. If you hear any speak against those you have communed\r\nwith, reckon that, as you have eaten bread with them, you are\r\nbound to defend their reputations. If any railing accusation be\r\nraised against any brother in Christ, reckon that his character is\r\nas dear to you as your own. Let a sacred Freemasonry be maintained\r\namong us, if I may liken a far higher and more spiritual union to\r\nanything which belongs to common life. Ye are members one of\r\nanother, see that ye love each other with a pure heart fervently.\r\nDrinking of the same cup, eating of the same bread, you set forth\r\nbefore the world a token which I trust is not meant to be a lie.\r\nAs it truly shows Christ\'s faithfulness to you, so let it as\r\nreally typify your faithfulness to Christ, and to one another.\r\nIn the next place, eating and drinking together was a token\r\nof ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"mutual confidence"}),'. They, in sitting there together,\r\nvoluntarily avowed their confidence in each other. Those disciples\r\ntrusted their Master, they knew He would not mislead or deceive\r\nthem. They trusted each other also, for when they were told that\r\none of them would betray their Lord, they did not suspect each\r\nother, but each one said, "Lord, is it I?" They had much\r\nconfidence in one another, and the Lord Jesus, as we have seen,\r\nhad placed great confidence in them by treating them as His\r\nfriends. He had even trusted them with the great secret of His\r\ncoming sufferings, and death. They were a trustful company who sat\r\nat that supper-table. Now, beloved, when you gather around this\r\ntable, come in the spirit of implicit trustfulness in the Lord\r\nJesus. If you are suffering, do not doubt His love, but believe\r\nthat He works all things for your good. If you are vexed with\r\ncares, prove your confidence by leaving them entirely in your\r\nRedeemer\'s hands. It will not be a festival of communion to you if\r\nyou come here with suspicions about your Master. No, show your\r\nconfidence as you eat of the bread with Him. Let there also be a\r\nbrotherly confidence in each other. Grievous would it be to see a\r\nspirit of suspicion and distrust among you. Suspicion is the death\r\nof fellowship. The moment one Christian imagines that another\r\nthinks hardly of him, though there may not be the slightest truth\r\nin that thought, yet straightway the root of bitterness is\r\nplanted. Let us believe in one another\'s sincerity, for we may\r\nrest assured that each of our brethren deserves to be trusted more\r\nthan we do. Turn your suspicions within, and if you must suspect,\r\nsuspect your own heart; but when you meet with those who have\r\ncommuned with you at this table, say within yourself, "If such can\r\ndeceive me, and alas I they may, then will I be content to be im-\r\nposed upon rather than entertain perpetual mistrust of my fellow-\r\nChristians."\r\nA third meaning of the assembling around the table is this,\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"hearty fraternity"}),'. Our Lord, in sitting down at the table with\r\nHis disciples, showed Himself to be one with them, a Brother\r\nindeed. We do not read that there was any order of priority by\r\nwhich their seats were arranged. Of course, if the Grand\r\nChamberlain at Rome had arranged the table, he would have placed\r\nPeter at the right hand of Christ, and the other apostles in\r\ngraduated positions according to the dignity of their future\r\nbishoprics, but all that we know about their order is this, that\r\nJohn sat next to the Saviour, and leaned upon His bosom, and that\r\nPeter sat a good way off,--we feel sure he did, because it is said\r\nthat he "beckoned" unto John; if he had sat next to him, he would\r\nhave whispered to him, but he beckoned to him, and so he must have\r\nbeen some way down the table, if, indeed, there was any "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"down"}),'"\r\nor "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"up"}),'" in the arrangement of the guests. We believe the fact\r\nwas, that they sat there on a sacred equality, the Lord Jesus, the\r\nEIder Brother, among them, and all else arranged according to\r\nthose words, "One is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are\r\nbrethren." Let us feel, then, in coming to the table again at this\r\ntime, that we are linked in ties sacred relationship with Jesus\r\nChrist, who is exalted in heaven, and that through Him our\r\nrelationship with our fellow-Christians is very near and intimate.\r\nOh, that Christian brotherhood were more real! The very word\r\n"brother" has come to be ridiculed as a piece of hypocrisy, and\r\nwell it may, for it is mostly used as a cant phrase, and in many\r\ncases means very little. But it ought to mean something. You have\r\nno right to come to that table unless you really feel that those\r\nwho are washed in Jesus\' blood have a claim upon the love of your\r\nheart, and the activity of your benevolence. What! are ye to live\r\ntogether for ever in heaven, and will ye show no affection for one\r\nanother here below? It is your Master\'s new command that ye love\r\none another; will ye disregard it? He has given this as the badge\r\nof Christians: "By this shall all men know that ye are My\r\ndisciples,"--not if ye wear a gold cross, but--"if ye have love\r\none to another." That is the Christian\'s badge of his being, in\r\nvery truth, a disciple of Jesus Christ. Here, at this table, we\r\nfind fraternity. Whosoever eateth of this sacred supper declares\r\nhimself to be one of a brotherhood in Christ, a brotherhood\r\nstriving for the same cause, having sincere sympathy, being\r\nmembers of each other, and all of them members of the body of\r\nChrist. God make this to be a fact throughout Christendom even\r\nnow, and how will the world marvel as it cries, "See how these\r\nChristians love one another!"\r\nBut this table means more yet: it signifies ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"common\r\nenjoyment"}),". Jesus eats, and they eat, the same bread. He drinks,\r\nand they drink, of the same cup. There is no distinction in the\r\nviands. What meaneth this? Doth it not say to us that the joy of\r\nChrist is the joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be\r\nfull\"? The very joy that delights Christ is that which He prepares\r\nfor His people. You, if you are a true believer, have sympathy in\r\nChrist's joy, you delight to see His kingdom come, the truth\r\nadvanced, sinners saved, grace glorified, holiness promoted, God\r\nexalted; this also is His delight. But my dear brethren and\r\nfellow-professors, are you sure that your chief joy is the same as\r\nChrist's? Are you certain that the mainstay of your life is the\r\nsame as that which was His meat and His drink, namely, to do the\r\nwill of the heavenly Father? If not, I am afraid you have no\r\nbusiness at this table; but if it be so, and you come to the\r\ntable, then I pray that you may share the joy of Christ. May you\r\njoy in Him as He joys in you, and so may your fellowship be sweet!\r\nLastly, on this point, the feast at the one table indicated\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"familiar affection"}),'. It is the child\'s place to sit at the table\r\nwith its parents, for there affection rules. It is the place of\r\nhonour to sit at the table: "Martha served, but Lazarus was one of\r\nthem that sat at the table." But the honour is such as love and\r\nnot fear suggests. Men at the table often reveal their minds more\r\nfully than elsewhere. If you want to understand a man, you do not\r\ngo to see him at the Stock Exchange, or follow him into the\r\nmarket; for there he keeps himself to himself; but you go to his\r\ntable, and there he unbosoms himself. Now, the Lord Jesus Christ\r\nsat at the table with His disciples. \'Twas a meal; \'twas a meal of\r\na homely kind; intimate intercourse ruled the hour. Oh, brethren\r\nand sisters, I am afraid we have come to this table sometimes, and\r\nChrist, and then it has been an empty formality and nothing more.\r\nI thank God that, coming to this table every Sabbath-day, as some\r\nof us do, and have done for many years, we have yet for the most\r\npart enjoyed the nearest communion with Christ here that we have\r\never known, and have a thousand times blessed His name for this\r\nordinance. Still, there is such a thing as only eating the bread\r\nand drinking the wine, and losing all the sacred meaning thereof.\r\nDo pray the Lord to reveal Himself to you. Ask that it may not be\r\na dead form to you, but that now in very deed you may give to\r\nChrist your heart, while He shall show to you His hands and His\r\nside, and make known to you His agonies and death, wherewith He\r\nredeemed you from the wrath to come. All this, and vastly more, is\r\nthe teaching of the table at which Jesus sat with the twelve. I\r\nhave often wondered why the Church of Rome does not buy up all\r\nthose pictures by one of its most renowned painters, Leonardo da\r\nVinci, in which our Lord is represented as sitting at the table\r\nwith His disciples, for these are a contradiction of the Popish\r\ndoctrine on this subject. As long as that picture remains on the\r\nwall, and as long as copies of it are spread everywhere, the\r\nChurch of Rome stands convicted of going against the teaching of\r\nthe earlier Church by setting up an altar when she confesses her-\r\nself that aforetime it was not considered to be an altar of\r\nsacrifice but a table of fellowship, at which the Lord did not\r\nkneel, nor stand as an officiating priest, but at which He and His\r\ndisciples sat. We, at least, have no rebukes to fear from\r\nantiquity, for we follow, and mean to follow, the primitive\r\nmethod. Our Lord has given us commandment to do this until He\r\ncomes,--not to alter it, but just to "do this," and nothing else,\r\nin the same manner until He shall come.\r\nIII. We will draw to a close by asking--What further may be\r\ninferred from this sitting of Christ with his disciples at the\r\ntable?\r\nI answer: first, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"there may be inferred from it the equality\r\nof all the saints"}),". There were here twelve apostles. Their\r\napostleship, however, is not concerned in the matter. When the\r\nLord's supper was celebrated after all the apostles had gone to\r\nheaven, was there to be any alteration because the apostles had\r\ngone? Not at all. Believers are to do this in remembrance of their\r\nLord ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"until He shall come"}),'. There was no command for a change when\r\nthe first apostles were all gone from the Church: No, it was to be\r\nthe same still,--bread and wine and the surrounding of the table,\r\nuntil the Lord came. I gather, then, the equality of all saints.\r\nThere is a difference in office, there was a difference in\r\nmiraculous gift, and there are great differences in growth of\r\ngrace; but still, in the household of God, all saints, whether\r\napostles, pastors, teachers, deacons, elders, or private members,\r\nbeing all equal, eat at one table. There is but one bread, there\r\nis but one juice of the vine here.\r\nIt is only in the Church of God that those words, so wild\r\npolitically, can ever be any more than a dream, "Liberty,\r\nEquality, and Fraternity." There you have them, where Jesus is;\r\nnot in a republic, but in the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour\r\nJesus Christ, where all rule and dominion are vested in Him, and\r\nall of us willingly acknowledge Him as our glorious Head, and all\r\nwe are brethren. Never fall into the idea that older believers\r\nwere of a superior nature to ourselves. Do not talk of ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Saint"}),"\r\nPaul, and ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Saint"})," Matthew, and ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Saint"})," Mark, unless you are\r\nprepared to speak of ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Saint"})," William and ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Saint"})," Jane sitting over\r\nyonder, for if they be in Christ they are as truly saints as those\r\nfirst saints were, and I ween there may be some who have attained\r\neven to higher saintship than many whom tradition has canonized.\r\nThe heights of saintship are by grace open to us all, and the Lord\r\ninvites us to ascend. Do not think that what the Lord wrought in\r\nthe early saints cannot be wrought in you. It is because you think\r\nso that you do not pray for it, and because you do not pray for it\r\nyou do not attain it. The grace of God sustained the apostles;\r\nthat grace is not less to-day than it was then. The Lord's arm is\r\nnot shortened; His power is not straitened. If we can but believe,\r\nand be as earnest as those first saints were, we shall subdue\r\nkingdoms yet, and the day shall come when the gods of Hindooism,\r\nand the falsehoods of Mohammed, and the lies of Rome, shall as\r\ncertainly be overthrown as were the ancient philosophies and the\r\nclassic idolatries of Greece and Rome by the teaching of the first\r\nministers of Christ. There is the same table for you, and the same\r\nfood is there in emblem, and grace can make you like those holy\r\nmen, for you are bought with the same blood, and quickened by the\r\nsame Spirit. Believe only, for all things are possible to him that\r\nbelieveth.\r\nAnother inference, only to be hinted at, is this, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"that the\r\nwants of the Church in all ages will be the same, and the supplies\r\nfor the Church's wants will never vary"}),". There will be the table\r\nstill, and the table with the same viands upon it,--bread still,\r\nnothing more than bread for food; wine still, nothing less than\r\nwine for drink. The Church will always want the same food, the\r\nsame Christ, the same gospel. Out on ye, traitors, who tell us\r\nthat we are to shape our gospel to suit this enlightened\r\nnineteenth century! Out on ye, false-hearts, who would have us\r\ntone down the everlasting truth that shall outlive the sun, and\r\nmoon, and stars, to suit your boasted culture, which is but\r\nvarnished ignorance! No, that truth which of old was mighty\r\nthrough God to the pulling down of strongholds, is mighty still,\r\nand we will maintain it to the death; the Church wants the\r\ndoctrines of grace to-day as much as when Paul, or Augustine, or\r\nCalvin preached them; the Church wants justification by faith, the\r\nsubstitutionary atonement, and regeneration, and divine\r\nsovereignty to be preached from her pulpits as much as in days of\r\nyore, and by God's grace she shall have them, too.\r\nLastly, there is in this truth, that Christ has brought all\r\nHis disciples into the position of table-companions, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"a prophecy\r\nthat this shall be the portion of all His people for ever"}),'. In\r\nheaven there cannot be less of privilege than on earth. It cannot\r\nbe that in the celestial state believers will be degraded from\r\nwhat they have been below. What were they, then, below? Table-\r\ncompanions. What shall they be in heaven above? Table-companions\r\nstill, and blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of\r\nGod. "Many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall\r\nsit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of\r\nGod," and the Lord Jesus shall be at the head of the table. Now,\r\nwhat will His table of joy be? Set your imagination to work, and\r\nthink what will be His festival of soul when His reward shall be\r\nall before Him, and His triumph all achieved. Have ye imagined it?\r\nCan ye conceive it? Whatever it is, you shall share in it. I\r\nrepeat those words, whatever it is, the least believer shall share\r\nin it.

No circle of friends can supply to a\r\nbereaved woman the loss of her husband; without him, she is still\r\na widow. Even thus, without Jesus, it is inevitable that the\r\nsaints should be as orphans; but Jesus has promised in the text\r\nthat we shall not be so; the one only thing that can remove the\r\ntrial He declares shall be ours, "I will come to you."\r\nNow remember, that'})," an orphan is one whose parent is dead_.\r\nThis in itself is a great sorrow, if there were no other.

No need to press to get at\r\nHim because the throng is great, for He is as near to me as He is\r\nto you, and as near to you as to saints in America, or the islands\r\nof the Southern Sea.

Now, you have the Spirit of\r\nGod. The Holy Spirit is so given, that there is not a truth which\r\nyou may not understand. You may be led into the deepest mysteries\r\nby His teaching. You may be made to know and to comprehend those\r\nknotty points in the Word of God which have hitherto puzzled you.\r\nYou have but humbly to look up to Jesus, and His Spirit will still\r\nteach you. I tell you, though you are poor and ignorant, and\r\nperhaps can scarcely read a word in the Bible; for all that, you\r\nmay be better instructed in the things of God than doctors of\r\ndivinity, if you go to the Holy Spirit, and are taught of Him.\r\nThose who go only to books and to the letter, and are taught of\r\nmen, may be fools in the sight of God; but those who go to Jesus,\r\nand sit at His feet, and ask to be taught of His Spirit, shall be\r\nwise unto salvation. Blessed be God, there are not a few amongst\r\nus of this sort. We are not left orphans; we have an Instructor\r\nwith us still.\r\nThere is one point in which the orphan is often sorrowfully\r\nreminded of his orphanhood, namely,_ in lacking a defender_. It is\r\nso natural in little children, when some big boy molests them, to\r\nsay, \"I'll tell my father!\" How often did we use to say so, and\r\nhow often have we heard from the little ones since, \"I'll tell\r\nmother!\" Sometimes, the not being able to do this is a much\r\nseverer loss than we can guess. Unkind and cruel men have snatched\r\naway from orphans the little which a father's love had left\r\nbehind; and in the court of law there has been no defender to\r\nprotect the orphan's goods. Had the father been there, the child\r\nwould have had its rights, scarcely would any have dared to\r\ninfringe them; but, in the absence of the father, the orphan is\r\neaten up like bread, and the wicked of the earth devour his\r\nestate. In this sense, the saints are not orphans. The devil would\r\nrob us of our heritage if he could, but there is an Advocate with\r\nthe Father who pleads for us. Satan would snatch from us every\r\npromise, and tear from us all the comforts of the covenant; but we\r\nare not orphans, and when he brings a suit-at-law against us, and\r\nthinks that we are the only defendants in the case, he is\r\nmistaken, for we have an Advocate on high.

He has not left us\r\norphans.\r\nNow I want, without saying many words, to get you who love\r\nthe Master to feel what a very precious thought this is, that you\r\nare not alone in this world; that, if you have no earthly friends,\r\nif you have none to whom you can take your cares, if you are quite\r\nlonely so far as outward friends are concerned, yet Jesus is with\r\nyou, is really with you, practically with you, able to help you,\r\nand ready to do so, and that you have a good and kind Protector\r\nclose at hand at this present moment, for Christ has said it: "I\r\nwill not leave you orphans."\r\nII. Secondly, there is, a consolation provided: The remedy by\r\nwhich the evil is averted is this, our Lord Jesus said, "',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"I will\r\ncome to you"}),'."\r\nWhat does this mean? Does it not mean, from the connection,\r\nthis--"_I will come to you by My Spirit"? _Beloved, we must not\r\nconfuse the Persons of the Godhead. The Holy Spirit is not the Son\r\nof God; Jesus, the Son of God, is not the Holy Spirit.\r\nThey are two distinct Persons of the one Godhead. But yet\r\nthere is such a wonderful unity, and the blessed Spirit acts so\r\nmarvellously as the Vicar of Christ, that it is quite correct to\r\nsay that, when the Spirit comes, Jesus comes, too, and "I will\r\ncome to you," means "I, by My Spirit, who shall take My place, and\r\nrepresent Me, I will come to be with you." See then, Christian,\r\nyou have the Holy Spirit in you and with you to be the\r\nRepresentative of Christ. Christ is with you now, not in person,\r\nbut by His Representative,--an efficient, almighty, divine,\r\neverlasting Representative, who stands for Christ, and is as\r\nChrist to you in His presence in your souls. Because you thus have\r\nChrist by His Spirit, you cannot be orphans, for the Spirit of God\r\nis always with you. It is a delightful truth that the Spirit of\r\nGod always dwells in believers;--not sometimes, but always. He is\r\nnot always active in believers, and He may be grieved until His\r\nsensible presence is altogether withdrawn, but His secret presence\r\nis always there. At no single moment is the Spirit of God wholly\r\ngone from a believer. The believer would die spiritually if this\r\ncould happen, but that cannot be, for Jesus has said, "Because I\r\nlive, ye shall live also." Even when the believer sins, the Holy\r\nSpirit does not utterly depart from him, but is still in him to\r\nmake him smart for the sin into which he has fallen. The\r\nbeliever\'s prayers prove that the Holy Spirit is still within him.\r\n"Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me," was the prayer of a saint who\r\nhad fallen very foully, but in whom the Spirit of God still kept\r\nHis residence, notwithstanding all the foulness of his guilt and\r\nsin.\r\nBut, beloved, in addition to this, Jesus Christ by His\r\nSpirit ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"makes visits to His people of a peculiar kind"}),". The Holy\r\nGhost becomes wonderfully active and potent at certain times of\r\nrefreshing. We are then especially and joyfully sensible of His\r\ndivine power. His influence streams through every chamber of our\r\nnature, and floods our dark soul with His glorious rays, as the\r\nsun shining in its strength. Oh, how delightful this is! Sometimes\r\nwe have felt this at the Lord's table. My soul pants to sit with\r\nyou at that table, because I do remember many a happy time when\r\nthe emblems of bread and wine have assisted my faith, and kindled\r\nthe passions of my soul into a heavenly flame. I am equally sure\r\nthat, at the prayer-meeting, under the preaching of the Word, in\r\nprivate meditation, and in searching the Scriptures, we can say\r\nthat Jesus Christ has come to us.

And now,\r\ngathering up the few thoughts I have uttered, let me remind you,\r\ndear friends, that every word of the text is instructive: "I will\r\nnot leave you orphans: I will come to you." Observe the "I" there\r\ntwice over. "I will not leave you orphans; father and mother may,\r\nbut I will not; friends once beloved may turn stony-hearted, but I\r\nwill not; Judas may play the traitor, and Ahithophel may betray\r\nhis David, but I will not leave you comfortless.

If Thou hadst\r\nbidden some of my brethren come and speak a word of comfort to me,\r\nI had been thankful, but Thou hast put it thus in the first\r\nperson, \'I will come unto you.\' O my Lord, what shall I say, what\r\nshall I do, but feel a hungering and a thirsting after Thee, which\r\nnothing shall satisfy till Thou shalt fulfil Thine own Word, \'I\r\nwill not leave you comfortless; I will come to you\'"?\r\nAnd then notice the persons to whom it is addressed, "I will\r\nnot leave ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"you"})," comfortless, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"you"}),", Peter, who will deny Me;\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"you"}),', Thomas, who will doubt Me; I will not leave you\r\ncomfortless."

Observe, too, _the richness and\r\nsufficiency of the text: _"I will not leave you comfortless: I\r\nwill come to you." He does not promise, "I will send you\r\nsanctifying grace, or sustaining mercy, or precious mercy," but He\r\nsays, what is the only thing that will prevent your being orphans,\r\n"I will come to you." Ah! Lord, Thy grace is sweet, but Thou art\r\nbetter. The vine is good, but the clusters are better. It is well\r\nenough to have a gift from Thy hand, but oh! to touch the hand\r\nitself.

So, our blessed Lord, knowing\r\nthis, does not say, "I will do this and that for you," but, "I\r\nwill come to you."\r\nDo you not see, dear friends, here is not only all you can\r\nwant, but all you think you can want, wrapped up in a sentence, "I\r\nwill come to you"? "It pleased the Father that in Him should all\r\nfulness dwell;" so that, when Christ comes, in Him "all fulness"\r\ncomes.

Very well! the man calls with that note of hand to-\r\nmorrow, and gets fifty pounds. And what is the good of the note of\r\nhand now? Why, it is of no further value, it is discharged. How\r\nwould you like to have a note of hand which would always stand\r\ngood? That would be a right royal present. "I promise to pay\r\nevermore, and this bond, though paid a thousand times, shall still\r\nhold good." Who would not like to have a cheque of that sort? Yet\r\nthis is the promise which Christ gives you, "I will not leave you\r\norphans: I will come to you." The first time a sinner looks to\r\nChrist, Christ comes to him. And what then? Why, the next minute\r\nit is still, "I will come to you." But here is one who has known\r\nChrist for fifty years, and he has had this promise fulfilled a\r\nthousand times a year: is it not done with? Oh, no! there it\r\nstands, just as fresh as when Jesus first spoke it, "I will come\r\nto you." Then we will treat our Lord in His own fashion, and take\r\nHim at His word. We will go to Him as often as ever we can, for we\r\nshall never weary Him; and when He has kept His promise most, then\r\nis it that we will go to Him, and ask Him to keep it more still;\r\nand after ten thousand proofs of the truth of it, we will only\r\nhave a greater hungering and thirsting to get it fulfilled again.\r\nThis is fit provision for life, and for death, "I will come to\r\nyou." In the last moment, when your pulse beats faintly, and you\r\nare just about to pass the curtain, and enter into the invisible\r\nworld, you may have this upon your lips, and say to your Lord, "My\r\nMaster, still fulfil the word on which Thou hast caused me to\r\nhope, \'I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\'"\r\nLet me remind you that ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the text is at this moment valid"}),',\r\nand for this I delight in it. "I will not leave you comfortless."\r\nThat means ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"now"}),', "I will not leave you comfortless now." Are you\r\ncomfortless at this hour? It is your own fault. Jesus Christ does\r\nnot leave you so, nor make you so. There are rich and precious\r\nthings in this word, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will\r\ncome to you, I will come to you now." It may be a very dull time\r\nwith you, and you are pining to come nearer to Christ. Very well,\r\nthen plead the promise before the Lord. Plead the promise as you\r\nsit where you are: "Lord, Thou hast said Thou wilt come unto me;\r\ncome unto me to-night." There are many reasons, believer, why you\r\nshould plead thus. You want Him; you need Him; you require Him;\r\ntherefore plead the promise, and expect its fulfilment.

The word\r\n"loaf" helps to bring out more clearly the idea of unity intended\r\nto be set forth by the apostle.\r\nIt is a lamentable fact that some have fancied that this\r\nsimple ordinance of the Lord\'s supper has a certain magical, or at\r\nleast physical power about it, so that, by the mere act of eating\r\nand drinking this bread and wine, men can be made partakers of the\r\nbody and blood of Christ. It is marvellous that so plain a symbol\r\nshould have been so complicated by genuflexions, adornments, and\r\ntechnical phrases. Can anyone see the slightest resemblance\r\nbetween the Master\'s sitting down with the twelve, and the mass of\r\nthe Roman community? The original rite is lost in the super-\r\nimposed ritual. Superstition has produced a sacrament where Jesus\r\nintended a fellowship. Too many, who would not go the length of\r\nRome, yet speak of this simple feast as if it were a mystery dark\r\nand obscure. They employ all manner of hard words to turn the\r\nchildren\'s bread into a stone. It is not the Lord\'s supper, but\r\nthe Eucharist; we see before us no plate, but a "paten"; the cup\r\nis a "chalice" and the table is an "altar." These are\r\nincrustations of superstition, whereby the blessed ordinance of\r\nChrist is likely to be again overgrown and perverted.\r\nWhat does this supper mean? It means communion: ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"communion\r\nwith Christ, and communion with one another"}),".\r\nWhat is communion? The word breaks up easily into union, and\r\nits prefix ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"com"}),", which means ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"with"}),", union with. We must,\r\ntherefore, first enjoy union with Christ, and with His Church, or\r\nelse we cannot enjoy communion. Union lies at the basis of com-\r\nmunion. We must be one with Christ in heart, and soul, and life;\r\nbaptized into His death; quickened by His life, and so brought to\r\nbe members of His body, one with the whole Church of which He is\r\nthe Head. We cannot have communion with Christ till we are in\r\nunion with ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Him"}),"; and we cannot have communion with the Church\r\ntill we are in vital union with ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"it"}),".\r\nI. The teaching of the Lord's supper is just this--that while\r\nwe have many ways of communion with Christ, yet the receiving of\r\nChrist into our souls as our Saviour is the best way of communion\r\nwith Him.\r\nI said, dear friends, that we have many ways of communion\r\nwith Christ; let me show you that it is so.\r\nCommunion is ours by ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"personal intercourse"})," with the Lord\r\nJesus. We speak with Him in prayer, and He speaks with us through\r\nthe Word. Some of us speak oftener with Christ than we do with\r\nwife or child, and our communion with Jesus is deeper and more\r\nthorough than our fellowship with our nearest friend. In\r\nmeditation and its attendant thanksgiving we speak with our risen\r\nLord, and by His Holy Spirit He answers us by creating fresh\r\nthought and emotion in our minds. I like sometimes in prayer, when\r\nI do not feel that I can say anything, just to sit still, and look\r\nup; then faith spiritually descries the Well-beloved, and hears\r\nHis voice in the solemn silence of the mind. Thus we have\r\nintercourse with Jesus of a closer sort than any words could\r\npossibly express. Our soul melts beneath the warmth of Jesus'\r\nlove, and darts upward her own love in return. Think not that I am\r\ndreaming, or am carried off by the memory of some unusual\r\nrhapsody: no, I assert that the devout soul can converse with the\r\nLord Jesus all the day, and can have as true fellowship with Him\r\nas if He still dwelt bodily among men. This thing comes to me, not\r\nby the hearing of the ear, but by my own personal experience: I\r\nknow of a surety that Jesus manifests Himself unto His people as\r\nHe doth not unto the world.\r\nAh, what sweet communion often exists between the saint and\r\nthe Well-beloved, when there is no bread and wine upon the table,\r\nfor the Spirit Himself draws the heart of the renewed one, and it\r\nruns after Jesus, while the Lord Himself appears unto the longing\r\nspirit! Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son\r\nJesus Christ. Do ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"you"})," enjoy this charming converse?\r\nNext, we have communion with Christ ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"in His thoughts, views,\r\nand purposes;"}),' for His thoughts are our thoughts according to our\r\ncapacity and sanctity. Believers take the same view of matters as\r\nJesus does; that which pleases Him pleases them, and that which\r\ngrieves Him grieves them also. Consider, for instance, the\r\ngreatest theme of our thought, and see whether our thoughts are\r\nnot like those of Christ. He delights in the Father, He loves to\r\nglorify the Father: do not we? Is not the Father the centre of our\r\nsoul\'s delight? Do we not rejoice at the very sound of His name?\r\nDoes not our spirit cry, "Abba, Father"? Thus it is clear we feel\r\nas Jesus feels towards the Father, and so we have the truest\r\ncommunion with Him. This is but one instance; your contemplations\r\nwill bring before you a wide variety of topics wherein we think\r\nwith Jesus. Now, identity of judgment, opinion, and purpose forms\r\nthe highway of communion; yea, it is communion.\r\nWe have also communion with Christ ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"in our emotions"}),". Have\r\nyou never felt a holy horror when you have heard a word of\r\nblasphemy in the street? Thus Jesus felt when He saw sin, and bore\r\nit in His own person: only He felt it infinitely more than you do.\r\nHave you never felt as you looked upon sinners that you must weep\r\nover them? Those are holy tears, and contain the same ingredients\r\nas those which Jesus shed when He lamented over Jerusalem. Yes, in\r\nour zeal for God, our hatred of sin, our detestation of falsehood,\r\nour pity for men, we have true communion with Jesus.\r\nFurther, we have had fellowship with Christ ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"in many of our\r\nactions"}),". Have you ever tried to teach the ignorant? This Jesus\r\ndid. Have you found it difficult? So Jesus found it. Have you\r\nstriven to reclaim the backslider? Then you were in communion with\r\nthe Good Shepherd who hastens into the wilderness to find the one\r\nlost sheep, finds it, lays it upon His shoulders, and brings it\r\nhome rejoicing. Have you ever watched over a soul night and day\r\nwith tears? Then you have had communion with Him who has borne all\r\nour names upon His broken heart, and carries the memorial of them\r\nupon His pierced hands. Yes, in acts of self-denial, liberality,\r\nbenevolence, and piety, we enter into communion with Him who went\r\nabout doing good. Whenever we try to disentangle the snarls of\r\nstrife, and to make peace between men who are at enmity, then are\r\nwe doing what the great Peace-maker did, and we have communion\r\nwith the Lord and Giver of peace. Wherever, indeed, we co-operate\r\nwith the Lord Jesus in His designs of love to men, we are in true\r\nand active communion with Him.\r\nSo it is ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"with our sorrows"}),'. Certain of us have had large\r\nfellowship with the Lord Jesus in affliction. "Jesus wept": He\r\nlost a friend, and so have we. Jesus grieved over the hardness of\r\nmen\'s hearts: we know that grief. Jesus was exceedingly sorry that\r\nthe hopeful young man turned away, and went back to the world: we\r\nknow that sorrow. Those who have sympathetic hearts, and live for\r\nothers, readily enter into the experience of "the Man of sorrows."\r\nThe wounds of calumny, the reproaches of the proud, the venom of\r\nthe bigoted, the treachery of the false, and the weakness of the\r\ntrue, we have known in our measure; and therein have had communion\r\nwith our Lord Jesus.\r\nNor this alone: we have been with our Divine Master_ in His\r\njoys_. I suppose there never lived a happier man than the Lord\r\nJesus. He was rightly called "the Man of sorrows"; but He might,\r\nwith unimpeachable truth, have been called, "the Man of joys." He\r\nmust have rejoiced as He called His disciples, and they came unto\r\nHim; as He bestowed healing and relief; as He gave pardon to\r\npenitents, and breathed peace on believers. His was the joy of\r\nfinding the sheep, and taking the piece of money out of the dust.\r\nHis work was His joy: such joy that, for its sake, He endured the\r\ncross, despising the shame. The exercise of benevolence is joy to\r\nloving hearts: the more pain it costs, the more joy it is. Kind\r\nactions make us happy, and in such joy we find communion with the\r\ngreat heart of Jesus.\r\nThus have I given you a list of windows of agate and gates of\r\ncarbuncle through which you may come at the Lord; but the\r\nordinance of the Lord\'s supper sets forth a way which surpasses\r\nthem all. It is the most accessible and the most effectual method\r\nof fellowship. Here it is that we have fellowship with the Lord\r\nJesus by receiving Him as our Saviour. We, being guilty, accept of\r\nHis atonement as our sacrificial cleansing, and in token thereof\r\nwe eat this bread and drink this cup. "Oh!" says one, "I do not\r\nfeel that I can get near to Christ. He is so high and holy, and I\r\nam only a poor sinner." Just so. For that very reason you can have\r\nfellowship with Christ in that which lies nearest to His heart: He\r\nis a Saviour, and to be a Saviour there must be a sinner to be\r\nsaved. Be you that one, and Christ and you shall at once be in\r\nunion and communion: He shall save, and you shall be saved; He\r\nshall sanctify, and you shall be sanctified; and twain shall thus\r\nbe one. This table sets before you His great sacrifice. Jesus has\r\noffered it; will you accept it? He does not ask you to bring\r\nanything,--no drop of blood, no pang of flesh; all is here, and\r\nyour part is to come and partake of it, even as of old the offerer\r\npartook of the peace-offering which he had brought, and so feasted\r\nwith God and with the priest. If you work for Christ, that will\r\ncertainly be some kind of fellowship with Him; but I tell you that\r\nthe communion of receiving him into your inmost soul is the\r\nnearest and closest fellowship possible to mortal man. The\r\nfellowship of service is exceedingly honourable, when we and\r\nChrist work together for the same objects; the fellowship of\r\nsuffering is exceedingly instructive, when our heart has graven\r\nupon it the same characters as were graven upon the heart of\r\nChrist: but the fellowship of the soul which receives Christ, and\r\nis received by Christ, is closer, more vital, more essential than\r\nany other.\r\nSuch fellowship is eternal. No power upon earth can\r\nhenceforth take from me the piece of bread which I have just now\r\neaten, it has gone where it will be made up into blood, and nerve,\r\nand muscle, and bone. It is within me, and of me. That drop of\r\nwine has coursed through my veins, and is part and parcel of my\r\nbeing. So he that takes Jesus by faith to be his Saviour has\r\nchosen the good part which shall not be taken away from him. He\r\nhas received the Christ into his inward parts, and all the men on\r\nearth, and all the devils in hell, cannot extract Christ from him.\r\nJesus saith, "He that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me." By our\r\nsincere reception of Jesus into our hearts, an indissoluble union\r\nis established between us and the Lord, and this manifests itself\r\nin mutual communion. To as many as received Him, to them has He\r\ngiven this communion, even to them that believe on His name.\r\nII. I have now to look at another side of communion,--namely,\r\nthe fellowship of true believers with each other. We have many\r\nways of communing the one with the other, but there is no way of\r\nmutual communing like the common reception of the same Christ in\r\nthe same way. I have said that there are many ways in which\r\nChristians commune with one another, and these doors of fellowship\r\nI would mention at some length.\r\nLet me go over much the same ground as before. We commune by\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"holy converse"}),". I wish we had more of this. Time was when they\r\nthat feared the Lord spake often one to another; I am afraid that\r\nnow they more often speak one against another. It is a grievous\r\nthing that full often love lies bleeding by a brother's hand.\r\nWhere we are not quite so bad as that, yet we are often backward\r\nand silent, and so miss profitable converse. Our insular reserve\r\nhas often made one Christian sit by another in utter isolation,\r\nwhen each would have been charmed with the other's company.\r\nChildren of one family need not wait to be introduced to each\r\nother: having eaten of this one bread, we have given and received\r\nthe token of brotherhood; let us therefore act consistently with\r\nour relationship, and fall into holy conversation next time we\r\nmeet. I am afraid that Christian brotherhood in many cases begins\r\nand ends inside the place of worship. Let it not be so among us.\r\nLet it be our delight to find our society in the circle of which\r\nJesus is the centre, and let us make those our friends who are the\r\nfriends of Jesus. By frequent united prayer and praise, and by\r\nministering the one to the other the things which we have learned\r\nby the Spirit, we shall have fellowship with each other in our\r\nLord Jesus Christ.\r\nI am sure that all Christians have fellowship together in\r\ntheir ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"thoughts"}),".

All spiritual life is one. The thoughts raised by the\r\nSpirit of God in the souls of men are never contrary to each\r\nother. I say not that the thoughts of all professors agree, but I\r\ndo assert that the minds of the truly regenerate in all sects, and\r\nin all ages, are in harmony with each other,--a harmony which\r\noften excites delighted surprise in those who perceive it. The\r\nmarks that divide one set of nominal Christians from another set\r\nare very deep and wide to those who have nothing of religion but\r\nthe name; yet living believers scarcely notice them. Boundaries\r\nwhich separate the cattle of the field are no division to the\r\nbirds of the air.

When we\r\ntalk together about our Lord, are we not agreed? When we speak of\r\nour Father, and all His dealings with us, are we not one?

This is a kind of communion which you and I cannot\r\nchoose or reject: if we are in Christ, it is and must be ours.\r\nCertain brethren restrict their communion in the outward\r\nordinance, and they think they have good reasons for doing so; but\r\nI am unable to see the force of their reasoning, because I\r\njoyfully observe that these brethren commune with other believers\r\nin prayer, and praise, and hearing of the Word, and other ways:\r\nthe fact being that the matter of real communion is very largely\r\nbeyond human control, and is to the spiritual body what the\r\ncirculation of the blood is to the natural body, a necessary\r\nprocess not dependent upon volition.

These\r\nwords in plainest terms assert that our Lord Jesus did really bear\r\nthe sins of His people. How ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"literal"}),' is the language! Words mean\r\nnothing if substitution is not stated here. I do not know the\r\nmeaning of the fifty-third of Isaiah if this is not its meaning.\r\nHear the prophet\'s words: "The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity\r\nof us all;" "for the transgression of my people was He stricken;"\r\n"He shall bear their iniquities:" "He was numbered with the\r\ntransgressors, and He bare the sin of many."\r\nI cannot imagine that the Holy Spirit would have used\r\nlanguage so expressive if He had not intended to teach us that our\r\nSaviour did really bear our sins, and suffer in our stead. What\r\nelse can be intended by texts like these--"Christ was once offered\r\nto bear the sins of many" (Heb. ix. 28); "He hath made Him to be\r\nsin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the\r\nrighteousness of God in Him" (2 Cor. v. 21); "Christ hath redeemed\r\nus from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is\r\nwritten, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree" (Gal. iii.\r\n13); "Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an\r\noffering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (Eph.\r\nv. 2); "Once in the end of the world hath He appeared to put away\r\nsin by the sacrifice of Himself" (Heb. ix. 26)? I say modestly,\r\nbut firmly, that these Scriptures either teach the bearing of our\r\nsins by our Lord Jesus, or they teach nothing. In these days,\r\namong many errors and denials of truth, there has sprung up a\r\nteaching of "modern thought" which explains away the doctrine of\r\nsubstitution and vicarious sacrifice. One wise man has gone so far\r\nas to say that the transference of sin or righteousness is\r\nimpossible, and another creature of the same school has\r\nstigmatized the idea as immoral.\r\nIt does not much matter what these modern haters of the cross\r\nmay dare to say; but, assuredly, that which they deny, denounce,\r\nand deride, is the cardinal doctrine of our most holy faith, and\r\nis as clearly in Scripture as the sun is in the heavens. Beloved,\r\nas we suffer through the sin of Adam, so are we saved through the\r\nrighteousness of Christ. Our fall was by another, and so is our\r\nrising again: we are under a system of representation and\r\nimputation, gainsay it who may. To us, the transference of our sin\r\nto Christ is a blessed fact clearly revealed in the Word of God,\r\nand graciously confirmed in the realizations of our faith. In that\r\nsame chapter of Isaiah we read, "Surely He hath borne our griefs,\r\nand carried our sorrows," and we perceive that this was a matter\r\nof fact, for He was really, truly, and emphatically sorrowful;\r\nand, therefore, when we read that "He bare our sins in His own\r\nbody on the tree," we dare not flitter it away, but assuredly\r\nbelieve that in very deed He was our Sin-Bearer.

Observe,\r\nalso, the personality from our side of the question, He "bare our\r\nsins," that is to say, my sins and your sins.

Our\r\nLord has appeared in court for us, accepting our place at the bar:\r\n"He was numbered with the transgressors."

',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"In propria\r\npersona"}),', our Redeemer has been arraigned, though innocent; has\r\ncome under the curse, though for ever blessed; and has suffered to\r\nthe death, though He had done nothing worthy of blame.

The\r\npassage before us has been forced beyond its teaching, by being\r\nmade to assert that our Lord Jesus bore our sins nowhere but on\r\nthe cross: this the words do not say. "The tree" was the place\r\nwhere beyond all other places we see our Lord bearing the\r\nchastisement due to our sins; but before this, He had felt the\r\nweight of the enormous load. It is wrong to base a great doctrine\r\nupon the incidental form of one passage of Scripture, especially\r\nwhen that passage of Scripture bears another meaning.\r\nThe marginal reading, which is perfectly correct, is "Who His\r\nown self bare our sins in His own body to the tree." Our Lord\r\ncarried the burden of our sins up to the tree, and there and then\r\nHe made an end of it. He had carried that load long before, for\r\nJohn the Baptist said of Him, "Behold the Lamb of God, which\r\ntaketh away" (the verb is in the present tense, "which taketh\r\naway") "the sin of the world" (John i. 29). Our Lord was then\r\nbearing the sin of the world as the Lamb of God. From the day when\r\nHe began His divine ministry, I might say even before that, He\r\nbore our sins. He was the Lamb "slain from the foundation of the\r\nworld;" so, when He went up to Calvary, bearing His cross, He was\r\nbearing our sins up to the tree. Yet, specially and peculiarly in\r\nHis death-agony He stood in our stead, and upon His soul and body\r\nburst the tempest of justice which had gathered through our\r\ntransgressions.\r\nThis sin-bearing is ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"final."}),' He bore our sins in His own body\r\non the tree, but He bears them now no more. The sinner and the\r\nsinner\'s Surety are both free, for the law is vindicated, the\r\nhonour of government is cleared, the substitutionary sacrifice is\r\ncomplete. He dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over Him;\r\nfor He has ended His work, and has cried, "It is finished." As for\r\nthe sins which He bore in His own body on the tree, they cannot be\r\nfound, for they have ceased to be, according to that ancient\r\npromise, "In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the\r\niniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none;\r\nand the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found" (Jeremiah i.\r\n20). The work of the Messiah was "to finish the transgression, and\r\nto make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity,\r\nand to bring in everlasting righteousness" (Daniel ix. 24). Now,\r\nif sin is made an end of, there is an end of it; and if\r\ntransgression is "finished", there is no more to be said about it.\r\nLet us look back with holy faith, and see Jesus bearing the\r\nstupendous load of our sins up to the tree, and on the tree; and\r\nsee how ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"effectual"}),' was His sacrifice for discharging the whole\r\nmass of our moral liability both in reference to guiltiness in the\r\nsight of God, and the punishment which follows thereon. It is a\r\nlaw of nature that nothing can be in two places at the same time;\r\nand if sin was borne away by our Lord, it cannot rest upon us. If\r\nby faith we have accepted the Substitute whom God Himself has ac-\r\ncepted, then it cannot be that the penalty should be twice\r\ndemanded, first of the Surety, and then of those for whom He\r\nstood. The Lord Jesus bore the sins of His people away, even as\r\nthe scape-goat, in the type, carried the sin of Israel to a land\r\nuninhabited. Our sins are gone for ever. "As far as the east is\r\nfrom the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us."\r\nHe hath cast all our iniquities into the depths of the sea; he\r\nhath hurled them behind his back, where they shall no more be\r\nseen.\r\nBeloved friends, we very calmly and coolly talk about this\r\nthing, but it is the greatest marvel in the universe; it is the\r\nmiracle of earth, the mystery of heaven, the terror of hell. Could\r\nwe fully realize the guilt of sin, the punishment due to it, and\r\nthe literal substitution of Christ, it would work in us an intense\r\nenthusiasm of gratitude, love, and praise. I do not wonder that\r\nour Methodist friends shout, "Hallelujah!" This is enough to make\r\nus all shout and sing, as long as we live, "Glory, glory to the\r\nSon of God!" What a wonder that the Prince of glory, in whom is no\r\nsin, who was indeed incapable of evil, should condescend to come\r\ninto such contact with our sin as is implied in His being "made\r\nsin for us"! Our Lord Jesus did not handle sin with the golden\r\ntongs, but He bore it on His own shoulders. He did not lift it\r\nwith golden staves, as the priests carried the ark; but He Himself\r\nbore the hideous load of our sin in His own body on the tree. This\r\nis the mystery of grace which angels desire to look into. I would\r\nfor ever preach it in the plainest and most unmistakable language.\r\nII. In the second place, briefly notice the change in our\r\ncondition, which the text describes as coming out of the Lord\'s\r\nbearing of our sins: "That we, being dead to sins, should live\r\nunto righteousness." The change is a dying and a reviving, a\r\nburial and a resurrection: we are brought from life to death, and\r\nfrom death to life.\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"We are henceforth legally dead to the punishment of sin"}),". If\r\nI were condemned to die for an offence, and some other died in my\r\nstead, then I died in him who died for me. The law could not a\r\nsecond time lay its charge against me, and bring me again before\r\nthe judge, and condemn me, and lead me out to die. Where would be\r\nthe justice of such a procedure? I am dead already: how can I die\r\nagain? I have borne the wrath of God in the person of my glorious\r\nand ever-blessed Substitute; how then can I bear it again? Where\r\nwas the use of a Substitute if I am to bear it also? Should Satan\r\ncome before God to lay an accusation against me, the answer is,\r\n\"This man is dead. He has borne the penalty, and is 'dead to\r\nsins,' for the sentence against him has been executed upon\r\nAnother.\" What a wonderful deliverance for us! Bless the Lord, O\r\nmy soul!\r\nBut Peter also means to remind us that, by and through the\r\ninfluence of Christ's death upon our hearts, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:'the Holy Ghost has\r\nmade us now to be actually "dead to sins":'}),' that is to say, we no\r\nlonger love them, and they have ceased to hold dominion over us.\r\nSin is no longer at home in our hearts; if it enters there, it is\r\nas an intruder. We are no more its willing servants. Sin calls to\r\nus by temptation, but we give it no answer, for we are dead to its\r\nvoice. Sin promises us a high reward, but we do not consent, for\r\nwe are dead to its allurements. We sin, but our will is not to\r\nsin. It would be heaven to us to be perfectly holy. Our heart and\r\nlife go after perfection, but sin is abhorred of our soul. "Now,\r\nif I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but\r\nsin that dwelleth in me." Our truest and most real self loathes\r\nsin; and though we fall into it, it is a fall,--we are out of our\r\nelement, and escape from the evil with all speed. The new-born\r\nlife within us has no dealings with sin; it is dead to sin.\r\nThe Greek word here used cannot be fully rendered into\r\nEnglish; it signifies "being unborn to sins." We were born in sin,\r\nbut by the death of Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit upon\r\nus, that birth is undone, "we are unborn to sins." That which was\r\nwrought in us by sin, even at our birth, is through the death of\r\nJesus counteracted by the new life which His Spirit imparts. "We\r\nare unborn to sins." I like the phrase, unusual as it sounds. Does\r\nit seem possible that birth should be reversed: the born unborn?\r\nYet so it is. The true ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"ego"}),', the reallest "I," is now unborn to\r\nsins, for we are "born, not of blood, nor of the will of the\r\nflesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." We are unborn to sins,\r\nand born unto God.\r\nBut our Lord\'s sin-bearing has also ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"brought us into life"}),'.\r\nDead to evil according to law, we also live in newness of life in\r\nthe kingdom of grace. Our Lord\'s object is "that we should live\r\nunto righteousness." Not only are our lives to be righteous, which\r\nI trust they are, but we are quickened and made sensitive and\r\nvigorous unto righteousness: through our Lord\'s death we are made\r\nquick of eye, and quick of thought, and quick of lip, and quick of\r\nheart unto righteousness. Certainly, if the doctrine of His\r\natoning sacrifice does not vivify us, nothing will. When we sin,\r\nit is the sorrowful result of our former death; but when we work\r\nrighteousness, we throw our whole soul into it, "We live unto\r\nrighteousness." Because our Divine Lord has died, we feel that we\r\nmust lay ourselves out for His praise. The tree which brought\r\ndeath to our Saviour is a tree of life to us. Sit under this true\r\n',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"arbor vitae"}),", and you will shake off the weakness and disease\r\nwhich came in by that tree of knowledge of good and evil.\r\nLivingstone in Africa used certain medicines which are known as\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Livingstone's Rousers;"}),' but what rousers are those glorious\r\ntruths which are extracted from the bitter wood of the cross! O my\r\nbrethren, let us show in our lives what wonders our Lord Jesus has\r\ndone for us by His agony and bloody sweat, by His cross and\r\npassion!\r\nIII. The apostle then speaks of the healing of our diseases\r\nby Christ\'s death: "By whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were\r\nas sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and\r\nBishop of your souls."\r\nWe were healed, and we remain so. It is not a thing to be\r\ndone in the future; it has been wrought. Peter describes our\r\ndisease in the words which compose verse twenty-five. What was it,\r\nthen?\r\nFirst, it was ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"brutishness"}),'. "Ye were as sheep." Sin has made\r\nus so that we are only fit to be compared to beasts, and to those\r\nof the least intelligence. Sometimes the Scripture compares the\r\nunregenerate man to an ass. Man is said to be "born like a wild\r\nass\'s colt." Amos likens Israel to the "kine of Bashan", and he\r\nsaith to them, "Ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that\r\nwhich is before her." David compared himself to behemoth: "So\r\nfoolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before Thee." We are\r\nnothing better than beasts until Christ comes to us. But we are\r\nnot beasts after that: a living, heavenly, spiritual nature is\r\ncreated within us when we come into contact with our Redeemer. We\r\nstill carry about with us the old brutish nature, but by the grace\r\nof God it is put in subjection, and kept there; and our fellowship\r\nnow is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. We "were as\r\nsheep," but we are now men redeemed unto God.\r\nWe are cured also of the ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"proneness to wander"}),' which is so\r\nremarkable in sheep. "Ye were as sheep going astray," always going\r\nastray, loving to go astray, delighting in it, never so happy as\r\nwhen they are wandering away from the fold. We wander still, but\r\nnot as sheep wander: we now seek the right way, and desire to\r\nfollow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. If we wander, it is\r\nthrough ignorance or temptation. We can truly say, "My soul\r\nfolloweth hard after Thee." Our Lord\'s cross has nailed us fast as\r\nto hands and feet: we cannot now run greedily after iniquity;\r\nrather do we say, "Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord\r\nhath dealt bountifully with thee!"']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:' "My wanderings, Lord, are at an end,\r\n    I\'m now return\'d to Thee:\r\n Be Thou my Father and my Friend,\r\n    Be all in all to me."\r\n\r\n Another disease of ours was _inability to return:_ "Ye were \n'})}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["as sheep going astray; but are now returned.\" Dogs and even swine\r\nare more likely to return home than wandering sheep. But now,\r\nbeloved, though we wandered, we have returned, and do still return\r\nto our Shepherd. Like Noah's dove, we have found no rest for the\r\nsole of our foot anywhere out of the ark, and therefore we return\r\nunto Him, and He graciously pulls us in unto Him. If we wander at\r\nany time, we bless God that there is a sacred something within us\r\nwhich will not let us rest, and there is a far more powerful\r\nsomething above us which draws us back. We are like the needle in\r\nthe compass: touch that needle with your finger, and compel it to\r\npoint to the east, or to the south, and it may do so for the\r\nmoment; but take away the pressure, and in an instant it returns\r\nto the pole. So we must go back to Jesus; we must return to the\r\nBishop of our souls. Our soul cries, \"Whom have I in heaven but\r\nThee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee.\"\r\nThus, by the virtue of our Lord's death, an immortal love is\r\ncreated in us, which leads us to seek His face, and renew our\r\nfellowship with Him.\r\nOur Lord's death has also cured us of our ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"readiness to\r\nfollow other leaders"}),'. If one sheep goes through a gap in the\r\nhedge, the whole flock will follow. We have been accustomed to\r\nfollow ringleaders in sin or in error: we have been too ready to\r\nfollow custom, and to do that which is judged proper, respectable,\r\nand usual: but now we are resolved to follow none but Jesus,\r\naccording to His word, "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them,\r\nand they follow Me. A stranger will they not follow, but will flee\r\nfrom him: for they know not the voice of strangers." For my own\r\npart, I am resolved to follow no human leader. Faith in Jesus\r\ncreates a sacred independence of mind. We have learned so entire a\r\ndependence upon our crucified Lord that we have none to spare for\r\nmen.\r\nFinally, beloved friends, when we were wandering we were like\r\nsheep ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"exposed to wolves"}),', but we are delivered from this by being\r\nnear the Shepherd. We were in danger of death, in danger from the\r\ndevil, in danger from a thousand temptations, which, like ravenous\r\nbeasts, prowled around us. Having ended our wandering, we are now\r\nin a place of safety. When the lion roars, we are driven the\r\ncloser to the Shepherd, and rejoice that His crook protects us. He\r\nsays, "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow\r\nMe: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never\r\nperish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand."\r\nWhat a wonderful work of grace has been wrought in us! We owe\r\nall this, not to the teaching of Christ, though that has helped us\r\ngreatly; not to the example of Christ, though that is charming us\r\ninto a diligent copying of it; but we owe it all to His stripes:\r\n"By whose stripes ye were healed." Brethren, we preach Christ\r\ncrucified, because we have been saved by Christ crucified. His\r\ndeath is the death of our sins. We can never give up the doctrine\r\nof Christ\'s substitutionary sacrifice, for it is the power by\r\nwhich we hope to be made holy. Not only are we washed from guilt\r\nin His blood, but by that blood we overcome sin. Never, so long as\r\nbreath or pulse remains, can we conceal the blessed truth that He\r\n"His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree, that we,\r\nbeing dead to sins, should live unto righteousness." The Lord give\r\nus to know much more of this than I can speak, for Jesus Christ\'s\r\nsake!

We beseech Him to fill the\r\nfull circle of our memory as the sun fills the heavens and the\r\nearth with light. We are to think only of Jesus, and of Him only\r\nwill I speak.

And He\r\nlaid His right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the\r\nfirst and the last: I am He that liveth, and was dead; and,\r\nbehold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell\r\nand of death."_\r\nJohn was of all men the most familiar with Jesus, and his\r\nLord had never needed to say to him, "Lovest thou Me?"

Love\r\npermits us to take great liberties: the child will climb the knee\r\nof his royal father, and no man accuses him of presuming. John had\r\nsuch love, and yet even he could not look into the face of the\r\nLord of glory without being overcome with awe. While yet in the\r\nbody, even John must swoon if he be indulged with a premature\r\nvision of the Well-beloved in His majesty. If permitted to see the\r\nLord before our bodies have undergone that wondrous change by\r\nwhich we are made like Jesus that we may see Him as He is, we\r\nshall find the sight to be more than we can bear. A clear view of\r\nour Lord\'s heavenly splendour while we are here on earth would not\r\nbe fitting, for it would not be profitable for us always to be\r\nlying in a swoon at our Redeemer\'s feet, while there is so much\r\nwork for us to do.\r\nPermit me, dear brethren, to take my text from its\r\nconnection, and to apply it to ourselves, by bringing it down from\r\nthe throne up yonder to the table here. It may be, I trust it will\r\nbe, that as we see Jesus even here, ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"we shall with John fall at\r\nHis feet as dead"}),". We shall not swoon, but we shall be dead in\r\nanother sense, most sweetly dead, while our life is revealed in\r\nHim. After we have thought upon that, we shall come to what my\r\ntext implies: then, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"may we revive with John"}),", for if he had not\r\nrevived he could never have told us of his fainting fit. Thus we\r\nshall have death with Christ, and resurrection in Him. Oh, for a\r\ndeep experience of both, by the power of the Holy Spirit!\r\nI. If we are permitted to see Christ in the simple and\r\ninstructive memorials which are now upon the table, we shall, in a\r\nblessed sense, fall at His feet as dead.\r\nFor, first, here we see ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"provision for the removal of our\r\nsin"}),', and we are thus reminded of it. Here is the bread broken\r\nbecause we have broken God\'s law, and must have been broken for\r\never had there not been a bruised Saviour. In this wine we see the\r\ntoken of the blood with which we must be cleansed, or else be foul\r\nthings to be cast away into the burnings of Tophet, because\r\nabominable in the sight of God. Inasmuch as we have before us the\r\nmemorial of the atonement for sin, it reminds us of our death in\r\nsin in which we should still have remained but for that: grace\r\nwhich spoke us into life and salvation. Are you growing great? Be\r\nlittle again as you see that you are nothing but slaves that have\r\nbeen ransomed. "God\'s freed-men" is still your true rank. Are you\r\nbeginning to think that, because you are sanctified; you have the\r\nless need of daily cleansing? Hear that word, "If we walk in the\r\nlight, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with\r\nanother," yet even then "the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,\r\ncleanseth us from all sin." We sin even when in the highest and\r\ndivinest fellowship, and need still the cleansing blood. How this\r\nhumbles us before the Lord! We are to be winners of sinners, and\r\nyet we ourselves are sinners still, needing as truly the Bread of\r\nlife as those to whom we serve it out.\r\nAh! and some of us have been very special sinners; and\r\ntherefore, if we love much, it is because we have had much\r\nforgiven. We have erred since we knew the Saviour, and that is a\r\nkind of sinnership which is exceedingly grievous; we have sinned\r\nsince we have entered into the highest state of spiritual joy, and\r\nhave been with Him on the holy mount, and have beheld His glory!\r\nThis breeds a holy shamefacedness. We may well fall at Jesus\'\r\nfeet, though He only reveals Himself in bread and wine, for these\r\nconvey a sense of our sinnership while they remind us of how our\r\nLord met our sin, and put it away.\r\nHerein we fall as low as the dead. Where is the "I"? Where is\r\nthe self-glorying? Have you any left in the presence of the\r\ncrucified Saviour? As you in spirit eat His flesh and drink His\r\nblood, can you glory in your own flesh, or feel the pride of blood\r\nand birth? Fie upon us if there mingles a tinge of pride with our\r\nministry, or a taint of self-laudation with our success! When we\r\nsee Jesus, our Saviour, the Saviour of sinners, surely self will\r\nsink, and humility will fall at His feet. When we think of\r\nGethsemane and Calvary, and all our great Redeemer\'s pain and\r\nagony, surely, by the Holy Ghost, self-glorying, self-seeking, and\r\nself-will must fall as though slain with a deadly wound. "When I\r\nsaw Him, I fell at His feet as dead."\r\nHere, also, we learn a second lesson. ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Jesus has placed upon\r\nthis table food"}),'. The bread sets forth all that is necessary, and\r\nthe cup all that is luxurious: provision for all our wants and for\r\nall our right desires, all that we need for sustenance and joy.\r\nThen, what a poverty-stricken soul am I that I cannot find myself\r\nin bread! As to comforts, I may not think of them; they must be\r\ngiven me or I shall never taste them. Brothers, we are Gentlemen\r\nCommoners upon the bounty of our great Kinsman: we come to His\r\ntable for our maintenance, we have no establishments of our own.\r\nHe who feeds the sparrows feeds our souls; in spiritual things, we\r\nno more gather into barns than do the blessed birds; our heavenly\r\nFather feeds us from that "all fulness" which it hath pleased Him\r\nto lay up for us in Jesus. We could not live an hour spiritually\r\nwithout Him who is not only bread, but life; not only the wine\r\nwhich cheereth, but consolation itself. Our life hangs upon Jesus;\r\nHe is our Head as well as our food. We shall never outgrow our\r\nneed of natural bread, and spiritually we shall never rise out of\r\nour need of a present Christ, but the rather we shall feel a\r\nstronger craving and a more urgent passion for Him. Look at yonder\r\nvain person. He feels that he is a great man, and you own that he\r\nis your superior in gifts; but what a cheat he is, what a foolish\r\ncreature to dream of being somebody! Now will he be found wanting;\r\nfor, like ourselves, he is not sufficient even to think anything\r\nof himself. A beggar who has to live on alms, to eat the bread of\r\ndependence, to take the cup of charity,--what has he to boast of?\r\nHe is the great One who feeds us, who gives us all that we enjoy,\r\nwho is our all in all; and as for us, we are suppliants,--I had\r\nalmost said mendicants,--a community of Begging Fr?res, to all\r\npersonal spiritual wealth as dead as the slain on Marathon. The\r\nnegro slave at least could claim his own breath, but we cannot\r\nclaim even that. The Spirit of God must give us spiritual breath,\r\nor our life will expire. When we think of this, surely the sight\r\nof Christ in this bread and Wine, though it be a dim vision\r\ncompared with that which ravished the heart of John, will make us\r\nfall at the Redeemer\'s feet as dead.\r\nThe "I" cannot live, for our Lord has provided no food for\r\nthe vain ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Ego"}),", and its lordliness. He has provided all for\r\nnecessity, but nothing for boasting. Oh, blessed sense of self-\r\nannihilation! We have experienced it several times this week when\r\ncertain of those papers were read to us by our brethren; and,\r\nmoreover, we shrivelled right up in the blaze of the joy with\r\nwhich our Master favoured us. I hope this happy assembly and its\r\nheavenly exercises have melted the ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Ego"}),' within us, and made it,\r\nfor the while, flow away in tears. Dying to self is a blessed\r\nfeeling. May we all realize it! When we are weak to the utmost in\r\nconscious death of self, then are we strong to the fulness of\r\nmight. Swooning away unto self-death, and losing all consciousness\r\nof personal power, we are introduced into the infinite, and live\r\nin God.\r\nII. Now let us consider how we get alive again, and so know\r\nthe Lord as the resurrection and the life. John did revive, and he\r\ntells us how it came about. He says of the Ever-blessed One,--"He\r\nlaid His right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the\r\nfirst and the last: I am He that liveth, and was dead; and,\r\nbehold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell\r\nand of death."\r\nAll the life-floods of our being will flow with renewed force\r\nif, first of all, we are _brought into contact with Jesus: _"He\r\nlaid His right hand upon me." Marvellous patience that He does not\r\nset His foot upon us, and tread us down as the mire of the\r\nstreets! I have lain at His feet as dead, and had He spurned me as\r\ntainted with corruption, I could not have impugned His justice.\r\nBut there is nothing here about His foot! That foot has been\r\npierced for us, and it cannot be that the foot which has been\r\nnailed to the cross for His people should ever trample them in His\r\nwrath. Hear these words, "He laid His right hand upon me." The\r\nright hand of His strength and of His glory He laid upon His\r\nfainting servant. It was ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"the hand of a man"}),". It is the right hand\r\nof Him who, in all our afflictions, was afflicted, who is a\r\nBrother born for adversity. Hence, everything about His hand has a\r\nreviving influence. The ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"speech"})," of sympathy, my brothers, is\r\noften too unpractical, and hence it is too feeble to revive the\r\nfainting; the ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"touch"})," of sympathy is far more effectual. You\r\nremember that happy story of the wild negro child who could never\r\nbe won till the little lady sat down by her, and laid her hand\r\nupon her. Eva won poor Topsy by that tender touch. The tongue\r\nfailed, but the hand achieved the victory. So was it with our\r\nadorable Lord. He showed us that He was bone of our bone and flesh\r\nof our flesh; He brought Himself into contact with us, and made us\r\nperceive the reality of His love to us, and then He became more\r\nthan a conqueror over us.\r\nThus, ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"we felt that He was no fiction"}),", but a real Christ,\r\nfor there was His hand, and we felt the gentle pressure. The\r\nlaying on of the right hand of the Lord had brought healing to the\r\nsick, sight to the blind, and even life to the dead, and it is no\r\nstrange thing that it should restore a fainting disciple. May you\r\nall feel it at this very moment in its full reviving power! May\r\nthere stream down from the Lord's right hand, not merely His\r\nsympathy, because He is a man like ourselves, but as much of the\r\npower of ",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"His deity"}),' as can be gotten into man, so that we may be\r\nfilled with the fulness _of God! _That is possible at this\r\ninstant. The Lord\'s supper represents the giving of the whole body\r\nof Christ to us, to enter into us for food; surely, if we enter\r\ninto its true meaning, we may expect to be revived and vitalized;\r\nfor we have here more than a mere touch of the hand, it is the\r\nwhole Christ that enters into us spiritually, and so comes into\r\ncontact with our innermost being. I believe in "the real\r\npresence": do not you? The ',(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"carnal"})," presence is another thing:\r\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.em,{children:"that"}),' we do not even desire. Lord Jesus, come into a many-handed\r\ncontact with us now by dwelling in us, and we in Thee!\r\nStill, there was something else wanted, for our Lord Jesus,\r\nafter the touch, _gave the word: _"Fear not; I am the first and\r\nthe last." What does He say? Does He say, "Thou art"? Open your\r\nTestaments, and see. Does He exclaim, "Fear not; thou art the\r\nbeloved disciple, John the apostle and divine"? I find nothing of\r\nthe kind. He did not direct His servant to look at himself, but to\r\nremember the great I Am, his Saviour, and Lord. The living comfort\r\nof every swooning child of God, of everyone who is conscious of a\r\ndeath-wound to the natural "I," lies in that majestic "I," who\r\nalone can say "I am." You live because there is an "I am" who has\r\nlife in Himself, and has that life for you.\r\n"I am the first." "I have gone before you, and prepared your\r\nway; I loved you before you loved Me; I ordained your whole course\r\nin life before you were in existence. In every work of grace for\r\nyou and within you, I am the first. Like the dew which comes from\r\nthe Lord, I waited not for man, neither tarried for the sons of\r\nmen. And I also am the last, perfecting that which concerneth you,\r\nand keeping you unto the end. I am the Alpha and the Omega to you,\r\nand all the letters in between; I began with you, and I shall end\r\nwith you, if an end can be thought of. I march in the van, and I\r\nbring up the rear. Your final preservation is as much from Me as\r\nyour hopeful commencement." Brother, does a fear arise concerning\r\nthat dark hour which threatens soon to arrive? What hour is that?\r\nJesus knows, and He will be with you through the night, and till\r\nthe day breaketh. If Jesus is the beginning and the end to us,\r\nwhat is there else? What have we to fear unless it be those\r\nunhallowed inventions of our mistrust, those superfluities of\r\nnaughtiness which fashion themselves into unbeliefs, and doubts,\r\nand unkind imaginings? Christ shuts out everything that could hurt\r\nus, for He covers all the time, and all the space; He is above the\r\nheights, and beneath the depths; and everywhere He is Love.\r\nRead on,--"I am He that liveth." "Because I live, ye shall\r\nlive also; no real death shall befal you, for death hath no more\r\ndominion over Me,--your Head, your Life." While there is a living\r\nChrist in heaven, no believer shall ever see death: he shall sleep\r\nin Jesus, and that is all, for even then he shall be "for ever\r\nwith the Lord."\r\nRead on,--"and was dead." "Therefore, though die, you shall\r\ngo no lower than I went; and you shall be brought up again even as\r\nI have returned from the tomb." Think of Jesus as having traversed\r\nthe realm of death-shade, and you will not fear to follow in His\r\ntrack. Where should the dying members rest but on the same couch\r\nwith their once dying Head?\r\n"And behold, I am alive for evermore." Yes, behold it, and\r\nnever cease to behold it: we serve an ever-living Lord. Brothers,\r\ngo home from this conference in the power of this grand utterance!\r\nThe dear child may sicken, or the precious wife may be taken home;\r\nbut Christ says, "I am alive for evermore." The believing heart\r\ncan never be a widow, for its Husband is the living God. Our Lord\r\nJesus will not leave us orphans, He will come unto us. Here is our\r\njoy, then: not in ourselves, but in the fact that He ever lives to\r\ncarry out the Father\'s good pleasure in us and for us. Onward,\r\nsoldiers of the cross, for our immortal Captain leads the way.\r\nRead once more,--"and have the keys of hell and of death." As\r\nI thought over these words, I marvelled for the poverty and\r\nmeanness of the cause of evil; for the prince of it, the devil,\r\nhas not the keys of his own house; he cannot be trusted with them;\r\nthey are swinging at the girdle of Christ. Surely I shall never go\r\nto hell, for my Lord Jesus turned the key against my entrance long\r\nago. The doors of hell were locked for me When He died on my\r\nbehalf. I saw Him lock the door, and, what is more, I saw Him hang\r\nthe key at His girdle, and there it is to this day. Christ has the\r\nkeys of hell; then, whenever He chooses, He can cage the devouring\r\nlion, and restrain his power for evil. Oh, that the day were come!\r\nIt is coming, for the dragon hath great wrath, knowing that his\r\ntime is short. Let us not go forth alone to battle with this dread\r\nadversary; let us tell his Conqueror of him, and entreat Him to\r\nshorten his chain. I admire the forcible words of a dying woman to\r\none who asked her what she did when she was tempted by the devil\r\non account of her sin. She replied, "The devil does not tempt me\r\nnow; he came to me a little while ago, and he does not like me\r\nwell enough to come again!" "Why not?" "Well, he went away because\r\nI said to him, Chosen, chosen!" "What did you mean by that?" "Do\r\nyou not remember how it is said in the Scripture, \'The Lord rebuke\r\nthee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke\r\nthee\'?" The aged woman\'s text was well taken, and well does the\r\nenemy know the rebuke which it contains. When Joshua, the high\r\npriest, clothed in filthy garments, stood before the angel, Satan\r\nstood at his right hand to resist him, but he was silenced by\r\nbeing told of the election of God: "The Lord which hath chosen\r\nJerusalem rebuke thee." Ah, brethren, when Christ\'s right hand is\r\nupon us, the evil one departs! He knows too well the weight of\r\nthat right hand.\r\nConclude the verse,--"and of death." Our Lord has the keys of\r\ndeath, and this will be a joyful fact to us when our last hours\r\narrive. If we say to Him, "Master, whither am I going?" He\r\nanswers, "I have the key of death and the spirit world. Will we\r\nnot reply, "We feel quite confident to go wherever Thou wilt lead\r\nus, O Lord"? We shall then pursue His track in His company. Our\r\nbodies shall descend into what men call a charnel-house, though it\r\nis really the unrobing-room of saints, the vestibule of heaven,\r\nthe wardrobe of our dress where it shall be cleansed and\r\nperfected. We have a fit spiritual array for the interval, but we\r\nexpect that our bodies shall rise again in the likeness of "the\r\nLord from heaven." What gainers we shall be when we shall take up\r\nthe robes we laid aside, and find them so gloriously changed, and\r\nmade fit for us to wear even in the presence of our Lord! So, if\r\nthe worst fear that crosses you should be realized, and you should\r\nliterally die at your Lord\'s feet, there is no cause for dread,\r\nfor no enemy can do you harm, since the divine right hand is\r\npledged to deliver you to the end. Let us give the Well-beloved\r\nthe most devout and fervent praise as we now partake of this regal\r\nfestival. The King sitteth at His table, let our spikenard give\r\nforth its sweetest smell.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"           C. H.
