The chanting should not be carried\r\nto the point where it seeks to rival conventional musical composition.\r\nThe dancer should be subordinated to the natural rhythms of English speech,\r\nand not attempt to incorporate bodily all the precedents\r\nof professional dancing."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Speaking generally, poetic ideas can be conveyed word by word,\r\nfaster than musical feeling.  The repetitions in the Poem Games\r\nare to keep the singing, the dancing and the ideas at one pace.\r\nThe repetitions may be varied according to the necessities\r\nof the individual dancer.  Dancing is slower than poetry and faster than music\r\nin developing the same thoughts.

Likewise the rhythms and the other elements."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Miss Dougherty is particularly illustrative in her pantomime,\r\nbut there were many verses she looked over and rejected\r\nbecause they could not be rendered without blurring the original intent.\r\nPossibly every poem in the world has its dancer somewhere waiting,\r\nwho can dance but that one poem.  Certainly those poems would be\r\nmost successful in games, where the tone color is so close to the meaning\r\nthat any exaggeration of that color by dancing and chanting\r\nonly makes the story clearer.
