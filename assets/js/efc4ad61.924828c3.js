It is\r\ntrue, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay more,\r\nI must pay three pounds sterling PER DIEM demurrage; nor can I stay\r\nupon demurrage above eight days more, and I have been here thirteen\r\nalready; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work\r\nunless I would suffer myself to be left behind here again; in which\r\ncase, if this single ship should miscarry in any part of her\r\nvoyage, I should be just in the same condition that I was left in\r\nhere at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully\r\ndelivered."  He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my\r\nvoyage; but laid it home upon my conscience whether the blessing of\r\nsaving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I had in the\r\nworld for.  I was not so sensible of that as he was.  I replied to\r\nhim thus:  "Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, to be an\r\ninstrument in God\'s hand to convert thirty-seven heathens to the\r\nknowledge of Christ:  but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given\r\nover to the work, so it seems so naturally to fall in the way of\r\nyour profession; how is it, then, that you do not rather offer\r\nyourself to undertake it than to press me to do it?"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, and\r\nputting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow.  "I most\r\nheartily thank God and you, sir," said he, "for giving me so\r\nevident a call to so blessed a work; and if you think yourself\r\ndischarged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will most\r\nreadily do it, and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and\r\ndifficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met\r\nwith, that I am dropped at last into so glorious a work."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to\r\nme; his eyes sparkled like fire; his face glowed, and his colour\r\ncame and went; in a word, he was fired with the joy of being\r\nembarked in such a work.  I paused a considerable while before I\r\ncould tell what to say to him; for I was really surprised to find a\r\nman of such sincerity, and who seemed possessed of a zeal beyond\r\nthe ordinary rate of men.  But after I had considered it a while, I\r\nasked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would\r\nventure, on the single consideration of an attempt to convert those\r\npoor people, to be locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his\r\nlife, and at last might not know whether he should be able to do\r\nthem good or not?  He turned short upon me, and asked me what I\r\ncalled a venture?  "Pray, sir," said he, "what do you think I\r\nconsented to go in your ship to the East Indies for?" - "ay," said\r\nI, "that I know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians." -\r\n"Doubtless it was," said he; "and do you think, if I can convert\r\nthese thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not\r\nworth my time, though I should never be fetched off the island\r\nagain? - nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many\r\nsouls than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the same\r\nprofession?  Yes, sir," says he, "I would give God thanks all my\r\ndays if I could be made the happy instrument of saving the souls of\r\nthose poor men, though I were never to get my foot off this island\r\nor see my native country any more.  But since you will honour me\r\nwith putting me into this work, for which I will pray for you all\r\nthe days of my life, I have one humble petition to you besides." -\r\n"What is that?" said I. - "Why," says he, "it is, that you will\r\nleave your man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to\r\nassist me; for without some help I cannot speak to them, or they to\r\nme."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could\r\nnot think of parting with him, and that for many reasons:  he had\r\nbeen the companion of my travels; he was not only faithful to me,\r\nbut sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had resolved\r\nto do something considerable for him if he out-lived me, as it was\r\nprobable he would.  Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be\r\na Protestant, it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace\r\nanother religion; and he would never, while his eyes were open,\r\nbelieve that his old master was a heretic, and would be damned; and\r\nthis might in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so\r\nturn him back again to his first idolatry.  However, a sudden\r\nthought relieved me in this strait, and it was this:  I told him I\r\ncould not say that I was willing to part with Friday on any account\r\nwhatever, though a work that to him was of more value than his life\r\nought to be of much more value than the keeping or parting with a\r\nservant.  On the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by\r\nno means agree to part with me; and I could not force him to it\r\nwithout his consent, without manifest injustice; because I had\r\npromised I would never send him away, and he had promised and\r\nengaged that he would never leave me, unless I sent him away."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational access\r\nto these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of\r\ntheir language, nor they one of his.

They soon explained their\r\ncondition to me, and showed that two of them were widowers, and the\r\nother three were single men, or bachelors.  I asked them with what\r\nconscience they could take these women, and call them their wives,\r\nand have so many children by them, and not be lawfully married to\r\nthem?  They all gave me the answer I expected, viz. that there was\r\nnobody to marry them; that they agreed before the governor to keep\r\nthem as their wives, and to maintain them and own them as their\r\nwives; and they thought, as things stood with them, they were as\r\nlegally married as if they had been married by a parson and with\r\nall the formalities in the world."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of God,\r\nand were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives; but that\r\nthe laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women\r\nand children hereafter; and that their wives, being poor desolate\r\nwomen, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help\r\nthemselves.  I therefore told them that unless I was assured of\r\ntheir honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take\r\ncare that what I did should be for the women and children without\r\nthem; and that, unless they would give me some assurances that they\r\nwould marry the women, I could not think it was convenient they\r\nshould continue together as man and wife; for that it was both\r\nscandalous to men and offensive to God, who they could not think\r\nwould bless them if they went on thus."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially Will\r\nAtkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved their\r\nwives as well as if they had been born in their own native country,\r\nand would not leave them on any account whatever; and they did\r\nverily believe that their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and\r\ndid, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and for their\r\nchildren, as any woman could possibly do:  and they would not part\r\nwith them on any account.

Indeed, I was afraid his\r\nscruples would have been carried so far as that he would not have\r\nmarried them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to say to\r\nhim, he resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily, and at\r\nlast refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had first talked\r\nwith the men and the women too; and though at first I was a little\r\nbackward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good will,\r\nperceiving the sincerity of his design."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When he came to them he let them know that I had acquainted him\r\nwith their circumstances, and with the present design; that he was\r\nvery willing to perform that part of his function, and marry them,\r\nas I had desired; but that before he could do it, he must take the\r\nliberty to talk with them.

You are not so\r\nignorant but even nature itself will teach you that all this is\r\ntrue; and I am satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it\r\nyourself." - "That is true, sir," said Atkins; "but with what face\r\ncan I say anything to my wife of all this, when she will tell me\r\nimmediately it cannot be true?" - "Not true!" said I; "what do you\r\nmean by that?" - "Why, sir," said he, "she will tell me it cannot\r\nbe true that this God I shall tell her of can be just, or can\r\npunish or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the devil,\r\nthat have been such a wicked creature as she knows I have been,\r\neven to her, and to everybody else; and that I should be suffered\r\nto live, that have been always acting so contrary to what I must\r\ntell her is good, and to what I ought to have done." - "Why, truly,\r\nAtkins," said I, "I am afraid thou speakest too much truth;" and\r\nwith that I informed the clergyman of what Atkins had said, for he\r\nwas impatient to know.  "Oh," said the priest, "tell him there is\r\none thing will make him the best minister in the world to his wife,\r\nand that is repentance; for none teach repentance like true\r\npenitents.
