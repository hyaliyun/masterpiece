Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.   In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.   The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.   Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled "}),"ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\r\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\r\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\r\nfell past it.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Well!' thought Alice to herself, "}),"after such a fall as this, I\r\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!

Let\r\nme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\r\nyou see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\r\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\r\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\r\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?'

How funny it'll seem to come out among the\r\npeople that walk with their heads downward!

Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, "}),"Do\r\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\r\nquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "}),"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\r\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\r\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\r\nhanging from the roof.\r\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\r\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\r\nother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\r\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\r\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\r\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\r\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\r\ndoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\r\nthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\r\nthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\r\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\r\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\r\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small\r\npassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\r\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\r\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\r\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\r\nshe could not even get her head though the doorway; ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, "}),"it would be of\r\nvery little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\r\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\r\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\r\nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\r\nthings indeed were really impossible.\r\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\r\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\r\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\r\ntelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words "}),"DRINK ME'\r\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\nIt was all very well to say ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  "}),"No, I'll look\r\nfirst,' she said, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked "}),"poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\r\nlater.\r\nHowever, this bottle was NOT marked ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.      *       *       *       *       *       *       *          *       *       *       *       *       *      *       *       *       *       *       *       *   "}),"What a curious feeling!' said Alice; ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I must be shutting up like a telescope.'   And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about this; "}),"for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"in my going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.   After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.   "}),"Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\r\nherself, rather sharply; ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  "}),"But it's no\r\nuse now,' thought poor Alice, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"to pretend to be two people!  Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'   Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words "}),"EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, "}),"and if it makes me grow larger,\r\nI can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\r\nunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\r\ndon't care which happens!'\r\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\r\nway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\r\nfeel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\r\nfind that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally\r\nhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\r\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\r\nthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\r\ncommon way.\r\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                       CHAPTER II\r\n                    The Pool of Tears\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); "}),"now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\r\never was!

It was as much as she could do, lying down on one\r\nside, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get\r\nthrough was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to\r\ncry again.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, "}),"a great\r\ngirl like you,' (she might well say this), ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"to go on crying in this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.   After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, "}),"Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she\r\nbe savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\r\nthat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\r\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"If you please, sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.   Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: "}),"Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday\r\nthings went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\r\nthe night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this\r\nmorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little\r\ndifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\r\nthe world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began\r\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age\r\nas herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of\r\nthem.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, "}),"for her hair goes in such\r\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm\r\nsure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,\r\noh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\r\nand--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\r\nthings I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,\r\nand four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!\r\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the\r\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\r\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\r\nand Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"'\r\nand she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,\r\nand began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\r\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"How doth the little crocodile               Improve his shining tail,             And pour the waters of the Nile               On every golden scale!

She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. "}),"That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at\r\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\r\nexistence; ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, "}),"and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'   As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, "}),"and in that\r\ncase I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\r\nbeen to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general\r\nconclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find\r\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in\r\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\r\nbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\r\nshe was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\r\nfeet high.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.  "}),"I shall be punished for it now, I\r\nsuppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\r\nthing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'\r\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a\r\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\r\nfirst she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\r\nshe remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that\r\nit was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, "}),"to speak to this\r\nmouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should\r\nthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\r\ntrying.'  So she began:  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, "}),"A mouse--of a mouse--to a\r\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\r\neyes, but it said nothing.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; "}),"I\r\ndaresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the\r\nConqueror.'

So she\r\nbegan again:  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.

There was no label this time with the words "}),"DRINK ME,'\r\nbut nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.

Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself "}),"Now I can do no more,\r\nwhatever happens.  What WILL become of me?'\r\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full\r\neffect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,\r\nand, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting\r\nout of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, "}),"when one\r\nwasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about\r\nby mice and rabbits.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.

",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.

",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I wonder what they'll do next!  As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'

"}),"So you did, old fellow!' said the others.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, "}),"If you do.  I'll set\r\nDinah at you!'\r\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\r\nherself, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, "}),"A\r\nbarrowful will do, to begin with.'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. "}),"I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead silence.   Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.  "}),"If I eat one of these cakes,' she\r\nthought, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.'   So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.   "}),"The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\r\nwandered about in the wood, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.'   It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.   An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. "}),"Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\r\nhard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\r\ntime at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\r\nwould be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\r\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of\r\nstick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\r\ninto the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,\r\nand rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice\r\ndodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\r\nover; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\r\nmade another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\r\nits hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very\r\nlike having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\r\nagain; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\r\nstick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long\r\nway back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat\r\ndown a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\r\nmouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\r\nso she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out\r\nof breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the\r\ndistance.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves:  "}),"I should have liked teaching it tricks\r\nvery much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh\r\ndear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let\r\nme see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or\r\ndrink something or other; but the great question is, what?'\r\nThe great question certainly was, what?

The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.   As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  "}),"IF I\r\ndon't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"they're sure to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?'

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.  There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.  "}),"But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked\r\ninto its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\r\nNo, there were no tears.  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,' said Alice, seriously, "}),"I'll have nothing more to do\r\nwith you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or\r\ngrunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for\r\nsome while in silence.\r\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.

"}),"How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"It's no business of MINE.'   The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed "}),"Off with her head!\r\nOff--'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.   The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said "}),"Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'\r\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Turn them over!'   The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.   "}),"Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the\r\nthree gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the\r\nKing, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  "}),"You make me giddy.'\r\nAnd then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"What HAVE you been doing here?'   "}),"May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,\r\ngoing down on one knee as he spoke, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"we were trying--'   "}),"I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the\r\nroses.  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.   "}),"You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a\r\nlarge flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered\r\nabout for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly\r\nmarched off after the others.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.   "}),"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers\r\nshouted in reply.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"That's right!' shouted the Queen.  "}),"Can you play croquet?'\r\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question\r\nwas evidently meant for her.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Yes!' shouted Alice.   "}),"Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the\r\nprocession, wondering very much what would happen next.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.   "}),"Very,' said Alice:  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"--where's the Duchess?'   "}),"Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He\r\nlooked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised\r\nhimself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and\r\nwhispered ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"She's under sentence of execution.'   "}),"What for?' said Alice.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:'Did you say "What a pity!"?\' the Rabbit asked.   '}),"No, I didn't,' said Alice:  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I don't think it's at all a pity. I said \"What for?\"'   "}),"She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a\r\nlittle scream of laughter.  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.  "}),"The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came\r\nrather late, and the Queen said--'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.   The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.   The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting "}),"Off with his head!' or ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Off with her head!' about once in a minute.   Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, "}),"and then,' thought she, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"what would become of me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'   She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself "}),"It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I\r\nshall have somebody to talk to.'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.   Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  "}),"It's no\r\nuse speaking to it,' she thought, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"till its ears have come, or at least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.   "}),"I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather\r\na complaining tone, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!'   "}),"How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Not at all,' said Alice:  "}),"she's so extremely--'  Just then\r\nshe noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so\r\nshe went on, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'   The Queen smiled and passed on.   "}),"Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and\r\nlooking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  "}),"allow me\r\nto introduce it.'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: "}),"however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.   "}),"Don't be impertinent,' said the King, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"and don't look at me like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.   "}),"A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.'   "}),"Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and\r\nhe called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"My dear!  I wish you would have this cat removed!'   The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.  "}),"Off with his head!' she said, without even looking\r\nround.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.   Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.   The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.   By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: "}),"but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.   When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.   The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.   The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.   The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.   The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)   Alice could think of nothing else to say but "}),"It belongs to the\r\nDuchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  "}),"fetch\r\nher here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.\r\nThe Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\r\nby the time he had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely\r\ndisappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down\r\nlooking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                       CHAPTER IX\r\n                 The Mock Turtle's Story\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together.   Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.   "}),"When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very\r\nhopeful tone though), ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, "}),"and vinegar that makes them\r\nsour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar\r\nand such things that make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish\r\npeople knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you\r\nknow--'\r\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a\r\nlittle startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.

And she squeezed herself up\r\ncloser to Alice's side as she spoke.\r\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,\r\nbecause the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was\r\nexactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,\r\nand it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not\r\nlike to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.

"}),"Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,\r\ndigging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:'and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves."\'   '}),"How fond she is of finding morals in things!'

Alice looked up,\r\nand there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,\r\nfrowning like a thunderstorm.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.   "}),"Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on\r\nthe ground as she spoke; ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time!

"}),"Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice\r\nwas too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her\r\nback to the croquet-ground.\r\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,\r\nand were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,\r\nthey hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a\r\nmoment's delay would cost them their lives.\r\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off\r\nquarrelling with the other players, and shouting ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Off with his head!' or "}),"Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were\r\ntaken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave\r\noff being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour\r\nor so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the\r\nKing, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of\r\nexecution.\r\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to\r\nAlice, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'   "}),"No,' said Alice.  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'   "}),"It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.   "}),"Come on, then,' said the Queen, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"and he shall tell you his history,'   As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, "}),"You are all pardoned.'  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Come, THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.   They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) "}),"Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen:  so she waited.   The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  "}),"What fun!'\r\nsaid the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"What IS the fun?' said Alice.   "}),"Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.

"}),'Everybody says "come on!" here,\' thought Alice, as she went\r\nslowly after it:  ',(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'   They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.  She pitied him deeply.  "}),"What is his sorrow?' she\r\nasked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the\r\nsame words as before, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'   So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.   "}),"This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"she wants for to know your history, she do.'   "}),"I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow\r\ntone:  ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'   So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice thought to herself, "}),"I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he\r\ndoesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "}),"I was\r\na real Turtle.'\r\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only\r\nby an occasional exclamation of ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, "}),"Thank you, sir, for your\r\ninteresting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be\r\nmore to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, "}),"we went to\r\nschool in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call\r\nhim Tortoise--'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.

"}),"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\r\nquestion,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and\r\nlooked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At\r\nlast the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:   "}),"Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe\r\nit--'\r\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.

"}),"Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; ",(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{children:"Why, what a long sleep you've had!'

So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she\r\nran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\r\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her\r\nhead on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of\r\nlittle Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began\r\ndreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--\r\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the\r\ntiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes\r\nwere looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her\r\nvoice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back\r\nthe wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and\r\nstill as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\r\naround her became alive the strange creatures of her little\r\nsister's dream.\r\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried\r\nby--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the\r\nneighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as\r\nthe March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,\r\nand the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate\r\nguests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\r\nDuchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once\r\nmore the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's\r\nslate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\r\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\r\nMock Turtle.\r\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\r\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and\r\nall would change to dull reality--the grass would be only\r\nrustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the\r\nreeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-\r\nbells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\r\nboy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\r\nall thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the\r\nconfused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the\r\ncattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\r\nheavy sobs.\r\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of\r\nhers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how\r\nshe would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and\r\nloving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about\r\nher other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager\r\nwith many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of\r\nWonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their\r\nsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\r\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\r\nTHE END"]})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,h.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>r});var o=n(96540);const a={},h=o.createContext(a);function i(e){const t=o.useContext(h);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:i(e.components),o.createElement(h.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
