On all sides the vast Rancho Los Palos Verdes cleft the\r\nhorizon: Don Mateo Castanada was one of the wealthiest grandees in the\r\nCalifornias, and his sons could gallop all day without crossing the\r\nboundary line of their future possessions. The rancho was as level as\r\nmid-ocean in a calm; here and there a wood or river broke the sweep;\r\nthousands of cattle grazed.

Roldan, like all the Californian youth, looked\r\nforward to the conscription with apprehension and disgust. Not that he\r\nwas a coward. He could throw a bull as fearlessly as his elder brothers;\r\nhe had ridden alone at night the length of the rancho in search of a pet\r\ncolt that had strayed; and he had once defended the women of the family\r\nsingle handed against a half dozen savages until reinforcements had\r\narrived. Moreover, the stories of American warfare which he had managed\r\nto read, despite the prohibition of the priests, had stirred his soul\r\nand fired his blood. But army life in California! It meant languishing\r\nin barracks, hoping for a flash in the pan between two rival houses, or\r\na possible revolt against a governor. If the Americans should come with\r\nintent to conquer! Roldan ground his teeth and stamped his foot. Then,\r\nindeed, he could not get to the battlefield fast enough. But the United\r\nStates would never defy Mexico. They were clever enough for that. His\r\nanger left him, and he gave a little regretful sigh. Not only would he\r\nlike that kind of a battle, but it would be great fun to know some\r\nAmerican boys.

And then he was a very high-spirited\r\nyoung gentleman. Although the same obedience, almost reverence, was\r\nexacted of him by his parents that was a part of the household religion\r\nin California, yet as the youngest child, who had been delicate during\r\nhis first five years, he had managed to get very badly spoiled. He did\r\nnot relish the idea of leading a life of monotony and discipline, of\r\nperforming hourly duties which did not suit his taste, above all of\r\nbeing ordered to leave his father's house as if he were a mere Indian.\r\nNo, he decided, he would not go into the army--not this year nor any\r\nother year.

Two of these horses were a beautiful\r\nbronze-gold in colour, with silver manes and tails, a breed peculiar to\r\nthe Californias; one was black, the other as white as crystal. The\r\nfamily and guests of Casa Carillo sat on their horses, in their\r\ncarretas, or stood just outside the fence surrounding the field. At one\r\nend were the several hundred Indians employed by Don Tiburcio, and\r\nseveral hundred more from the Mission. Father Osuna had also joined the\r\nparty from the Casa, and Roldan, who had seen hundreds of horse-races\r\nand was built on a more complex plan than his contemporaries, got as\r\nclose to the priest as he dared and gave him his undivided attention.\r\nPadre Osuna was a man of unusual height and heaviness of build. His\r\nblack eyes were set close to his fine Roman nose. The mouth was so\r\ntightly compressed that its original curves were quite destroyed, and\r\nthe intellectual development of the brow was very marked. His hands\r\nexerted a peculiar fascination over Roldan. They were of huge size, even\r\nfor so big a man, lean and knotted, with square-tipped fingers. The skin\r\non them was fine and brown; it looked as soft as a woman's. He used them\r\na good deal when talking, and not ungracefully; but they seemed to claw\r\nand grasp the air, to be independent of the arms hidden in the\r\nvoluminous sleeves of the smart brown cassock. Other people watched\r\nthose hands too--they seemed to possess a magnetism of their own; and\r\nevery one showed this priest great deference: he was one of the most\r\nsuccessful disciplinarians in the Department of California, a brilliant\r\nspeaker, an able adviser in matters of state, and a man of many social\r\ngraces."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:'"More agreeable to meet in the sala of the Mission than in a cave at\r\nmidnight," thought Roldan.

One caught the bear--a brown bear\r\nof moderate size--about the neck, another about a hind leg. The brute\r\ndrew his legs together like a bucking horse and leaped into the air,\r\nthen plunged toward his tormentors; but those that had him in lasso\r\ngalloped in different directions, and poor bruin was quickly strained\r\nand strangled to death. Two vaqueros were left to skin him, and the\r\nparty rode on. In a very few moments they saw a moving group some\r\ndistance ahead. Spurring their mustangs they dashed forward, letting the\r\nlassos fly. Now the sport became truly exciting and dangerous. Some six\r\nor eight brown bears, of varying sizes, growled furiously and bounded\r\ntoward the intruders. Three were caught in the meshes of the rope, the\r\nothers were making straight for the horses. There was only one thing to\r\ndo. The men put spurs and galloped rapidly away, the bears plunging\r\nheavily in pursuit. When the men had outdistanced the bears by a hundred\r\nyards or more, they wheeled suddenly and trotted back, once more letting\r\nfly the lasso. This time all but one were roped; as they kicked in fury,\r\ntheir hind legs were caught by the lariats held in reserve; and there\r\nfollowed a scene of plunging and springing, galloping, shouting,\r\ngrowling; and neighing, for the mustangs were fully alive to their part."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The one bear at liberty rode straight for Roldan."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"He had hurled his lasso with the rest, and it was trailing. He jerked\r\nabout and fled for a mile or more, holding on with his legs while both\r\nhands were occupied gathering in the rope and coiling it about the high\r\npommel of his saddle. Then he turned and charged full at the bear, who\r\nwas hot in pursuit and no mean runner. He hurled the lariat. It fell\r\nshort, and lay quivering on the ground like a huge wounded snake. Roldan\r\ngave an exclamation, of surprise as much as of dismay: he was an expert\r\nwith the rope. He turned, however, dragging it in. It caught about the\r\nmustang's hind legs. The beast went down, neighing with horror. Roldan\r\ntried to jerk him to his feet. He seemed hopelessly entangled. Roldan\r\nextricated himself, knowing that he was comparatively safe, as bears\r\nprefer horse-meat to man's. He had no sooner got his feet free of the\r\nboots than the mustang leaped to his feet and fled like a hare, dragging\r\nthe lariat in a straight line after him."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Roldan was alone, the bear not ten yards away.

But the bear gathered himself and\r\nleaped, not once but several times. There was no doubt that his blood\r\nwas up, and that he meant a duel to the death. Roldan turned with a\r\ncatching of what breath was left in him. He mechanically drew his knife\r\nfrom its pocket and flourished it at the advancing bear. Bruin cared as\r\nlittle for steel as for rope. He came on with a mighty growl."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Roldan gave one rapid glance about. There was not even a tree in sight.\r\nFrom his point of departure an object seemed approaching, but it was too\r\ndark to tell as yet whether it was a horseman or another bear. The brute\r\nwas almost on him, panting mightily. All the senses between Roldan's\r\nskeleton and his skin concentrated in the determination to live. He\r\nsprang forward and plunged his long knife into the protruding injected\r\neye of the bear, then leaped aside, his dripping knife in his hand, and\r\ndanced about the maddened beast with the agility of a modern prize-\r\nfighter. The bear, too, danced, as if obsessed by some infernal music;\r\nand the skipping, and leaping, and dodging, and waltzing of these two\r\nwould have been ludicrous had it not been a matter of life and horrid\r\ndeath. Through it all Roldan was vaguely conscious of approaching\r\nhoofbeats, but there was no room in his consciousness for hope or\r\ndespair. He was not even aware that he was panting as if his lungs and\r\nthroat were bursting, nor even that his vision was a trifle blurred from\r\nconstant and rapid change of focus and surcharged veins. But he executed\r\nhis dance of life as unerringly as if fresh from his bed and bath. The\r\nbear, a clumsy creature at best, and streaming and blinded with his\r\nblood, was slackening a little, but there was life in him yet, and twice\r\nits measure of vengeance. Suddenly he lay down, but became so abruptly\r\ninert that Roldan was not deceived. Instead of putting himself within\r\nreach of those waiting arms he fled with all his strength. It was then\r\nthat he knew how fully that strength was spent: his lungs and legs\r\nrefused to work with his will and impulse after the first hundred yards,\r\nand he fell to the ground with a sensation of utter indifference,\r\nlonging only for physical rest. He heard the bear plunging after, the\r\nloud sound of a horse's hoofs, mingled with a single shout, then gave up\r\nhis consciousness."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:'He awoke in a few moments.

At eleven the boys dressed\r\nand swung from their windows, not daring to leave by the courtyard. Nor\r\ndid they dare go to the corral and abstract three horses.

So great an air of repose did the silent walls\r\nand sleeping beasts give to the landscape that the boys felt the quiet\r\nof the night as they had not done in the other valley, and drew closer\r\ntogether, almost holding their breath lest the priests might hear it. A\r\nquarter of an hour later they were among the hills and standing before\r\nthe aperture whose secrets were known only to Padre Osuna.

The walls were veined with what\r\nappeared to be irregular bands of dirty crystal, pricked with glittering\r\nyellow. There were, perhaps, a thousand of these little points bared\r\nfrom the jealous earth, and they shone with a steady baleful glare,\r\nmagnetising six youthful eyes, stirring in three careless brains the\r\nghosts of ancient gold-lust, whose concrete substance lay in the marble\r\nvaults of Spain.
