The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.

I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms. Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean," said a Bengal Light; "I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Well, I said Pylotechnic," answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"I was saying," continued the Rocket, "I was saying - What was I saying?"'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"You were talking about yourself," replied the Roman Candle.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.

"What right have you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others. In fact, you should be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.  It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"If you want to give pleasure to others," cried the Roman Candle, "you had better keep yourself dry."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Certainly," exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits; "that is only common sense."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Common sense, indeed!" said the Rocket indignantly; "you forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for myself, I don\'t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any hearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Well, really," exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, "why not?  It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Ah! what a trivial view of life!" said the Rocket; "but it is only what I expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned. What a terrible misfortune!  Poor people, to lose their only son! It is really too dreadful!  I shall never get over it."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"But they have not lost their only son," said the Roman Candle; "no misfortune has happened to them at all."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"I never said that they had," replied the Rocket; "I said that they might.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.  But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"You certainly are!" cried the Bengal Light.

Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.  Boom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  "Good-bye," cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.  Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.  He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.

"Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer\'s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.  It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer\'s wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Ahem! ahem!" said the Rocket angrily.

I am off to look for my daughters.  I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.  Well, good-bye:  I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Conversation, indeed!" said the Rocket.  "You have talked the whole time yourself.

In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.  Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately.

A person of my position is never useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.
