In personality he differs greatly from other famous detectives.  He has neither the impressive authority of Sherlock Holmes, nor the keen brilliancy of Monsieur Lecoq.  Muller is a small, slight, plain-looking man, of indefinite age, and of much humbleness of mien.  A naturally retiring, modest disposition, and two external causes are the reasons for Muller's humbleness of manner, which is his chief characteristic.  One cause is the fact that in early youth a miscarriage of justice gave him several years in prison, an experience which cast a stigma on his name and which made it impossible for him, for many years after, to obtain honest employment.  But the world is richer, and safer, by Muller's early misfortune.  For it was this experience which threw him back on his own peculiar talents for a livelihood, and drove him into the police force.  Had he been able to enter any other profession, his genius might have been stunted to a mere pastime, instead of being, as now, utilised for the public good."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Then, the red tape and bureaucratic etiquette which attaches to every governmental department, puts the secret service men of the Imperial police on a par with the lower ranks of the subordinates. Muller's official rank is scarcely much higher than that of a policeman, although kings and councillors consult him and the Police Department realises to the full what a treasure it has in him.  But official red tape, and his early misfortune ... prevent the giving of any higher official standing to even such a genius. Born and bred to such conditions, Muller understands them, and his natural modesty of disposition asks for no outward honours, asks for nothing but an income sufficient for his simple needs, and for aid and opportunity to occupy himself in the way he most enjoys."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Joseph Muller\'s character is a strange mixture.  The kindest-hearted man in the world, he is a human bloodhound when once the lure of the trail has caught him.  He scarcely eats or sleeps when the chase is on, he does not seem to know human weakness nor fatigue, in spite of his frail body.  Once put on a case his mind delves and delves until it finds a clue, then something awakes within him, a spirit akin to that which holds the bloodhound nose to trail, and he will accomplish the apparently impossible, he will track down his victim when the entire machinery of a great police department seems helpless to discover anything. The high chiefs and commissioners grant a condescending permission when Muller asks, "May I do this?  ... or may I handle this case this way?" both parties knowing all the while that it is a farce, and that the department waits helpless until this humble little man saves its honour by solving some problem before which its intricate machinery has stood dazed and puzzled.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This call of the trail is something that is stronger than anything else in Muller's mentality, and now and then it brings him into conflict with the department, ... or with his own better nature. Sometimes his unerring instinct discovers secrets in high places, secrets which the Police Department is bidden to hush up and leave untouched.  Muller is then taken off the case, and left idle for a while if he persists in his opinion as to the true facts.  And at other times, Muller's own warm heart gets him into trouble.  He will track down his victim, driven by the power in his soul which is stronger than all volition; but when he has this victim in the net, he will sometimes discover him to be a much finer, better man than the other individual, whose wrong at this particular criminal's hand set in motion the machinery of justice.  Several times that has happened to Muller, and each time his heart got the better of his professional instincts, of his practical common-sense, too, perhaps, ... at least as far as his own advancement was concerned, and he warned the victim, defeating his own work.  This peculiarity of Muller's character caused his undoing at last, his official undoing that is, and compelled his retirement from the force.  But his advice is often sought unofficially by the Department, and to those who know, Muller's hand can be seen in the unravelling of many a famous case."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The following stories are but a few of the many interesting cases that have come within the experience of this great detective. But they give a fair portrayal of Muller\'s peculiar method of working, his looking on himself as merely an humble member of the Department, and the comedy of his acting under "official orders" when the Department is in reality following out his directions.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"THE CASE OF HE GOLDEN BULLET"}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"by Grace Isabel Colbron and Augusta Groner"}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Please, sir, there is a man outside who asks to see you."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"What does he want?" asked Commissioner Horn, looking up.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"He says he has something to report, sir."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Send him in, then."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The attendant disappeared, and the commissioner looked up at the clock.

The commissioner was not in a very good humour as he sat back to receive the young man who entered the room in the wake of the attendant.

When I returned, about half-past ten it was, I knocked at the door of his bedroom.  He didn't answer, and I walked away softly, so as not to disturb him in case he'd gone to sleep already.  The hall was dark, and as I went through it I saw a ray of light coming from the keyhole of the Professor's study. That surprised me, because he never worked as late as that before.

Then I ran to the police station.\""}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Horn was evidently as alarmed as was the young valet.  But Muller's cheeks were flushed and a flash of secret joy, of pleasurable expectation, brightened his deep-set, grey eyes.

This upper story was the apartment occupied by the owner of the house, who was now in Italy with his invalid wife.  Otherwise the dainty little villa, built in the fashionable Nuremberg style, with heavy wooden doors and lozenged-paned windows, had no occupants except Professor Fellner and his servant.  With its graceful outlines and well-planned garden, the dwelling had a most attractive appearance.  Opposite it was the broad avenue known as the Promenade, and beyond this were open fields.  To the right and to the left were similar villas in their gardens."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Dummel opened the door and the three men entered the house.

Johann turned up the light, and Horn, who had visited the Professor several times and knew the situation of the rooms, went at once to the heavy, carved and iron trimmed door of the study.  He attempted to open the door, but it resisted all pressure.  The heavy key was in the inner side of the big lock with its medieval iron ornamentation.  But the key was turned so that the lower part of the lock was free, a round opening of unusual size. Horn made sure of this by holding a lighted match to the door."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"You are right," he said to the valet, "the door is locked from the inside.

Johann disappeared, returning in a few moments with a small hatchet, and followed the commissioner through the dining-room.  It was an attractive apartment with its high wooden paneling and its dainty breakfast table.  But a slight shiver ran through the commissioner's frame as he realised that some misfortune, some crime even might be waiting for them on the other side of the closed door.  The bedroom door also was locked on the inside, and after some moments of knocking and calling, Horn set the hatchet to the framework just as the bell of the house-door pealed out."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"With a cracking and tearing of wood the bedroom door fell open, and in the same moment Muller and the physician passed through the dining-room.  Johann hurried into the bedroom to open the window-shutters, and the others gathered in the doorway.  A single look showed each of the men that the bed was untouched, and they passed on through the room.  The door from the bedroom to the study stood open.  In the latter room the shutters were tightly closed, and the lamp had long since gone out.  But sufficient light fell through the open bedroom door for the men to see the figure of the Professor seated at his desk, and when Johann had opened the shutters, it was plain to all that the silent figure before them was that of a corpse."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Heart disease, probably," murmured the physician, as he touched the icy forehead.

The eyes were glazed.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The others looked on in silence.  Horn was very pale, and his usually calm face showed great emotion.  Johann seemed quite beside himself, the tears rolled down his cheeks unhindered.  Muller stood without a sign of life, his sallow face seemed made of bronze; he was watching and listening.  He seemed to hear and see what no one else could see or hear.  He smiled slightly when the doctor spoke of "heart disease," and his eyes fell on the revolver that lay near the dead man\'s hand on the desk.  Then he shook his head, and then he started suddenly.  Horn noticed the movement; it was in the moment when the physician raised up the sunken figure that had fallen half over the desk.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"He was killed by a bullet," said Muller.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"Yes, that was it,\" replied the doctor.  With the raising of the body the dead man's waistcoat fell back into its usual position, and they could see a little round hole in his shirt.

The experienced police commissioner was pleased and yet slightly angered at this behaviour on the part of the detective.  He knew that it was quite possible that Muller had already formed a clear opinion about the case, and that he was merely keeping it to himself. And yet he was glad to see that the little detective had apparently learned a lesson from his recent mistake concerning the death of Mrs. Kniepp - that he had somewhat lost confidence in his hitherto unerring instinct, and did not care to express any opinion until he had studied the matter a little closer.  The commissioner was just a little bit vain, and just a little bit jealous of this humble detective's fame."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Muller shrugged his shoulders at the remark of his superior, and the two men stood silent, thinking over the case, as the Chief of Police appeared, accompanied by the doctor, a clerk, and two hospital attendants.

The Head of Police spoke with calm politeness, but Muller started and shivered.  The emphasis on the "here" showed him that even the head of the department had been incensed at his suggestion that the beautiful Mrs. Kniepp had died of her own free will.  It had been his assertion of this which, coming to the ears of the bereaved husband, had enraged and embittered him, and had turned the power of his influence with the high authorities against the detective.  Muller knew how greatly he had fallen from favour in the Police Department, and the words of his respected superior showed him that he was still in disgrace.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But the strange, quiet smile was still on his lips as, with his usual humble deference, he accompanied the others to the sidewalk. Before the commissioners left the house, the Chief commanded Johann to answer carefully any questions Muller might put to him."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"He\'ll find something, you may be sure," said Horn, as they drove off in the cab.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Let him that\'s his business.

"He may win more fame - he may still go on winning triumphs, but he will go on in a circle; he\'ll never forge ahead as his capabilities deserve.

Muller\'s heart has played several tricks on the police department, which has, at other times, profited so well by his genius.  He is a strange mixture.  While he is on the trail of the criminal he is like the bloodhound.  He does not seem to know fatigue nor hunger; his whole being is absorbed by the excitement of the chase.  He has done many a brilliant service to the cause of justice, he has discovered the guilt, or the innocence, of many in cases where the official department was as blind as Justice is proverbially supposed to be.  Joseph Muller has become the idol of all who are engaged in this weary business of hunting down wrong and punishing crime.  He is without a peer in his profession.  But he has also become the idol of some of the criminals. For if he discovers (as sometimes happens) that the criminal is a good sort after all, he is just as likely to warn his prey, once he has all proofs of the guilt and a conviction is certain.  Possibly this is his way of taking the sting from his irresistible impulse to ferret out hidden mysteries.  But it is rather inconvenient, and he has hurt himself by it - hurt himself badly.  They were tired of his peculiarities at the capital, and wanted to make his years an excuse to discharge him.  I happened to get wind of it, and it was my weakness for him that saved him."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Yes, you brought him here when they transferred you to this town, I remember now."'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"I'm afraid it wasn't such a good thing for him, after all.

He took a seat in the night express which rolled out from the station a few moments later.   As he was alone in his compartment, Muller gave way to his excitement, sometimes even murmuring half-aloud the thoughts that rushed through his brain.

But the two men did not appear to notice this, so greatly were they interested in the task that had brought them there.  First of all, they made a most minute examination of the two doors which had been locked.  The keys were still in both locks on the inside.  They were big heavy keys, suitable for the tall massive heavily-paneled and iron-ornamented doors.  The entire villa was built in this heavy old German style, the favourite fashion of the last few years."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When they had looked the locks over carefully, Muller lit the lamp that hung over the desk in the study and closed the window shutters tight.

His breast swelled with gratitude as he thought of the unhappy man whose life had been ruined by the careless cruelty of others and his own passions.

You can accept this present for it   comes from the hand of an honest man in spite of all.  Yes, I   compelled my wife to go to her death after I had compelled her   to confess her shame to me, and I entered her lover's house with   the knowledge I had forced from her.  When I looked through the   keyhole and saw his false face before me, I murdered him in cold   blood.  Then, that the truth might not be suspected, I continued   to play the sorrowing husband.  I wore on my watch chain the ring   I had had made in imitation of the one my wife had worn.  This   original ring of hers, her wedding ring which she had defiled,   I sent in the form of a bullet straight to her lover's heart.   Yes, I have committed a crime, but I feel that I am less criminal   than those two whom I judged and condemned, and whose sentence I   carried out as I now shall carry out my own sentence with a hand   which will not tremble.
