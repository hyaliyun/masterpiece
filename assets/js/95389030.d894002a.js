I'd frighten myself too much.  This story is about one of the shepherds who saw the angels on the first Christmas night.  He was just a youth, and he loved music with all his heart, and he longed to be able to express the melody that was in his soul.  But he could not; he had a harp and he often tried to play on it; but his clumsy fingers only made such discord that his companions laughed at him and mocked him, and called him a madman because he would not give it up, but would rather sit apart by himself, with his arms about his harp, looking up into the sky, while they gathered around their fire and told tales to wile away their long night vigils as they watched their sheep on the hills.  But to him the thoughts that came out of the great silence were far sweeter than their mirth; and he never gave up the hope, which sometimes left his lips as a prayer, that some day he might be able to express those thoughts in music to the tired, weary, forgetful world.  On the first Christmas night he was out with his fellow shepherds on the hills.  It was chill and dark, and all, except him, were glad to gather around the fire.  He sat, as usual, by himself, with his harp on his knee and a great longing in his heart.  And there came a marvellous light in the sky and over the hills, as if the darkness of the night had suddenly blossomed into a wonderful meadow of flowery flame; and all the shepherds saw the angels and heard them sing.  And as they sang, the harp that the young shepherd held began to play softly by itself, and as he listened to it he realized that it was playing the same music that the angels sang and that all his secret longings and aspirations and strivings were expressed in it.  From that night, whenever he took the harp in his hands, it played the same music; and he wandered all over the world carrying it; wherever the sound of its music was heard hate and discord fled away and peace and good-will reigned.  No one who heard it could think an evil thought; no one could feel hopeless or despairing or bitter or angry.  When a man had once heard that music it entered into his soul and heart and life and became a part of him for ever.  Years went by; the shepherd grew old and bent and feeble; but still he roamed over land and sea, that his harp might carry the message of the Christmas night and the angel song to all mankind.  At last his strength failed him and he fell by the wayside in the darkness; but his harp played as his spirit passed; and it seemed to him that a Shining One stood by him, with wonderful starry eyes, and said to him, 'Lo, the music thy harp has played for so many years has been but the echo of the love and sympathy and purity and beauty in thine own soul; and if at any time in the wanderings thou hadst opened the door of that soul to evil or envy or selfishness thy harp would have ceased to play.  Now thy life is ended; but what thou hast given to mankind has no end; and as long as the world lasts, so long will the heavenly music of the Christmas harp ring in the ears of men.'

He was poor at that time and so the father of Miss Jemima Parr did not want him for a soninlaw and told him he was not to come near the house or he would set the dog on him.  Miss Jemima Parr was very pretty and my mothers uncle Thomas was just crazy about her and she wanted him too.  She cried almost every night after her father forbid him to come to the house except the nights she had to sleep or she would have died.  And she was so frightened he might try to come for all and get tore up by the dog and it was a bull-dog too that would never let go.  But mothers uncle Thomas was too cute for that.  He waited till one day there was preaching in the Markdale church in the middle of the week because it was sacrament time and Miss Jemima Parr and her family all went because her father was an elder.  My mothers uncle Thomas went too and set in the pew just behind Miss Jemima Parrs family.

She said it was because it was so windy she was afraid she would get the tooth-ache and not because she was frightened of the ghost of the dog that haunted the bridge in Uncle James' hollow.  I did wish she hadn't said anything about the dog because I mightn't of thought about it if she hadn't.  I had to go on alone thinking of it.  I'd heard the story often but I'd never believed in it.  They said the dog used to appear at one end of the bridge and walk across it with people and vanish when he got to the other end.  He never tried to bite anyone but one wouldn't want to meet the ghost of a dog even if one didn't believe in him.  I knew there was no such thing as ghosts and I kept saying a paraphrase over to myself and the Golden Text of the next Sunday School lesson but oh, how my heart beat when I got near the hollow!  It was so dark.  You could just see things dim- like but you couldn't see what they were.  When I got to the bridge I walked along sideways with my back to the railing so I couldn't think the dog was behind me.  And then just in the middle of the bridge I met something.  It was right before me and it was big and black, just about the size of a Newfoundland dog, and I thought I could see a white nose.  And it kept jumping about from one side of the bridge to the other.  Oh, I hope none of my readers will ever be so frightened as I was then.  I was too frightened to run back because I was afraid it would chase me and I couldn't get past it, it moved so quick, and then it just made one spring right on me and I felt its claws and I screamed and fell down.  It rolled off to one side and laid there quite quiet but I didn't dare move and I don't know what would have become of me if Amos Cowan hadn't come along that very minute with a lantern.  And there was me sitting in the middle of the bridge and that awful thing beside me.  And what do you think it was but a big umbrella with a white handle?  Amos said it was his umbrella and it had blown away from him and he had to go back and get the lantern to look for it.  I felt like asking him what on earth he was going about with an umbrella open when it wasent raining.  But the Cowans do such queer things.  You remember the time Jerry Cowan sold us God's picture.

But he hadnt died and when he got back to town he went right to her house and walked in and there she was standing up to be married to the other fellow.  Poor Mr. Carlisle felt awful.

He drove over to Baywater one Saturday to visit his uncle there and came home the next afternoon, and although it was Sunday he brought a big bag of oatmeal in the wagon with him.  When he came to Carlisle church he saw that service was going on there, and he concluded to stop and go in.  But he didn't like to leave his oatmeal outside for fear something would happen to it, because there were always mischievous boys around, so he hoisted the bag on his back and walked into church with it and right to the top of the aisle to Grandfather King's pew.  Grandfather King used to say he would never forget it to his dying day.  The minister was preaching and everything was quiet and solemn when he heard a snicker behind him.  Grandfather King turned around with a terrible frown--for you know in those days it was thought a dreadful thing to laugh in church--to rebuke the offender; and what did he see but that great, hulking young Isaac stalking up the aisle, bending a little forward under the weight of a big bag of oatmeal?  Grandfather King was so amazed he couldn't laugh, but almost everyone else in the church was laughing, and grandfather said he never blamed them, for no funnier sight was ever seen.  Young Isaac turned into grandfather's pew and thumped the bag of oatmeal down on the seat with a thud that cracked it.  Then he plumped down beside it, took off his hat, wiped his face, and settled back to listen to the sermon, just as if it was all a matter of course.

She was as uncivil to him as sweet Cecily could be to anyone, but the gallant Cyrus was nothing daunted.  He laid determined siege to Cecily\'s young heart by all the methods known to love-lorn swains.  He placed delicate tributes of spruce gum, molasses taffy, "conversation" candies and decorated slate pencils on her desk; he persistently "chose" her in all school games calling for a partner; he entreated to be allowed to carry her basket from school; he offered to work her sums for her; and rumour had it that he had made a wild statement to the effect that he meant to ask if he might see her home some night from prayer meeting.  Cecily was quite frightened that he would; she confided to me that she would rather die than walk home with him, but that if he asked her she would be too bashful to say no.

I feel sure Cecily preserved it.  But she walked past Cyrus next morning at school with a frozen countenance, evincing not the slightest pity for his pangs of unrequited affection.

Cousin Annetta set out to be very refined indeed.  She pretended to have no appetite at all.  One afternoon she was invited to tea at Grandfather King's when they had some special company--people from Charlottetown.  Cousin Annetta said she could hardly eat anything.

And she picked and pecked until Grandfather King declared he would like to throw something at her.  After tea Cousin Annetta went home, and just about dark Grandfather King went over to Uncle Jeremiah's on an errand.  As he passed the open, lighted pantry window he happened to glance in, and what do you think he saw? Delicate Cousin Annetta standing at the dresser, with a big loaf of bread beside her and a big platterful of cold, boiled pork in front of her; and Annetta was hacking off great chunks, like Dan there, and gobbling them down as if she was starving.

There were more pixy babies than usual this spring, and the mothers were in a hurry for the cradles.  The tulips are the pixy babies' cradles, it seems.  The mother pixies come out of the woods at twilight and rock their tiny little brown babies to sleep in the tulip cups.  That is the reason why tulip blooms last so much longer than other blossoms.  The pixy babies must have a cradle until they are grown up.

At first we thought he had been cured by the unmerciful chaffing he had to undergo from his mates, but eventually his sister told Cecily the true reason.  Cyrus had at last been driven to believe that Cecily's aversion to him was real, and not merely the defence of maiden coyness.

I noticed it, because I had heard the girls say that Miss Reade never wore rings, not liking them.  It was not a new ring; it was handsome, but of an old-fashioned design and setting, with a glint of diamonds about a central sapphire.

Old Mr. Coles at the Harbour told me all about it. He was a young man then and he says he can never forget that dreadful time.  You know in those days hundreds of American fishing schooners used to come down to the Gulf every summer to fish mackerel.  On one beautiful Saturday night in this October of 1851, more than one hundred of these vessels could be counted from Markdale Capes.  By Monday night more than seventy of them had been destroyed.  Those which had escaped were mostly those which went into harbour Saturday night, to keep Sunday.  Mr. Coles says the rest stayed outside and fished all day Sunday, same as through the week, and HE says the storm was a judgment on them for doing it.  But he admits that even some of them got into harbour later on and escaped, so it's hard to know what to think.  But it is certain that on Sunday night there came up a sudden and terrible storm--the worst, Mr. Coles says, that has ever been known on the north shore.  It lasted for two days and scores of vessels were driven ashore and completely wrecked.  The crews of most of the vessels that went ashore on the sand beaches were saved, but those that struck on the rocks went to pieces and all hands were lost.  For weeks after the storm the north shore was strewn with the bodies of drowned men.  Think of it!  Many of them were unknown and unrecognizable, and they were buried in Markdale graveyard.

But the saddest of all the stories of the Yankee Storm was the one about the Franklin Dexter.  The Franklin Dexter went ashore on the Markdale Capes and all on board perished, the Captain and three of his brothers among them.  These four young men were the sons of an old man who lived in Portland, Maine, and when he heard what had happened he came right down to the Island to see if he could find their bodies.  They had all come ashore and had been buried in Markdale graveyard; but he was determined to take them up and carry them home for burial.  He said he had promised their mother to take her boys home to her and he must do it.  So they were taken up and put on board a sailing vessel at Markdale Harbour to be taken back to Maine, while the father himself went home on a passenger steamer.  The name of the sailing vessel was the Seth Hall, and the captain's name was Seth Hall, too.  Captain Hall was a dreadfully profane man and used to swear blood-curdling oaths.  On the night he sailed out of Markdale Harbour the old sailors warned him that a storm was brewing and that it would catch him if he did not wait until it was over.  The captain had become very impatient because of several delays he had already met with, and he was in a furious temper.  He swore a wicked oath that he would sail out of Markdale Harbour that night and 'God Almighty Himself shouldn't catch him.' He did sail out of the harbour; and the storm did catch him, and the Seth Hall went down with all hands, the dead and the living finding a watery grave together.  So the poor old mother up in Maine never had her boys brought back to her after all.

He had lived all his life in Carlisle; and all the Carlisle people knew of or about him--although they thought they knew everything--was that he was painfully, abnormally shy.  He never went anywhere except to church; he never took part in Carlisle's simple social life; even with most men he was distant and reserved; as for women, he never spoke to or looked at them; if one spoke to him, even if she were a matronly old mother in Israel, he was at once in an agony of painful blushes.

On the morning she was expected he betook himself to woods and fields, returning only at night-fall.  During his absence Mrs. Griggs was frankly wont to explore the house from cellar to attic, and her report of its condition was always the same--\"neat as wax.\" To be sure, there was one room that was always locked against her, the west gable, looking out on the garden and the hill of pines beyond.

There was a bookcase between the windows filled with choicely bound books.  Beside it stood a little table with a very dainty work-basket on it.  By the basket Mrs. Griggs saw a pair of tiny scissors and a silver thimble.  A wicker rocker, comfortable with silk cushions, was near it.  Above the bookcase a woman's picture hung--a water-colour, if Mrs. Griggs had but known it--representing a pale, very sweet face, with large, dark eyes and a wistful expression under loose masses of black, lustrous hair.

Left alone, just when the boy's nature was deepening into the man's, he turned to this ideal kingdom for all he believed the real world could never give him.  Love--a strange, almost mystical love--played its part here for him.  He shadowed forth to himself the vision of a woman, loving and beloved; he cherished it until it became almost as real to him as his own personality and he gave this dream woman the name he liked best-- Alice. In fancy he walked and talked with her, spoke words of love to her, and heard words of love in return.

It was out of place among the dim old engravings of bewigged portraits and conventional landscapes on the walls of Golden Milestone.  As he pondered the matter in his garden that evening he had an inspiration.  The sunset, flaming on the windows of the west gable, kindled them into burning rose.

Finally he saw in a store a pale blue tea-gown and the satin slippers.  He had always fancied her as dressed in blue.  He bought them and took them home to her room.  Thereafter it was sacred to her; he always knocked on its door before he entered; he kept it sweet with fresh flowers; he sat there in the purple summer evenings and talked aloud to her or read his favourite books to her.

The grass opened eyes of blue violets.  The sky was high and cloudless, turquoise-blue, shading off into milkiness on the far horizons.  Birds were singing along the brook valley.  Rollicking robins were whistling joyously in the pines.

She was like--so like; not in feature, perhaps, but in grace and colouring--the grace of a slender, lissome form and the colouring of cloudy hair and wistful, dark gray eyes, and curving red mouth; and more than all, she was like her in expression--in the subtle revelation of personality exhaling from her like perfume from a flower.

When he tried to think of the Alice he loved he saw, not the shadowy spirit occupant of the west gable, but the young girl who had stood under the pine, beautiful with the beauty of moonlight, of starshine on still water, of white, wind-swayed flowers growing in silent, shadowy places.

She would have laughed with girlish scorn at the idea.  She liked him very much; she thought his nature beautiful in its simplicity and purity; in spite of his shyness she felt more delightfully at home in his society than in that of any other person she had ever met.  He was one of those rare souls whose friendship is at once a pleasure and a benediction, showering light from their own crystal clearness into all the dark corners in the souls of others, until, for the time being at least, they reflected his own nobility.

My dreams are all I have, so I go far in them, even to dreaming that you are my wife.  I dream how I shall fix up my dull old house for you.  One room will need nothing more--it is your room, dear, and has been ready for you a long time--long before that day I saw you under the pine.  Your books and your chair and your picture are there, dear--only the picture is not half lovely enough.  But the other rooms of the house must be made to bloom out freshly for you.  What a delight it is thus to dream of what I would do for you!  Then I would bring you home, dear, and lead you through my garden and into my house as its mistress.  I would see you standing beside me in the old mirror at the end of the hall--a bride, in your pale blue dress, with a blush on your face.  I would lead you through all the rooms made ready for your coming, and then to your own.  I would see you sitting in your own chair and all my dreams would find rich fulfilment in that royal moment.  Oh, Alice, we would have a beautiful life together!  It\'s sweet to make believe about it.  You will sing to me in the twilight, and we will gather early flowers together in the spring days.  When I come home from work, tired, you will put your arms about me and lay your head on my shoulder.  I will stroke it--so--that bonny, glossy head of yours.

Why must you creep in like this to hear me and put me to shame?  Oh, I love you--I will say it, laugh as you will.  Is it such a strange thing that I should have a heart like other men?  This will make sport for you!  I, who love you better than my life, better than any other man in the world can love you, will be a jest to you all your life.

The old house was in darkness and I thought it would be a shame to rouse you all out of bed after a hard day\'s work.  So I decided that I would spend the night in the orchard.

It is a fine, airy, silver wine, such as fairies may drink at their revels, unharmed of it; but when a mere mortal sips of it, it mounts straightway to his brain, to the undoing of his daylight common sense.  However, I have got neither cold nor rheumatism, as a sensible person would have done had he ever been lured into doing such a non-sensible thing; there is a special Providence for us foolish folk.  I enjoyed my night in the orchard; for a time I was companioned by sweet old memories; and then I fell asleep listening to the murmurs of the wind in those old trees yonder.

There was no school that day, as Mr. Perkins was absent, attending a meeting of the Teachers' Convention, so we spent most of its golden hours in the orchard with Uncle Blair, listening to his fascinating accounts of foreign wanderings.  He also drew all our pictures for us, and this was especially delightful, for the day of the camera was only just dawning and none of us had ever had even our photographs taken.  Sara Ray's pleasure was, as usual, quite spoiled by wondering what her mother would say of it, for Mrs. Ray had, so it appeared, some very peculiar prejudices against the taking or making of any kind of picture whatsoever, owing to an exceedingly strict interpretation of the second commandment.

Sometimes its banks were high and steep, hung with slender ashes and birches; again they were mere, low margins, green with delicate mosses, shelving out of the wood.

But one day a youth came through the wood; he was as beautiful as the spring; he cut the brown reed and fashioned it according to his liking; and then he put it to his lips and breathed on it; and, oh, the music that floated through the forest!
