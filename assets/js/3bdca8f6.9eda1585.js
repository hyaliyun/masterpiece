During the geological epoch, when the terrestrial spheroid was still in course of formation, a thick atmosphere surrounded it, saturated with watery vapors, and copiously impregnated with carbonic acid.  The vapors gradually condensed in diluvial rains, which fell as if they had leapt from the necks of thousands of millions of seltzer water bottles. This liquid, loaded with carbonic acid, rushed in torrents over a deep soft soil, subject to sudden or slow alterations of"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"form, and maintained in its semi-fluid state as much by the heat of the sun as by the fires of the interior mass.  The internal heat had not as yet been collected in the center of the globe. The terrestrial crust, thin and incompletely hardened, allowed it to spread through its pores.  This caused a peculiar form of vegetation, such as is probably produced on the surface of the inferior planets, Venus or Mercury, which revolve nearer than our earth around the radiant sun of our system."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The soil of the continents was covered with immense forests. Carbonic acid, so suitable for the development of the vegetable kingdom, abounded.  The feet of these trees were drowned in a sort of immense lagoon, kept continually full by currents of fresh and salt waters.  They eagerly assimilated to themselves the carbon which they, little by little, extracted from the atmosphere, as yet unfit for the function of life, and it may be said that they were destined to store it, in the form of coal, in the very bowels of the earth."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It was the earthquake period, caused by internal convulsions, which suddenly modified the unsettled features of the terrestrial surface.  Here, an intumescence which was to become a mountain, there, an abyss which was to be filled with an ocean or a sea.  There, whole forests sunk through the earth's crust, below the unfixed strata, either until they found a resting-place, such as the primitive bed of granitic rock, or, settling together in a heap, they formed a solid mass."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As the waters were contained in no bed, and were spread over every part of the globe, they rushed where they liked, tearing from the scarcely-formed rocks material with which to compose schists, sandstones, and limestones.  This the roving waves bore over the submerged and now peaty forests, and deposited above them the elements of rocks which were to superpose the coal strata. In course of time, periods of which include millions of years, these earths hardened in layers, and enclosed under a thick carapace of pudding-stone, schist, compact or friable sandstone, gravel and stones, the whole of the massive forests."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And what went on in this gigantic crucible, where all this vegetable matter had accumulated, sunk to various depths? A regular chemical operation, a sort of distillation. All the carbon contained in these vegetables had agglomerated, and little by little coal was forming under the double influence of enormous pressure and the high temperature maintained by the internal fires, at this time so close to it."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Thus there was one kingdom substituted for another in this slow but irresistible reaction.  The vegetable was transformed into a mineral.  Plants which had lived the vegeta-tive life in all the vigor of first creation became petrified.

In fact, it is to its degree of power that are due the different sorts of coal, of which industry makes use. Thus in the lowest layers of the coal ground appears the anthracite, which, being almost destitute of volatile matter, contains the greatest quantity of carbon.  In the higher beds are found, on the contrary, lignite and fossil wood, substances in which the quantity of carbon is infinitely less.  Between these two beds, according to the degree of pressure to which they have been subjected, are found veins of graphite and rich or poor coal.  It may be asserted that it is for want of sufficient pressure that beds of peaty bog have not been completely changed into coal.  So then, the origin of coal mines, in whatever part of the globe they have been discovered, is this: the absorption through the terrestrial crust of the great forests of the geological period; then, the mineralization of the vegetables obtained in the course of time, under the influence of pressure and heat, and under the action of carbonic acid."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, at the time when the events related in this story took place, some of the most important mines of the Scottish coal beds had been exhausted by too rapid working.

At that time there was no other means of destroying the bad gas but by dispersing it in little explosions, before its buoyancy had collected it in too great quantities in the heights of the galleries. The monk, as we called him, with his face masked, his head muffled up, all his body tightly wrapped in a thick felt cloak, crawled along the ground.  He could breathe down there, when the air was pure; and with his right hand he waved above his head a blazing torch. When the firedamp had accumulated in the air, so as to form a detonating mixture, the explosion occurred without being fatal, and, by often renewing this operation, catastrophes were prevented. Sometimes the 'monk' was injured or killed in his work, then another took his place.  This was done in all mines until the Davy lamp was universally adopted.

Moreover, fire-damp, as well as the latter, a mixture of inflammable gases, forms a detonating mixture as soon as the air unites with it in a proportion of eight, and perhaps even five to the hundred.
