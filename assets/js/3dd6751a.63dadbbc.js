And one cried ``Ithaca!\r\n Ah, Ithaca!'' and turned his face and wept.\r\n\r\n Page: 72 \r\n Then came another - wise Telemachus -\r\n Who knelt beside the man of many days\r\n And pored upon the face; but lo, the life\r\n Was like bright water spilt in sands of thirst,\r\n A wasted splendour swiftly drawn away.\r\n Yet held he by the dead: he heeded not\r\n The moaning warrior who had learnt his sin -\r\n Who waited now, like one in lairs of pain,\r\n Apart with darkness hungry for his fate;\r\n For had not wise Telemachus the lore\r\n Which makes the pale-mouthed seer content to sleep\r\n Amidst the desolations of the world?\r\n So therefore he, who knew Telegonus,\r\n The child of Circe by Laertes' son,\r\n Was set to be a scourge of Zeus, smote not,\r\n But rather sat with moody eyes, and mused,\r\n And watched the dead. For who may brave the gods?\r\n\r\n\r\n Yet, O my fathers, when the people came,\r\n And brought the holy oils and perfect fire,\r\n And built the pile, and sang the tales of Troy -\r\n Of desperate travels in the olden time,\r\n By shadowy mountains and the roaring sea,\r\n Near windy sands and past the Thracian snows -\r\n The man who crossed them all to see his sire,\r\n And had a loyal heart to give the King,\r\n\r\n Page: 73 \r\n Instead of blows - this man did little more\r\n Than moan outside the fume of funeral rites,\r\n All in a rushing twilight full of rain,\r\n And clap his palms for sharper pains than swords.\r\n Yea, when the night broke out against the flame,\r\n And lonely noises loitered in the fens,\r\n This man nor stirred nor slept, but lay at wait,\r\n With fastened mouth.
