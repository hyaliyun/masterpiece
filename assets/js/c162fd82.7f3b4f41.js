Probably the five years known as the Golden Era of Nero had      passed when they were written: yet the text itself does not      aid such a suggestion; and the view generally taken, namely      that Lucan was in earnest, appears preferable.  There were      many who dreamed at the time that the disasters of the Civil      War were being compensated by the wealth and prosperity of      the empire under Nero; and the assurance of universal peace,      then almost realised, which is expressed in lines 69-81,      seems inconsistent with the idea that this passage was      written in irony.  (See Lecky\'s "European Morals from      Augustus to Charlemagne", vol. i.p.240, who describes these      latter verses as Written with all the fervour of a Christian      poet.

The cutting of the Isthmus of Corinth was      proposed in Nero\'s reign, and actually commenced in his      presence; but abandoned because it was asserted that the      level of the water in the Corinthian Gulf was higher than      that in the Saronic Gulf, so that, if the canal were cut,      the island of Aegina would be submerged.

Dean Merivale remarks (chapter\r\nli.) on this passage, that in the despair of another life\r\nwhich pervaded Paganism at the time, the Roman was\r\nexasperated at the Druids\' assertion of the transmigration\r\nof souls.  But the passage seems also to betray a lingering\r\nsuspicion that the doctrine may in some shape be true,\r\nhowever horrible were the rites and sacrifices.  The reality\r\nof a future life was a part of Lucan\'s belief, as a state of\r\nreward for heroes. (See the passage at the beginning of Book\r\nIX.; and also Book VI., line 933).  But all was vague and\r\nuncertain, and he appears to have viewed the Druidical\r\ntransmigration rather with doubt and unbelief, as a possible\r\nform of future or recurring life, than with scorn as an\r\nabsurdity.\r\n(20) Plutarch says the Consuls fled without making the sacrifices\r\nusual before wars.

It\r\ndoes not appear that he was there long.  A Gallic soldier\r\nwas sent to kill him; "and the eyes of Marius appeared to\r\nhim to dart a strong flame, and a loud voice issued from the\r\ngloom, `Man, do you dare to kill Caius Marius?\'"  He rushed\r\nout exclaiming, "I cannot kill Caius Marius." (Plutarch,\r\n"Marius", 38.)\r\n(2)  The Governor of Libya sent an officer to Marius, who had\r\nlanded in the neighbourhood of Carthage.  The officer\r\ndelivered his message, and Marius replied, "Tell the\r\nGovernor you have seen Caius Marius, a fugitive sitting on\r\nthe ruins of Carthage," a reply in which he not inaptly\r\ncompared the fate of that city and his own changed fortune.\r\n(Plutarch, "Marius", 40.)\r\n(3)  In the "gathering of fresh fury on Libyan soil", there\r\nappears to be an allusion to the story of Antruns, in Book\r\nIV.\r\n(4)  See Ben Jonson\'s "Catiline", Act i., scene 1, speaking of\r\nthe Sullan massacre.\r\nCethegus: Not infants in the porch of life were free.\r\n....\r\nCatiline: \'Twas crime enough that they had lives: to\r\nstrike but only those that could do hurt was dull and\r\npoor: some fell to make the number as some the prey.\r\n(5)  Whenever he did not salute a man, or return his salute, this\r\nwas a signal for massacre. (Plutarch, "Marius", 49.)\r\n(6)  The Marian massacre was in B.C. 87-86; the Sullan in 82-81.\r\n(7)  The head of Antonius was struck off and brought to Marius at\r\nsupper.  He was the grandfather of the triumvir.\r\n(8)  Scaevola, it would appear, was put to death after Marius the\r\nelder died, by the younger Marius.  He was Pontifex Maximus,\r\nand slain by the altar of Vesta.\r\n(9)  B.C. 86, Marius and Cinna were Consuls.  Marius died\r\nseventeen days afterwards, in the seventieth year of his\r\nage.\r\n(10) The Battle of Sacriportus was fought between Marius the\r\nyounger and the Sullan army in B.C. 82.  Marius was defeated\r\nwith great loss, and fled to Praeneste, a town which\r\nafterwards submitted to Sulla, who put all the inhabitants\r\nto death (line 216).  At the Colline gate was fought the\r\ndecisive battle between Sulla and the Saranires, who, after\r\na furious contest, were defeated.\r\n(11) Diomedes was said to feed his horses on human flesh. (For\r\nAntaeus see Book IV., 660.)  Enomaus was king of Pisa in\r\nElis.

It was in\r\nreference to this that Caesar charged him with making a\r\ntraffic of his marriage; but Plutarch says "to accuse Cato\r\nof filthy lucre is like upbraiding Hercules with cowardice."\r\nAfter the marriage Marcia remained at Rome while Cato\r\nhurried after Pompeius.\r\n(15) The bride was carried over the threshold of her new home,\r\nfor to stumble on it would be of evil omen.  Plutarch\r\n("Romulus") refers this custom to the rape of the Sabine\r\nwomen, who were "so lift up and carried away by force."\r\n(North, volume i., p. 88, Edition by Windham.)  I have read\r\n"vetuit" in this passage, though "vitat" appears to be a\r\nbetter variation according to the manuscripts.\r\n(16) The bride was dressed in a long white robe, bound round the\r\nwaist with a girdle.

When the Parthian war broke out and the\r\nSenate required each of the two leaders to supply a legion\r\nfor it, Pompeius demanded the return of the legion which he\r\nhad sent to Gaul; and Caesar returned it, together with one\r\nof his own.

The war with Sertorius lasted till 71\r\nB.C., when Pompeius and Metellus triumphed in respect of his\r\noverthrow.\r\n(28) See Book I., line 369.\r\n(29) In B.C. 67, Pompeius swept the pirates off the seas.

"Its first emotion seemed to\r\nbe astonishment mixed with anger; its hair became erect; in\r\nan instant it slipped behind the reptile, and with\r\nremarkable swiftness and agility leaped upon its head,\r\nseized it and crushed it with its teeth."\r\n(26) Reading "arce", not "arte".  The word "signifer" seems to\r\nfavour the reading I have preferred; and Dean Merivale and\r\nHosius adopted it.\r\n(27) For the character and career of Curio, see Merivale\'s\r\n"History of the Roman Empire", chapter xvi.  He was of\r\nprofligate character, but a friend and pupil of Cicero; at\r\nfirst a rabid partisan of the oligarchy, he had, about the\r\nperiod of his tribuneship (B.C. 50-49), become a supporter\r\nof Caesar.  How far Gaulish gold was the cause of this\r\nconversion we cannot tell. It is in allusion to this change\r\nthat he was termed the prime mover of the civil war.  His\r\narrival in Caesar\'s camp is described in Book I., line 303.\r\nHe became Caesar\'s chief lieutenant in place of the deserter\r\nLabienus; and, as described in Book III., was sent to\r\nSardinia and Sicily, whence he expelled the senatorial\r\nforces.  His final expedition to Africa, defeat and death,\r\nform the subject of the latter part of this book.  Mommsen\r\ndescribes him as a man of talent, and finds a resemblance\r\nbetween him and Caesar.

But they were to be regarded as exiles,\r\nhaving lost their rights, rather than the Senators in\r\nEpirus, who were in full possession of theirs.\r\n(4)  Dean Merivale says that probably Caesar\'s Senate was not\r\nless numerous than his rival\'s.  Duruy says there were\r\nsenators in Pompeius\' camp, out of a total of between 500\r\nand 600.  Mommsen says, "they were veritably emigrants.\r\nThis Roman Coblentz presented a pitiful spectacle of the\r\nhigh pretensions and paltry performances of the grandees of\r\nRome." (Vol. iv., p. 397.)  Almost all the Consulars were\r\nwith Pompeius.\r\n(5)  By the will of Ptolemy Auletes, Cleopatra had been appointed\r\njoint sovereign of Egypt with her young brother.

The reference is to the\r\nanswer given by the oracle to the Athenians that their\r\nwooden walls would keep them safe; which Themistocles\r\ninterpreted as meaning their fleet.\r\n(12) Cicero, on the contrary, suggests that the reason why the\r\noracles ceased was this, that men became less credulous.\r\n("De Div.", ii., 57)  Lecky, "History of European Morals\r\nfrom Augustus to Charlemagne", vol. i., p. 368.\r\n(13) This name is one of those given to the Cumaean Sibyl\r\nmentioned at line 210.

(Caesar, "De Bello Civili", iii., 1; Merivale,\r\nchapter xvi.)\r\n(24) In the time of the Empire, the degraded Consulship,\r\npreserved only as a name, was frequently transferred\r\nmonthly, or even shorter, intervals from one favourite to\r\nanother.\r\n(25) Caesar performed the solemn rites of the great Latin\r\nfestival on the Alban Mount during his Dictatorship.\r\n(Compare Book VII., line 471.)\r\n(26) Dyrrhachium was founded by the Corcyreams, with whom the\r\nHomeric Phaeacians have been identified.\r\n(27) Apparently making the Danube discharge into the Sea of Azov.\r\nSee Mr. Heitland\'s Introduction, p. 53.\r\n(28) At the foot of the Acroceraunian range.\r\n(29) Caesar himself says nothing of this adventure.

The victors' shout\r\nGlad to the sky arose; no greater joy\r\nA little blood could give them had they seen\r\nThat Caesar's self was wounded.

After Hercules had been married to Deianira, and\r\nwhen they were on a journey, they came to the River Evenus.\r\nHere Nessus, a Centaur, acted as ferryman, and Hercules bade\r\nhim carry Deianira across.

("Pompeius", 76).  Mommsen\r\n(vol. iv., pp. 421-423) discusses the subject, and says that\r\nfrom Parthia only could Pompeius have attempted to seek\r\nsupport, and that such an attempt, putting the objections to\r\nit aside, would probably have failed.  Lucan\'s sympathies\r\nwere probably with Lentulus.\r\n(12) Probably Lucius Lentulus Crus, who had been Consul, for B.C.\r\n49, along with Caius Marcellus. (See Book V., 9.)  He was\r\nmurdered in Egypt by Ptolemy\'s ministers.\r\n(13) That is, be as easily defended.\r\n(14) Thus rendered by Sir Thomas May, of the Long Parliament:\r\n"Men used to sceptres are ashamed of nought:\r\nThe mildest governement a kingdome finds\r\nUnder new kings."\r\n(15) That is, he reached the most eastern mouth of the Nile\r\ninstead of the western.\r\n(16) At Memphis was the well in which the rise and fall of the\r\nwater acted as a Nilometer (Mr. Haskins\'s note).\r\n(17) Comp.

His appearance was the occasion of general rejoicing.\r\nCambyses slew the Apis which came in his time, and for this\r\ncause became mad, as the Egyptians said.\r\n(18) That is, by Achoreus, who had just spoken.\r\n(19) Compare Ben Jonson\'s "Sejanus", Act ii., Scene 2: --\r\nThe prince who shames a tyrant\'s name to bear\r\nShall never dare do anything, but fear;\r\nAll the command of sceptres quite doth perish\r\nIf it begin religious thoughts to cherish;\r\nWhole empires fall, swayed by these nice respects,\r\nIt is the licence of dark deeds protects\r\nE\'en states most hated, when no laws resist\r\nThe sword, but that it acteth what it list."\r\n(20) He was drowned in attempting to escape in the battle on the\r\nNile in the following autumn.\r\n(21) Dionysus.

Lentulus, Proconsul of Cilicia. (Mr. Haskins\'\r\nnote.  See also Mommsen, vol. iv., p. 305.)  It seems to\r\nhave been discovered in the Sibylline books at the time when\r\nit was desired to prevent Pompeius from interfering in the\r\naffairs of Egypt, in B.C. 57.\r\n(24) That is, by their weeping for Iris departure they treated\r\nhim as a mortal and not as a god.  Osiris was the soul of\r\nApis (see on line 537), and when that animal grew old and\r\nunfit for the residence of Osiris the latter was thought to\r\nquit it.  Then began the weeping. which continued until a\r\nnew Apis appeared, selected, of course, by Osiris for his\r\ndwelling-place.  Then they called out "We have found him,\r\nlet us rejoice."  For a discussion on the Egyptian\r\nconception of Osiris, and Iris place in the theogony of that\r\nnation, see Hegel\'s "Lectures on the Philosophy of History":\r\nChapter on Egypt.\r\n(25) It may be noted that the Emperor Hadrian raised a monument\r\non the spot to the memory of Pompeius some sixty years after\r\nthis was written (Durny\'s \'History of Rome,\' iii., 319).\r\nPlutarch states that Cornelia had the remains taken to Rome\r\nand interred in a mausoleum.

(See Book IX., 777.)\r\n(12) That is, at the autumnal equinox.  The priest states that\r\nthe planet Mercury causes the rise of the Nile.  The passage\r\nis difficult to follow; but the idea would seem to be that\r\nthis god, who controlled the rise and fall of the waves of\r\nthe sea, also when he was placed directly over the Nile\r\ncaused the rise of that river.\r\n(13) So also Herodotus, Book ii., 22.
