He was educated at Meissen   and Leipzic, and began writing for the stage before he was twenty.   In 1748 he went to Berlin, where he met Voltaire and for a time   was powerfully influenced by him. The most important product of   this period was his tragedy of "Miss Sara Samson," a modern   version of the story of Medea, which began the vogue of the   sentimental middle-class play in Germany. After a second sojourn   in Leipzic (1755-1758), during which he wrote criticism, lyrics,   and fables, Lessing returned to Berlin and began to publish his   "Literary Letters," making himself by the vigor and candor of his   criticism a real force in contemporary literature. From Berlin he   went to Breslau, where he made the first sketches of two of his   greatest works, "Laocoon" and "Minna von Barnhelm," both of which   were issued after his return to the Prussian capital. Failing in   his effort to be appointed Director of the Royal Library by   Frederick the Great, Lessing went to Hamburg in 1767 as critic of   a new national theatre, and in connection with this enterprise he   issued twice a week the "Hamburgische Dramaturgie," the two   volumes of which are a rich mine of dramatic criticism and theory.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'His next residence was at Wolfenbuttel, where he had charge of the   ducal library from 1770 till his death in 1781. Here he wrote his   tragedy of "Emilia Galotti," founded on the story of Virginia, and   engaged for a time in violent religious controversies, one   important outcome of which was his "Education of the Human Race."   On being ordered by the Brunswick authorities to give up   controversial writing, he found expression for his views in his   play "Nathan the Wise," his last great production.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'The importance of Lessing\'s masterpiece in comedy, "Minna von   Barnhelm," is difficult to exaggerate. It was the beginning of   German national drama; and by the patriotic interest of its   historical background, by its sympathetic treatment of the German   soldier and the German woman, and by its happy blending of the   amusing and the pathetic, it won a place in the national heart   from which no succeeding comedy has been able to dislodge it.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MINNA VON BARNHELM OR THE SOLDIER'S FORTUNE"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"DRAMATIS PERSONAE"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MAJOR VON TELLHEIM, a discharged officer.

It speaks for itself. As if you could be guilty of such an unworthy act, as not to take me! Do you know that I should be pointed at for the rest of my life? My countrywomen would talk about me, and say. "That is she, that is the Fraulein von Barnhelm, who fancied that because she was rich could marry the noble Tellheim; as if such men were to be caught with money." That is what they would say, for they are all envious of me.

If I mistake not, you told me something of the kind this forenoon. Therein is good and evil mixed. Let us examine each charge more closely. You are discharged? So you say.

You talk as a man must talk, to whom in return the great are quite superfluous. And never were they more so than now. I return my best thanks to the great ones that they have given up their claims to a man whom I would very unwillingly have shared with them. I am your sovereign, Tellheim; you want no other master. To find you discharged, is a piece of good fortune I dared scarcely dream of! But you are not only discharged; you are more. And what are you more? A cripple, you say! Well! (looking at him from head to foot), the cripple is tolerably whole and upright--appears still to be pretty well, and strong. Dear Tellheim, if you expect to go begging on the strength of your limbs, I prophesy that you will be relieved at very few doors; except at the door of a good-natured girl like myself."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MAJ. T. I only hear the joking girl now, dear Minna."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'MIN. And I only hear the "dear Minna" in your chiding.

I am so much the more secure from your blows.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MAJ. T. Madam!"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:'MIN. You would say, "You are so much the less secure from mine."

I only lament that I cannot laugh with you."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MIN. Why not? What have you to say against laughing? Cannot one be very serious even whilst laughing? Dear Major, laughter keeps us more rational than vexation. The proof is before us. Your laughing friend judges of your circumstances more correctly than you do yourself. Because you are discharged, you say your honour is sullied; because you are wounded in the arm, you call yourself a cripple. Is that right? Is that no exaggeration? And is it my doing that all exaggerations are so open to ridicule? I dare say, if I examine your beggary that it will also be as little able to stand the test. You may have lost your equipage once, twice, or thrice; your deposits in the hands of this or that banker may have disappeared together with those of other people; you may have no hope of seeing this or that money again which you may have advanced in the service; but are you a beggar on that account?

If you had but read my letter, Madam!"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MIN. Well, I did read it. But what I read in it, on this point, is a perfect riddle. It is impossible that any one should wish to turn a noble action into a crime. But explain to me, dear Major."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MAJ. T. You remember, Madam, that I had orders to collect the contribution for the war most strictly in cash in all the districts in your neighbourhood. I wished to forego this severity, and advanced the money that was deficient myself."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MIN. I remember it well. I loved you for that deed before I had seen you."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MAJ. T. The government gave me their bill, and I wished, at the signing of the peace, to have the sum entered amongst the debts to be repaid by them. The bill was acknowledged as good, but my ownership of the same was disputed. People looked incredulous, when I declared that I had myself advanced the amount in cash. It was considered as bribery, as a douceur from the government, because I at once agreed to take the smallest sum with which I could have been satisfied in a case of the greatest exigency. Thus the bill went from my possession, and if it be paid, will certainly not be paid to me. Hence, Madam, I consider my honour to be suspected! not on account of my discharge, which, if I had not received, I should have applied for. You look serious, Madam! Why do you not laugh? Ha! ha! ha! I am laughing."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MIN. Oh! stifle that laugh, Tellheim, I implore you! It is the terrible laugh of misanthropy. No, you are not the man to repent of a good deed, because it may have had a bad result for yourself. Nor can these consequences possibly be of long duration. The truth must come to light.

But, viewing the matter in the worst light, if they are determined to mistake your character here, with us you will not be misunderstood. No, we cannot, we will not, misunderstand you, Tellheim. And if our government has the least sentiment of honour, I know what it must do. But I am foolish; what would that matter? Imagine, Tellheim, that you have lost the two thousand pistoles on some gay evening. The king was an unfortunate card for you: the queen (pointing to herself) will be so much the more favourable. Providence, believe me, always indemnifies a man of honour--often even beforehand. The action which was to cost you two thousand pistoles, gained you me. Without that action, I never should have been desirous of making your acquaintance. You know I went uninvited to the first party where I thought I should meet you. I went entirely on your account. I went with a fixed determination to love you--I loved you already! with the fixed determination to make you mine, if I should find you as dark and ugly as the Moor of Venice. So dark and ugly you are not; nor will you be so jealous. But, Tellheim, Tellheim, you are yet very like him! Oh! the unmanageable, stubborn man, who always keeps his eye fixed upon the phantom of honour, and becomes hardened against every other sentiment! Your eyes this way! Upon me,--me, Tellheim!

The impulse of self-preservation awakes, when I have something more precious than myself to support, and to support through my own exertions. Do not let the word "pity" offend you. From the innocent cause of our distress we may hear the term without humiliation. I am this cause; through me, Minna, have you lost friends and relations, fortune and country.
