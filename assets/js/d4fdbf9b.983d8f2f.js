Drawing off his hat he stretched out his arms to meet it, and his eyes closed as the cool wind struck his throat and face and lifted the hair from his forehead. About him the mountains lay like a tumultuous sea-the Jellico Spur, stilled gradually on every side into vague, purple shapes against the broken rim of the sky, and Pine Mountain and the Cumberland Range racing in like breakers from the north.  Under him lay Jellico Valley, and just visible in a wooded cove, whence Indian Creek crept into sight, was a mining-camp-a cluster of white cabins-from which he had climbed that afternoon. At that distance the wagon-road narrowed to a bridle-path, and the figure moving slowly along it and entering the forest at the base of the mountain was shrunk to a toy.  For a moment Clayton stood with his face to the west, drinking in the air; then tightening his belt, he caught the pliant body of a sapling and swung loose from the rock.  As the tree flew back, his dog sprang after him. The descent was sharp. At times he was forced to cling to the birch-tops till they lay flat on the mountain-side."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Breathless, he reached at last a bowlder from which the path was easy to the valley below, and he leaned quivering against the soft rug of moss and lichens that covered it.  The shadows had crept from the foot of the mountains, darkening the valley, and lifting up the mountain-side beneath him a long, wavering line in which met the cool, deep green of the shade and the shining bronze where the sunlight still lay.  Lazily following this line, his eye caught two moving shadows that darted jagged shapes into the sunlight and as quickly withdrew them.  As the road wound up toward him, two figures were soon visible through the undergrowth.  Presently a head bonneted in blue rose above the bushes, and Clayton's half-shut eyes opened wide and were fixed with a look of amused expectancy where a turn of the path must bring rider and beast into plain sight.  Apparently some mountain girl, wearied by the climb or in a spirit of fun, had mounted her cow while driving it home; and with a smile at the thought of the confusion he would cause her, Clayton stepped around the bowlder and waited. With the slow, easy swing of climbing cattle, the beast brought its rider into view.  A bag of meal lay across its shoulders, and behind this the girl-for she was plainly young-sat sidewise, with her bare feet dangling against its flank.  Her face was turned toward the valley below, and her loosened bonnet half disclosed a head of bright yellow hair."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Catching sight of Clayton, the beast stopped and lifted its head, not the meek, patient face he expected to see, but a head that was wrinkled and vicious-the head of a bull.  Only the sudden remembrance of a dead mountain custom saved him from utter amazement.  He had heard that when beasts of burden were scarce, cows, and especially bulls, were worked in ploughs and ridden by the mountaineers, even by the women.  But this had become a tradition, the humor of which greater prosperity and contact with a new civilization had taught even the mountain people to appreciate.  The necessities of this girl were evidently as great as her fear of ridicule seemed small.  When the brute stopped, she began striking him in the flank with her bare heel, without looking around, and as he paid no attention to such painless goading, she turned with sudden impatience and lifted a switch above his shoulders.  The stick was arrested in mid-air when she saw Clayton, and then dropped harmlessly.  The quick fire in her eyes died suddenly away, and for a moment the two looked at each other with mutual curiosity, but only for a moment.  There was something in Clayton's gaze that displeased her.  Her face clouded, and she dropped her eyes."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"G\'long," she said, in a low tone.

The bag had fallen, and had broken open, and some of the meal was spilled on the ground.  The girl, flushed and angry, stood above it."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Look thar, now," she said.

She had looked him straight in the face with steady eyes, and had spoken as though her sway over mountain and road were undisputed and he had been a wretched trespasser.  She paid no attention to his apologies, and she scorned his offers of assistance.  She seemed no more angered by the loss of the meal than by his incapacity to manage his dog, which seemed to typify to her his general worthlessness.  He had been bruised by his fall, and she did not even ask if he were hurt.  Indeed, she seemed not to care, and she had ridden away from him as though he were worth no more consideration than the stone under him."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"He was amused, and a trifle irritated.  How could there be such a curious growth in the mountains? he questioned, as he rose and continued the descent.  There was an unusual grace about her, in spite of her masculine air. Her features were regular, the nose straight and delicate, the mouth resolute, the brow broad, and the eyes intensely blue, perhaps tender, when not flashing with anger, and altogether without the listless expression he had marked in other mountain women, and which, he had noticed, deadened into pathetic hopelessness later in life.  Her figure was erect, and her manner, despite its roughness, savored of something high-born.  Where could she have got that bearing?  She belonged to a race whose descent, he had heard, was unmixed English; upon whose lips lingered words and forms of speech that Shakespeare had heard and used.  Who could tell what blood ran in her veins?"}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Musing, he had come almost unconsciously to a spur of the mountains under which lay the little mining-camp.  It was six o'clock, and the miners, grim and black, each with a pail in hand and a little oil-lamp in his cap, were going down from work.  A shower had passed over the mountains above him, and the last sunlight, coming through a gap in the west, struck the rising mist and turned it to gold.  On a rock which thrust from the mountain its gray, sombre face, half embraced by a white arm of the mist, Clayton saw the figure of a woman.  He waved his hat, but the figure stood motionless, and he turned into the woods toward the camp."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'It was the girl; and when Clayton disappeared she too turned and went on her way.  She had stopped there because she knew he must pass a point where she might see him again.  She was little less indifferent than she seemed; her motive was little more than curiosity.  She had never seen that manner of man before.  Evidently he was a " furriner "from the " settlemints."  No man in the mountains had a smooth, round face like his, or wore such a queer hat, such a soft, white shirt, and no  galluses," or carried such a shiny, weak-looking stick, or owned a dog that he couldn\'t make mind him.  She was not wholly contemptuous, however.  She had felt vaguely the meaning of his politeness and deference.  She was puzzled and pleased, she scarcely knew why.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"He was mighty accomodatin\'," she thought. But whut," she asked herself as she rode slowly homeward-" whut did he take off his hat fer'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"II"}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"LIGHTS twinkled from every cabin as Clayton passed through the camp. Outside the kitchen doors, miners, bare to the waist, were bathing their blackened faces and bodies, with children, tattered and unclean, but healthful, playing about them; within, women in loose gowns, with sleeves unrolled and with disordered hair, moved like phantoms through clouds of savory smoke.  The commissary was brilliantly lighted.  At a window close by improvident miners were drawing the wages of the day, while their wives waited in the store with baskets unfilled.  In front of the commissary a crowd of negroes were talking, laughing, singing, and playing pranks like children. Here two, with grinning faces, were squared off, not to spar, but to knock at each other's tattered hat; there two more, with legs and arms indistinguishable, were wrestling; close by was the sound of a mouth-harp, a circle of interested spectators, and, within, two dancers pitted against each other, and shuffling with a zest that labor seemed never to affect."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Immediately after supper Clayton went to his room, lighted his lamp, and sat down to a map he was tracing.  His room was next the ground, and a path ran near the open window.  As he worked, every passer-by would look curiously within.  On the wall above his head a pair of fencing-foils were crossed under masks.  Below these hung two pistols, such as courteous Claude Duval used for side-arms.  Opposite were two old rifles, and beneath them two stone beer-mugs, and a German student's pipe absurdly long and richly ornamented.  A mantel close by was filled with curiosities, and near it hung a banjo unstrung, a tennis-racket, and a blazer of startling colors.  Plainly they were relics of German student life, and the odd contrast they made with the rough wall and ceiling suggested a sharp change in the fortunes of the young worker beneath.  Scarcely six months since he had been suddenly summoned home from Germany.  The reason was vague, but having read of recent American failures, notably in Wall Street, he knew what had happened. Reaching New York, he was startled by the fear that his mother was dead, so gloomy was the house, so subdued his sister's greeting, and so worn and sad his father's face.  The trouble, however, was what he had guessed, and he had accepted it with quiet resignation.  The financial wreck seemed complete; but one resource, however, was left.  Just after the war Clayton's father had purchased mineral lands in the South, and it was with the idea of developing these that he had encouraged the marked scientific tastes of his son, and had sent him to a German university.  In view of his own disaster, and the fact that a financial tide was swelling southward, his forethought seemed an inspiration.  To this resource Clayton turned eagerly; and after a few weeks at home, which were made intolerable by straitened circumstances, and the fancied coldness of friend and acquaintance, he was hard at work in the heart of the Kentucky mountains."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The transition from the careless life of a student was swift and bitter; it was like beginning a new life with a new identity, though Clayton suffered less than he anticipated.  He had become interested from the first.  There was nothing in the pretty glen, when he came, but a mountaineer's cabin and a few gnarled old apple-trees, the roots of which checked the musical flow of a little stream.  Then the air was filled with the tense ring of hammer and saw, the mellow echoes of axes, and the shouts of ox-drivers from the forests, indignant groans from the mountains, and a little town sprang up before his eyes, and cars of shining coal wound slowly about the mountainside."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Activity like this stirred his blood.  Busy from dawn to dark, he had no time to grow miserable.  His work was hard, to be sure, but it made rest and sleep a luxury, and it had the new zest of independence; he even began to take in it no little pride when he found himself an essential part of the quick growth going on. When leisure came, he could take to woods filled with unknown birds, new forms of insect life, and strange plants and flowers.  With every day, too, he was more deeply stirred by the changing beauty of the mountains hidden at dawn with white mists, faintly veiled through the day with an atmosphere that made him think of Italy, and enriched by sunsets of startling beauty.  But strongest of all was the interest he found in the odd human mixture about him-the simple, good-natured darkies who slouched past him, magnificent in physique and picturesque with rags; occasional foreigners just from Castle Garden, with the hope of the New World still in their faces; and now and then a gaunt mountaineer stalking awkwardly in the rear of the march toward civilization.  Gradually it had dawned upon him that this last, silent figure, traced through Virginia, was closely linked by blood and speech with the common people of England, and, moulded perhaps by the influences of feudalism, was still strikingly unchanged; that now it was the most distinctively national remnant on American soil, and symbolized the development of the continent, and that with it must go the last suggestions of the pioneers, with their hardy physiques, their speech, their manners and customs, their simple architecture and simple mode of life.  It was soon plain to him, too, that a change was being wrought at last-the change of destruction. The older mountaineers, whose bewildered eyes watched the noisy signs of an unintelligible civilization, were passing away.  Of the rest, some, sullen and restless, were selling their homesteads and following the spirit of their forefathers into a new wilderness; others, leaving their small farms in adjacent valleys to go to ruin, were gaping idly about the public works, caught up only too easily by the vicious current of the incoming tide.  In a century the mountaineers must be swept away, and their ignorance of the tragic forces at work among them gave them an unconscious pathos that touched Clayton deeply."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As he grew to know them, their historical importance yielded to a genuine interest in the people themselves.  They were densely ignorant, to be sure; but they were natural, simple, and hospitable.   Their sense of personal worth was high, and their democracy-or aristocracy,  since there was no distinction of caste-absolute. For generations,  son had lived like father in an isolation hardly credible.   No influence save such as shook the nation ever reached them.  The Mexican war, slavery, and national politics of the first  half-century were still present issues, and each old man would give  his rigid, individual opinion sometimes with surprising humor and force.   He went much among them, and the rugged old couples whom he found  in the cabin porches-so much alike at first-quickly became distinct  with a quaint individuality. Among young or old, however, he had found  nothing like the half-wild young creature he had met on the mountain that day.   In her a type had crossed his path-had driven him from it, in truth-that  seemed unique and inexplicable. He had been little more than amused at first,  but a keen interest had been growing in him with every thought of her.   There was an indefinable charm about the girl.  She gave a new and sudden  zest to his interest in mountain life; and while he worked, the incidents  of the encounter on the mountain came minutely back to him till he saw her  again as she rode away, her supple figure swaying with every movement  of the beast, and dappled with quivering circles of sunlight from the bushes,  her face calm, but still flushed with color, and her yellow hair shaking  about her shoulders-not lustreless and flaxen, as hair was in the mountains,  he remembered, but catching the sunlight like gold."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Almost unconsciously he laid aside his pencil and leaned from his window to lift his eyes to the dark mountain he had climbed that day. The rude melody of an old-fashioned hymn was coming up the glen, and he recognized the thin, quavering voice of an old mountaineer, Uncle Tommy Brooks, as he was familiarly known, whose cabin stood in the midst of the camp, a pathetic contrast to the smart new houses that had sprung around it.  The old man had lived in the glen for nearly three-quarters of a century, and he, if any one, must know the girl. With the thought, Clayton sprang through the window, and a few minutes later was at the cabin.  The old man sat whittling in the porch, joining in the song with which his wife was crooning a child to sleep within.  Clayton easily identified Europa, as he had christened her; the simple mention of her means of transport was sufficient."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Ridin' a bull, was she? \" repeated the old man,  laughing.  \"Well,  that  was Easter Hicks, old Bill Hicks' gal.

On one bed lay a rather comely young woman with a child by her side; on a chest close by sat another with her lover, courting in the most open and primitive manner.  In the corner an old grandam dozed with her pipe, her withered face just touched by the rim of the firelight.

She was barely fifteen, with the face of a girl of twelve, and her motherly manner had struck him as an odd contrast. He felt a thrill of pity for the young mother as he called to mind the aged young wives he had seen who were haggard and care-worn at thirty, and who still managed to live to an old age.

All were mountaineers, lank, bearded, men, coatless for the most part, and dressed in brown home-made jeans, slouched, formless hats, and high, coarse boots. Sun and wind had tanned their faces to sympathy, in color, with their clothes, which had the dun look of the soil. They seemed peculiarly a race of the soil, to have sprung as they were from the earth, which had left indelible stains upon them.  All carried long rifles, old-fashioned and home-made, some even with flint-locks.  It was Saturday, and many of their wives had come with them to the camp.

The woods were resonant with song-birds, and the dew dripped and sparkled wherever a shaft of sunlight pierced the thick leaves.  Late violets hid shyly under canopies of May-apple; bunches of blue and of white anemone nodded from under fallen trees, and water ran like hidden music everywhere.  Slowly the valley and the sound of its life-the lowing of cattle, the clatter at the mines, the songs of the negroes at work-sank beneath him. The chorus of birds dwindled until only the cool, flute-like notes of a wood- thrush rose faintly from below.  Up he went, winding around great oaks, fallen trunks, loose bowlders, and threatening cliffs until light glimmered whitely between the boles of the trees.  From a gap where he paused to rest, a fire-scald \" was visible close to the' crest of the adjoining mountain.  It was filled with the charred, ghost-like trunks of trees that had been burned standing.

From the cliff the vines had crept to roof and chimney, and were waving their tendrils about a thin blue spiral of smoke.  The cabin was gray and tottering with age.  Above the porch on the branches of an apple-tree hung leaves that matched in richness of tint the thick moss on the rough shingles.  Under it an old woman sat spinning, and a hound lay asleep at her feet. Easter was nowhere to be seen, but her voice came from below him in a loud tone of command; and presently she appeared from behind a knoll, above which the thatched roof of a stable was visible, and slowly ascended the path to the house.

The old woman resumed spinning.  The girl took her seat in the low chair, holding her new treasure in her lap, with her eyes fixed on it, and occasionally running one brown hand down its shining barrel. Clayton watched her. She had given no sign whatever that she had ever seen him before, and yet a curious change had come over her. Her imperious manner had yielded to a singular reserve and timidity.  The peculiar beauty of the girl struck him now with unusual force. Her profile was remarkably regular and delicate; her mouth small, resolute, and sensitive; heavy, dark lashes shaded her downcast eyes; and her brow suggested a mentality that he felt a strong desire to test. Her feet were small, and so were her quick, nervous hands, which were still finely shaped, in spite of the hard usage that had left them brown and callous. He wondered if she was really as lovely as she seemed; if his standard might not have been affected by his long stay in the mountains; if her picturesque environment might not have influenced his judgment.  He tried to imagine her daintily slippered, clad in white, with her loose hair gathered in a Psyche knot; or in evening dress, with arms and throat bare; but the pictures were difficult to make.  He liked her best as she was, in perfect physical sympathy with the natural phases about her; as much a part of them as tree, plant, or flower, embodying the freedom, grace, and beauty of nature as well and as unconsciously as they.  He questioned whether she hardly felt herself to be apart from them; and, of course, she as little knew her kinship to them."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"She had lifted her eyes now, and had fixed them with tender thoughtfulness on the mountains. What did she see in the scene before her, he wondered: the deep valley, brilliant with early sunshine; the magnificent sweep of wooded slopes; Pine Mountain and the peak-like Narrows, where through it the river had worn its patient way; and the Cumberland Range, lying like a cloud against the horizon, and bluer and softer than the sky above it.  He longed to know what her thoughts were; if in them there might be a hint of what he hoped to find.  Probably she could not tell them, should he ask her, so unconscious was she of her mental life, whatever that might be.  Indeed, she seemed scarcely to know of her own existence; there was about her a simplicity to which he had felt himself rise only in the presence of the spirit about some lonely mountain-top or in the heart of deep woods. Her gaze was not vacant, not listless, but the pensive look of a sensitive child, and Clayton let himself fancy that there was in it an unconscious love of the beauty before her, and of its spiritual suggestiveness a slumbering sense, perhaps easily awakened. Perhaps he might awaken it."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The drowsy hum of the spinning-wheel ceased suddenly, and his dream was shattered. He wondered how long they had sat there saying nothing, and how long the silence might continue. Easter, he believed, would never address him.  Even the temporary intimacy that the barter of the gun had brought about was gone. The girl seemed lost in unconsciousness. The mother had gone to her loom,  and was humming softly to herself as she passed the shuttle to and fro.  Clayton turned for an instant to watch her, and the rude background,  which he had forgotten, thrust every unwelcome detail upon his attention:  the old cabin, built of hewn logs, held together by wooden pin and  augur-hole, and shingled with rough boards; the dark, windowless room;  the unplastered walls; the beds with old-fashioned high posts,  mattresses of straw, and cords instead of slats; the home-made chairs  with straight backs, tipped with carved knobs; the mantel filled  with utensils and overhung with bunches of drying herbs; a ladder  with half a dozen smooth-worn steps leading to the loft; and a wide,  deep fireplace-the only suggestion of cheer and comfort in the gloomy interior.  An open porch connected the single room with the kitchen.   Here, too, were suggestions of daily duties. The mother's face told a tale  of hardship and toil, and there was the plough in the furrow,  and the girl's calloused hands folded in her lap. With a thrill  of compassion Clayton turned to her. What a pity! what a pity!  Just now her face had the peace of a child's; but when aroused,  an electric fire burned from her calm eyes and showed the ardent temperament that really lay beneath.

If she came to the camp, he walked up the mountain with her. No idle day passed that he did not visit the cabin, and it was not long before he found himself strangely interested.  Her beauty and fearlessness had drawn him at first; her indifference and stolidity had piqued him; and now the shyness that displaced these was inconsistent and puzzling. This he set himself deliberately at work to remove, and the conscious effort gave a peculiar piquancy to their intercourse.  He had learned the secret of association with the mountaineers-to be as little unlike them as possible-and he put the knowledge into practice. He discarded coat and waistcoat, wore a slouched hat, and went unshaven for weeks. He avoided all conventionalities, and was as simple in manner and speech as possible. Often when talking with Easter, her face was blankly unresponsive, and a question would sometimes leave her in confused silence. He found it necessary to use the simplest Anglo-Saxon words, and he soon fell into many of the quaint expressions of the mountaineers and their odd, slow way of speech. This course was effective, and in time the shyness wore away and left between them a comradeship as pleasant as unique. Sometimes they took long walks together on the mountains. This was contrary to mountain etiquette, but they were remote even from the rude conventionalities of the life below them.  They even went hunting together, and Easter had the joy of a child when she discovered her superiority to Clayton in woodcraft and in the use of a rifle. If he could tell her the names of plants and flowers they found, and how they were akin, she could show him where they grew.  If he could teach her a little more about animals and their habits than she already knew, he had always to follow her in the search for game. Their fellowship was, in consequence, never more complete than when they were roaming the woods. In them Easter was at home, and her ardent nature came to the surface like a poetic glow from her buoyant health and beauty. Then appeared all that was wayward and elfin-like in her character, and she would be as playful, wilful, evanescent as a wood-spirit. Sometimes, when they were separated, she would lead him into a ravine by imitating a squirrel or a wild-turkey, and, as he crept noiselessly along with bated breath and eyes peering eagerly through the tree-tops or the underbrush, she would step like a dryad from behind some tree at his side, with a ringing laugh at his discomfiture.  Again, she might startle him by running lightly along the fallen trunk of a tree that lay across a torrent, or, in a freak of wilfulness, would let herself down the bare face of some steep cliff.  If he scolded her, she laughed.  If he grew angry, she was serious instantly, and once she fell to weeping and fled home.  He followed her, but she barricaded herself in her room in the loft, and would not be coaxed down.

He had spoken it outright as a fact, and he must have thought that her silence confirmed it. He had said that the "furriner" cared nothing for her, and had dared to tell her that she was in love with him. Her cheeks began to bum. She would call him back and tell him that she cared no more for the "furriner " than she did for him. She started from the steps, but paused, straining her eyes through the darkness. It was too late, and, with a helpless little cry, she began pacing the porch. She had scarcely heard what was said after the mountaineer\'s first accusation, so completely had that enthralled her mind; now fragments came back to her.  There was something about a picture-ah! she remembered that picture.  Passing through the camp one afternoon, she had glanced in at a window and had seen a rifle once her own.  Turning in rapid wonder about the room, her eye lighted upon a picture on a table near the window.  She had felt the refined beauty of the girl, and it had impressed her with the same timidity that Clayton had when she first knew him.

Perhaps he was going to her.  She almost stretched out her hands in a sudden, fierce desire to clutch the round throat and sink her nails into the soft flesh that rose before her mind.  She had forgotten that he had ever told her that he must go away, so little had it impressed her at the time. She had never thought of a possible change in their relations or in their lives. She tried to think what her life would be after he was gone, and she was frightened; she could not imagine her old life resumed. When Clayton came, it was as though she had risen from sleep in a dream, and had lived in it thereafter without questioning its reality.  Into his hands she had delivered her life and herself with the undoubting faith of a child. She had never thought of their relations at all. Now the awakening had come.  The dream was shattered.

She lifted her hands to her head in a dazed, ineffectual way.

Easter had thrown her books into a corner, her mother said, and did nothing but mope all day; and though she insisted that it was only one of the girl's \" spells,\" it was plain that something was wrong. Easter's face remained thin and drawn, and acquired gradually a hard, dogged, almost sullen look. She spoke to Clayton rarely, and then only in monosyllables. She never looked him in the face, and if his gaze rested intently on her, as she sat with eyes downcast and hands folded, she seemed to know it at once. Her face would color faintly, her hands fold and unfold nervously, and sometimes she would rise and go within. He had no opportunity of speaking with her alone. She seemed to guard against that, and, indeed, Raines's presence almost prevented it, for the mountaineer was there always, and always now the last to leave. He sat usually in the shadow of the vine, and though his-face was unseen, Clayton could feel his eyes fixed upon him with an intensity that sometimes made him nervous. The mountaineer had evidently begun to misinterpret his visits to the cabin. Clayton was regarded as a rival. In what other light, indeed, could he appear to Raines?

A light was visible, but he could hear no voices.  Still, he knew he would find the occupants seated in the porch, held by that strange quiet which nature imposes on those who dwell much alone with her.

Stirred to the depths by that embrace on the mountain-side, he gave himself wholly up to the love or infatuation-he did not ask which-that enthralled him.

There was in it the thrill that might come from taming some wild creature that had never known control, and the gentleness that to any generous spirit such power would bring. These, with the magnetism of the girl's beauty and personality, and the influence of her environment, he had felt for a long time; but now richer chords were set vibrating in response to her great love, the struggle she had against its disclosure, the appeal for tenderness and protection in her final defeat.  It was ideal, he told himself, as he sank into the delicious dream; they two alone with nature, above all human life, with its restraints, its hardships, its evils, its distress.  For them was the freedom of the open sky lifting its dome above the mountains; for them nothing less kindly than the sun shining its benediction; for their eyes only the changing beauties of day and night; for their ears no sound harsher than the dripping of dew or a bird-song; for them youth, health, beauty, love.  And it was primeval love, the love of the first woman for the first man.  She knew no convention, no prudery, no doubt.  Her life was impulse, and her impulse was love.  She was the teacher now, and he the taught; and he stood in wonder when the plant he had tended flowered into such beauty in a single night.  Ah, the happy, happy days that followed!  The veil that had for a long time been unfolding itself between him and his previous life seemed to have almost fallen, and they were left alone to their happiness.  The mother kept her own counsel.

Striking the  curtain accidentally, he loosed it from its fastenings, and,  doubling the pillows, he lay looking out on the swiftly passing landscape.   The moon was full and brilliant, and there was a strange, keen pleasure  in being whirled in such comfort through the night.   The mists almost hid the mountains.  They seemed very, very far away.  A red star trembled in the crest of Wolf Mountain.   Easter's cabin must be almost under that Star. He wondered if she were asleep.  Perhaps she was out on the porch, lonely, suffering, and thinking of him.  He felt her kiss and her tears upon his hand.  Did he not love her?  Could there be any doubt about that?  His thoughts turned toRaines,  and he saw the mountaineer in his lonely cabin, sitting with his head bowed  in his hands in front of the dying fire.  He closed his eyes,  and another picture rose before him-a scene at home.  He had taken Easter to New York.  How brilliant the light! what warmth and luxury!  There stood his father, there his mother.  What gracious dignity they had!  Here was his sister-what beauty and elegance and grace of manner!  But Easter! Wherever she was placed the other figures needed readjustment.

He seemed never to have been away so long, and never had home seemed so pleasant.  His sister had grown more beautiful; his mother's quiet, noble face was smoother and fairer than it had been for years; and despite the absence of his father, who had been hastily summoned to England, there was an air of cheerfulness in the house that was in marked contrast to its gloom when Clayton was last at home.  He had been quickened at once into a new appreciation of the luxury and refinement about him, and he soon began to wonder how he had inured himself to the discomforts and crudities of his mountain life.  Old habits easily resumed sway over him.   At the club friend and acquaintance were so unfeignedly glad to see him  that he began to suspect that his own inner gloom had darkened their faces  after his father's misfortune.  Day after day found him in his favorite  corner at the club, watching the passing pageant and listening eagerly  to the conversational froth of the town-the gossip of club, theatre,  and society.  His ascetic life in the mountains gave to every pleasure  the taste of inexperience.  His early youth seemed renewed,  so keen and fresh were his emotions.  He felt, too, that he was recovering  a lost identity, and still the new one that had grown around him  would not loosen its hold.  He had told his family nothing of Easter-why,  he could scarcely have said-and the difficulty of telling increased each day.   His secret began to weigh heavily upon him; and though he determined to  unburden himself on his father's return, he was troubled with a vague sense  of deception.  When he went to receptions with his sister, this sense of  a double identity was keenly felt amid the lights, the music, the flowers,  the flash of eyes and white necks and arms, the low voices, the polite,  clear-cut utterances of welcome and compliment."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Several times he had met a face for which he had once had a boyish infatuation.  Its image had never been supplanted during his student career, but he had turned from it as from a star when he came home  and found that his life was to be built with his own hands. Now the girl had  grown to gracious womanhood, and when he saw her  he was thrilled with the remembrance that she had once favored him above all others. One night a desire assailed him to learn upon what footing he then stood.  He had yielded, and she gave him a kindly welcome.  They had drifted to reminiscence, and Clayton went home that night troubled at heart and angry that he should be so easily disturbed; surprised that the days were passing so swiftly, and pained that they were filled less and less with thoughts of Easter.  With a pang of remorse and fear, he determined to go back to the mountains as soon as his father came home.  He knew the effect of habit.

Wagner's tidal wave had reached New York; it was the opening night of the season, and the opera was one that he had learned  to love in Germany.  The very brilliancy of the scene threw him into gloom,  so aloof did he feel from it all-the great theatre aflame with lights,  the circling tiers of faces, the pit with its hundred musicians,  their eyes on the leader, who stood above them with baton upraised and German face already aglow."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In his student days he had loved music, but he had little more than trifled with it; now, strangely enough, his love, even his understanding, seemed to have grown; and when the violins thrilled all the vast space into life, he was shaken with a passion newly born. All the evening he sat riveted.  A rush of memories came upon him-memories of his student life, with its dreams and ideals of culture and scholarship, which rose from his past again like phantoms.  In the elevation of the moment the trivial pleasures that had been tempting him became mean and unworthy. With a pang of bitter regret he saw himself as he might have been, as he yet might be."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A few days later his father came home, and his distress of mind was complete.  Clayton need stay in the mountains but little longer, he said; he was fast making up his losses, and he had hoped after his trip to England to have Clayton at once in New York; but now he had best wait perhaps another year.  Then had come a struggle  that racked heart and brain. All he had ever had was before him again.  Could it be his duty to shut himself from this life-his natural  heritage-to stifle the highest demands of his nature?  Was he seriously  in love with that mountain girl?  Had he indeed ever been sure of himself?   If, then, he did not love her beyond all question, would he not wrong himself,  wrong her, by marrying her? Ah, but might he not wrong her, wrong himself -even more?   He was bound to her by every tie that his sensitive honor recognized  among the duties of one human being to another.  He had sought her; he had lifted her above her own life. If one human being had ever put its happiness in the hands of another, that had been done.  If he had not deliberately taught her to love him, he had not tried to prevent it.  He could not excuse himself; the thought of gaining her affection had occurred to him, and he had put it aside. There was no excuse; for when she gave her love, he had accepted it, and, as far as she knew, had given his own unreservedly.  Ah, that fatal moment of weakness, that night on the mountam-side!  Could he tell her, could he tell Raines, the truth, and ask to be released?

Within it was a poor tintype, from which Easter\'s eyes looked shyly at him.  Before he left he had tried in vain to get her to the tent of an itinerant photographer.  During his absence, she had evidently gone of her own accord.  The face was very beautiful, and in it was an expression of questioning, modest pride.  "Aren\'t you surprised? "it seemed to say-" and pleased? Only the face,  with its delicate lines, and the throat and the shoulders were visible.   She looked almost refined.

In his absence everything seemed to have suffered a change. Jellico had never seemed so small, so coarse, so wretched as when he stepped from the dusty train and saw it lying dwarfed and shapeless in the afternoon sunlight.  The State line bisects the straggling streets of frame-houses.  On the Kentucky side an extraordinary spasm of morality had quieted into local option. Just across the way in Tennessee was a row of saloons.  It was "pay-day" for the miners, and the worst element of all the mines was drifting in to spend the following Sabbath in unchecked vice. Several rough, brawny fellows were already staggering from Tennessee into Kentucky, and around one saloon hung a crowd of slatternly negroes, men and women. Heartsick with disgust, Clayton hurried into the lane that wound through the valley.  Were these hovels, he asked himself in wonder, the cabins he once thought so poetic, so picturesque? How was it that they suggested now only a pitiable poverty of life? From each, as he passed, came a rough, cordial  shout of greeting. Why was he jarred so strangely? Even nature had changed.  The mountains seemed stunted, less beautiful. The light, streaming  through the western gap with all the splendor of a mountain sunset, no longer thrilled him. The moist fragrance of the earth at twilight, the sad pipings of birds by the wayside, the faint, clear notes of a wood-thrush-his favorite-from the edge of the forest, even the mid-air song of a meadow-lark above his head, were unheeded as, with face haggard with thought and travel, he turned doggedly from the road and up the mountain toward Easter\'s home. The novelty and ethnological zeal that had blinded him to the disagreeable phases of mountain life were gone; so was the pedestal from which he had descended to make a closer study of the people.  For he felt now that he had gone among them with an unconscious condescension; his interest seemed now to have been little more than curiosity-a pastime to escape brooding over his own change of fortune.

There was no answer,  and he sank wearily into a chair, his thoughts reverting homeward.   By this time his mother and sister must know why he had come back to the mountains.  He could imagine their consternation and grief. Perhaps that was only the beginning;  he might be on the eve of causing them endless unhappiness.  He had thought to  involve them as little as possible by remaining in the mountains; but the thought  of living there was now intolerable in the new relations he would sustain  to the people.

He had the same nervous, impetuous quickness, and, horrified by the likeness, Clayton watched him sink back into a chair, pipe in mouth, and relapse into a stolidity that seemed incapable of the energy and fire shown scarcely a moment before.  His life in the mountains had made him as shaggy as some wild animal. He was coatless, and his trousers of jeans were upheld by a single home-made suspender.

Once he would have thought her picturesque, but now it pained him to see her doing such rough work.  When she saw him, she gave a cry of surprise and delight that made Clayton tingle with remorse.

Her appearance was really refined and tasteful. When they went out on the porch he noticed that her hands had lost their tanned appearance. Her feet were slippered, and she wore black stockings.  He remembered the book of fashion-plates he had once sent her; it was that that had quickened her instinct of dress.

The charm of the girl's personality had asserted its power again, and hopes that had almost been destroyed by his trip home were rekindled by her tasteful appearance, her delicacy of feeling, and by her beauty, which he had not overrated. He asked that his sister might meet him in Louisville after the wedding-whenever that should be. They two could decide then what should be done.

In consequence, there was an unprecedented stir among the mountaineers.  The marriage of a citizen  with a " furriner " was an unprecedented event, and the old mountaineer, who began to take some pride in the alliance, emphasized it at every opportunity.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"At the mines Clayton's constant visits to the mountain were known to everybody, but little attention had been paid to them.  Now, however, when the rumor of the wedding seemed confirmed by his return and his silence, every one was alert with a curiosity so frankly shown that he soon became eager to get away from the mountains.  Accordingly, he made known his wish to Easter's parents that the marriage should take place as soon as possible. Both received the suggestion with silent assent. Then had followed  many difficulties. Only as a great concession to the ideas and customs  of \" fur-riners\" would the self-willed old mountaineer agree that  the ceremony should take place at night, and that after the supper  and the dance, the two should leave Jellico at daybreak.  Mountain marriages were solemnized in the daytime, and wedding  journeys were unknown. The old man did not understand why Clayton  should wish to leave the mountains, and the haste of the latter  seemed to give him great offence. When Clayton had ventured to suggest,  instead, that the marriage should be quiet, and that he and Easter  should remain on the mountain a few days before leaving, he fumed with anger;  and thereafter any suggestion from the young engineer was met with a suspicion  that looked ominous.  Raines was away on his circuit, and would not return  until just before the wedding, so that from him Clayton could get no help.  Very wisely, then, he interfered no more, but awaited the day with dread."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It was nearing dusk when he left the camp on his wedding-night.  Half-way up the mountain he stopped to lean against the kindly breast of a bowlder blocking the path.  It was the spot where he had seen Easter for the first time. The mountains were green again, as they were then, but the scene seemed sadly changed. The sun was gone;  the evening-star had swung its white light like a censer above Devil's Den;  the clouds were moving swiftly through the darkening air,  like a frightened flock seeking a fold; and the night was closing fast  over the cluster of faint camp-fires. The spirit brooding over mountain  and sky was unspeakably sad, and with a sharp pain at his heart Clayton  turned from it and hurried on.  Mountain, sky, and valley were soon lost  in the night.  When he reached the cabin rays of bright light were flashing  from chink and crevice into the darkness, and from the kitchen came the sounds  of busy preparation. Already many guests had arrived.  A group of men  who stood lazily talking in the porch became silent as he approached, but, recognizing none of them, he entered the cabin. A dozen women were seated about the room, and instantly their eyes were glued upon him.  As the kitchen door swung open he saw Easter's mother bending over the fireplace, a table already heavily laden, and several women bustling about it. Above his head he heard laughter, a hurried tramping of feet, and occasional cries of surprise and delight. He paused at the threshold, hardly knowing what to do, and when he turned a titter from one corner showed that his embarrassment was seen. On the porch he was seized by  Easter's father, who drew him back into the room. The old mountaineer's  face was flushed, and he had been drinking heavily."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Oh, hyar ye air! " he exclaimed. "You\'re right on hand, hain\'t ye?

Clayton shook his head firmly, but the rest followed Hicks, who turned at the door and repeated the invitation with a frowning face.  Clayton was left the focus of feminine eyes, whose unwavering directness kept his own gaze on the floor. People began to come in rapidly, most of whom he had never seen before. The room was filled, save for a space about him.  Every one gave him a look of curiosity that made him feel like some strange animal on exhibition.  Once more he tried to escape to the porch, and again he was met by Easter's father, who this time was accompanied by Raines."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The young circuit-rider was smoothly shaven, and dressed in dark clothes, and his calm face and simple but impressive manner seemed at once to alter the atmosphere of the room. He grasped Clayton's hand warmly, and without a trace of self-consciousness.  The room had grown instantly quiet, and Raines began to share the curious interest that Clayton had caused; for the young mountaineer's sermon had provoked discussion far and wide, and, moreover, the peculiar relations of the two toward Easter were known and rudely appreciated. Hicks was subdued into quiet respect, and tried to conceal his incipient intoxication.  The effort did not last long. When the two fiddlers came, he led them in with a defiant air, and placed them in the corner, bustling about officiously but without looking at Raines, whose face began to cloud."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Well, we\'re all hyar, I reckon!

Easter's mother and her assistants came in from the kitchen, and the doors were filled with faces.  Above, the tramping of feet became more hurried; below, all stood with expectant faces turned to the rude staircase.  Clayton's heart began to throb, and a strange light brightened under Raines's heavy brows."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"Hurry up, thar!" shouted Hicks, impatiently.'}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A moment later two pairs of rough shoes came down the steps, and after them two slippered feet that fixed every eye in the room, until the figure and face above them slowly descended into the light. Midway the girl paused with a timid air. Had an angel been lowered to mortal view, the waiting people would not have been stricken with more wonder. Raines's face relaxed into a look almost of awe, and even Hicks for the instant was stunned into reverence.  Mountain eyes had never beheld such loveliness so arrayed. It was simple enough-the garment-all white, and of a misty texture, yet it formed a mysterious vision to them. About the girl's brow was a wreath of pink and white laurel.  A veil had not been used.  It would hide her face, she said, and she did not see why that should be done.  For an instant she stood poised so lightly that she seemed to sway like a vision, as the candle-lights quivered about her, with her hands clasped in front of her, and her eyes wandering about the room till they lighted upon Clayton with a look of love  that seemed to make her conscious only of him. Then, with quickening breath,  lips parted slightly, cheeks slowly flushing, and shining eyes still upon him,  she moved slowly across the room until she stood at his side."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Raines gathered himself together as from a dream, and stepped before the pair.

There was a strange mixture in those last words of the office and the man-of divine authority and personal appeal-and Clay. ton was deeply stirred.

Hicks was fulfilling his word, and in the kitchen his wife had done her part. Everything known to the mountaineer palate was piled in profusion on the table, but Clayton and Easter ate nothing.  To him the whole evening was a nightmare, which the solemn moments of the marriage had made the more hideous. He was restless and eager to get away. The dancing was becoming more furious, and above the noise rose Hicks's voice prompting the dancers.  The ruder ones still hung about the doors, regarding Clayton curiously, or with eager eyes upon the feast.

Forward and back they glided, their swift feet beating every note of the music; Faster receding before her partner, and now advancing toward him, now whirling away with a disdainful toss of her head and arms, and now giving him her hand and whirling till her white skirts floated from the floor. At last, with head bent coquettishly toward her partner, she danced around him, and when it seemed that she would be caught by his outstretched hands she slipped from his clasp, and, with burning cheeks, flashing eyes, and bridal wreath showering its pink-flecked petals about her, flew to Clayton's side."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Mebbe ye don't like that,\" cried Hicks, turning to Raines, who had been gravely watching the scene."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Raines said nothing in reply, but only looked the drunken man in the face."}),"\n",(0,h.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\"You two,\" he continued, indicating Clayton with an angry shake of his head, \" air a-tryin' to spile ever'body's fun.

To Clayton the peace of the primitive little chamber was an infinite relief.

Above, the roof rose to a sharp angle, and the low, unplastered walls were covered with pietures cut from the books he had given her. A single window opened into the night over the valley and to the mountains beyond. Two small cane-bottom chairs were near this, and in these they sat down.  In the east dark clouds were moving swiftly across the face of the moon, checking its light anJ giving the dim valley startling depth  and  blackness.  Rain-drops struck the roof at intervals, a shower of apple-blossoms rustled against the window and drifted on, and below the muffled sound of music and shuffling feet was now and then pierced by the shrill calls of the prompter.

As he bent back to look at the sleeping girl, the moonlight fell softly upon her face, revealing its purity of color, and touching the loosened folds of her hair, and shining through a tear-drop which had escaped from her closed lashes. How lovely the face was! How pure!  How child-like with all its  hidden strength!  How absolute her confidence in him! How great  her love!
