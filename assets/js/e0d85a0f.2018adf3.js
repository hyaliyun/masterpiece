We had been\r\nwandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;\r\nbut since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early)\r\nthe cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a\r\nrain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of\r\nthe question.\r\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly\r\nafternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight,\r\nwith nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings\r\nof Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my\r\nphysical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.\r\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round\r\ntheir mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the\r\nfireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither\r\nquarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had\r\ndispensed from joining the group; saying, 'She regretted to be under\r\nthe necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard\r\nfrom Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was\r\nendeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and\r\nchildlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner-\r\nsomething lighter, franker, more natural, as it were- she really\r\nmust exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,\r\nlittle children.'\r\n'What does Bessie say I have done?' I asked.\r\n'Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is\r\nsomething truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that\r\nmanner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly,\r\nremain silent.'\r\nA small breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in\r\nthere. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume,\r\ntaking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into\r\nthe window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a\r\nTurk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was\r\nshrined in double retirement.\r\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to\r\nthe left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating\r\nme from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the\r\nleaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.\r\nAfar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet\r\nlawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly\r\nbefore a long and lamentable blast.\r\nI returned to my book- Bewick's History of British Birds: the\r\nletterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet\r\nthere were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could\r\nnot pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts\r\nof sea-fowl; of 'the solitary rocks and promontories' by them only\r\ninhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its\r\nsouthern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape-"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"       'Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, \r\n        Boils round the naked, melancholy isles \r\n        Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge \r\n        Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.' \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of\r\nLapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with\r\n'the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of\r\ndreary space,- that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields\r\nof ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine\r\nheights above heights, surround the pole and concentre the\r\nmultiplied rigours of extreme cold.' Of these death-white realms I\r\nformed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended\r\nnotions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely\r\nimpressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves\r\nwith the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock\r\nstanding up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat\r\nstranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing\r\nthrough bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\r\nI cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard,\r\nwith its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low\r\nhorizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent,\r\nattesting the hour of eventide.\r\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine\r\nphantoms.\r\nThe fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over\r\nquickly: it was an object of terror.\r\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a\r\ndistant crowd surrounding a gallows.\r\nEach picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped\r\nunderstanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:\r\nas interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter\r\nevenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having\r\nbrought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit\r\nabout it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped\r\nher nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love\r\nand adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as\r\nat a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry,\r\nEarl of Moreland.\r\nWith Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.\r\nI feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The\r\nbreakfast-room door opened.\r\n'Boh! Madam Mope!' cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he\r\nfound the room apparently empty.\r\n'Where the dickens is she!' he continued. 'Lizzy! Georgy!\r\n(calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out\r\ninto the rain- bad animal!'\r\n'It is well I drew the curtain,' thought I; and I wished\r\nfervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed\r\nhave found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or\r\nconception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at\r\nonce-\r\n'She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.'\r\nAnd I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being\r\ndragged forth by the said Jack.\r\n'What do you want?' I asked, with awkward diffidence.\r\n'Say, \"What do you want, Master Reed?\"' was the answer. 'I want you\r\nto come here;' and seating himself in an armchair, he intimated by a\r\ngesture that I was to approach and stand before him.\r\nJohn Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older\r\nthan I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy\r\nand unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy\r\nlimbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table,\r\nwhich made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and\r\nflabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had\r\ntaken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate\r\nhealth.' Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if\r\nhe had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother's\r\nheart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more\r\nrefined idea that John's sallowness was owing to over-application and,\r\nperhaps, to pining after home.\r\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an\r\nantipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in\r\nthe week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I\r\nhad feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he\r\ncame near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he\r\ninspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his\r\nmenaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend\r\ntheir young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was\r\nblind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him\r\nabuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more\r\nfrequently, however, behind her back.\r\nHabitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent\r\nsome three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he\r\ncould without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and\r\nwhile dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance\r\nof him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in\r\nmy face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and\r\nstrongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a\r\nstep or two from his chair.\r\n'That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,' said\r\nhe, 'and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the\r\nlook you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!'\r\nAccustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to\r\nit; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow\r\nthe insult.\r\n'What were you doing behind the curtain?' he asked.\r\n'I was reading.'\r\n'Show the book.'\r\nI returned to the window and fetched it thence.\r\n'You have no business to take our books; you are a dependant,\r\nmama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought\r\nto beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and\r\neat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense. Now,\r\nI'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the\r\nhouse belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the\r\ndoor, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.'\r\nI did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw\r\nhim lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I\r\ninstinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough,\r\nhowever; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head\r\nagainst the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp:\r\nmy terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.\r\n'Wicked and cruel boy!' I said. 'You are like a murderer- you are\r\nlike a slave-driver- you are like the Roman emperors!'\r\nI had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion\r\nof Nero, Caligula, etc. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I\r\nnever thought thus to have declared aloud.\r\n'What! what!' he cried. 'Did she say that to me? Did you hear\r\nher, Eliza and Georgiana? Won't I tell mama? but first-'\r\nHe ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he\r\nhad closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a\r\nmurderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my\r\nneck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations\r\nfor the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic\r\nsort. I don't very well know what I did with my hands, but he called\r\nme 'Rat! Rat!' and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and\r\nGeorgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came\r\nupon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted:\r\nI heard the words-\r\n'Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!'\r\n'Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!'\r\nThen Mrs. Reed subjoined-\r\n'Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.' Four\r\nhands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                      CHAPTER II \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I RESISTED all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance\r\nwhich greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot\r\nwere disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside\r\nmyself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say: I was\r\nconscious that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me liable to\r\nstrange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved,\r\nin my desperation, to go all lengths.\r\n'Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat.'\r\n'For shame! for shame!' cried the lady's-maid. 'What shocking\r\nconduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's\r\nson! Your young master.'\r\n'Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?'\r\n'No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.\r\nThere, sit down, and think over your wickedness.'\r\nThey had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs.\r\nReed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it\r\nlike a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.\r\n'If you don't sit still, you must be tied down,' said Bessie. 'Miss\r\nAbbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.'\r\nMiss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary\r\nligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it\r\ninferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.\r\n'Don't take them off,' I cried; 'I will not stir.'\r\nIn guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.\r\n'Mind you don't,' said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that\r\nI was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss\r\nAbbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my\r\nface, as incredulous of my sanity.\r\n'She never did so before,' at last said Bessie, turning to the\r\nAbigail.\r\n'But it was always in her,' was the reply. 'I've told Missis\r\noften my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She's\r\nan underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so\r\nmuch cover.'\r\nBessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said-\r\n'You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to\r\nMrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would\r\nhave to go to the poorhouse.'\r\nI had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my\r\nvery first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.\r\nThis reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear:\r\nvery painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot\r\njoined in-\r\n'And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses\r\nReed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought\r\nup with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will\r\nhave none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make\r\nyourself agreeable to them.'\r\n'What we tell you is for your good,' added Bessie, in no harsh\r\nvoice; 'you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you\r\nwould have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude,\r\nMissis will send you away, I am sure.'\r\n'Besides,' said Miss Abbot, 'God will punish her: He might strike\r\nher dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?\r\nCome, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for\r\nanything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for\r\nif you don't repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the\r\nchimney and fetch you away.'\r\nThey went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.\r\nThe red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might\r\nsay never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at\r\nGateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the\r\naccommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and\r\nstateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars\r\nof mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a\r\ntabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds\r\nalways drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar\r\ndrapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was\r\ncovered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a\r\nblush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were\r\nof darkly polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding\r\nshades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and\r\npillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.\r\nScarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the\r\nhead of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and\r\nlooking, as I thought, like a pale throne.\r\nThis room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent,\r\nbecause remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was\r\nknown to be so seldom entered. The housemaid alone came here on\r\nSaturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet\r\ndust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review\r\nthe contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were\r\nstored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her\r\ndeceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the\r\nred-room- the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.\r\nMr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he\r\nbreathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by\r\nthe undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary\r\nconsecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion.\r\nMy seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me\r\nriveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose\r\nbefore me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with\r\nsubdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my\r\nleft were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them\r\nrepeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite\r\nsure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up\r\nand went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I\r\nhad to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance\r\ninvoluntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and\r\ndarker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange\r\nlittle figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms\r\nspecking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all\r\nelse was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one\r\nof the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories\r\nrepresented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing\r\nbefore the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.\r\nSuperstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her\r\nhour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the\r\nrevolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to\r\nstem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the\r\ndismal present.\r\nAll John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud\r\nindifference, all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality,\r\nturned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.\r\nWhy was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for\r\never condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to\r\nwin any one's favour? Eliza, who, was headstrong and selfish, was\r\nrespected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite,\r\na captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her\r\nbeauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to\r\nall who, looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault.\r\nJohn no one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the\r\nnecks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at\r\nthe sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the\r\nbuds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother\r\n'old girl,' too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to\r\nhis own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and\r\nspoiled her silk attire; and he was still 'her own darling.' I dared\r\ncommit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed\r\nnaughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and\r\nfrom noon to night.\r\nMy head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received:\r\nno one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had\r\nturned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was\r\nloaded with general opprobrium.\r\n'Unjust!- unjust!' said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus\r\ninto precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally\r\nwrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from\r\ninsupportable oppression- as running away, or, if that could not be\r\neffected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.\r\nWhat a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How\r\nall my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in\r\nwhat darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I\r\ncould not answer the ceaseless inward question- why I thus suffered;\r\nnow, at the distance of- I will not say how many years, I see it\r\nclearly.\r\nI was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had\r\nnothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen\r\nvassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love\r\nthem. They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that\r\ncould not sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing,\r\nopposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a\r\nuseless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their\r\npleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at\r\ntheir treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been\r\na sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child-\r\nthough equally dependent and friendless- Mrs. Reed would have\r\nendured my presence more complacently; her children would have\r\nentertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the\r\nservants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the\r\nnursery.\r\nDaylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock,\r\nand the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the\r\nrain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the\r\nwind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a\r\nstone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation,\r\nself-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying\r\nire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought\r\nhad I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That\r\ncertainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under\r\nthe chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I\r\nhad been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to\r\nrecall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not\r\nremember him; but I knew that he was my own uncle- my mother's\r\nbrother- that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house;\r\nand that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed\r\nthat she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs.\r\nReed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,\r\nI dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could\r\nshe really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with\r\nher, after her husband's death, by any tie? It must have been most\r\nirksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the\r\nstead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an\r\nuncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.\r\nA singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not- never doubted-\r\nthat if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and\r\nnow, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls-\r\noccasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly\r\ngleaming mirror- I began to recall what I had heard of dead men,\r\ntroubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes,\r\nrevisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the\r\noppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit, harassed by the wrongs\r\nof his sister's child, might quit its abode- whether in the church\r\nvault or in the unknown world of the departed- and rise before me in\r\nthis chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any\r\nsign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me,\r\nor elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with\r\nstrange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be\r\nterrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it-\r\nI endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my\r\nhead and tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a\r\nlight gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon\r\npenetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and\r\nthis stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and\r\nquivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this streak\r\nof light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by\r\nsome one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for\r\nhorror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift\r\ndarting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My\r\nheart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I\r\ndeemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was\r\noppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door\r\nand shook the lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the\r\nouter passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.\r\n'Miss Eyre, are you ill?' said Bessie.\r\n'What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!' exclaimed Abbot.\r\n'Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!' was my cry.\r\n'What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?' again demanded\r\nBessie.\r\n'Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.' I had now\r\ngot hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.\r\n'She has screamed out on purpose,' declared Abbot, in some disgust.\r\n'And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have\r\nexcused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her\r\nnaughty tricks.'\r\n'What is all this?' demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs.\r\nReed came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling\r\nstormily. 'Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre\r\nshould be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.'\r\n'Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am,' pleaded Bessie.\r\n'Let her go,' was the only answer. 'Loose Bessie's hand, child: you\r\ncannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor\r\nartifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that\r\ntricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and\r\nit is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I\r\nshall liberate you then.'\r\n'O aunt! have pity! forgive me! I cannot endure it- let me be\r\npunished some other way! I shall be killed if-'\r\n'Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:' and so, no doubt,\r\nshe felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely.\r\nlooked on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and\r\ndangerous duplicity.\r\nBessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now\r\nfrantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me\r\nin, without farther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon\r\nafter she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit:\r\nunconsciousness closed the scene."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     CHAPTER III \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"THE next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I\r\nhad had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red\r\nglare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking\r\nwith a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water:\r\nagitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror\r\nconfused my faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was\r\nhandling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and\r\nthat more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I\r\nrested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.\r\nIn five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew\r\nquite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the\r\nnursery fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie\r\nstood at the bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in\r\na chair near my pillow, leaning over me.\r\nI felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection\r\nand security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an\r\nindividual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.\r\nTurning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to\r\nme than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised\r\nthe face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an\r\napothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were\r\nailing: for herself and the children she employed a physician.\r\n'Well, who am I?' he asked.\r\nI pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he\r\ntook it, smiling and saying, 'We shall do very well by and by.' Then\r\nhe laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful\r\nthat I was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further\r\ndirections, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he\r\ndeparted; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat\r\nin the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him,\r\nall the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness\r\nweighed it down.\r\n'Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?' asked Bessie, rather\r\nsoftly.\r\nScarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might\r\nbe rough. 'I will try.'\r\n'Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?'\r\n'No, thank you, Bessie.'\r\n'Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but\r\nyou may call me if you want anything in the night.'\r\nWonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.\r\n'Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?'\r\n'You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be\r\nbetter soon, no doubt.'\r\nBessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near. I heard\r\nher say-\r\n'Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my\r\nlife be alone with that poor child tonight: she might die; it's such a\r\nstrange thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw\r\nanything. Missis was rather too hard.'\r\nSarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were\r\nwhispering together for half an hour before they fell asleep. I caught\r\nscraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too\r\ndistinctly to infer the main subject discussed.\r\n'Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished'- 'A\r\ngreat black dog behind him'- 'Three loud raps on the chamber door'-\r\n'A light in the churchyard just over his grave,' etc., etc.\r\nAt last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the\r\nwatches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye,\r\nand mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can\r\nfeel.\r\nNo severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the\r\nred-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the\r\nreverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful\r\npangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew\r\nnot what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were\r\nonly uprooting my bad propensities.\r\nNext day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl\r\nby the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but\r\nmy worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a\r\nwretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had\r\nI wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I\r\nthought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there,\r\nthey were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too,\r\nwas sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and\r\nthither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me\r\nevery now and then a word of unwonted kindness. This state of things\r\nshould have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a\r\nlife of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my\r\nracked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe,\r\nand no pleasure excite them agreeably.\r\nBessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with\r\nher a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of\r\nparadise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been\r\nwont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and\r\nwhich plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in\r\norder to examine it more closely, but had always hitherto been\r\ndeemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now\r\nplaced on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of\r\ndelicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other\r\nfavours long deferred and often wished for, too late! I could not\r\neat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers,\r\nseemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away. Bessie asked\r\nif I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient stimulus,\r\nand I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from the library. This\r\nbook I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it a\r\nnarrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper\r\nthan what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought\r\nthem in vain among fox-glove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and\r\nbeneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made\r\nup my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England to\r\nsome savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the\r\npopulation more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdingnag being, in\r\nmy creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I\r\nmight one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the\r\nlittle fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny\r\ncows, sheep, and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields,\r\nforest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men\r\nand women, of the other. Yet, when this cherished volume was now\r\nplaced in my hand- when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its\r\nmarvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to find-\r\nall was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies\r\nmalevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most\r\ndread and dangerous regions. I closed the book, which I dared no\r\nlonger peruse, and put it on the table, beside the untasted tart.\r\nBessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having\r\nwashed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid\r\nshreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for\r\nGeorgiana's doll. Meantime she sang: her song was-"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"             'In the days when we were gipsying, \r\n                    A long time ago.' \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I had often heard the song before, and always with lively\r\ndelight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,- at least, I thought so.

She\r\nmight as well have said to the fire, 'don't burn!' but how could she\r\ndivine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of\r\nthe morning Mr. Lloyd came again.\r\n'What, already up!' said he, as he entered the nursery. 'Well,\r\nnurse, how is she?'\r\nBessie answered that I was doing very well.\r\n'Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Mis Jane: your\r\nname is Jane, is it not?'\r\n'Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.'\r\n'Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what\r\nabout? Have you any pain?'\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n'Oh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with\r\nMissis in the carriage,' interposed Bessie.\r\n'Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.'\r\nI thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false\r\ncharge, I answered promptly, 'I never cried for such a thing in my\r\nlife: I hate going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.'\r\n'Oh fie, Miss!' said Bessie.\r\nThe good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing\r\nbefore him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small\r\nand grey; not very bright, but I daresay I should think them shrewd\r\nnow: he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having\r\nconsidered me at leisure, he said-\r\n'What made you ill yesterday?'\r\n'She had a fall,' said Bessie, again putting in her word.\r\n'Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can't she manage to walk\r\nat her age? She must be eight or nine years old.'\r\n'I was knocked down,' was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me\r\nby another pang of mortified pride; 'but that did not make me ill,'\r\nI added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.\r\nAs he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell\r\nrang for the servants' dinner; he knew what it was. 'That's for you,\r\nnurse,' said he; 'you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture\r\ntill you come back.'\r\nBessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because\r\npunctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gates-head Hall.\r\n'The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?' pursued Mr.\r\nLloyd when Bessie was gone.\r\n'I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.'\r\nI saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time. 'Ghost! What, you\r\nare a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?'\r\n'Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out\r\nthere. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if\r\nthey can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a\r\ncandle,- so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.'\r\n'Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid\r\nnow in daylight?'\r\n'No: but night will come again before long: and besides,- I am\r\nunhappy,- very unhappy, for other things.'\r\n'What other things? Can you tell me some of them?'\r\nHow much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it\r\nwas to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse\r\ntheir feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in\r\nthought, they know not how to express the result of the process in\r\nwords. Fearful, however, of losing this first and only opportunity\r\nof relieving my grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause,\r\ncontrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.\r\n'For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.'\r\n'You have a kind aunt and cousins.'\r\nAgain I paused; then bunglingly enounced-\r\n'But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the\r\nred-room.'\r\nMr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.\r\n'Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?' asked\r\nhe. 'Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?'\r\n'It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be\r\nhere than a servant.'\r\n'Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid\r\nplace?'\r\n'If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but\r\nI can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.'\r\n'Perhaps you may- who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs.\r\nReed?'\r\n'I think not, sir.'\r\n'None belonging to your father?'\r\n'I don't know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I\r\nmight have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew\r\nnothing about them.'\r\n'If you had such, would you like to go to them?'\r\nI reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to\r\nchildren: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable\r\npoverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,\r\nscanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices:\r\npoverty for me was synonymous with degradation.\r\n'No; I should not like to belong to poor people,' was my reply.\r\n'Not even if they were kind to you?'\r\nI shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of\r\nbeing kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their\r\nmanners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw\r\nsometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the\r\ncottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough\r\nto purchase liberty at the price of caste.\r\n'But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?'\r\n'I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a\r\nbeggarly set: I should not like to go a-begging.'\r\n'Would you like to go to school?'\r\nAgain I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie\r\nsometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks,\r\nwore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and\r\nprecise: John Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John\r\nReed's tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of\r\nschool-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where\r\nshe had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her\r\ndetails of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies\r\nwere, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful\r\npaintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they\r\ncould sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of\r\nFrench books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to\r\nemulation as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change:\r\nit implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an\r\nentrance into a new life.\r\n'I should indeed like to go to school,' was the audible\r\nconclusion of my musings.\r\n'Well, well! who knows what may happen?' said Mr. Lloyd, as he\r\ngot up. 'The child ought to have change of air and scene,' he added,\r\nspeaking to himself; 'nerves not in a good state.'\r\nBessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard\r\nrolling up the gravel-walk.\r\n'Is that your mistress, nurse?' asked Mr. Lloyd. 'I should like\r\nto speak to her before I go.'\r\nBessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way\r\nout. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I\r\npresume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to\r\nrecommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt\r\nreadily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject\r\nwith Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was\r\nin bed, and, as they thought, asleep, 'Missis was, she dared say, glad\r\nenough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who\r\nalways looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots\r\nunderhand.' Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of\r\ninfantine Guy Fawkes.\r\nOn that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss\r\nAbbot's communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor\r\nclergyman; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her\r\nfriends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather\r\nReed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a\r\nshilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the\r\nlatter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a\r\nlarge manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that\r\ndisease was then prevalent: that my mother took the infection from\r\nhim, and both died within a month of each other.\r\nBessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, 'Poor\r\nMiss Jane is to be pitied too, Abbot.'\r\n'Yes,' responded Abbot; 'if she were a nice, pretty child, one\r\nmight compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for\r\nsuch a little toad as that.'\r\n'Not a great deal, to be sure,' agreed Bessie: 'at any rate, a\r\nbeauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same\r\ncondition.'\r\n'Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!' cried the fervent Abbot. 'Little\r\ndarling!- with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet\r\ncolour as she has; just as if she were painted!- Bessie, I could fancy\r\na Welsh rabbit for supper.'\r\n'So could I- with a roast onion. Come, we'll go down.' They went."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                      CHAPTER IV \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"FROM my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported\r\nconference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to\r\nsuffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,-\r\nI desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and\r\nweeks passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new\r\nallusion was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed\r\nsurveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since\r\nmy illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever\r\nbetween me and her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep\r\nin by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my\r\ntime in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the\r\ndrawing-room. Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to\r\nschool: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not\r\nlong endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now\r\nmore than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted\r\naversion.\r\nEliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to\r\nme as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever\r\nhe saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly\r\nturned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and\r\ndesperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it\r\nbetter to desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I\r\nhad burst his nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as\r\nhard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either\r\nthat or my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to\r\nfollow up my advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I\r\nheard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how 'that nasty\r\nJane Eyre' had flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather\r\nharshly-\r\n'Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her;\r\nshe is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your\r\nsisters should associate with her.'\r\nHere, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and\r\nwithout at all deliberating on my words-\r\n'They are not fit to associate with me.'\r\nMrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange\r\nand audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me\r\nlike a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of\r\nmy crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or\r\nutter one syllable during the remainder of the day.\r\n'What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?' was my\r\nscarcely voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed\r\nas if my tongue pronounced words, without my will consenting to\r\ntheir utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no\r\ncontrol.\r\n'What?' said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold\r\ncomposed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took\r\nher hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know\r\nwhether I were child or fiend. I was now in for it.\r\n'My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think;\r\nand so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long,\r\nand how you wish me dead.'\r\nMrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly,\r\nshe boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie\r\nsupplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she\r\nproved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child\r\never reared under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed\r\nonly bad feelings surging in my breast.\r\nNovember, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas\r\nand the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual\r\nfestive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening\r\nparties given. From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my\r\nshare of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of\r\nEliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room,\r\ndressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair\r\nelaborately ringleted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of\r\nthe piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the\r\nbutler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments\r\nwere handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room\r\ndoor opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would\r\nretire from the stair-head to the solitary and silent nursery:\r\nthere, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had\r\nnot the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very\r\nrarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I\r\nshould have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with\r\nher, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in\r\na room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had\r\ndressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively\r\nregions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing the\r\ncandle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee till the\r\nfire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing\r\nworse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank\r\nto a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as\r\nI best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib. To\r\nthis crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something,\r\nand, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to\r\nfind a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image,\r\nshabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with\r\nwhat absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it\r\nalive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded\r\nin my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was\r\ncomparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.\r\nLong did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the\r\ncompany, and listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs:\r\nsometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her\r\nscissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper- a bun\r\nor a cheese-cake- then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and\r\nwhen I had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice\r\nshe kissed me, and said, 'Good night, Miss Jane.' When thus gentle,\r\nBessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world;\r\nand I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and\r\namiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably,\r\nas she was too often wont to do. Bessie, Lee must, I think, have\r\nbeen a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she\r\ndid, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge\r\nfrom the impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty\r\ntoo, if my recollections of her face and person are correct. I\r\nremember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very\r\nnice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious\r\nand hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice:\r\nstill, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead\r\nHall.\r\nIt was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:\r\nBessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been\r\nsummoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm\r\ngarden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was\r\nfond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and\r\nhoarding up the money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic,\r\nand a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of\r\neggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener\r\nabout flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary\r\nhaving orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products\r\nof her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair\r\noff her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to\r\nher money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or\r\nan old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered\r\nby the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued\r\ntreasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of\r\ninterest- fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every\r\nquarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.\r\nGeorgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass,\r\nand interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers,\r\nof which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was\r\nmaking my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it\r\narranged before she returned, (for Bessie now frequently employed me\r\nas a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs,\r\netc.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to\r\nthe window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's house\r\nfurniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her\r\nplaythings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates\r\nand cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for\r\nlack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers\r\nwith which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the\r\nglass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was\r\nstill and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.\r\nFrom this window were visible the porter's lodge and the\r\ncarriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white\r\nfoliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates\r\nthrown open and a carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the\r\ndrive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none\r\never brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of\r\nthe house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.\r\nAll this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found\r\nlivelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which\r\ncame and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed\r\nagainst the wall near the casement. The remains of my breakfast of\r\nbread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of\r\nroll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the\r\nwindow-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.\r\n'Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?\r\nHave you washed your hands and face this morning?' I gave another\r\ntug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its\r\nbread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone\r\nsill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I\r\nreplied-\r\n'No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.'\r\n'Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You\r\nlook quite red, as if you have been about some mischief: what were you\r\nopening the window for?'\r\nI was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too\r\ngreat a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the\r\nwashstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face\r\nand hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head\r\nwith a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying\r\nme to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was\r\nwanted in the breakfast-room.\r\nI would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs.\r\nReed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the\r\nnursery-door upon me. I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I\r\nhad never been called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to\r\nthe nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become\r\nfor me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.\r\nI now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room\r\ndoor, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable\r\nlittle poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of\r\nme in those days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to\r\ngo forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation;\r\nthe vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must\r\nenter.\r\n'Who could want me?' I asked inwardly, as with both hands I\r\nturned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted\r\nmy efforts. 'What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?-\r\na man or a woman?' The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing\r\nthrough and curtseying low, I looked up at- a black pillar!- such,\r\nat least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow,\r\nsable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top\r\nwas like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.\r\nMrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a\r\nsignal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony\r\nstranger with the words: 'This is the little girl respecting whom I\r\napplied to you.'\r\nHe, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood,\r\nand having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes\r\nwhich twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a\r\nbass voice, 'Her size is small: what is her age?'\r\n'Ten years.'\r\n'So much?' was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny\r\nfor some minutes. Presently he addressed me-\r\n'Your name, little girl?'\r\n'Jane Eyre, sir.'\r\nIn uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall\r\ngentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large, and\r\nthey and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.\r\n'Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?'\r\nImpossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world\r\nheld a contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an\r\nexpressive shake of the head, adding soon, 'Perhaps the less said on\r\nthat subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.'\r\n'Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;' and\r\nbending from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the\r\narm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed's. 'Come here,' he said.\r\nI stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before\r\nhim. What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with\r\nmine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent\r\nteeth!\r\n'No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,' he began, 'especially\r\na naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?'\r\n'They go to hell,' was my ready and orthodox answer.\r\n'And what is hell? Can you tell me that?'\r\n'A pit full of fire.'\r\n'And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there\r\nfor ever?'\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n'What must you do to avoid it?'\r\nI deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was\r\nobjectionable: 'I must keep in good health, and not die.'\r\n'How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die\r\ndaily. I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two\r\nsince,- a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to\r\nbe feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called\r\nhence.'\r\nNot being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes\r\ndown on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing\r\nmyself far enough away.\r\n'I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever\r\nhaving been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent\r\nbenefactress.'\r\n'Benefactress! benefactress!' said I inwardly: 'they all call\r\nMrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable\r\nthing.'\r\n'Do you say your prayers night and morning?' continued my\r\ninterrogator.\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n'Do you read your Bible?'\r\n'Sometimes.'\r\n'With pleasure? Are you fond of it?'\r\n'I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and\r\nSamuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and\r\nChronicles, and Job and Jonah.'\r\n'And the Psalms? I hope you like them?'\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n'No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows\r\nsix Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather\r\nhave, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he\r\nsays: \"Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;\" says he, \"I wish\r\nto be a little angel here below;\" he then gets two nuts in\r\nrecompense for his infant piety.'\r\n'Psalms are not interesting,' I remarked.\r\n'That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to\r\nchange it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of\r\nstone and give you a heart of flesh.'\r\nI was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which\r\nthat operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs.\r\nReed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry\r\non the conversation herself.\r\n'Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I\r\nwrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite\r\nthe character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her\r\ninto Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and\r\nteachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all,\r\nto guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this\r\nin your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst.'\r\nWell might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was\r\nher nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence;\r\nhowever carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please\r\nher, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as\r\nthe above. Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to\r\nthe heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope\r\nfrom the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I\r\nfelt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was\r\nsowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself\r\ntransformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an artful, noxious\r\nchild, and what could I do to remedy the injury?\r\n'Nothing, indeed,' thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob,\r\nand hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my\r\nanguish.\r\n'Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,' said Mr. Brocklehurst;\r\n'it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the\r\nlake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be\r\nwatched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.'\r\n'I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her\r\nprospects,' continued my benefactress; 'to be made useful, to be\r\nkept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission,\r\nspend them always at Lowood.'\r\n'Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,' returned Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst. 'Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly\r\nappropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that\r\nespecial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I\r\nhave studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of\r\npride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my\r\nsuccess. My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit\r\nthe school, and on her return she exclaimed: \"Oh, dear papa, how quiet\r\nand plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed\r\nbehind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little\r\nholland pockets outside their frocks- they are almost like poor\r\npeople's children! and,\" said she, \"they looked at my dress and\r\nmama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.\"'\r\n'This is the state of things I quite approve,' returned Mrs.\r\nReed; 'had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a\r\nsystem more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my\r\ndear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.'\r\n'Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has\r\nbeen observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of\r\nLowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations,\r\nhardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and\r\nits inhabitants.'\r\n'Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received\r\nas a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her\r\nposition and prospects?'\r\n'Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen\r\nplants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable\r\nprivilege of her election.'\r\n'I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for,\r\nI assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that\r\nwas becoming too irksome.'\r\n'No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I\r\nshall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my\r\ngood friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I\r\nshall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so\r\nthat there will be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.'\r\n'Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss\r\nBrocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton\r\nBrocklehurst.'\r\n'I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the Child's\r\nGuide; read it with prayer, especially that part containing \"An\r\naddicted to falsehood and deceit.\"'\r\nWith these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin\r\npamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he\r\ndeparted.\r\nMrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence;\r\nshe was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time\r\nsome six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame,\r\nsquare-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout,\r\nnot obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much\r\ndeveloped and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and\r\nprominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light\r\neyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and\r\nopaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a\r\nbell- illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager;\r\nher household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her\r\nchildren only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;\r\nshe dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off\r\nhandsome attire.\r\nSitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I\r\nexamined her figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the\r\ntract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my\r\nattention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just\r\npassed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the\r\nwhole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my\r\nmind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly,\r\nand a passion of resentment fomented now within me.\r\nMrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her\r\nfingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.\r\n'Go out of the room; return to the nursery,' was her mandate. My\r\nlook or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she\r\nspoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to\r\nthe door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the\r\nroom, then close up to her.\r\nSpeak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but\r\nhow? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I\r\ngathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence-\r\n'I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I\r\ndeclare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the\r\nworld except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give\r\nto your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.'\r\nMrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice\r\ncontinued to dwell freezingly on mine.\r\n'What more have you to say?' she asked, rather in the tone in which\r\na person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is\r\nordinarily used to a child.\r\nThat eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking\r\nfrom head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued-\r\n'I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you\r\naunt again so long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am\r\ngrown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you\r\ntreated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that\r\nyou treated me with miserable cruelty.'\r\n'How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?'\r\n'How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth. You\r\nthink I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or\r\nkindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember\r\nhow you thrust me back- roughly and violently thrust me back- into the\r\nred-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in\r\nagony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, \"Have\r\nmercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!\" And that punishment you made me\r\nsuffer because your wicked boy struck me- knocked me down for nothing.\r\nI will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People\r\nthink you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. You are\r\ndeceitful!'\r\nEre I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult,\r\nwith the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It\r\nseemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out\r\ninto unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs.\r\nReed looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was\r\nlifting up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting\r\nher face as if she would cry.\r\n'Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do\r\nyou tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?'\r\n'No, Mrs. Reed.'\r\n'Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I\r\ndesire to be your friend.'\r\n'Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a\r\ndeceitful disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what\r\nyou are, and what you have done.'\r\n'Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be\r\ncorrected for their faults.'\r\n'Deceit is not my fault!' I cried out in a savage, high voice.\r\n'But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now\r\nreturn to the nursery- there's a dear- and lie down a little.'\r\n'I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon,\r\nMrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.'\r\n'I will indeed send her to school soon,' murmured Mrs. Reed sotto\r\nvoce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.\r\nI was left there alone- winner of the field. It was the hardest\r\nbattle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood\r\nawhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed\r\nmy conqueror's solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but\r\nthis fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated\r\nthrob of my pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had\r\ndone; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had\r\ngiven mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and\r\nthe chill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing,\r\ndevouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and\r\nmenaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the\r\nflames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent\r\ncondition, when half an hour's silence and reflection had shown me the\r\nmadness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating\r\nposition.\r\nSomething of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic\r\nwine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour,\r\nmetallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.\r\nWillingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I\r\nknew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the\r\nway to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting\r\nevery turbulent impulse of my nature.\r\nI would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce\r\nspeaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than\r\nthat of sombre indignation. I took a book- some Arabian tales; I sat\r\ndown and endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my\r\nown thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found\r\nfascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the\r\nshrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or\r\nbreeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt\r\nof my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which\r\nwas quite sequestered; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees,\r\nthe falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet\r\nleaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I\r\nleaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep\r\nwere feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was\r\na very grey day; a most opaque sky, 'onding on snaw,' canopied all;\r\nthence flakes fell at intervals, which settled on the hard path and on\r\nthe hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough,\r\nwhispering to myself over and over again, 'What shall I do?- what\r\nshall I do?'\r\nAll at once I heard a clear voice call, 'Miss Jane! where are\r\nyou? Come to lunch!'\r\nIt was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light\r\nstep came tripping down the path.\r\n'You naughty little thing!' she said. 'Why don't you come when\r\nyou are called?'\r\nBessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been\r\nbrooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat\r\ncross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,\r\nI was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory\r\nanger; and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of\r\nheart. I just put my two arms round her and said, 'Come, Bessie! don't\r\nscold.'\r\nThe action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to\r\nindulge in: somehow it pleased her.\r\n'You are a strange child, Miss Jane,' she said, as she looked\r\ndown at me; 'a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to\r\nschool, I suppose?'\r\nI nodded.\r\n'And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?'\r\n'What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.'\r\n'Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You\r\nshould be bolder.'\r\n'What! to get more knocks?'\r\n'Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that's certain. My mother\r\nsaid, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a\r\nlittle one of her own to be in your place.- Now, come in, and I've\r\nsome good news for you.'\r\n'I don't think you have, Bessie.'\r\n'Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!\r\nWell, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to\r\ntea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I'll ask cook to\r\nbake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your\r\ndrawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave\r\nGateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like\r\nto take with you.'\r\n'Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.'\r\n'Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be\r\nafraid of me. Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply;\r\nit's so provoking.'\r\n'I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because\r\nI have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to\r\ndread.'\r\n'If you dread them they'll dislike you.'\r\n'As you do, Bessie?'\r\n'I don't dislike you, Miss: I believe I am fonder of you than of\r\nall the others.'\r\n'You don't show it.'\r\n'You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.\r\nWhat makes you so venturesome and hardy?'\r\n'Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides'- I was going to\r\nsay something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on\r\nsecond thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.\r\n'And so you're glad to leave me?'\r\n'Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry.'\r\n'Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I daresay\r\nnow if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say\r\nyou'd rather not.'\r\n'I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.' Bessie stooped;\r\nwe mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite\r\ncomforted. That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the\r\nevening Bessie told me some of her most enchaining stories, and sang\r\nme some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of\r\nsunshine."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                      CHAPTER V \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"FIVE o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of\r\nJanuary, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me\r\nalready up and nearly dressed. I had risen half an hour before her\r\nentrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light\r\nof a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow\r\nwindow near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach\r\nwhich passed the lodge gates at six A.M. Bessie was the only person\r\nyet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now\r\nproceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with\r\nthe thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in\r\nvain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had\r\nprepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into\r\nmy bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping\r\nherself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery. As we passed Mrs.\r\nReed's bedroom, she said, 'Will you go in and bid Missis good-bye?'\r\n'No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down\r\nto supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my\r\ncousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been\r\nmy best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her\r\naccordingly.'\r\n'What did you say, Miss?'\r\n'Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from\r\nher to the wall.'\r\n'That was wrong, Miss Jane.'\r\n'It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend:\r\nshe has been my foe.'\r\n'O Miss Jane! don't say so!'\r\n'Good-bye to Gateshead!' cried I, as we passed through the hall and\r\nwent out at the front door.\r\nThe moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern,\r\nwhose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent\r\nthaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I\r\nhastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter's lodge: when\r\nwe reached it, we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my\r\ntrunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at\r\nthe door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that\r\nhour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming\r\ncoach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly\r\nthrough the gloom.\r\n'Is she going by herself?' asked the porter's wife.\r\n'Yes.'\r\n'And how far is it?'\r\n'Fifty miles.'\r\n'What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her\r\nso far alone.'\r\nThe coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses\r\nand its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged\r\nhaste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to\r\nwhich I clung with kisses.\r\n'Be sure and take good care of her,' cried she to the guard, as\r\nhe lifted me into the inside.\r\n'Ay, ay!' was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice\r\nexclaimed 'All right,' and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie\r\nand Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed,\r\nremote and mysterious regions.\r\nI remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day\r\nseemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel\r\nover hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and\r\nin one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken\r\nout, and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn,\r\nwhere the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no\r\nappetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each\r\nend, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery\r\nhigh up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I\r\nwalked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally\r\napprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed\r\nin kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie's\r\nfireside chronicles. At last the guard returned; once more I was\r\nstowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded\r\nThe afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into\r\ndusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from\r\nGateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great\r\ngrey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we\r\ndescended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had\r\noverclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.\r\nLulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long\r\nslumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door\r\nwas open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her\r\nface and dress by the light of the lamps.\r\n'Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?' she asked. I\r\nanswered 'Yes', and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and\r\nthe coach instantly drove away.\r\nI was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and\r\nmotion of the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me.\r\nRain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly\r\ndiscerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door\r\nI passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There\r\nwas now visible a house or houses- for the building spread far- with\r\nmany windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly\r\npath, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led\r\nme through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.\r\nI stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I\r\nlooked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the\r\nhearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains,\r\nshining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or\r\nsplendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I\r\nwas puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when\r\nthe door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another\r\nfollowed close behind.\r\nThe first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and\r\nlarge forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her\r\ncountenance was grave, her bearing erect.\r\n'The child is very young to be sent alone,' said she, putting her\r\ncandle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute\r\nor two, then further added-\r\n'She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you\r\ntired?' she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.\r\n'A little, ma'am.'\r\n'And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes\r\nto bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents\r\nto come to school, my little girl?'\r\nI explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long\r\nthey had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I\r\ncould read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek\r\ngently with her forefinger, and saying, 'She hoped I should be a\r\ngood child,' dismissed me along with Miss Miller.\r\nThe lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went\r\nwith me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her\r\nvoice, look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in\r\ncomplexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and\r\naction, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she\r\nlooked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was, an\r\nunder-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment,\r\nfrom passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till,\r\nemerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that\r\nportion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many\r\nvoices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal\r\ntables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and\r\nseated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age,\r\nfrom nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their\r\nnumber to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding\r\neighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint\r\nfashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they\r\nwere engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I had\r\nheard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.\r\nMiss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then\r\nwalking up to the top of the long room she cried out-\r\n'Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!'\r\nFour tall girls arose from different tables, and going round,\r\ngathered the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word\r\nof command-\r\n'Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!'\r\nThe tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a\r\ntray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon,\r\nand a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The\r\nportions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the\r\nwater, the mug being common to all. When it came to my turn, I\r\ndrank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and\r\nfatigue rendering me incapable of eating; I now saw, however, that\r\nit was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.\r\nThe meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes\r\nfiled off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with\r\nweariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was,\r\nexcept that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I\r\nwas to be Miss Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when\r\nlaid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was\r\nquickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was\r\nextinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.\r\nThe night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream; I only\r\nonce awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall\r\nin torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place\r\nby my side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing;\r\nthe girls were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a\r\nrushlight or two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was\r\nbitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and\r\nwashed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as\r\nthere was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of\r\nthe room. Again the bell rang; all formed in file, two and two, and in\r\nthat order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit\r\nschoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she\r\ncalled out-\r\n'Form classes!'\r\nA great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller\r\nrepeatedly exclaimed, 'Silence!' and 'Order!' When it subsided, I\r\nsaw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs,\r\nplaced at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a\r\ngreat book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A\r\npause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of\r\nnumbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this\r\nindefinite sound.\r\nA distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the\r\nroom, each walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed\r\nthe fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around\r\nwhich the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior\r\nclass I was called, and placed at the bottom of it.\r\nBusiness now began: the day's Collect was repeated, then certain\r\ntexts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted\r\nreading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time\r\nthat exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The\r\nindefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were\r\nmarshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I\r\nwas to behold a prospect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly\r\nsick from inanition, having taken so little the day before.\r\nThe refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long\r\ntables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay,\r\nsent forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation\r\nof discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those\r\ndestined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls\r\nof the first class, rose the whispered words-\r\n'Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!'\r\n'Silence!' ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one\r\nof the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed,\r\nbut of somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one\r\ntable, while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain\r\nfor her I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss\r\nMiller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,\r\nforeign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards\r\nfound, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace\r\nwas said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the\r\nteachers, and the meal began.\r\nRavenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my\r\nportion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger\r\nblunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge\r\nis almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over\r\nit. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and\r\ntry to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.\r\nBreakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned\r\nfor what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory\r\nwas evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and\r\nin passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the\r\nporridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their\r\ncountenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one,\r\nwhispered-\r\n'Abominable stuff! How shameful!'\r\nA quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during\r\nwhich the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of\r\ntime it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and\r\nthey used their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the\r\nbreakfast, which one and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the\r\nsole consolation they had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the\r\nroom: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and\r\nsullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by\r\nsome lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she\r\nmade no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she\r\nshared in it.\r\nA clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle,\r\nand standing in the middle of the room, cried-\r\n'Silence! To your seats!'\r\nDiscipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was\r\nresolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour\r\nof tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but\r\nstill, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the\r\nroom, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage\r\nthey appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a\r\ncurl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow\r\ntucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped\r\nsomething like a Highlander's purse) tied in front of their frocks,\r\nand destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing\r\nwoollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles.\r\nAbove twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or\r\nrather young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even\r\nto the prettiest.\r\nI was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the\r\nteachers- none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a\r\nlittle coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh\r\nand grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple,\r\nweather-beaten, and over-worked- when, as my eye wandered from face to\r\nface, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common\r\nspring.\r\nWhat was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere\r\nI had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes\r\nwere now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and\r\nencountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at\r\nthe bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at\r\neach end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.\r\nMiss Miller, approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having\r\nreceived her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud-\r\n'Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!'\r\nWhile the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved\r\nslowly up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of\r\nveneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my\r\neyes traced her steps. Seen now, in broad day-light, she looked\r\ntall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their\r\nirids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the\r\nwhiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a\r\nvery dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the\r\nfashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets\r\nwere in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple\r\ncloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a\r\ngold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her\r\ngirdle. Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features;\r\na complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he\r\nwill have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea\r\nof the exterior of Miss Temple- Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw\r\nthe name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.\r\nThe superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having\r\ntaken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables,\r\nsummoned the first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on\r\ngeography; the lower classes were called by the teachers:\r\nrepetitions in history, grammar, etc., went on for an hour; writing\r\nand arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss\r\nTemple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was\r\nmeasured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent\r\nrose-\r\n'I have a word to address to the pupils,' said she.\r\nThe tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth,\r\nbut it sank at her voice. She went on-\r\n'You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must\r\nbe hungry:- I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be\r\nserved to all.'\r\nThe teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.\r\n'It is to be done on my responsibility,' she added, in an\r\nexplanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.\r\nThe bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to\r\nthe high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was\r\nnow given 'To the garden!' Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with\r\nstrings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze, I was\r\nsimilarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into\r\nthe open air.\r\nThe garden was a wide enclosure, surrounded with walls so high as\r\nto exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down\r\none side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into\r\nscores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the\r\npupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers\r\nthey would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of\r\nJanuary, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood\r\nand looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not\r\npositively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under\r\nfoot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The\r\nstronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but\r\nsundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in\r\nthe verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their\r\nshivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.\r\nAs yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take\r\nnotice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of\r\nisolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant\r\nagainst a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about\r\nme, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the\r\nunsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to\r\nthe employment of watching and thinking. My reflections were too\r\nundefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I\r\nwas; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable\r\ndistance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could\r\nform no conjecture. I looked round the convent-like garden, and then\r\nup at the house- a large building, half of which seemed grey and\r\nold, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom\r\nand dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave\r\nit a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this\r\ninscription-\r\nBrocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.' 'Let your light\r\nso shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify\r\nyour Father which is in heaven.'- St. Matt. v. 16.\r\nI read these words over and over again: I felt that an\r\nexplanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate\r\ntheir import. I was still pondering the signification of\r\n'Institution', and endeavouring to make out a connection between the\r\nfirst words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough\r\nclose behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a\r\nstone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which\r\nshe seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title- it was\r\nRasselas; a name that struck me as strange, and consequently\r\nattractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to\r\nher directly-\r\n'Is your book interesting?' I had already formed the intention of\r\nasking her to lend it to me some day.\r\n'I like it,' she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during\r\nwhich she examined me.\r\n'What is it about?' I continued. I hardly know where I found the\r\nhardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was\r\ncontrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a\r\nchord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a\r\nfrivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the\r\nserious or substantial.\r\n'You may look at it,' replied the girl, offering me the book.\r\nI did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were\r\nless taking than the title: Rasselas looked dull to my trifling taste;\r\nI saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety\r\nseemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her;\r\nshe received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about\r\nto relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to\r\ndisturb her-\r\n'Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door\r\nmeans? What is Lowood Institution?'\r\n'This house where you are come to live.'\r\n'And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different\r\nfrom other schools?'\r\n'It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of\r\nus, are charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not\r\neither your father or your mother dead?'\r\n'Both died before I can remember.'\r\n'Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and\r\nthis is called an institution for educating orphans.'\r\n'Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?'\r\n'We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.'\r\n'Then why do they call us charity-children?'\r\n'Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and\r\nthe deficiency is supplied by subscription.'\r\n'Who subscribes?'\r\n'Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this\r\nneighbourhood and in London.'\r\n'Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?'\r\n'The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet\r\nrecords, and whose son overlooks and directs everything here.'\r\n'Why?'\r\n'Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.'\r\n'Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a\r\nwatch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?'\r\n'To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food\r\nand all our clothes.'\r\n'Does he live here?'\r\n'No- two miles off, at a large hall.'\r\n'Is he a good man?'\r\n'He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.'\r\n'Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?'\r\n'Yes.'\r\n'And what are the other teachers called?'\r\n'The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the\r\nwork, and cuts out- for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and\r\npelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss\r\nScatcherd; she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class\r\nrepetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a\r\npocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is\r\nMadame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.'\r\n'Do you like the teachers?'\r\n'Well enough.'\r\n'Do you like the little black one, and the Madame-? -I cannot\r\npronounce her name as you do.'\r\n'Miss Scatcherd is hasty- you must take care not to offend her;\r\nMadame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.'\r\n'But Miss Temple is the best- isn't she?'\r\n'Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest,\r\nbecause she knows far more than they do.'\r\n'Have you been long here?'\r\n'Two years.'\r\n'Are you an orphan?'\r\n'My mother is dead.'\r\n'Are you happy here?'\r\n'You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough\r\nfor the present: now I want to read.'\r\nBut at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered\r\nthe house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely\r\nmore appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast:\r\nthe dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a\r\nstrong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of\r\nindifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and\r\ncooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was\r\napportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within\r\nmyself whether every day's fare would be like this.\r\nAfter dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons\r\nrecommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.\r\nThe only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl\r\nwith whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by\r\nMiss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle\r\nof the large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high\r\ndegree ignominious, especially for so great a girl- she looked\r\nthirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress\r\nand shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed:\r\ncomposed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes.\r\n'How can she bear it so quietly- so firmly?' I asked of myself.\r\n'Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open\r\nand swallow me up. She looks as if she were thinking of something\r\nbeyond her punishment- beyond her situation: of something not round\r\nher nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams- is she in a\r\nday-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they\r\ndo not see it- her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:\r\nshe is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is\r\nreally present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is- whether good or\r\nnaughty.'\r\nSoon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug\r\nof coffee, and half a slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and\r\ndrank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much\r\nmore- I was still hungry. Half an hour's recreation succeeded, then\r\nstudy; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and\r\nbed. Such was my first day at Lowood."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                      CHAPTER VI \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"THE next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by\r\nrushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the\r\nceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change\r\nhad taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen\r\nnorth-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows\r\nall night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the\r\ncontents of the ewers to ice.\r\nBefore the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was\r\nover, I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last,\r\nand this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was\r\neatable, the quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished\r\nit had been doubled.\r\nIn the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth\r\nclass, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I\r\nhad only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to\r\nbecome an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by\r\nheart, the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the\r\nfrequent change from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was\r\nglad when, about three o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into\r\nmy hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle,\r\nthimble, etc., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom,\r\nwith directions to hem the same. At that hour most of the others\r\nwere sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's\r\nchair reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons\r\ncould be heard, together with the manner in which each girl\r\nacquitted herself, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss\r\nScatcherd on the performance. It was English history: among the\r\nreaders I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the\r\ncommencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the\r\nclass, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to\r\nstops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that\r\nobscure position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of\r\nconstant notice; she was continually addressing to her such phrases as\r\nthe following:-\r\n'Burns' (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called\r\nby their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), 'Burns, you are standing on\r\nthe side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.' 'Burns, you\r\npoke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.' 'Burns, I insist on\r\nyour holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that\r\nattitude,' etc. etc.\r\nA chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and\r\nthe girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of\r\nCharles I, and there were sundry questions about tonnage and\r\npoundage and ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer;\r\nstill, every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached\r\nBurns: her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole\r\nlesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I kept\r\nexpecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead\r\nof that, she suddenly cried out-\r\n'You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails\r\nthis morning!'\r\nBurns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.\r\n'Why,' thought I, 'does she not explain that she could neither\r\nclean her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?'\r\nMy attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a\r\nskein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from\r\ntime to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether\r\nI could mark, stitch, knit, etc.; till she dismissed me, I could not\r\npursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements. When I\r\nreturned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I\r\ndid not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and\r\ngoing into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in\r\nhalf a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at\r\none end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a\r\nrespectful curtsey; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed\r\nher pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her\r\nneck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to\r\nBurns's eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers\r\nquivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent\r\nanger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary\r\nexpression.\r\n'Hardened girl!' exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; 'nothing can correct you\r\nof your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.'\r\nBurns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the\r\nbook-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her\r\npocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.\r\nThe play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction\r\nof the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee\r\nswallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not\r\nsatisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the\r\nschoolroom felt warmer than in the morning- its fires being allowed to\r\nburn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place\r\nof candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed\r\nuproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of\r\nliberty.\r\nOn the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog\r\nher pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and\r\nlaughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I\r\npassed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out;\r\nit snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes;\r\nputting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the\r\ngleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.\r\nProbably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this\r\nwould have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted\r\nthe separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart, this\r\nobscure chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from\r\nboth a strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the\r\nwind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the\r\nconfusion to rise to clamour.\r\nJumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one\r\nof the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found\r\nBurns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the\r\ncompanionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the\r\nembers.\r\n'Is it still Rasselas?' I asked, coming behind her.\r\n'Yes,' she said, 'and I have just finished it.'\r\nAnd in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.\r\n'Now,' thought I, 'I can perhaps get her to talk.' I sat down by\r\nher on the floor.\r\n'What is your name besides Burns?'\r\n'Helen.'\r\n'Do you come a long way from here?'\r\n'I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of\r\nScotland.'\r\n'Will you ever go back?'\r\n'I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.'\r\n'You must wish to leave Lowood?'\r\n'No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it\r\nwould be of no use going away until I have attained that object.'\r\n'But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?'\r\n'Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.'\r\n'And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should\r\nresist her. If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her\r\nhand; I should break it under her nose.'\r\n'Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great\r\ngrief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a\r\nsmart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action\r\nwhose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and\r\nbesides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.'\r\n'But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to\r\nstand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great\r\ngirl: I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.'\r\n'Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it:\r\nit is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be\r\nrequired to bear.'\r\nI heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of\r\nendurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the\r\nforbearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen\r\nBurns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected\r\nshe might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter\r\ndeeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.\r\n'You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very\r\ngood.'\r\n'Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss\r\nScatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in\r\norder; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my\r\nlessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot\r\nbear to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very\r\nprovoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and\r\nparticular.'\r\n'And cross and cruel,' I added; but Helen Burns would not admit\r\nmy addition: she kept silence.\r\n'Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?'\r\nAt the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over\r\nher grave face.\r\n'Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to\r\nany one, even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells\r\nme of them gently; and if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me\r\nmy meed liberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective\r\nnature is, that even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have no\r\ninfluence to cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value\r\nit most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.'\r\n'That is curious,' said I, 'it is so easy to be careful.'\r\n'For you I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your class this\r\nmorning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never\r\nseemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned\r\nyou. Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to\r\nMiss Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I\r\nlose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.\r\nSometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear\r\nround me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through\r\nDeepden, near our house;- then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I\r\nhave to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for\r\nlistening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.'\r\n'Yet how well you replied this afternoon.'\r\n'It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had\r\ninterested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was\r\nwondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and\r\nunwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity\r\nit was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no\r\nfarther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able to\r\nlook to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age\r\nwas tending! Still, I like Charles- I respect him- I pity him, poor\r\nmurdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they\r\nhad no right to shed. How dared they kill him!'\r\nHelen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not\r\nvery well understand her- that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the\r\nsubject she discussed. I recalled her to my level.\r\n'And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?'\r\n'No, certainly, not often: because Miss Temple has generally\r\nsomething to say which is newer than my own reflections; her\r\nlanguage is singularly agreeable to me, and the information she\r\ncommunicates is often just what I wished to gain.'\r\n'Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?'\r\n'Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination\r\nguides me. There is no merit in such goodness.'\r\n'A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all\r\nI ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to\r\nthose who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all\r\ntheir own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never\r\nalter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a\r\nreason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should- so\r\nhard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.'\r\n'You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you\r\nare but a little untaught girl.'\r\n'But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to\r\nplease them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish\r\nme unjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show\r\nme affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.'\r\n'Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians\r\nand civilised nations disown it.'\r\n'How? I don't understand.'\r\n'It is not violence that best overcomes hate- nor vengeance that\r\nmost certainly heals injury.'\r\n'What then?'\r\n'Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He\r\nacts; make His word your rule, and His conduct your example.'\r\n'What does He say?'\r\n'Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that\r\nhate you and despitefully use you.'\r\n'Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless\r\nher son John, which is impossible.'\r\nIn her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded\r\nforthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and\r\nresentments. Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt,\r\nwithout reserve or softening.\r\nHelen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make\r\na remark, but she said nothing.\r\n'Well,' I asked impatiently, 'is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted,\r\nbad woman?'\r\n'She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she\r\ndislikes your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but\r\nhow minutely you remember all she has done and said to you! What a\r\nsingularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your\r\nheart! No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not\r\nbe happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the\r\npassionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short to be\r\nspent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be,\r\none and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will\r\nsoon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our\r\ncorruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with\r\nthis cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will\r\nremain,- the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when\r\nit left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will\r\nreturn; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than\r\nman- perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale\r\nhuman soul to brighten to the seraph! Surely it Will never, on the\r\ncontrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot\r\nbelieve that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and\r\nwhich I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I\r\ncling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest- a\r\nmighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I\r\ncan so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can\r\nso sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed\r\nrevenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply\r\ndisgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm,\r\nlooking to the end.'\r\nHelen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she\r\nfinished this sentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk\r\nto me, but rather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not\r\nallowed much time for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl,\r\npresently came up, exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent-\r\n'Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and\r\nfold up your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and\r\nlook at it!'\r\nHelen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the\r\nmonitor without reply as without delay."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     CHAPTER VII \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MY first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age\r\neither; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in\r\nhabituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of\r\nfailure in these points harassed me worse than the physical\r\nhardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.\r\nDuring January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and,\r\nafter their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our\r\nstirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within\r\nthese limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our\r\nclothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had\r\nno boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved\r\nhands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I\r\nremember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause\r\nevery evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the\r\nswelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the\r\nscanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of\r\ngrowing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a\r\ndelicate invalid. From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an\r\nabuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the\r\nfamished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the\r\nlittle ones out of their portion. Many a time I have shared between\r\ntwo claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at\r\nteatime; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my\r\nmug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of\r\nsecret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.\r\nSundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk\r\ntwo miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set\r\nout cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we\r\nbecame almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an\r\nallowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion\r\nobserved in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.\r\nAt the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and\r\nhilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of\r\nsnowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.\r\nI can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our\r\ndrooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered,\r\ngathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and\r\nexample, to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, 'like\r\nstalwart soldiers.' The other teachers, poor things, were generally\r\nthemselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.\r\nHow we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we\r\ngot back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each\r\nhearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of\r\ngreat girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in\r\ngroups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.\r\nA little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration\r\nof bread- a whole, instead of a half, slice- with the delicious\r\naddition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to\r\nwhich we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally\r\ncontrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but\r\nthe remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.\r\nThe Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church\r\nCatechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St.\r\nMatthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose\r\nirrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of\r\nthese performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some\r\nhalf-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall\r\ndown, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be\r\ntaken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the\r\ncentre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the\r\nsermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank\r\ntogether in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors'\r\nhigh stools.\r\nI have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and\r\nindeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the\r\nfirst month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his\r\nfriend the archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not\r\nsay that I had my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did\r\nat last.\r\nOne afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was\r\nsitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division,\r\nmy eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure\r\njust passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline;\r\nand when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose\r\nen masse, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain\r\nwhose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the\r\nschoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen,\r\nstood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously\r\nfrom the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this\r\npiece of architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst,\r\nbuttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid\r\nthan ever.\r\nI had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too\r\nwell I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my\r\ndisposition, etc.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to\r\napprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along I\r\nhad been dreading the fulfilment of this promise,- I had been\r\nlooking out daily for the 'Coming Man,' whose information respecting\r\nmy past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever:\r\nnow there he was.\r\nHe stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I\r\ndid not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I\r\nwatched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see\r\nits dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I\r\nlistened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the\r\nroom, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me from\r\nimmediate apprehension.\r\n'I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do;\r\nit struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico\r\nchemises, and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith\r\nthat I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she\r\nshall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any\r\naccount, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they\r\nhave more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma'am!\r\nI wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!- when I was here\r\nlast, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying\r\non the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of\r\nrepair: from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not\r\nbeen well mended from time to time.'\r\nHe paused.\r\n'Your directions shall be attended to, sir,' said Miss Temple.\r\n'And, ma'am,' he continued, 'the laundress tells me some of the\r\ngirls have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules\r\nlimit them to one.'\r\n'I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and\r\nCatherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at\r\nLowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers\r\nfor the occasion.'\r\nMr. Brocklehurst nodded.\r\n'Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance\r\noccur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I\r\nfind, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch,\r\nconsisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls\r\nduring the past fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations,\r\nand I find no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this\r\ninnovation? and by what authority?'\r\n'I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,' replied Miss\r\nTemple: 'the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not\r\npossibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till\r\ndinner-time.'\r\n'Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing\r\nup these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and\r\nindulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should\r\nany little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as\r\nthe spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish,\r\nthe incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something\r\nmore delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and\r\nobviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to\r\nthe spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince\r\nfortitude under the temporary privation. A brief address on those\r\noccasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor\r\nwould take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the\r\nprimitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the\r\nexhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples\r\nto take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man\r\nshall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out\r\nof the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, \"If ye suffer\r\nhunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye.\" Oh, madam, when you put\r\nbread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's\r\nmouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think\r\nhow you starve their immortal souls!'\r\nMr. Brocklehurst again paused- perhaps overcome by his feelings.\r\nMiss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but\r\nshe now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as\r\nmarble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that\r\nmaterial; especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required\r\na sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into\r\npetrified severity.\r\nMeantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands\r\nbehind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly\r\nhis eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled\r\nor shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he\r\nhad hitherto used-\r\n'Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what- what is that girl with curled\r\nhair? Red hair, ma'am, curled- curled all over?' And extending his\r\ncane he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.\r\n'It is Julia Severn,' replied Miss Temple, very quietly.\r\n'Julia Severn, ma'am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair?\r\nWhy, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does\r\nshe conform to the world so openly- here in an evangelical, charitable\r\nestablishment- as to wear her hair one mass of curls?'\r\n'Julia's hair curls naturally,' returned Miss Temple, still more\r\nquietly.\r\n'Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish\r\nthese girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I\r\nhave again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged\r\nclosely, modestly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be\r\ncut off entirely; I will send a barber tomorrow: and I see others\r\nwho have far too much of the excrescence- that tall girl, tell her\r\nto turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their\r\nfaces to the wall.'\r\nMiss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to\r\nsmooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the\r\norder, however, and when the first class could take in what was\r\nrequired of them, they obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I\r\ncould see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this\r\nmanoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he\r\nwould perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of\r\nthe cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference\r\nthan he imagined.\r\nHe scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five\r\nminutes, then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell\r\nof doom-\r\n'All those top-knots must be cut off.'\r\nMiss Temple seemed to remonstrate.\r\n'Madam,' he pursued, 'I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not\r\nof this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of\r\nthe flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and\r\nsobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the\r\nyoung persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which\r\nvanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off;\r\nthink of the time wasted, of-'\r\nMr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors,\r\nladies, now entered the room. They ought to have come a little\r\nsooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly\r\nattired in velvet, silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine\r\ngirls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion,\r\nshaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful\r\nhead-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled;\r\nthe elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with\r\nermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.\r\nThese ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs.\r\nand the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the\r\ntop of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their\r\nreverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the\r\nroom upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper,\r\nquestioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now\r\nproceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who\r\nwas charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the\r\ndormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other\r\nmatters called off and enchained my attention.\r\nHitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst\r\nand Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to\r\nsecure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I\r\ncould only elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on\r\nthe form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my\r\nslate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped\r\nnotice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from\r\nmy hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye\r\nupon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up\r\nthe two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It\r\ncame.\r\n'A careless girl!' said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after-\r\n'It is the new pupil, I perceive.' And before I could draw breath,\r\n'I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her.' Then aloud:\r\nhow loud it seemed to me! 'Let the child who broke her slate come\r\nforward!'\r\nOf my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the\r\ntwo great girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and\r\npushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently\r\nassisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel-\r\n'Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not\r\nbe punished.'\r\nThe kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.\r\n'Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,'\r\nthought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and\r\nCo. bounded in my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.\r\n'Fetch that stool,' said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very\r\nhigh one from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.\r\n'Place the child upon it.'\r\nAnd I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition\r\nto note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to\r\nthe height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of\r\nme, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a\r\ncloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.\r\nMr. Brocklehurst hemmed.\r\n'Ladies,' said he, turning to his family, 'Miss Temple, teachers,\r\nand children, you all see this girl?'\r\nOf course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like\r\nburning-glasses against my scorched skin.\r\n'You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary\r\nform of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He\r\nhas given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked\r\ncharacter. Who would think that the Evil One had already found a\r\nservant and agent in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.'\r\nA pause- in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and\r\nto feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer\r\nto be shirked, must be firmly sustained.\r\n'My dear children,' pursued the black marble clergyman, with\r\npathos, 'this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my\r\nduty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs,\r\nis a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an\r\ninterloper and an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you\r\nmust shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her\r\nfrom your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you\r\nmust watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words,\r\nscrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if,\r\nindeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I\r\ntell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land,\r\nworse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and\r\nkneels before Juggernaut- this girl is- a liar!'\r\nNow came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in\r\nperfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts\r\nproduce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics,\r\nwhile the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two\r\nyounger ones whispered, 'How shocking!'\r\nMr. Brocklehurst resumed.\r\n'This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and\r\ncharitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her\r\nown daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl\r\nrepaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her\r\nexcellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young\r\nones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their\r\npurity: she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old\r\nsent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers,\r\nsuperintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round\r\nher.'\r\nWith this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top\r\nbutton of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose,\r\nbowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state\r\nfrom the room. Turning at the door, my judge said-\r\n'Let her stand half an hour longer on that stool, and let no one\r\nspeak to her during the remainder of the day.'\r\nThere was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not\r\nbear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the\r\nroom, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my\r\nsensations were, no language can describe; but just as they all\r\nrose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up\r\nand passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light\r\ninspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through\r\nme! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had\r\npassed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I\r\nmastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand\r\non the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight questions about her work\r\nof Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned\r\nto her place, and smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I\r\nremember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine\r\nintellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her\r\nthin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of\r\nan angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm 'the untidy\r\nbadge;' scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss\r\nScatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had\r\nblotted an exercise in copying it out. Such is the imperfect nature of\r\nman! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes\r\nlike Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind\r\nto the full brightness of the orb."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     CHAPTER VIII \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"ERE the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed,\r\nand all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to\r\ndescend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the\r\nfloor. The spell by which I had been so far supported began to\r\ndissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief\r\nthat seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I\r\nwept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I\r\nabandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be\r\nso good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn\r\nrespect and win affection. Already I had made visible progress; that\r\nvery morning I had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had\r\npraised me warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; she had\r\npromised to teach me drawing, and to let me learn French, if I\r\ncontinued to make similar improvement two months longer: and then I\r\nwas well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of\r\nmy own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and\r\ntrodden on; and could I ever rise more?\r\n'Never,' I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out\r\nthis wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up-\r\nagain Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming\r\nup the long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.\r\n'Come, eat something,' she said; but I put both away from me,\r\nfeeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present\r\ncondition. Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not\r\nnow abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep\r\naloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her\r\narms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained\r\nsilent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke-\r\n'Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a\r\nliar?'\r\n'Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have\r\nheard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.'\r\n'But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know, despise\r\nme.'\r\n'Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either\r\ndespises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.'\r\n'How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?'\r\n'Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and\r\nadmired man; he is little liked here; he never took steps to make\r\nhimself liked. Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you\r\nwould have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it\r\nis, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared.\r\nTeachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but\r\nfriendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you\r\npersevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much\r\nthe more evidently for their temporary suppression. Besides, Jane'-\r\nshe paused.\r\n'Well, Helen?' said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my\r\nfingers gently to warm them, and went on-\r\n'If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your\r\nown conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would\r\nnot be without friends.'\r\n'No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not\r\nenough: if others don't love me I would rather die than live- I cannot\r\nbear to be solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real\r\naffection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love,\r\nI would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to\r\nlet a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it\r\ndash its hoof at my chest-'\r\n'Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you\r\nare too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created\r\nyour frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other\r\nresources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you.\r\nBesides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible\r\nworld and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is\r\neverywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to\r\nguard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on\r\nall sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise\r\nour innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge\r\nwhich Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at secondhand\r\nfrom Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on\r\nyour clear front), and God waits only the separation of spirit from\r\nflesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink\r\noverwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is\r\nso certain an entrance to happiness- to glory?'\r\nI was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she\r\nimparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the\r\nimpression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came;\r\nand when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed\r\na short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague\r\nconcern for her.\r\nResting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist;\r\nshe drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long\r\nthus, when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the\r\nsky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming\r\nin through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching\r\nfigure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.\r\n'I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,' said she; 'I want you\r\nin my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.'\r\nWe went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to\r\nthread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we\r\nreached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked\r\ncheerful. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair\r\non one side of the hearth, and herself taking another, she called me\r\nto her side.\r\n'Is it all over?' she asked, looking down at my face. 'Have you\r\ncried your grief away?'\r\n'I am afraid I never shall do that.'\r\n'Why?'\r\n'Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody\r\nelse, will now think me wicked.'\r\n'We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.\r\nContinue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.'\r\n'Shall I, Miss Temple?'\r\n'You will,' said she, passing her arm round me. 'And now tell me\r\nwho is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?'\r\n'Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to\r\nher care.'\r\n'Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?'\r\n'No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have\r\noften heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that\r\nshe would always keep me.'\r\n'Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a\r\ncriminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.\r\nYou have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as\r\nyou can. Say whatever your memory suggests as true; but add nothing\r\nand exaggerate nothing.'\r\nI resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most\r\nmoderate- most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order\r\nto arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of\r\nmy sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued\r\nthan it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of\r\nHelen's warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused\r\ninto the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus\r\nrestrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I\r\nwent on that Miss Temple fully believed me.\r\nIn the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having\r\ncome to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful\r\nepisode of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure,\r\nin some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my\r\nrecollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed\r\nspurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time\r\nin the dark and haunted chamber.\r\nI had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence;\r\nshe then said-\r\n'I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his\r\nreply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from\r\nevery imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.'\r\nShe kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well\r\ncontented to stand for I derived a child's pleasure from the\r\ncontemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her\r\nwhite forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark\r\neyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.\r\n'How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?'\r\n'Not quite so much, I think, ma'am.'\r\n'And the pain in your chest?'\r\n'It is a little better.'\r\nMiss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then\r\nshe returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.\r\nShe was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said\r\ncheerfully-\r\n'But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.'\r\nShe rang her bell.\r\n'Barbara,' she said to the servant who answered it, 'I have not yet\r\nhad tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.'\r\nAnd a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the\r\nchina cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table\r\nnear the fire! How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the\r\nscent of the toast! of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was\r\nbeginning to be hungry), discerned only a very small portion: Miss\r\nTemple discerned it too.\r\n'Barbara,' said she, 'can you not bring a little more bread and\r\nbutter? There is not enough for three.'\r\nBarbara went out: she returned soon-\r\n'Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.'\r\nMrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and\r\niron.\r\n'Oh, very well!' returned Miss Temple; 'we must make it do,\r\nBarbara, I suppose.' And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling,\r\n'Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this\r\nonce.'\r\nHaving invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed\r\nbefore each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of\r\ntoast, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel\r\nwrapped in paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized\r\nseed-cake.\r\n'I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,' said\r\nshe, 'but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,' and\r\nshe proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.\r\nWe feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the\r\nleast delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with\r\nwhich our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished\r\nappetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied.\r\nTea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire;\r\nwe sat one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed\r\nbetween her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be\r\nadmitted to hear.\r\nMiss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state\r\nin her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded\r\ndeviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which\r\nchastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her,\r\nby a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as\r\nto Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.\r\nThe refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and\r\nkindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all\r\nthese, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers\r\nwithin her. They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the\r\nbright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but\r\npale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her\r\neyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that\r\nof Miss Temple's- a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash,\r\nnor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her\r\nsoul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot\r\ntell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to\r\nhold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the\r\ncharacteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening;\r\nher spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much\r\nas many live during a protracted existence.\r\nThey conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times\r\npast; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or\r\nguessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores\r\nof knowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with\r\nFrench names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax\r\nwhen Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to\r\nrecall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a\r\nshelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen\r\nobeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line. She\r\nhad scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could\r\nbe admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to\r\nher heart-\r\n'God bless you, my children!'\r\nHelen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more\r\nreluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her\r\nshe a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from\r\nher cheek.\r\nOn reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd:\r\nshe was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's,\r\nand when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told\r\nthat to-morrow she should have half a dozen of untidily folded\r\narticles pinned to her shoulder.\r\n'My things were indeed in shameful disorder,' murmured Helen to me,\r\nin a low voice: 'I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.'\r\nNext morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a\r\npiece of pasteboard the word 'Slattern,' and bound it like a\r\nphylactery round Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and\r\nbenign-looking forehead. She wore it till evening, patient,\r\nunresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. The moment Miss\r\nScatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it\r\noff, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which she was\r\nincapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and\r\nlarge, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of\r\nher sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.\r\nAbout a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss\r\nTemple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared\r\nthat what he said went to corroborate my account. Miss Temple,\r\nhaving assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been\r\nmade into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most\r\nhappy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every\r\nimputation. The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a\r\nmurmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.\r\nThus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work\r\nafresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I\r\ntoiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my\r\nmemory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise\r\nsharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in\r\nless than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I\r\nlearned the first two tenses of the verb Etre, and sketched my first\r\ncottage (whose walls, by the bye, outrivalled in slope those of the\r\nleaning tower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to\r\nbed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot\r\nroast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont\r\nto amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the spectacle of\r\nideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands:\r\nfreely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins,\r\nCuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies hovering\r\nover unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wrens' nests\r\nenclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays. I\r\nexamined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to\r\ntranslate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot\r\nhad that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my\r\nsatisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.\r\nWell has Solomon said- 'Better is a dinner of herbs where love\r\nis, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.'\r\nI would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for\r\nGateshead and its daily luxuries."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                      CHAPTER IX \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"BUT the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.\r\nSpring drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter\r\nhad ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My\r\nwretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of\r\nJanuary, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of\r\nApril; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature\r\nfroze the very blood in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour\r\npassed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be\r\npleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds,\r\nwhich, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed\r\nthem at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps.\r\nFlowers peeped out amongst the leaves; snowdrops, crocuses, purple\r\nauriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday afternoons\r\n(half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers\r\nopening by the wayside, under the hedges.\r\nI discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the\r\nhorizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls\r\nof our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits\r\ngirdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a\r\nbright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different\r\nhad this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky\r\nof winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!- when mists as\r\nchill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those\r\npurple peaks, and rolled down 'ing' and holm till they blended with\r\nthe frozen fog of the beck! That beck itself was then a torrent,\r\nturbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound\r\nthrough the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and\r\nfor the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.\r\nApril advanced to May: a bright, serene May it was; days of blue\r\nsky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its\r\nduration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose\r\nits tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and\r\noak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang\r\nup profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled\r\nits hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth\r\nof its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in\r\novershadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I\r\nenjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this\r\nunwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now\r\nbecomes my task to advert.\r\nHave I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak\r\nof it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a\r\nstream? Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is\r\nanother question.\r\nThat forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and\r\nfog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring,\r\ncrept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded\r\nschoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the\r\nseminary into an hospital.\r\nSemi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the\r\npupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay\r\nill at one time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who\r\ncontinued well were allowed almost unlimited license; because the\r\nmedical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to\r\nkeep them in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure\r\nto watch or restrain them. Miss Temple's whole attention was\r\nabsorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting\r\nit except to snatch a few hours' rest at night. The teachers were\r\nfully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations\r\nfor the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have\r\nfriends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of\r\ncontagion. Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died\r\nat the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of\r\nthe malady forbidding delay.\r\nWhile disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death\r\nits frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls;\r\nwhile its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug\r\nand the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of\r\nmortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and\r\nbeautiful woodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers:\r\nhollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips\r\nand roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay\r\nwith pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out,\r\nmorning and evening, their scent of spice and apples; and these\r\nfragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood,\r\nexcept to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to\r\nput in a coffin.\r\nBut I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the\r\nbeauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like\r\ngipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where\r\nwe liked: we lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never\r\ncame near Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the\r\ncross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection;\r\nher successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to\r\nthe ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality.\r\nBesides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our\r\nbreakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare\r\na regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large\r\npiece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we\r\ncarried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we\r\nliked best, and dined sumptuously.\r\nMy favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and\r\ndry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by\r\nwading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone\r\nwas just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and\r\nme, at that time my chosen comrade- one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd,\r\nobservant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly\r\nbecause she was witty and original, and partly because she had a\r\nmanner which set me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more\r\nof the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with\r\nher my curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she gave ample\r\nindulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had\r\na turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to\r\nquestion; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much\r\nentertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.\r\nAnd where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these\r\nsweet days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so\r\nworthless as to have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the\r\nMary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first\r\nacquaintance: she could only tell me amusing stories, and\r\nreciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in;\r\nwhile, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified to give\r\nthose who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far\r\nhigher things.\r\nTrue, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective\r\nbeing, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of\r\nHelen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of\r\nattachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever\r\nanimated my heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times\r\nand under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful\r\nfriendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never\r\ntroubled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been\r\nremoved from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I\r\nwas told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever\r\npatients; for her complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by\r\nconsumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which\r\ntime and care would be sure to alleviate.\r\nI was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice\r\ncoming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by\r\nMiss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not\r\nallowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom\r\nwindow, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and\r\nsat at a distance under the verandah.\r\nOne evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late\r\nwith Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves\r\nfrom the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way,\r\nand had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived,\r\nwho looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the\r\nwood. When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew\r\nto be the surgeon's, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann\r\nremarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had\r\nbeen sent for at that time of the evening. She went into the house;\r\nI stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots\r\nI had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I\r\nleft them till the morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer:\r\nthe flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant\r\nevening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly\r\nanother fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the\r\ngrave east. I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child\r\nmight, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:-\r\n'How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of\r\ndying! This world is pleasant- it would be dreary to be called from\r\nit, and to have to go who knows where?'\r\nAnd then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what\r\nhad been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first\r\ntime it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind,\r\non each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it\r\nfelt the one point where it stood- the present; all the rest was\r\nformless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of\r\ntottering, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new\r\nidea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him\r\nwas a nurse. After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she\r\nwas about to close the door, but I ran up to her.\r\n'How is Helen Burns?'\r\n'Very poorly,' was the answer.\r\n'Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?'\r\n'Yes.'\r\n'And what does he say about her?'\r\n'He says she'll not be here long.'\r\nThis phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only\r\nconveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to\r\nNorthumberland, to her own home. I should not have suspected that it\r\nmeant she was dying; but I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my\r\ncomprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this\r\nworld, and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if\r\nsuch region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong\r\nthrill of grief, then a desire- a necessity to see her; and I asked in\r\nwhat room she lay.\r\n'She is in Miss Temple's room,' said the nurse.\r\n'May I go up and speak to her?'\r\n'Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come\r\nin; you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.'\r\nThe nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance\r\nwhich led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine\r\no'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.\r\nIt might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I- not\r\nhaving been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence\r\nof the dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound\r\nrepose- rose softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without\r\nshoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's\r\nroom. It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way;\r\nand the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at\r\npassage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of\r\ncamphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room:\r\nand I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all\r\nnight should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for\r\nI must see Helen,- I must embrace her before she died,- I must give\r\nher one last kiss, exchange with her one last word.\r\nHaving descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house\r\nbelow, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two\r\ndoors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then\r\njust opposite to me was Miss Temple's room. A light shone through\r\nthe keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the\r\nvicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to\r\nadmit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to\r\nhesitate, and full of impatient impulses- soul and senses quivering\r\nwith keen throes- I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen,\r\nand feared to find death.\r\nClose by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white\r\ncurtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under\r\nthe clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had\r\nspoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed\r\ncandle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I\r\nknew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the\r\nfever-room. I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on\r\nthe curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still\r\nrecoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.\r\n'Helen!' I whispered softly, 'are you awake?'\r\nShe stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face,\r\npale, wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my\r\nfear was instantly dissipated.\r\n'Can it be you, Jane?' she asked, in her own gentle voice.\r\n'Oh!' I thought, 'she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she\r\ncould not speak and look so calmly if she were.'\r\nI got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her\r\ncheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she\r\nsmiled as of old.\r\n'Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it\r\nstrike some minutes since.'\r\n'I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could\r\nnot sleep till I had spoken to you.'\r\n'You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.'\r\n'Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?'\r\n'Yes; to my long home- my last home.'\r\n'No, no, Helen!' I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour\r\nmy tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake\r\nthe nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then\r\nshe whispered-\r\n'Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself\r\nwith my quilt.'\r\nI did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.\r\nAfter a long silence, she resumed, still whispering-\r\n'I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you\r\nmust be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We\r\nall must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not\r\npainful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no\r\none to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is lately married,\r\nand will not miss me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.\r\nI had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the\r\nworld: I should have been continually at fault.'\r\n'But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?'\r\n'I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.'\r\n'Where is God? What is God?'\r\n'My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely\r\nimplicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count\r\nthe hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to\r\nHim, reveal Him to me.'\r\n'You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven,\r\nand that our souls can get to it when we die?'\r\n'I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can\r\nresign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my\r\nfather; God is my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.'\r\n'And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?'\r\n'You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by\r\nthe same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.'\r\nAgain I questioned, but this time only in thought. 'Where is that\r\nregion? Does it exist?' And I clasped my arms closer around Helen; she\r\nseemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go;\r\nI lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the\r\nsweetest tone-\r\n'How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a\r\nlittle; I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like\r\nto have you near me.'\r\n'I'll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.'\r\n'Are you warm, darling?'\r\n'Yes.'\r\n'Good-night, Jane.'\r\n'Good-night, Helen.'\r\nShe kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.\r\nWhen I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked\r\nup; I was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me\r\nthrough the passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for\r\nleaving my bed; people had something else to think about; no\r\nexplanation was afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two\r\nafterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at\r\ndawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen\r\nBurns's shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was-\r\ndead.\r\nHer grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after\r\nher death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble\r\ntablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word\r\n'Resurgam.'"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                      CHAPTER X \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"HITHERTO I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant\r\nexistence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as\r\nmany chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am\r\nonly bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess\r\nsome degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years\r\nalmost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links\r\nof connection.\r\nWhen the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at\r\nLowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its\r\nvirulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention\r\non the school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by\r\ndegrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a\r\nhigh degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and\r\nquality of the children's food; the brackish, fetid water used in\r\nits preparation; the pupils' wretched clothing and accommodations- all\r\nthese things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result\r\nmortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.\r\nSeveral wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed\r\nlargely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better\r\nsituation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and\r\nclothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the\r\nmanagement of a committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth\r\nand family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the\r\npost of treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties\r\nby gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his\r\noffice of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to\r\ncombine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion\r\nwith uprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly\r\nuseful and noble institution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after\r\nits regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher;\r\nand in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and\r\nimportance.\r\nDuring these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy,\r\nbecause it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education\r\nplaced within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a\r\ndesire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my\r\nteachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself\r\nfully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first\r\ngirl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of\r\nteacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of\r\nthat time I altered.\r\nMiss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued\r\nsuperintendent of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best\r\npart of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my\r\ncontinual solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother,\r\ngoverness, and, latterly, companion. At this period she married,\r\nremoved with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy\r\nof such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.\r\nFrom the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone\r\nevery settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in\r\nsome degree a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her\r\nnature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed\r\nbetter regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had\r\ngiven in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was\r\ncontent: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a\r\ndisciplined and subdued character.\r\nBut destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between\r\nme and Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a\r\npost-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise\r\nmount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my\r\nown room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the\r\nhalf-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.\r\nI walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only\r\nto be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my\r\nreflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the\r\nafternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned\r\non me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming\r\nprocess; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss\r\nTemple- or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere\r\nI had been breathing in her vicinity- and that now I was left in my\r\nnatural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.\r\nIt did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive\r\nwere gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me,\r\nbut the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some\r\nyears been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems;\r\nnow I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field\r\nof hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who\r\nhad courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of\r\nlife amidst its perils.\r\nI went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the\r\ntwo wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts\r\nof Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other\r\nobjects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I\r\nlonged to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed\r\nprison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the\r\nbase of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I\r\nlonged to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had\r\ntravelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill\r\nat twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought\r\nme first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had\r\nall been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to\r\nGateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit\r\nme. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer\r\nworld: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and\r\nvoices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and\r\nantipathies- such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it\r\nwas not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one\r\nafternoon. I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I\r\nuttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly\r\nblowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change,\r\nstimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space:\r\n'Then,' I cried, half desperate, 'grant me at least a new servitude!'\r\nHere a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.\r\nI was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections\r\ntill bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me\r\nkept me from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged\r\neffusion of small talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It\r\nseemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered\r\nmy mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise\r\nfor my relief.\r\nMiss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welsh-woman, and till\r\nnow her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any\r\nother light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes\r\nwith satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my\r\nhalf-effaced thought instantly revived.\r\n'A new servitude! There is something in that,' I soliloquised\r\n(mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud). 'I know there\r\nis, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words\r\nas Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no\r\nmore than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere\r\nwaste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter of\r\nfact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I\r\nwant is to serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is\r\nnot the thing feasible? Yes- yes- the end is not so difficult; if I\r\nhad only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining\r\nit.'\r\nI sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly\r\nnight; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to\r\nthink again with all my might.\r\n'What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces,\r\nunder new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting\r\nanything better. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to\r\nfriends, I suppose: I have no friends. There are many others who\r\nhave no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own\r\nhelpers; and what is their resource?'\r\nI could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to\r\nfind a response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt\r\nthe pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it\r\nworked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain\r\nlabour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain,\r\nnoted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.\r\nA kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required\r\nsuggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and\r\nnaturally to my mind:- 'Those who want situations advertise; you\r\n'How? I know nothing about advertising.'\r\nReplies rose smooth and prompt now:-\r\n'You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it\r\nunder a cover directed to the editor of the Herald; you must put it,\r\nthe first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers\r\nmust be addressed to J. E., at the post-office there; you can go and\r\ninquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come,\r\nand act accordingly.'\r\nThis scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my\r\nmind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell\r\nasleep.\r\nWith earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written,\r\nenclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it\r\nran thus:-\r\n'A young lady accustomed to tuition' (had I not been a teacher\r\ntwo years?) 'is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private\r\nfamily where the children are under fourteen' (I thought that as I was\r\nbarely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils\r\nnearer my own age). 'She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a\r\ngood English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music'\r\n(in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of\r\naccomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive).\r\nThis document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I\r\nasked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to\r\nperform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my\r\nfellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk\r\nof two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I\r\nvisited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and\r\ncame back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a\r\nrelieved heart.\r\nThe succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last,\r\nhowever, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close\r\nof a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to\r\nLowton. A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side\r\nof the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that\r\nday I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting\r\nme at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of\r\nlea and water.\r\nMy ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a\r\npair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was\r\ndone, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the\r\nshoemaker's to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore\r\nhorn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.\r\n'Are there any letters for J. E.?' I asked.\r\nShe peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a\r\ndrawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my\r\nhopes began to falter. At last, having held a document before her\r\nglasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the\r\ncounter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful\r\nglance- it was for J. E.\r\n'Is there only one?' I demanded.\r\n'There are no more,' said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned\r\nmy face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be\r\nback by eight, and it was already half-past seven.\r\nVarious duties awaited me on my arrival: I had to sit with the\r\ngirls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers;\r\nto see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.\r\nEven when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss\r\nGryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our\r\ncandlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all\r\nburnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten\r\nproduced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had\r\nfinished undressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now\r\ntook out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the\r\ncontents were brief.\r\nThursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a\r\nposition to give satisfactory references as to character and\r\ncompetency, a situation can be offered her where there is but one\r\npupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary\r\nis thirty pounds per annum. J. E. is requested to send references,\r\nname, address, and all particulars to the direction:-\r\nI examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and\r\nrather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance\r\nwas satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting\r\nfor myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into\r\nsome scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my\r\nendeavours to be respectable, proper, en regle. I now felt that an\r\nelderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs.\r\nFairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps,\r\nbut not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability.\r\nThornfield! that, doubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly\r\nspot, I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive a\r\nrecollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it; both the shire and\r\ncounty where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I\r\nlonged to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large\r\ndoubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least.\r\nNot that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and\r\nclouds of smoke- 'but,' I argued, 'Thornfield will, probably, be a\r\ngood way from the town.'\r\nHere the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.\r\nNext day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be\r\nconfined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve\r\ntheir success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the\r\nsuperintendent during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a\r\nprospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double\r\nwhat I now received (for at Lowood I only got L15 per annum); and\r\nrequested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or\r\nsome of the committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to\r\nmention them as references. She obligingly consented to act as\r\nmediatrix in the matter. The next day she laid the affair before Mr.\r\nBrocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she was\r\nmy natural guardian. A note was accordingly addressed to that lady,\r\nwho returned for answer, that 'I might do as I pleased: she had long\r\nrelinquished all interference in my affairs.' This note went the round\r\nof the committee, and at last, after what appeared to me most\r\ntedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I\r\ncould; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself\r\nwell, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character\r\nand capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should\r\nforthwith be furnished me.\r\nThis testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded\r\na copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating\r\nthat she was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period\r\nfor my assuming the post of governess in her house.\r\nI now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed\r\nrapidly. I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my\r\nwants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,- the same I had\r\nbrought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.\r\nThe box was corded, the card nailed on. In half an hour the carrier\r\nwas to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to\r\nrepair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had\r\nbrushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves,\r\nand muff; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left\r\nbehind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to\r\nrest. I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not\r\nnow repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life\r\nwas closing tonight, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to\r\nslumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change\r\nwas being accomplished.\r\n'Miss,' said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was\r\nwandering like a troubled spirit, 'a person below wishes to see you.'\r\n'The carrier, no doubt,' I thought, and ran downstairs without\r\ninquiry. I was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the\r\ndoor of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran\r\nout-\r\n'It's her, I am sure!- I could have told her anywhere!' cried the\r\nindividual who stopped my progress and took my hand.\r\nI looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant,\r\nmatronly, yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and\r\neyes, and lively complexion.\r\n'Well, who is it?' she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half\r\nrecognised; 'you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?'\r\nIn another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously:\r\n'Bessie! Bessie! Bessie!' that was all I said; whereat she half\r\nlaughed, half cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire\r\nstood a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.\r\n'That is my little boy,' said Bessie directly.\r\n'Then you are married, Bessie?'\r\n'Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and\r\nI've a little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane.'\r\n'And you don't live at Gateshead?'\r\n'I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.'\r\n'Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them,\r\nBessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee,\r\nwill you?' but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.\r\n'You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,'\r\ncontinued Mrs. Leaven. 'I daresay they've not kept you too well at\r\nschool: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and\r\nMiss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.'\r\n'Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?'\r\n'Very. She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there\r\neverybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his\r\nrelations were against the match; and- what do you think?- he and Miss\r\nGeorgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.\r\nIt was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and\r\nnow she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are\r\nalways quarrelling.'\r\n'Well, and what of John Reed?'\r\n'Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He went to\r\ncollege, and he got- plucked, I think they call it: and then his\r\nuncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such\r\na dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.'\r\n'What does he look like?'\r\n'He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man;\r\nbut he has such thick lips.'\r\n'And Mrs. Reed?'\r\n'Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think\r\nshe's not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please\r\nher- he spends a deal of money.'\r\n'Did she send you here, Bessie?'\r\n'No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard\r\nthat there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to\r\nanother part of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a\r\nlook at you before you were quite out of my reach.'\r\n'I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.' I said this\r\nlaughing: I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed\r\nregard, did in no shape denote admiration.\r\n'No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look\r\nlike a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were\r\nno beauty as a child.'\r\nI smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct,\r\nbut I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen\r\nmost people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an\r\nexterior likely to second that desire brings anything but\r\ngratification.\r\n'I daresay you are clever, though,' continued Bessie, by way of\r\nsolace. 'What can you do? Can you play on the piano?'\r\n'A little.'\r\nThere was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then\r\nasked me to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and\r\nshe was charmed.\r\n'The Miss Reeds could not play as well!' said she exultingly. 'I\r\nalways said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?'\r\n'That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.' It was a\r\nlandscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the\r\nsuperintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the\r\ncommittee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.\r\n'Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any\r\nMiss Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies\r\nthemselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?'\r\n'Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.'\r\n'And you can work on muslin and canvas?'\r\n'I can.'\r\n'Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will\r\nget on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I\r\nwanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father's\r\nkinsfolk, the Eyres?'\r\n'Never in my life.'\r\n'Well, you know, Missis always said they were poor and quite\r\ndespicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much\r\ngentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr.\r\nEyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were\r\nat school fifty miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he\r\ncould not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the\r\nship was to sail from London in a day or two. He looked quite a\r\ngentleman, and I believe he was your father's brother.'\r\n'What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?'\r\n'An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine- the butler\r\ndid tell me-'\r\n'Madeira?' I suggested.\r\n'Yes, that is it- that is the very word.'\r\n'So he went?'\r\n'Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very\r\nhigh with him; she called him afterwards a \"sneaking tradesman.\" My\r\nRobert believes he was a wine-merchant.'\r\n'Very likely,' I returned; 'or perhaps clerk or agent to a\r\nwine-merchant.'\r\nBessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she\r\nwas obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next\r\nmorning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted\r\nfinally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there, each went her\r\nseparate way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the\r\nconveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the\r\nvehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the\r\nunknown environs of Millcote."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                      CHAPTER XI \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"A NEW chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play;\r\nand when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you\r\nsee a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured\r\npapering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such\r\nfurniture, such ornaments on the mantel-piece, such prints,\r\nincluding a portrait of George the Third, and another of the Prince of\r\nWales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is visible\r\nto you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by\r\nthat of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my\r\nmuff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness\r\nand chill contracted by sixteen hours' exposure to the rawness of an\r\nOctober day: I left Lowton at four o'clock A.M., and the Millcote town\r\nclock is now just striking eight.\r\nReader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very\r\ntranquil in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would\r\nbe some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the\r\nwooden steps the 'boots' placed for my convenience, expecting to\r\nhear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage\r\nwaiting to convey me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible;\r\nand when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a\r\nMiss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to\r\nrequest to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting,\r\nwhile all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.\r\nIt is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel\r\nitself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection,\r\nuncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and\r\nprevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.\r\nThe charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride\r\nwarms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me\r\nbecame predominant when half an hour elapsed and still I was alone.\r\nI bethought myself to ring the bell.\r\n'Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?' I asked\r\nof the waiter who answered the summons.\r\n'Thornfield? I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar.' He\r\nvanished, but reappeared instantly-\r\n'Is your name Eyre, Miss?'\r\n'Yes.'\r\n'Person here waiting for you.'\r\nI jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the\r\ninn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the\r\nlamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.\r\n'This will be your luggage, I suppose?' said the man rather\r\nabruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.\r\n'Yes.' He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car,\r\nand then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to\r\nThornfield.\r\n'A matter of six miles.'\r\n'How long shall we be before we get there?'\r\n'Happen an hour and a half.'\r\nHe fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we\r\nset off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to\r\nreflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of my\r\njourney; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant\r\nconveyance, I meditated much at my ease.\r\n'I suppose,' thought I, 'judging from the plainness of the\r\nservant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so\r\nmuch the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was\r\nvery miserable with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this\r\nlittle girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall\r\nsurely be able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity\r\nthat doing one's best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I\r\ntook that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with\r\nMrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray\r\nGod Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does,\r\nI am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I\r\ncan advertise again. How far are we on our road now, I wonder?'\r\nI let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us;\r\njudging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable\r\nmagnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could\r\nsee, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the\r\ndistrict; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more\r\npopulous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.\r\nThe roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse\r\nwalk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily\r\nbelieve, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said-\r\n'You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now.'\r\nAgain I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad\r\ntower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a\r\nnarrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or\r\nhamlet. About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair\r\nof gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now\r\nslowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house:\r\ncandlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were\r\ndark. The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a\r\nmaid-servant; I alighted and went in.\r\n'Will you walk this way, ma'am?' said the girl; and I followed\r\nher across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me\r\ninto a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first\r\ndazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes\r\nhad been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and\r\nagreeable picture presented itself to my view.\r\nA snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair\r\nhigh-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable\r\nlittle elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin\r\napron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately\r\nand milder looking. She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat\r\ndemurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the\r\nbeau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a\r\nnew governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to\r\noverwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the\r\nold lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.\r\n'How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride;\r\nJohn drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.'\r\n'Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?' said I.\r\n'Yes, you are right: do sit down.'\r\nShe conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my\r\nshawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself\r\nso much trouble.\r\n'Oh, it is no trouble; I daresay your own hands are almost numbed\r\nwith cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two:\r\nhere are the keys of the storeroom.'\r\nAnd she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of\r\nkeys, and delivered them to the servant.\r\n'Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,' she continued. 'You've\r\nbrought your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?'\r\n'Yes, ma'am.'\r\n'I'll see it carried into your room,' she said, and bustled out.\r\n'She treats me like a visitor,' thought I. 'I little expected\r\nsuch a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is\r\nnot like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must\r\nnot exult too soon.'\r\nShe returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and\r\na book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now\r\nbrought, and then herself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather\r\nconfused at being the object of more attention than I had ever\r\nbefore received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but\r\nas she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out\r\nof her place, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.\r\n'Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?' I\r\nasked, when I had partaken of what she offered me.\r\n'What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,' returned the\r\ngood lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.\r\nI repeated the question more distinctly.\r\n'Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your\r\nfuture pupil.'\r\n'Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?'\r\n'No,- I have no family.'\r\nI should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way\r\nMiss Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not\r\npolite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.\r\n'I am so glad,' she continued, as she sat down opposite to me,\r\nand took the cat on her knee; 'I am so glad you are come; it will be\r\nquite pleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is\r\npleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather\r\nneglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable\r\nplace; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the\r\nbest quarters. I say alone- Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John\r\nand his wife are very decent people; but then you see they are only\r\nservants, and one can't converse with them on terms of equality: one\r\nmust keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one's authority.\r\nI'm sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect,\r\nand when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but\r\nthe butcher and postman came to the house, from November till\r\nFebruary; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after\r\nnight alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don't\r\nthink the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining. In\r\nspring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make\r\nsuch a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this\r\nautumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a\r\nhouse alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.'\r\nMy heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk;\r\nand I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere\r\nwish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.\r\n'But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night,' said she; 'it\r\nis on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all\r\nday: you must feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed,\r\nI'll show you your bedroom. I've had the room next to mine prepared\r\nfor you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it\r\nbetter than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have\r\nfiner furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in\r\nthem myself.'\r\nI thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt\r\nfatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She\r\ntook her candle, and I followed her from the room. First she went to\r\nsee if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock,\r\nshe led the way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the\r\nstaircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery\r\ninto which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a\r\nchurch rather than a house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded\r\nthe stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and\r\nsolitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to\r\nfind it of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.\r\nWhen Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had\r\nfastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced\r\nthe eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious\r\nstaircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my\r\nlittle room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and\r\nmental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of\r\ngratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and\r\noffered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose,\r\nto implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the\r\nkindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned. My\r\ncouch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears. At\r\nonce weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it\r\nwas broad day.\r\nThe chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun\r\nshone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing\r\npapered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and\r\nstained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view. Externals\r\nhave a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of\r\nlife was beginning for me- one that was to have its flowers and\r\npleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by\r\nthe change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all\r\nastir. I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was\r\nsomething pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an\r\nindefinite future period.\r\nI rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain- for I\r\nhad no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity-\r\nI was still by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be\r\ndisregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on\r\nthe contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to\r\nplease as much as my want of beauty would permit. I sometimes\r\nregretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy\r\ncheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall,\r\nstately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I\r\nwas so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked.\r\nAnd why had I these aspirations and these regrets? It would be\r\ndifficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet\r\nI had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. However, when I had\r\nbrushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock- which,\r\nQuakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety-\r\nand adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do\r\nrespectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new\r\npupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy. Having\r\nopened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and\r\nneat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.\r\nTraversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery\r\nsteps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I\r\nlooked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a\r\ngrim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl\r\nnecklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock\r\nwhose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and\r\nrubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then\r\nI was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was\r\nhalf of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine\r\nautumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and\r\nstill green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed\r\nthe front of the mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions\r\nnot vast, though considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a\r\nnobleman's seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.\r\nIts grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery,\r\nwhose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and\r\ngrounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were separated\r\nby a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong,\r\nknotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the\r\nmansion's designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those\r\nround Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from\r\nthe living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming\r\nto embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find\r\nexistent so near the stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet,\r\nwhose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of\r\nthese hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its\r\nold tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.\r\nI was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet\r\nlistening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the\r\nwide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it\r\nwas for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that\r\nlady appeared at the door.\r\n'What! out already?' said she. 'I see you are an early riser.' I\r\nwent up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the\r\nhand.\r\n'How do you like Thornfield?' she asked. I told her I liked it very\r\nmuch.\r\n'Yes,' she said, 'it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be\r\ngetting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his\r\nhead to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it\r\nrather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence\r\nof the proprietor.'\r\n'Mr. Rochester!' I exclaimed. 'Who is he?'\r\n'The owner of Thornfield,' she responded quietly. 'Did you not know\r\nhe was called Rochester?'\r\nOf course I did not- I had never heard of him before; but the old\r\nlady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood\r\nfact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.\r\n'I thought,' I continued, 'Thornfield belonged to you.'\r\n'To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the\r\nhousekeeper- the manager. To be sure I am distantly related to the\r\nRochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was\r\na clergyman, incumbent of Hay- that little village yonder on the hill-\r\nand that church near the gates was his. The present Mr. Rochester's\r\nmother was a Fairfax, second cousin to my husband: but I never presume\r\non the connection- in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself\r\nquite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always\r\ncivil, and I expect nothing more.'\r\n'And the little girl- my pupil!'\r\n'She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a\r\nbelieve. Here she comes, with her \"bonne,\" as she calls her nurse.'\r\nThe enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow\r\nwas no great dame; but a dependant like myself. I did not like her the\r\nworse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.\r\nThe equality between her and me was real; not the mere result of\r\ncondescension on her part: so much the better- my position was all the\r\nfreer.\r\nAs I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by\r\nher attendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did\r\nnot at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven\r\nor eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured\r\nface, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.\r\n'Good morning, Miss Adela,' said Mrs. Fairfax. 'Come and speak to\r\nthe lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some\r\nday.' She approached.\r\n'C'est la ma gouvernante!' said she, pointing to me, and addressing\r\nher nurse; who answered-\r\n'Mais oui, certainement.'\r\n'Are they foreigners?' I inquired, amazed at hearing the French\r\nlanguage.\r\n'The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent;\r\nand, I believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she\r\nfirst came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift\r\nto talk it a little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with\r\nFrench; but you will make out her meaning very well, I daresay.'\r\nFortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a\r\nFrench lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with\r\nMadame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last\r\nseven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily- applying\r\nmyself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as\r\npossible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain\r\ndegree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not\r\nlikely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and\r\nshook hands with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as\r\nI led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her\r\nown tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated\r\nat the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her\r\nlarge hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.\r\n'Ah!' cried she, in French, 'you speak my language as well as Mr.\r\nRochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can\r\nSophie. She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame\r\nFairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over\r\nthe sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked- how it did smoke!-\r\nand I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr.\r\nRochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and\r\nSophie and I had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of\r\nmine; it was like a shelf. And Mademoiselle- what is your name?'\r\n'Eyre- Jane Eyre.'\r\n'Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning,\r\nbefore it was quite daylight, at a great city- a huge city, with\r\nvery dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean\r\ntown I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a\r\nplank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach,\r\nwhich took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and\r\nfiner, called an hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie\r\nused to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called\r\nthe Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond\r\nwith beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.'\r\n'Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?' asked Mrs.\r\nFairfax.\r\nI understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent\r\ntongue of Madame Pierrot.\r\n'I wish,' continued the good lady, 'you would ask her a question or\r\ntwo about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?'\r\n'Adele,' I inquired, 'with whom did you live when you were in\r\nthat pretty clean town you spoke of?'\r\n'I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.\r\nMama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great\r\nmany gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before\r\nthem, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I\r\nlet you hear me sing now?'\r\nShe had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a\r\nspecimen of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came\r\nand placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely\r\nbefore her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the\r\nceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the\r\nstrain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her\r\nlover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in\r\nher brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false\r\none that night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her\r\ndemeanour, how little his desertion has affected her.\r\nThe subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I\r\nsuppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love\r\nand jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste\r\nthat point was: at least I thought so.\r\nAdele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the naivete of\r\nher age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, 'Now,\r\nMademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.'\r\nAssuming an attitude, she began 'La Ligue des Rats: fable de La\r\nFontaine.' She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to\r\npunctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an\r\nappropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and\r\nwhich proved she had been carefully trained.\r\n'Was it your mama who taught you that piece?' I asked.\r\n'Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: \"Qu'avez vous\r\ndonc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!\" She made me lift my hand- so-\r\nto remind me to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance\r\nfor you?'\r\n'No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin,\r\nas you say, with whom did you live then?'\r\n'With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she\r\nis nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine\r\na house as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I\r\nwould like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I\r\nknew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always\r\nkind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not\r\nkept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone\r\nback again himself, and I never see him.'\r\nAfter breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room,\r\nit appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the\r\nschoolroom. Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but\r\nthere was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be\r\nneeded in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light\r\nliterature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, etc. I suppose\r\nhe had considered that these were all the governess would require\r\nfor her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for\r\nthe present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been\r\nable to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of\r\nentertainment and information. In this room, too, there was a\r\ncabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for\r\npainting and a pair of globes.\r\nI found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to\r\napply: she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt\r\nit would be injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I\r\nhad talked to her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and\r\nwhen the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to\r\nher nurse. I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in\r\ndrawing some little sketches for her use.\r\nAs I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs.\r\nFairfax called to me: 'Your morning school-hours are over now, I\r\nsuppose,' said she. She was in a room the folding doors of which stood\r\nopen: I went in when she addressed me. It was a large, stately\r\napartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet,\r\nwalnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in stained glass, and a\r\nlofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of\r\nfine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.\r\n'What a beautiful room!' I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I\r\nhad never before seen any half so imposing.\r\n'Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to\r\nlet in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in\r\napartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels\r\nlike a vault.'\r\nShe pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung\r\nlike it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by\r\ntwo broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse\r\nof a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view\r\nbeyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it\r\na boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid\r\nbrilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of\r\nwhite grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast\r\ncrimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian\r\nmantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between\r\nthe windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and\r\nfire.\r\n'In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!' said I. 'No\r\ndust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would\r\nthink they were inhabited daily.'\r\n'Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare,\r\nthey are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put\r\nhim out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of\r\narrangement on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in\r\nreadiness.'\r\n'Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?'\r\n'Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits,\r\nand he expects to have things managed in conformity to them.'\r\n'Do you like him? Is he generally liked?'\r\n'Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all\r\nthe land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to\r\nthe Rochesters time out of mind.'\r\n'Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like\r\nhim? Is he liked for himself?'\r\n'I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is\r\nconsidered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has\r\nnever lived much amongst them.'\r\n'But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?'\r\n'Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather\r\npeculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great\r\ndeal of the world, I should think. I daresay he is clever, but I never\r\nhad much conversation with him.'\r\n'In what way is he peculiar?'\r\n'I don't know- it is not easy to describe- nothing striking, but\r\nyou feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether\r\nhe is in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you\r\ndon't thoroughly understand him, in short- at least, I don't: but it\r\nis of no consequence, he is a very good master.'\r\nThis was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer\r\nand mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a\r\ncharacter, or observing and describing salient points, either in\r\npersons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class;\r\nmy queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr.\r\nRochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor- nothing more:\r\nshe inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my\r\nwish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.\r\nWhen we left the dining-room she proposed to show me over the\r\nrest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs,\r\nadmiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The\r\nlarge front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the\r\nthird-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their\r\nair of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the lower\r\napartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions\r\nchanged: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement\r\nshowed bed-steads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut,\r\nlooking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs'\r\nheads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,\r\nhigh-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose\r\ncushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced\r\nembroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been\r\ncoffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield\r\nHall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the\r\nhush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by\r\nno means coveted a night's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds:\r\nshut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought\r\nold English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of\r\nstrange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,-\r\nall which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of\r\nmoonlight.\r\n'Do the servants sleep in these rooms?' I asked.\r\n'No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no\r\none ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost\r\nat Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.'\r\n'So I think: you have no ghost, then?'\r\n'None that I ever heard of,' returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.\r\n'Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?'\r\n'I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been\r\nrather a violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though,\r\nthat is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.'\r\n'Yes- \"after life's fitful fever they sleep well,\"' I muttered.\r\n'Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?' for she was moving away.\r\n'On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?' I\r\nfollowed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence\r\nby a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now\r\non a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.\r\nLeaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the\r\ngrounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely\r\ngirdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park,\r\ndotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a\r\npath visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with\r\nfoliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all\r\nreposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon bounded by a\r\npropitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white. No feature in the\r\nscene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I turned from it\r\nand repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the\r\nladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of\r\nblue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of\r\ngrove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre,\r\nand over which I had been gazing with delight.\r\nMrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I,\r\nby dint of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded\r\nto descend the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage\r\nto which this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third\r\nstorey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far\r\nend, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut,\r\nlike a corridor in some Bluebeard's castle.\r\nWhile I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so\r\nstill a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh;\r\ndistinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for\r\nan instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct,\r\nit was very low. It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake\r\nan echo in every lonely chamber; though it originated but in one,\r\nand I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.\r\n'Mrs. Fairfax!' I called out: for I now heard her descending the\r\ngreat stairs. 'Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?'\r\n'Some of the servants, very likely,' she answered: 'perhaps Grace\r\nPoole.'\r\n'Did you hear it?' I again inquired.\r\n'Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.\r\nSometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.'\r\nThe laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in\r\nan odd murmur.\r\n'Grace!' exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.\r\nI really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as\r\ntragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it\r\nwas high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the\r\ncurious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear,\r\nI should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed\r\nme I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.\r\nThe door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,- a woman of\r\nbetween thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and\r\nwith a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less\r\nghostly could scarcely be conceived.\r\n'Too much noise, Grace,' said Mrs. Fairfax. 'Remember\r\ndirections!' Grace curtseyed silently and went in.\r\n'She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her\r\nhousemaid's work,' continued the widow; 'not altogether\r\nunobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough. By the\r\nbye, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?'\r\nThe conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached\r\nthe light and cheerful region below. Adele came running to meet us\r\nin the hall, exclaiming-\r\n'Mesdames, vous etes servies!' adding, 'J'ai bien faim, moi!'\r\nWe found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     CHAPTER XII \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"THE promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to\r\nThornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer\r\nacquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out\r\nto be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of\r\ncompetent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively\r\nchild, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes\r\nwayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no\r\ninjudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for\r\nher improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became\r\nobedient and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits\r\nof character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised\r\nher one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had\r\nshe any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made\r\nreasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps\r\nnot very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle,\r\nand efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of\r\nattachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.\r\nThis, par parenthese, will be thought cool language by persons\r\nwho entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children,\r\nand the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for\r\nthem an idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter\r\nparental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling\r\nthe truth. I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and\r\nprogress, and a quiet liking for her little self: just as I\r\ncherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and\r\na pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had\r\nfor me, and the moderation of her mind and character.\r\nAnybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and\r\nthen, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to\r\nthe gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele\r\nplayed with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom,\r\nI climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and\r\nhaving reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and\r\nhill, and along dim sky-line- that then I longed for a power of vision\r\nwhich might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,\r\ntowns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen- that then I\r\ndesired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of\r\nintercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character,\r\nthan was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax,\r\nand what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other\r\nand more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to\r\nbehold.\r\nWho blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called\r\ndiscontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my\r\nnature; it agitated me to pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to\r\nwalk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards,\r\nsafe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's\r\neye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it- and,\r\ncertainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by\r\nthe exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded\r\nit with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that\r\nwas never ended- a tale my imagination created, and narrated\r\ncontinuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling,\r\nthat I desired and had not in my actual existence.\r\nIt is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with\r\ntranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they\r\ncannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine,\r\nand millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows\r\nhow many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses\r\nof life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm\r\ngenerally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for\r\ntheir faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their\r\nbrothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a\r\nstagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded\r\nin their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to\r\nconfine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to\r\nplaying on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to\r\ncondemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn\r\nmore than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\r\nWhen thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh:\r\nthe same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had\r\nthrilled me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her\r\nlaugh. There were days when she was quite silent; but there were\r\nothers when I could not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I\r\nsaw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a\r\ntray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally\r\n(oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing\r\na pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the\r\ncuriosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she\r\nhad no point to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to\r\ndraw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a\r\nmonosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.\r\nThe other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah\r\nthe housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in\r\nno respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and\r\nsometimes I asked her questions about her native country; but she\r\nwas not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such\r\nvapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than\r\nencourage inquiry.\r\nOctober, November, December passed away. One afternoon in\r\nJanuary, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she\r\nhad a cold; and, as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that\r\nreminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my\r\nown childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing\r\npliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold;\r\nI was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long\r\nmorning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to\r\nbe posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it\r\nto Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter\r\nafternoon walk. Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her little\r\nchair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her best wax\r\ndoll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to\r\nplay with, and a story-book for a change of amusement; and having\r\nreplied to her 'Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.\r\nJeannette,' with a kiss I set out.\r\nThe ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I\r\nwalked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and\r\nanalyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and\r\nsituation. It was three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed\r\nunder the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in its approaching\r\ndimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from\r\nThornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and\r\nblackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral\r\ntreasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its\r\nutter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of air stirred, it\r\nmade no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to\r\nrustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as\r\nthe white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path. Far\r\nand wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now\r\nbrowsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the\r\nhedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.\r\nThis lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the\r\nmiddle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering\r\nmy mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel\r\nthe cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice\r\ncovering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had\r\noverflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could\r\nlook down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the\r\nprincipal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose\r\nagainst the, west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the\r\ntrees, and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.\r\nOn the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a\r\ncloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half\r\nlost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was\r\nyet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly\r\nits thin murmurs of life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in\r\nwhat dales and depths I could not tell: but there were many hills\r\nbeyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes. That\r\nevening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the\r\nsough of the most remote.\r\nA rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once\r\nso far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter,\r\nwhich effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid\r\nmass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and\r\nstrong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill,\r\nsunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.\r\nThe din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of\r\nthe lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the\r\nstile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In\r\nthose days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark\r\ntenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst\r\nother rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them\r\na vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give. As this horse\r\napproached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I\r\nremembered certain of Bessie's tales, wherein figured a\r\nNorth-of-England spirit called a 'Gytrash,' which, in the form of\r\nhorse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came\r\nupon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.\r\nIt was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the\r\ntramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the\r\nhazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made\r\nhim a distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of\r\nBessie's Gytrash- a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head:\r\nit passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with\r\nstrange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.\r\nThe horse followed,- a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man,\r\nthe human being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the\r\nGytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though\r\nthey might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet\r\nshelter in the commonplace human form. No Gytrash was this,- only a\r\ntraveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He passed, and I went\r\non; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of\r\n'What the deuce is to do now?' and a clattering tumble, arrested my\r\nattention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of\r\nice which glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and\r\nseeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan,\r\nbarked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in\r\nproportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate group, and\r\nthen he ran up to me; it was all he could do,- there was no other help\r\nat hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller,\r\nby this time struggling himself free of his steed. His efforts were so\r\nvigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the\r\nquestion-\r\n'Are you injured, sir?'\r\nI think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was\r\npronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me\r\ndirectly.\r\n'Can I do anything?' I asked again.\r\n'You must just stand on one side,' he answered as he rose, first to\r\nhis knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving,\r\nstamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying\r\nwhich removed me effectually some yards' distance; but I would not\r\nbe driven quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate;\r\nthe horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a 'Down,\r\nPilot!' The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if\r\ntrying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for\r\nhe halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.\r\nI was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think,\r\nfor I now drew near him again.\r\n'If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either\r\nfrom Thornfield Hall or from Hay.'\r\n'Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,- only a sprain;'\r\nand again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an\r\ninvoluntary 'Ugh!'\r\nSomething of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing\r\nbright: I could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a\r\nriding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details were not\r\napparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and\r\nconsiderable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with stern features\r\nand a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and\r\nthwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached\r\nmiddle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him,\r\nand but little shyness. Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young\r\ngentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him\r\nagainst his will, and offering my services unasked. I had hardly\r\never seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one. I had a\r\ntheoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,\r\nfascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine\r\nshape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor\r\ncould have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned\r\nthem as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but\r\nantipathetic.\r\nIf even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me\r\nwhen I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily\r\nand with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any\r\nvocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the\r\ntraveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he waved to\r\nme to go, and announced-\r\n'I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this\r\nsolitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.'\r\nHe looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes\r\nin my direction before.\r\n'I should think you ought to be at home yourself,' said he, 'if you\r\nhave a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?'\r\n'From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when\r\nit is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if\r\nyou wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.'\r\n'You live just below- do you mean at that house with the\r\nbattlements?' pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a\r\nhoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods, that,\r\nby contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n'Whose house is it?'\r\n'Mr. Rochester's.'\r\n'Do you know Mr. Rochester?'\r\n'No, I have never seen him.'\r\n'He is not resident, then?'\r\n'No.'\r\n'Can you tell me where he is?'\r\n'I cannot.'\r\n'You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are-' He\r\nstopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple:\r\na black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine\r\nenough for a lady's-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I\r\nhelped him.\r\n'I am the governess.'\r\n'Ah, the governess!' he repeated; 'deuce take me, if I had not\r\nforgotten! The governess!' and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In\r\ntwo minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he\r\ntried to move.\r\n'I cannot commission you to fetch help,' he said; 'but you may help\r\nme a little yourself, if you will be so kind.'\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n'You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?'\r\n'No.'\r\n'Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are\r\nnot afraid?'\r\nI should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when\r\ntold to do it, I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the\r\nstile, and went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the\r\nbridle, but it was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near\r\nits head; I made effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was\r\nmortally afraid of its trampling forefeet. The traveller waited and\r\nwatched for some time, and at last he laughed.\r\n'I see,' he said, 'the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet,\r\nso all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must\r\nbeg of you to come here.'\r\nI came. 'Excuse me,' he continued: 'necessity compels me to make\r\nyou useful.' He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me\r\nwith some stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the\r\nbridle, he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing\r\ngrimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.\r\n'Now,' said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, 'just\r\nhand me my whip; it lies there under the hedge.'\r\nI sought it and found it.\r\n'Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as\r\nfast as you can.'\r\nA touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear,\r\nand then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"            'Like heath that, in the wilderness, \r\n               The wild wind whirls away.' \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and\r\nwas gone for me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no\r\ninterest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a\r\nmonotonous life. My help had been needed and claimed; I had given\r\nit: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though\r\nthe deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an\r\nexistence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture\r\nintroduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all\r\nthe others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and,\r\nsecondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern. I had it still\r\nbefore me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the\r\npost-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.\r\nWhen I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and\r\nlistened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway\r\nagain, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland\r\ndog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard\r\nwillow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the\r\nmoonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among\r\nthe trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in\r\nthe direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught\r\na light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I\r\nhurried on.\r\nI did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to\r\nreturn to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome\r\nstaircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet\r\ntranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and\r\nher only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my\r\nwalk,- to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an\r\nuniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges\r\nof security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What\r\ngood it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the\r\nstorms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by\r\nrough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now\r\nrepined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of\r\nsitting still in a 'too easy chair' to take a long walk: and just as\r\nnatural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be\r\nunder his.\r\nI lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced\r\nbackwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door\r\nwere closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and\r\nspirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house- from the grey hollow filled\r\nwith rayless cells, as it appeared to me- to that sky expanded\r\nbefore me,- a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon\r\nascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left\r\nthe hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below\r\nher, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless\r\ndepth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that\r\nfollowed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when\r\nI viewed them. Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in\r\nthe hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a\r\nside-door, and went in.\r\nThe hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung\r\nbronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the\r\noak staircase. This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room,\r\nwhose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the\r\ngrate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing\r\npurple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant\r\nradiance. It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had\r\nscarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling\r\nof voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adele,\r\nwhen the door closed.\r\nI hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too,\r\nbut no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting\r\nupright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a\r\ngreat black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the\r\nlane. It was so like it that I went forward and said- 'Pilot,' and the\r\nthing got up and came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he\r\nwagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone\r\nwith, and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for\r\nI wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this\r\nvisitant. Leah entered.\r\n'What dog is this?'\r\n'He came with master.'\r\n'With whom?'\r\n'With master- Mr. Rochester- he is just arrived.'\r\n'Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?'\r\n'Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone\r\nfor a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and\r\nhis ankle is sprained.'\r\n'Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?'\r\n'Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.'\r\n'Ah! Bring me a candle, will you, Leah?'\r\nLeah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who\r\nrepeated the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and\r\nwas now with Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders\r\nabout tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"                     CHAPTER XIII \n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"MR. ROCHESTER, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early\r\nthat night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come\r\ndown, it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his\r\ntenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him.\r\nAdele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily\r\nrequisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an\r\napartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for\r\nthe future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that\r\nThornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church,\r\nit echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of\r\nthe bell: steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke\r\nin different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing\r\nthrough it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.\r\nAdele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept\r\nrunning to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could\r\nget a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go\r\ndownstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,\r\nwhere I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry,\r\nand made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her 'ami,\r\nMonsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,' as she dubbed him (I had not\r\nbefore heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had\r\nbrought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that\r\nwhen his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a\r\nlittle box in whose contents she had an interest.\r\n'Et cela doit signifier,' said she, 'qu'il y aura la dedans un\r\ncadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.\r\nMonsieur a parle de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante,\r\net si elle n'etait pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu\r\npale. J'ai dit qu'oui: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?'\r\nI and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the\r\nafternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At\r\ndark I allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run\r\ndownstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the\r\ncessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr.\r\nRochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window;\r\nbut nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together\r\nthickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the\r\ncurtain and went back to the fireside.\r\nIn the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I\r\nremembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine,\r\nwhen Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery\r\nmosaic I had been piecing together, and scattering too some heavy\r\nunwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.\r\n'Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea\r\nwith him in the drawing-room this evening,' said she: 'he has been\r\nso much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.'\r\n'When is his tea-time?' I inquired.\r\n'Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had\r\nbetter change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here\r\nis a candle.'\r\n'Is it necessary to change my frock?'\r\n'Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr.\r\nRochester is here.'\r\nThis additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I\r\nrepaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black\r\nstuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one\r\nI had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the\r\ntoilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate\r\noccasions.\r\n'You want a brooch,' said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl\r\nornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,\r\nand then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was\r\nrather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's\r\npresence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept\r\nin her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch,\r\nwhose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.\r\nTwo wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the\r\nmantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay\r\nPilot- Adele knelt near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr.\r\nRochester, his foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at\r\nAdele and the dog: the fire shone full on his face. I knew my\r\ntraveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made\r\nsquarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his\r\ndecisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full\r\nnostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and\r\njaw- yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake. His shape, now\r\ndivested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with his\r\nphysiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of\r\nthe term- broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor\r\ngraceful.\r\nMr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs.\r\nFairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice\r\nus, for he never lifted his head as we approached.\r\n'Here is Miss Eyre, sir,' said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He\r\nbowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.\r\n'Let Miss Eyre be seated,' said he: and there was something in\r\nthe forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed\r\nfurther to express, 'What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be\r\nthere or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.'\r\nI sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness\r\nwould probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid\r\nit by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice\r\nlaid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence,\r\nunder the freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the\r\neccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see\r\nhow he would go on.\r\nHe went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor\r\nmoved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one\r\nshould be amiable, and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual- and, as\r\nusual, rather trite- she condoled with him on the pressure of business\r\nhe had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to him with\r\nthat painful sprain: then she commended his patience and\r\nperseverance in going through with it.\r\n'Madam, I should like some tea,' was the sole rejoinder she got.\r\nShe hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded\r\nto arrange the cups, spoons, etc., with assiduous celerity. I and\r\nAdele went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.\r\n'Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?' said Mrs. Fairfax to me;\r\n'Adele might perhaps spill it.'\r\nI did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adele,\r\nthinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour,\r\ncried out-\r\n'N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre\r\ndans votre petit coffre?'\r\n'Who talks of cadeaux?' said he gruffly. 'Did you expect a present,\r\nMiss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?' and he searched my face with\r\neyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.\r\n'I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are\r\ngenerally thought pleasant things.'\r\n'Generally thought? But what do you think?'\r\n'I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you\r\nan answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it,\r\nhas it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion\r\nas to its nature.'\r\n'Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands\r\na \"cadeau,\" clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the\r\nbush.'\r\n'Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she\r\ncan prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom;\r\nfor she says you have always been in the habit of giving her\r\nplaythings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since\r\nI am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an\r\nacknowledgment.'\r\n'Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adele, and\r\nfind you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has\r\nno talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.'\r\n'Sir, you have now given me my \"cadeau\"; I am obliged to you: it is\r\nthe meed teachers most covet-praise of their pupils' progress.'\r\n'Humph!' said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.\r\n'Come to the fire,' said the master, when the tray was taken\r\naway, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting;\r\nwhile Adele was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me\r\nthe beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.\r\nWe obeyed, as in duty bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee,\r\nbut she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.\r\n'You have been resident in my house three months?'\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n'And you came from-?'\r\n'Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?'\r\n'Eight years.'\r\n'Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the\r\ntime in such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder\r\nyou have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had\r\ngot that sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I\r\nthought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand\r\nwhether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your\r\nparents?'\r\n'I have none.'\r\n'Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?'\r\n'No.'\r\n'I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you\r\nsat on that stile?'\r\n'For whom, sir?'\r\n'For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for\r\nthem. Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that\r\ndamned ice on the causeway?'\r\nI shook my head. 'The men in green all forsook England a hundred\r\nyears ago,' said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. 'And not\r\neven in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of\r\nthem. I don't think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will\r\never shine on their revels more.'\r\nMrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows,\r\nseemed wondering what sort of talk this was.\r\n'Well,' resumed Mr. Rochester, 'if you disown parents, you must\r\nhave some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?'\r\n'No; none that I ever saw.'\r\n'And your home?'\r\n'I have none.'\r\n'Where do your brothers and sisters live?'\r\n'I have no brothers or sisters.'\r\n'Who recommended you to come here?'\r\n'I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.'\r\n'Yes,' said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon,\r\n'and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.\r\nMiss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and\r\ncareful teacher to Adele.'\r\n'Don't trouble yourself to give her a character,' returned Mr.\r\nRochester: 'eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.\r\nShe began by felling my horse.'\r\n'Sir?' said Mrs. Fairfax.\r\n'I have to thank her for this sprain.'\r\nThe widow looked bewildered.\r\n'Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?'\r\n'No, sir.'\r\n'Have you seen much society?'\r\n'None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of\r\nThornfield.'\r\n'Have you read much?'\r\n'Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous\r\nor very learned.'\r\n'You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in\r\nreligious forms;- Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is\r\na parson, is he not?'\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n'And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of\r\nreligieuses would worship their director.'\r\n'Oh, no.'\r\n'You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! That\r\nsounds blasphemous.'\r\n'I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.\r\nHe is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our\r\nhair; and for economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with\r\nwhich we could hardly sew.'\r\n'That was very false economy,' remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again\r\ncaught the drift of the dialogue.\r\n'And was that the head and front of his offending?' demanded Mr.\r\nRochester.\r\n'He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the\r\nprovision department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored\r\nus with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from\r\nbooks of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which\r\nmade us afraid to go to bed.'\r\n'What age were you when you went to Lowood?'\r\n'About ten.'\r\n'And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?'\r\nI assented.\r\n'Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly\r\nhave been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where\r\nthe features and countenance are so much at variance as in your\r\ncase. And now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?'\r\n'A little.'\r\n'Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library-\r\nI mean, if you please.- (Excuse my tone of command; I am used to\r\nsay, \"Do this,\" and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for\r\none new inmate.)- Go, then, into the library; take a candle with\r\nyou; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.'\r\nI departed, obeying his directions.\r\n'Enough!' he called out in a few minutes. 'You play a little, I\r\nsee; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than\r\nsome, but not well.'\r\nI closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued-\r\n'Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were\r\nyours. I don't know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably\r\na master aided you?'\r\n'No, indeed!' I interjected.\r\n'Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can\r\nvouch for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless\r\nyou are certain: I can recognise patchwork.'\r\n'Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.'\r\nI brought the portfolio from the library.\r\n'Approach the table,' said he; and I wheeled it to his couch. Adele\r\nand Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.\r\n'No crowding,' said Mr. Rochester: 'take the drawings from my\r\nhand as I finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine.'\r\nHe deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he laid\r\naside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.\r\n'Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,' said he, 'and\r\nlook at them with Adele;- you' (glancing at me) 'resume your seat, and\r\nanswer my questions. I perceive those pictures were done by one\r\nhand: was that hand yours?'\r\n'Yes.'\r\n'And when did you find time to do them? They have taken much\r\ntime, and some thought.'\r\n'I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had\r\nno other occupation.'\r\n'Where did you get your copies?'\r\n'Out of my head.'\r\n'That head I see now on your shoulders?'\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n'Has it other furniture of the same kind within?'\r\n'I should think it may have: I should hope- better.'\r\nHe spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them\r\nalternately.\r\nWhile he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are:\r\nand first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The\r\nsubjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the\r\nspiritual eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were\r\nstriking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it\r\nhad wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.\r\nThese pictures were in water-colours. The first represented\r\nclouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was\r\nin eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest\r\nbillows, for there was no land. One gleam of light lifted into\r\nrelief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and\r\nlarge, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set\r\nwith gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette\r\ncould yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.\r\nSinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through\r\nthe green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible,\r\nwhence the bracelet had been washed or torn.\r\nThe second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of\r\na hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.\r\nBeyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight:\r\nrising into the sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in\r\ntints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was\r\ncrowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the\r\nsuffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed\r\nshadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.\r\nOn the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint\r\nlustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this\r\nvision of the Evening Star.\r\nThe third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter\r\nsky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close\r\nserried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the\r\nforeground, a head,- a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg,\r\nand resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and\r\nsupporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a\r\nbrow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed,\r\nblank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were\r\nvisible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black\r\ndrapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a\r\nring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.\r\nThis pale crescent was 'the likeness of a kingly crown'; what it\r\ndiademed was 'the shape which shape had none.'\r\n'Were you happy when you painted these pictures?' asked Mr.\r\nRochester presently.\r\n'I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in\r\nshort, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.'\r\n'That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have\r\nbeen few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's\r\ndreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you\r\nsit at them long each day?'\r\n'I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat\r\nat them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length\r\nof the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.'\r\n'And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent\r\nlabours?'\r\n'Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and\r\nmy handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was\r\nquite powerless to realise.'\r\n'Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no\r\nmore, probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science\r\nto give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl,\r\npeculiar. As to the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the\r\nEvening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them\r\nlook so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above\r\nquells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And\r\nwho taught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on\r\nthis hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There!\r\nput the drawings away!'\r\nI had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at\r\nhis watch, he said abruptly-\r\n'It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele\r\nsit up so long? Take her to bed!'\r\nAdele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the\r\ncaress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have\r\ndone, nor so much.\r\n'I wish you all good-night, now,' said he, making a movement of the\r\nhand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company,\r\nand wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I\r\ntook my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in\r\nreturn, and so withdrew.\r\n'You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,'\r\nI observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to\r\nbed.\r\n'Well, is he?'\r\n'I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.'\r\n'True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so\r\naccustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has\r\npeculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.'\r\n'Why?'\r\n'Partly because it is his nature- and we can none of us help our\r\nnature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to\r\nharass him, and make his spirits unequal.'\r\n'What about?'\r\n'Family troubles, for one thing.'\r\n'But he has no family.'\r\n'Not now, but he has had- or, at least, relatives. He lost his\r\nelder brother a few years since.'\r\n'His elder brother?'\r\n'Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in\r\npossession of the property; only about nine years.'\r\n'Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother\r\nas to be still inconsolable for his loss?'\r\n'Why, no- perhaps not. I believe there were some\r\nmisunderstandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite\r\njust to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against\r\nhim. The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the\r\nfamily estate together. He did not like to diminish the property by\r\ndivision, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth,\r\ntoo, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of\r\nage, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a\r\ngreat deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined\r\nto bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for\r\nthe sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that\r\nposition was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what\r\nhe had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke with his\r\nfamily, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life. I\r\ndon't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight\r\ntogether, since the death of his brother without a will left him\r\nmaster of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.'\r\n'Why should he shun it?'\r\n'Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.'\r\nThe answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer;\r\nbut Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit\r\ninformation of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials. She\r\naverred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was\r\nchiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to\r\ndrop the subject, which I did accordingly."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.hr,{})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>s,x:()=>i});var r=t(96540);const a={},o=r.createContext(a);function s(e){const n=r.useContext(o);return r.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function i(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:s(e.components),r.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
