And now Jane Hastings was at home again.  At home in the unchanged house--spacious, old-fashioned--looking down from its steeply sloping lawns and terraced gardens upon the sooty, smoky activities of Remsen City, looking out upon a charming panorama of hills and valleys in the heart of South Central Indiana.  Six years of striving in the East and abroad to satisfy the restless energy she inherited from her father; and here she was, as restless as ever--yet with everything done that a woman could do in the way of an active career.  She looked back upon her years of elaborate preparation; she looked forward upon--nothing.  That is, nothing but marriage--dropping her name, dropping her personality, disappearing in the personality of another.  She had never seen a man for whom she would make such a sacrifice; she did not believe that such a man existed."}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["She meditated bitterly upon that cruel arrangement of Nature's whereby the father transmits his vigorous qualities in twofold measure to the daughter, not in order that she may be a somebody, but solely in order that she may transmit them to sons.

She gazed down at Remsen City, connected by factories and pierced from east, west and south by railways.  She gazed out over the fields and woods.  Yes, there must be something for her besides merely marrying and breeding--just as much for her as for a man.  But what?  If she should marry a man who would let her rule him, she would despise him.  If she should marry a man she could respect--a man who was of the master class like her father--how she would hate him for ignoring her and putting her in her ordained inferior feminine place.  She glanced down at her skirts with an angry sense of enforced masquerade.

Instantly--and long before he saw her--there was a grotesque whisking out of sight of the serious personality upon which we have been intruding.  In its stead there stood ready to receive the young man a woman of the type that possesses physical charm and knows how to use it--and does not scruple to use it.  For a woman to conquer man by physical charm is far and away the easiest, the most fleeting and the emptiest of victories.  But for woman thus to conquer without herself yielding anything whatsoever, even so little as an alluring glance of the eye--that is quite another matter.  It was this sort of conquest that Jane Hastings delighted in--and sought to gain with any man who came within range.  If the men had known what she was about, they would have denounced her conduct as contemptible and herself as immoral, even brazen.  But in their innocence they accused only their sophisticated and superbly masculine selves and regarded her as the soul of innocence.  This was the more absurd in them because she obviously excelled in the feminine art of inviting display of charm.  To glance at her was to realize at once the beauty of her figure, the exceeding grace of her long back and waist.  A keen observer would have seen the mockery lurking in her light-brown eyes, and about the corners of her full red lips."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"She arranged her thick dark hair to make a secret, half- revealed charm of her fascinating pink ears and to reveal in dazzling unexpectedness the soft, round whiteness of the nape of her neck."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Because you are thus let into Miss Hastings' naughty secret, so well veiled behind an air of earnest and almost cold dignity, you must not do her the injustice of thinking her unusually artful.

He retained ownership of the doggery, but took his name down and put up that of his barkeeper.

Finally, it had Victor Dorn.  He had no mean opinion of his value to the movement; but he far and most modestly underestimated it.  The human way of rallying to an abstract principle is by way of a standard bearer--a man-- personality--a real or fancied incarnation of the ideal to be struggled for.

Only in our own time has science begun to make a notable impression upon the fog which formerly lay over the whole human mind, thicker here, thinner there, a mere haze yonder, but present everywhere.

Even those who seem to live at haphazard, like the multitude, prove to have chart and compass and definite port in objective when their conduct is more attentively examined.  Victor Dorn's system was as perfect as it was simple, and he held himself to it as rigidly as the father superior of a Trappist monastery holds his monks to their routine.  Also, Victor had learned to know and to be on guard against those two arch-enemies of the man who wishes to ``get somewhere''--self-excuse and optimism.  He had got a good strong leash upon his vanity --and a muzzle, too.  When things went wrong he instantly blamed HIMSELF, and did not rest until he had ferreted out the stupidity or folly of which HE had been guilty.  He did not grieve over his failures; he held severely scientific post mortems upon them to discover the reason why--in order that there should not again be that particular kind of failure at least.  Then, as to the other arch-enemy, optimism, he simply cut himself off from indulgence in it.  He worked for success; he assumed failure.

It is possible for even the humblest of us to understand genius, just as it is possible to view a mountain from all sides and get a clear idea of it bulk and its dominion.  But the hasty traveler contents himself with a glance, a ``How superb,'' and a quick passing on; and most of us are hasty travelers in the scenic land of intellectuality.

Thus, all that youth and inexperience can know about love is its aspect of passion.

With the aid of her love and council, and of her father's money and influence, he--he and she--would mount to something really worth while--something more than the petty politics of a third rate city in the West.

Only a villainous nature can harbor such a wish, can admit it except as a hastily and slyly in-crawling impulse, to be flung out the instant it is discovered.  It is another matter to calculate--very secretly, very unconsciously--upon a death that seems inevitable anyhow.  Jane had only to look at her father to feel that he would not be spared to her long.  The mystery was how he had kept alive so long, how he continued to live from day to day.  His stomach was gone; his whole digestive apparatus was in utter disorder.
