But no sooner had he lain himself down than his eyes grew heavy, and when the sunbeams roused him from his slumbers there was not an apple left on the tree."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Next came the turn of the youngest son, who made himself a comfortable bed under the apple tree, and prepared himself to sleep.  Towards midnight he awoke, and sat up to look at the tree.  And behold!  the apples were beginning to ripen, and lit up the whole palace with their brightness.  At the same moment nine golden pea-hens flew swiftly through the air, and while eight alighted upon the boughs laden with fruit, the ninth fluttered to the ground where the prince lay, and instantly was changed into a beautiful maiden, more beautiful far than any lady in the emperor's court.  The prince at once fell in love with her, and they talked together for some time, till the maiden said her sisters had finished plucking the apples, and now they must all go home again.  The prince, however, begged her so hard to leave him a little of the fruit that the maiden gave him two apples, one for himself and one for his father.  Then she changed herself back into a pea-hen, and the whole nine flew away."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As soon as the sun rose the prince entered the palace, and held out the apple to his father, who was rejoiced to see it, and praised his youngest son heartily for his cleverness.  That evening the prince returned to the apple tree, and everything passed as before, and so it happened for several nights.  At length the other brothers grew angry at seeing that he never came back without bringing two golden apples with him, and they went to consult an old witch, who promised to spy after him, and discover how he managed to get the apples.  So, when the evening came, the old woman hid herself under the tree and waited for the prince.  Before long he arrived and laid down on his bed, and was soon fast asleep.  Towards midnight there was a rush of wings, and the eight pea-hens settled on the tree, while the ninth became a maiden, and ran to greet the prince.  Then the witch stretched out her hand, and cut off a lock of the maiden's hair, and in an instant the girl sprang up, a pea-hen once more, spread her wings and flew away, while her sisters, who were busily stripping the boughs, flew after her."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When he had recovered from his surprise at the unexpected disappearance of the maiden, the prince exclaimed, 'What can be the matter?' and, looking about him, discovered the old witch hidden under the bed.  He dragged her out, and in his fury called his guards, and ordered them to put her to death as fast as possible.  But that did no good as far as the pea-hens went.  They never came back any more, though the prince returned to the tree every night, and wept his heart out for his lost love.  This went on for some time, till the prince could bear it no longer, and made up his mind he would search the world through for her.  In vain his father tried to persuade him that his task was hopeless, and that other girls were to be found as beautiful as this one.  The prince would listen to nothing, and, accompanied by only one servant, set out on his quest."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After travelling for many days, he arrived at length before a large gate, and through the bars he could see the streets of a town, and even the palace.  The prince tried to pass in, but the way was barred by the keeper of the gate, who wanted to know who he was, why he was there, and how he had learnt the way, and he was not allowed to enter unless the empress herself came and gave him leave.  A message was sent to her, and when she stood at the gate the prince thought he had lost his wits, for there was the maiden he had left his home to seek.  And she hastened to him, and took his hand, and drew him into the palace.  In a few days they were married, and the prince forgot his father and his brothers, and made up his mind that he would live and die in the castle."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"One morning the empress told him that she was going to take a walk by herself, and that she would leave the keys of twelve cellars to his care.

Some servants who saw what had happened came rushing to the prince, and the poor young man went nearly mad when he heard the result of his own folly, and could only cry out that he would follow the dragon to the ends of the earth, until he got his wife again."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"For months and months he wandered about, first in this direction and then in that, without finding any traces of the dragon or his captive.

He is twin brother to my own horse, and can fly as high as the clouds themselves.  But no one can ever get this horse without first serving the old woman for three whole days.
