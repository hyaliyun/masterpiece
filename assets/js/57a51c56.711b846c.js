Models of the interior\r\nlife, to you is dedicated this new edition of a work of one of your devoted\r\nservants, which is well calculated to lead many souls up the path of\r\nperfection till they reign with you in the Kingdom of Heaven.\r\nThe LITTLE BOOK OF ETERNAL WISDOM is among the best of the writings of\r\nBlessed Henry Suso, a priest of the Order of St. Dominic, who lived a life\r\nof wonderful labours and sufferings, and died in the Fourteenth century with\r\na reputation for sanctity which the Church has solemnly confirmed. Gregory\r\nXVI granted to the whole Order of St. Dominic the privilege of celebrating\r\nhis office, and of offering the Mass yearly in his honour, appointing the\r\nSecond of March for his festival.\r\nThe Order of St. Dominic, known in the Church both as the Order of\r\nTruth and the Order of Preachers, so rich in pontiffs, martyrs, and\r\nconfessors, is also illustrious for its theologians, its ascetic writers,\r\nits great masters of the Spiritual life. Its mystic theologians stand in the\r\nfirst rank of those who have sealed the wondrous heights of sublime\r\nperfection. Not only have they stood on the mountain tops of the spiritual\r\nlife, but they have pointed out, with a clearness surpassed by no other\r\nwriters, the path of ascent, marking for the unwary its every danger. The\r\nwiles of the enemy are exposed; where, when, and how he seeks to accomplish\r\nour ruin. Our defence is first outlined, and then given in detail. The\r\nsource of strength is pointed out, and thus the perilous journey may safely\r\nbe made.\r\nAmong the ascetic writers of the Order, mention may be made of St.\r\nThomas Aquinas, Blessed Albert the Great, Master Humbert, St. Antoninus, Dom\r\nBartholomew of the Martyrs, Ven. Louis of Granada, St. Vincent Ferrer, St.\r\nCatherine of Sienna, and St. Catherine of Ricci, whilst the Illuminated\r\nDoctor John Tauler and Blessed Henry Suso are among the first of the great\r\nmystic theologians of the Church.\r\nTHE LITTLE BOOK OF ETERNAL WISDOM was translated and published for the\r\nCatholics of England years ago, but has long been out of print. It would be\r\ndifficult to speak too highly of this little book or of its author. In\r\nsoundness of teaching, sublimity of thought, clearness of expression, and\r\nbeauty of illustration, we do not know of a spiritual writer that surpasses\r\nHenry Suso. He clothes virtue in such lovely garments, the path to the\r\nsublime heights of perfection is so clearly marked out, that the willing\r\nsoul is allured onward and assisted upward, till she stands with her blessed\r\nguide in the full light of the Eternal Wisdom.\r\nTo this preface it was deemed advisable to add the celebrated "Parable\r\nof the Pilgrim," taken from the writings of Walter Hilton, a Carthusian\r\nmonk, and afterwards abridged by the venerable contemplative Father Baker,\r\nof the Order of St. Benedict.\r\nThe devout reader is earnestly requested to read this parable again and\r\nagain before commencing the study of Suso\'s golden book of Eternal Wisdom.\r\nThis parable outlines the whole plan of the spiritual life, it conveys most\r\nuseful instructions for those who seriously aim at perfection, which Hilton\r\ndesignates as the Vision of Peace given to the Soul in Jerusalem. This\r\nparable will be understood and appreciated by those only who are hungering\r\nafter Justice. They should read it frequently, and fervently pray for grace\r\nto become true pilgrims and pursue the path here clearly marked out, that so\r\nthey may arrive at the glorious end.\r\nC. H.

The other said, "The journey there is\r\nlong and full of difficulties. There are several roads that appear and\r\npromise to lead there, but their dangers are too great. However, I know one\r\nway which, if you will faithfully follow according to the mark\'s and\r\ndirections that I shall give you, will certainly lead you there. I cannot,\r\nhowever, promise you security from many frights, beatings, and other\r\nill-usages and temptations of all kinds, yet if you only have courage and\r\npatience enough to suffer them without quarreling, or resisting, or\r\ntroubling yourself about them, but pass on quietly, having this only in your\r\nmind, and sometimes on you tongue, `I have naught, I am naught, I desire\r\nnaught but to be in Jerusalem,\' my life for yours, in due time you will get\r\nthere in safety."\r\nThe pilgrim, full of joy at the news said, "If only I arrive at length\r\nin safety at the place I desire so much, I care not what miseries I suffer\r\non the way; therefore, only let me know the course I am to take, and, God\r\nwilling, I shall not fail carefully to observe all your directions."--"Since\r\nyou have so good a will," said the guide, "though I myself was never so\r\nhappy as to be in Jerusalem, yet be assured that if you follow the\r\ninstructions I shall give, you will arrive safe at the end of your journey."\r\nThe advice is briefly this: Before taking the first step on the highway\r\nthat leads there you must be firmly grounded in the truths of the Catholic\r\nfaith. Moreover, whatever sins you find sullying your conscience you must\r\ncleanse by hearty penance and absolution according to the laws of the\r\nChurch. Having done so begin your journey in God\'s name; but be sure to have\r\nwith you two necessary instruments, Humility and Charity. These are\r\ncontained in the words above mentioned, which must always be present to your\r\nmind, "I am naught, I have naught, I desire only one thing and that is our\r\nLord Jesus, and to be with Him at peace in Jerusalem." The meaning and power\r\nof these words you must have continually, at least in your thoughts either\r\nexpressly or virtually. Humility says, "I am nothing, I have nothing."\r\nCharity says, "I desire nothing but Jesus." You must never lose these two\r\ncompanions, neither will they consent to be separated from each other, for\r\nthey agree lovingly together, and the deeper you establish yourself in\r\nhumility the higher you will advance in charity, for the more you see and\r\nfeel yourself to be nothing the more ardently you will see and love Jesus,\r\nthat by Him who is All you may become something.\r\nThis humility is to be exercised not so much in considering your own\r\nvileness and sinfulness, though in the beginning this consideration is good\r\nand beneficial, but rather in a quiet consideration of the infinite being\r\nand goodness of Jesus. You are to behold Him either through grace in\r\nsensible devotional knowledge of Him, or, at least, in a full and firm faith\r\nin Him. And such a contemplation of the infinite sanctity and goodness of\r\nJesus will operate in your mind a much more pure, spiritual, solid and\r\nperfect humility, than the reflecting on your own nothingness, which\r\nproduces a humility much more gross, boisterous and imperfect. In this\r\nmirror of sanctity you will behold yourself to be not only the most\r\nwretched, filthy creature in the world, but also, in the very substance of\r\nyour soul, setting aside the foulness of sin, to be a mere nothing; for\r\nreally, in comparison with Jesus who is All, you are nothing. And until you\r\nhave and feel that you have the love of Jesus, although you think you have\r\ndone ever so many good deeds, spiritually and worldly, you have nothing, for\r\nnothing but the love of Jesus will abide in and fill your soul. Therefore\r\ncast aside and forget all other things in order that you may have that which\r\nis the best of all. If you do this you will become a true pilgrim, who\r\nleaves behind him house, wife, children, friends, and goods, and denies\r\nhimself all things in order that he may go on his journey lightly and\r\nwithout hindrance.\r\nIf your desire for Jesus still continues and grows stronger, so that\r\nyou go on your way courageously, they will then tell you that you may become\r\nill, and perhaps with such a disease as will bring frightful dreads into\r\nyour mind; or perhaps you will become very poor and you will find no\r\ncharitable person to help you. Do not heed what they say, but if you should\r\nhappen to fall into sickness or poverty, still have faith in Jesus and say,\r\n"I am naught, I have naught, I care for naught in this world, and I desire\r\nnaught but the love of Jesus, that I may see Him at peace in Jerusalem."\r\nIf it should ever happen that through some of these temptations and\r\nyour own weakness, you waver and perhaps fall into sin, and thus lose the\r\nway for a time, return as soon as possible to the right path by using such\r\nremedies as the Church ordains. Do not think of your past sins, for that\r\nwill harm you and favour your enemies; but make haste to go on your way as\r\nif nothing happened. Think only of Jesus, and of your desire to gain His\r\nlove, and nothing will harm you.\r\nFinally, when your enemies see that you are so determined that neither\r\nsickness, fancies, poverty, life, death, nor sins discourage you, but that\r\nyou will continue to seek the love of Jesus and nothing else, by continuing\r\nyour prayer and other spiritual works, they will grow enraged and will not\r\nspare you the most cruel abuse. They will make their most dangerous assault\r\nby bringing before you all your good deeds and virtues, showing that all men\r\npraise, love, and honour you for your sanctity. This they will do to make\r\nyou vain and proud. But if you offer your life to Jesus you will consider\r\nall this flattery and falsehood as deadly poison to your soul, and will cast\r\nit from you.\r\nIn order to shun such temptations renounce all vain thoughts and think\r\nof Jesus only, resolving to know and love Him. After you have accustomed\r\nyourself to think of Him alone, any thoughts not relating to Him will be\r\nunwelcome and painful to you.\r\nIf there is any work you are obliged to do for yourself or neighbour\r\nfail not to do it as soon and as well as you can, lest by delay it may\r\ndistract your thoughts from Jesus. If it is unnecessary work do not think\r\nabout it, but dismiss it from your thoughts saying, "I am naught, I can do\r\nnaught, I have naught, and I desire naught but Jesus and His love."\r\nIt will be necessary for you, as for all other pilgrims, to take, on\r\nthe way, sleep and refreshments and sometimes innocent recreation; but if\r\nyou use discretion in these things, although they seem to delay you, they\r\nwill give you strength and courage to continue on your journey.\r\nTo conclude, remember that your principal aim, and indeed only\r\nbusiness, is to give your thoughts to the desire of Jesus, and to strengthen\r\nthis desire by daily prayer and other spiritual works. And whatever you find\r\nsuitable to increase that desire, be it praying or reading, speaking or\r\nbeing silent, working or resting, make use of it as long as your soul finds\r\ndelight in it, and as long as it increases the desire of having and enjoying\r\nnothing but the love of Jesus and the blessed sight of Jesus in true peace\r\nin Jerusalem. Be assured that this good desire, thus cherished and\r\ncontinually increased, will bring you safely to the end of your pilgrimage.\r\nObserving these instructions, you are in the right path to Jerusalem.\r\nTo proceed on this journey, it is necessary to do, inwardly and outwardly,\r\nsuch works as are suitable to your condition, and such as will help to\r\nincrease in you the gracious desire that you have to love Jesus only. No\r\nmatter what your works are, whether thinking, reading, preaching, labouring,\r\netc., if you find that they draw your mind from worldly vanity and\r\nstrengthen your heart and will more to the love of Jesus, it is good and\r\nprofitable for you to pursue them. But if through custom, you find such\r\nworks in time lose their power and virtue to increase this love, cast them\r\naside and try some other works which you think will gain for you more grace\r\nand sanctity; for, although the inclination and desire of your heart for\r\nJesus should never change, nevertheless the spiritual works you practice,\r\nsuch as prayer, reading, etc., in order to feed and strengthen this desire,\r\nmay well be changed, according as you feel your spiritual welfare will be\r\nbenefited by this change. Therefore, lest you hinder the freedom of your\r\nheart to love Jesus, do not think that because you have accustomed yourself\r\nto a certain form of devotion, that you cannot change it for the better.\r\nBefore you have journeyed far, you must expect enemies of all kinds,\r\nwho will surround you and busily endeavour to hinder you from going forward.\r\nIndeed, if they can by any means, they will, wither by persuasions,\r\nflatteries, or violence, force you to return to your former habits of\r\nsinfulness. For there is nothing annoys them so much as to see a resolute\r\ndesire to love Jesus and to labour to find him. Consequently, they will\r\nconspire to drive out of your heart that good desire and love in which all\r\nvirtues are comprised. The first enemies that will assault you will be the\r\ndesires of the flesh, and vain fears of your corrupt heart. Joined with\r\nthese will be unclean spirits, which, with sights and temptations, will seek\r\nto entice you to them, and draw you from Jesus. But do not believe anything\r\nthey say, but betake yourself to your old and only secure remedy,\r\nanswering--"I am naught, I have naught, and I desire naught but only the\r\nlove of Jesus."\r\nIf they endeavour to put dreads and doubts into your mind, and try to\r\nmake you believe you have not done necessary penance to atone for your sins,\r\ndo not believe them. Neither believe them if they say you have not\r\nsufficiently confessed your sins, and that you should return home to do\r\npenance better, before you have the boldness to go to Jesus. You are\r\nsufficiently acquitted of your sins, and there is no need at all that you\r\nshould delay in order to ransack your conscience, for this will now but harm\r\nyou, and either put you entirely out of your way, or at least unprofitably\r\ndelay your toil.\r\nIf they tell you that you are not worthy to have the love of Jesus, or\r\nto see Jesus, and that on that account you ought not to be so presumptuous\r\nas to desire and seek it, do not believe them, but go on, saying, "It is not\r\nbecause I am worthy, but because I am unworthy, that I desire to have the\r\nlove of Jesus; for, once having that, I should become worthy. Therefore, I\r\nwill never cease desiring it until I have obtained it. I was created for\r\nthis love alone, and so, say and do what you will, I will desire it\r\ncontinually, and never cease to pray for it, and thus endeavour to obtain\r\nit."\r\nIf you meet with any who seem to be your friends, and who in kindness\r\nwould hinder your progress by entertaining you and seeking to draw you to\r\nsensual mirth by vain discourses and carnal pleasures, whereby you will be\r\nin danger of forgetting your pilgrimage, turn a deaf ear to them, answer\r\nthem not; think only of this, that you would fain be at Jerusalem. If they\r\noffer you gifts and attractions, heed them not, but think ever of Jerusalem.\r\nIf men despise you, lay false charges against you, defraud and rob you,\r\nor even beat and use you cruelly, for your life take no notice of them, but\r\nmeekly content yourself with the injury received, and proceed as if nothing\r\nhad happened to hinder you. This punishment, or even more, is as nothing if\r\nyou can only arrive at Jerusalem, where you shall be recompensed for all you\r\nhave endured.\r\nIf your enemies see that you grow courageous, and that you will neither\r\nbe seduced by flatteries nor disheartened by the pains and trials of your\r\njourney, but rather are contented with them, they will then be afraid of\r\nyou. Notwithstanding all this, they will still pursue you on your way and\r\nseek every advantage against you, now and then endeavouring, either by\r\nflatteries or alarms, to stop and drive you back. Fear them not, but\r\ncontinue on your way thinking of nothing but Jerusalem and Jesus, whom you\r\nwill find there.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                          TRANSLATORS NOTE\r\n\r\n                       -----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n This edition of Blessed Henry Suso's Little Book of Eternal Wisdom is\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"translated from the classical German text of Cardinal Melchior Diepenbrock,\r\nPrince-Bishop of Breslau.\r\nThat it is a very imperfect reproduction of the incomparable original,\r\nI am fully aware, but there are authors whose beauties of idiom are such as\r\nto be untranslatable, and Suso is one of them.\r\nIt is superfluous to enlarge here on the intrinsic merits of Blessed\r\nHenry Suso's work.

And, as he thus stood with his\r\ncomplaint, his interior senses were rapt to an unusual exaltation, in which\r\nhe was very speedily and clearly enlightened as follows: Thou shalt make a\r\nhundred venias,[1] and each venia with a special meditation of My passion,\r\nand each meditation with a request. And every one of My sufferings shall be\r\nspiritually impressed on thee, to suffer the same again through Me as far as\r\nthou art able.\r\nAnd as he thus stood in the light, and would needs count the venias, he\r\nonly found ninety, upon which he spoke to God thus: Sweet Lord, Thou didst\r\nspeak of a hundred venias, and I find only ninety. Then he was reminded of\r\nten others which he had already made in the Chapter House, before\r\nsolemnizing, according to his custom, the devout meditation of the miserable\r\nleading forth of Christ to death, and coming before that very crucifix; and\r\nso he found that the hundred meditations had entirely included from\r\nbeginning to end His bitter Passion and death. And when he began to exercise\r\nhimself in this matter, as he had been directed, his former dryness was\r\nchanged into an interior sweetness.\r\nAccordingly, he gained many a bright inspiration of divine truth,\r\nwhereof these meditations were a cause, and between him and the Eternal\r\nWisdom there sprang up a tender intercourse, and this took place not by a\r\nbodily intercourse nor by figurative answers; it took place solely by\r\nmeditation in the light of Holy Writ whose answers can deceive in nothing;\r\nso that the answers are taken either from the mouth of the Eternal Wisdom\r\nwho uttered them herself in the Gospel, or else from the highest doctors,\r\nand they comprise either the same words or the same sense, or else such\r\ntruths as are agreeable to Holy Writ, out of whose mouth the Eternal Wisdom\r\nspoke. Nor did the visions which hereafter follow take place in a bodily\r\nway; they are but an interpreted similitude.\r\nThe answer touching our Blessed Lady's complaint he has given in the\r\nsense of St. Bernard's words; and the reason why he propounds his doctrine\r\nby question and answer is that it may prove the more attractive; that it may\r\nnot seem as though he were the person to whom the doctrine belonged, or who\r\nhad spoken it as coming from himself. His object is to give a general\r\ndoctrine, in which he and all persons may find every one what is suitable\r\nfor himself. He takes upon himself, as a teacher ought to do, the person of\r\nall mankind: now he speaks in the person of a sinner; now under the image of\r\na love-sick soul; then, as the matter suggests, in the likeness of a servant\r\nwith whom the Eternal Wisdom discourses. Moreover, everything is expounded\r\nwith reference to our interior; much is given here as doctrine that a\r\nzealous man should choose out for himself as devout prayer. The thoughts\r\nwhich stand here are simple, the words simpler still, for they proceed from\r\na simple soul and are meant for simple men who have still their\r\nimperfections to cast aside.\r\nIt happened that, as the same brother had begun to write on the three\r\nmatters, namely, the Passion, and the rest of it all, and had come to that\r\npart on repentance: Now then, cheer up thou soul of mine! etc., he had\r\nreclined himself one forenoon on his chair, and that in a bright sleep he\r\nsaw clearly, in a vision, how two culpable persons sat before him, and how\r\nhe chastised them very severely for sitting there so idly, and performing\r\nnothing. Then was it given him to understand that he should thread a needle,\r\nwhich was put into his hand. Now the thread was threefold; and two parts\r\nwere very fine, but the other part was a little courser, and when he would\r\nneeds twist the three together he could not well do it. Then he saw close to\r\nhim on his right hand our Lord, standing the same as when He was unbound\r\nfrom the pillar, and He stood before him with a look so kind and fatherly\r\nthat he thought it was indeed his father. Now he perceived that His body had\r\nquite a natural colour; it was not very white, but of the colour of wheat,\r\nthat is, white and red well mixed together (and this is the most natural\r\ncolour of all), and he perceived that His whole body was covered with\r\nwounds, and that they were quite fresh and bloody, that some were round,\r\nsome angular, some very long, just as the whips had torn Him; and as He thus\r\nstood sweetly before him, and kindly looked at him, the preacher raised his\r\nhands and rubbed them to and fro on His bloody wounds, and then took the\r\nthree parts of the thread and twisted them easily together. Then was given\r\nto him a power, and he understood that he was to complete his task, and that\r\nGod with His rose-coloured garment (which is wrought so delightfully out of\r\nHis wounds) would clothe all those in eternal beauty who should occupy their\r\ntime and leisure with it here below.\r\nOne thing, however, a man should know, that there is as great a\r\ndifference between hearing himself the sweet accords of a harp and hearing\r\nanother speak of them, as there is between the words received in pure grace\r\nand that flow out of a living heart, through a living mouth, and those same\r\nwords when they come to be set down on dead parchment, especially in the\r\nGerman tongue; for then are they chilled, and they wither like plucked\r\nroses: for the sprightliness of their delivery, which, more than anything,\r\nmoves the heart of man, is then extinguished, and in the dryness of dry\r\nhearts are they received. Never was there a string how sweet soever, but it\r\nbecame dumb when stretched on a dry log. A joyless heart can as little\r\nunderstand a joyful tongue as a German can an Englishman! Therefore let\r\nevery fervent soul hasten after the first out-pourings of this sweet\r\ndoctrine, so that she may learn to contemplate them in their origin, where\r\nthey were in all their loveliness and ravishing beauty; even there are the\r\nin-pourings of the present grace, to the quickening of hearts that are dead!\r\nAnd he who thus looks at this book will hardly have read it through before\r\nhis heart will needs be deeply moved either to fervent love, or to new\r\nlight, or to a yearning towards God, and abhorrence of sin, or else to some\r\nspiritual request, wherein the soul will presently be renewed in grace.\r\nHere ends the Preface, and follows"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                    LITTLE BOOK OF ETERNAL WISDOM\r\n\r\n                           PART THE FIRST\r\n\r\n                       -----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER I.

These\r\nwords stand written in the Book of Wisdom[2] and are spoken by the beautiful\r\nand all-loving Wisdom.\r\nA Servant was filled with disgust and dejection of heart on his first\r\nsetting forth on the uneven ways. Then did the Eternal Wisdom meet him in a\r\nspiritual and ineffable form, and lead him through bitter and sweet until\r\nshe brought him to the right path of divine truth. And after well reflecting\r\non his wonderful progress, he thus spoke to God; Sweet and tender Lord! from\r\nthe days of my childhood my mind has sought for something with burning\r\nthirst, but what it is I have not as yet fully understood. Lord, I have\r\npursued it ardently many a year, but I never could grasp it, for I know not\r\nwhat it is, and yet it is something that attracts my heart and soul, without\r\nwhich I never can attain true rest. Lord, I sought it in the first days of\r\nmy childhood, as I saw done around me, in creatures, but the more I sought\r\nit in them the less I found it, and the nearer I approached them the further\r\nI receded from it, for every image that presented itself to my sight, before\r\nI wholly tried it, or gave myself up quietly to it, warned me away thus: "I\r\nam not what thou seekest!" And this repulsion I have experienced more and\r\nmore in all things. Lord, now my heart rages after it, for my heart would so\r\ngladly possess it. Alas! I have so constantly had to experience what it is\r\nnot! But what it is, Lord, I am not as yet clear. Tell me, beloved Lord,\r\nwhat it is indeed, and what is its nature, that so secretly agitates me.\r\nAnswer of Eternal Wisdom.--Dost thou not know it? And yet it has\r\nlovingly embraced thee, has often stopped thee in the way, until it has at\r\nlength won thee for itself alone.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, I never saw it; never heard of it: I know not what\r\nit is.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--This is not surprising, for its strangeness and thy\r\nfamiliarity with creatures were the cause. But now open thy interior eyes\r\nand see who I am. It is I, the Eternal Wisdom, who, with the embrace of My\r\neternal providence, have chosen thee in eternity for Myself alone. I have\r\nbarred the way to thee as often as thou wouldst have parted company with Me,\r\nhad I permitted thee. In all things thou didst ever meet with some obstacle\r\nand it is the sweet sign of My elect that I will needs have them for Myself.\r\nThe Servant.--Tender loving Wisdom! And is it Thou I have so long been\r\nseeking for? is it Thou my spirit has so constantly struggled for? Alas, my\r\nGod, why didst Thou not show Thyself to me long ago? Why hast Thou delayed\r\nso long? How many a weary way have I not wandered!\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Had I done so thou wouldst not have known My goodness\r\nso sensibly as now thou knowest it.\r\nThe Servant.--O unfathomable goodness! how very sweetly hast Thou not\r\nmanifested Thyself to me! When I was not, Thou gavest me being. When I had\r\nseparated from Thee, Thou didst not separate from me; when I wished to\r\nescape from Thee, Thou didst hold me sweetly captive. Yes, Thou Eternal\r\nWisdom, if my heart might embrace Thee and consume all my days with Thee in\r\nlove and praise, such would be its desire; for truly that man is blest whom\r\nThou dost anticipate so lovingly that Thou lettest him have nowhere true\r\nrest, till he seeks his rest in Thee alone. O Wisdom Elect! since in Thee I\r\nhave found Him whom my soul loveth, despise not Thy poor creature. See how\r\ndumb my heart is to all the world in joy and sorrow. Lord, is my heart\r\nalways to be dumb towards Thee? O give my wretched soul leave, my dearest\r\nLord, to speak a word with Thee, for my heart is too full to contain itself\r\nany longer; neither has it anyone in all this world to whom it can unburden\r\nitself, except to Thee, my elected Lord, Father, and Brother. Lord, Thou\r\nalone knowest the nature of a love overflowing heart, and knowest that no\r\none can love what he cannot in any way know. Therefore, since I am now to\r\nlove Thee alone, give me to know Thee entirely, so that I may be also able\r\nto love Thee entirely.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The highest emanation of all beings, taken in their\r\nnatural order, is through the noblest beings to the lowest, but their\r\nrefluence to their origin is through the lowest to the highest. Therefore,\r\nif thou art wishful to behold Me in My uncreated Divinity thou must learn\r\nhow to know and love Me here in My suffering humanity for this is the\r\nspeediest way to eternal salvation.\r\nThe Servant.--Then let me remind Thee to-day, Lord,of Thy unfathomable\r\nlove, when Thou didst incline Thyself from Thy lofty throne, from the royal\r\nseat of the fatherly heart, in misery and disgrace for three and thirty\r\nyears, and didst show the love which Thou hast for me and all mankind,\r\nprincipally in the most bitter passion of Thy cruel death: Lord, be Thou\r\nreminded of this, that Thou mayest manifest Thyself spiritually to my soul,\r\nin that most sweet and lovely form to which Thy immeasurable love did bring\r\nThee.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The more mangled, the more deathly I am for love, the\r\nmore lovely am I to a well-regulated mind. My unfathomable love shows itself\r\nin the great bitterness of My passion, like the sun in its brightness, like\r\nthe fair rose in its perfume, like the strong fire in its glowing heat.\r\nTherefore, hear with devotion how cruelly I suffered for thee.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"          CHAPTER II.

I was ignominiously betrayed, taken\r\nprisoner like an enemy, rigorously bound, and led miserable away. After this\r\nI was impiously maltreated with blows, with spittle, with blindfolding,\r\naccused before Caiphas, and pronounced worthy of death. Unspeakable sorrows\r\nof heart were then seen in My dear Mother, from the first sight she had of\r\nMy distress till I was hung upon the cross. I was shamefully presented\r\nbefore Pilate, falsely denounced, and sentenced to die. They stood over\r\nagainst Me with terrible eyes like fierce giants, and I stood before them\r\nlike a meek lamb. I, the Eternal Wisdom, was mocked as a fool in a white\r\ngarment before Herod, My fair body was rent and torn without mercy by the\r\nrude stripes of whips, My lovely countenance was drenched in spittle and\r\nblood, and in this condition I was condemned, and miserable and shamefully\r\nled forth with My cross to death. They shouted after Me very furiously, so\r\nthat: Crucify, crucify the miscreant! resounded to the skies.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! Lord, the beginning is indeed so bitter, how will\r\nit end? If I were to see a wild beast so abused I should hardly be able to\r\nbear it. With what reason, then, must not Thy Passion pierce my heart and\r\nsoul! But, Lord, this is a great marvel to my heart; I would needs seek Thy\r\ndivinity, and Thou showest me Thy humanity; I would needs seek Thy\r\nsweetness, and Thou settest before me Thy bitterness; I would needs conquer,\r\nThou teachest me to fight. Lord, what dost Thou mean?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--No one can attain divine exaltation or singular\r\nsweetness except by passing through the image of My human abasement and\r\nbitterness. The higher one climbs without passing through My humanity, the\r\ndeeper one falls. My humanity is the way one must go, My Passion the gate\r\nthrough which one must penetrate, to arrive at that which thou seekest.\r\nTherefore, lay aside thy faint-heartedness, and enter with Me the lists of\r\nknightly resolve: for, indeed, softness beseems not the servant when his\r\nmaster stands ready in warlike boldness. I will put thee on My coat of mail,\r\nfor My entire Passion must thou suffer over again according to thy strength.\r\nMake up thy mind to a darting encounter, for thy heart, before thou shalt\r\nsubdue thy nature, must often die, and thou must sweat the bloody sweat of\r\nanguish because of many a painful suffering under which I mean to prepare\r\nthee for Myself; for with red blossoms will I manure thy spice garden.\r\nContrary to old custom, must thou be made prisoner and bound; thou wilt\r\noften be secretly calumniated and publicly defamed by My adversaries; many a\r\nfalse judgment will people pass on thee; My torments must thou then\r\ndiligently carry in thy heart with a motherly heartfelt love. Thou wilt\r\nobtain many a severe judge of thy godly life; so also will thy godly ways be\r\noften mocked as folly by human ways; thy undisciplined body will be scourged\r\nwith a hard and severe life; thou wilt be scoffingly crowned with\r\npersecution of thy holy life; after this, if only thou shalt issue forth\r\nfrom thy own will and deny thyself, and shalt stand as wholly disengaged\r\nfrom all creatures in the things which might lead thee astray in thy eternal\r\nsalvation, even as a dying man when he departs hence, and has nothing more\r\nto do with this world--if only thou shalt do this, then wilt thou be led\r\nforth with Me on the miserable way of the cross.\r\nThe Servant.--Woe is me, Lord, but this is a dreary pastime! My whole\r\nnature rebels against these words. Lord, how shall I ever endure it all?\r\nGentle Lord, one thing I must say: couldst Thou not have found out some\r\nother way, in Thy eternal wisdom, to save me and show Thy love for me, some\r\nway which would have exempted Thee from Thy great sufferings, and me from\r\ntheir bitter participation? How very wonderful do Thy judgments appear!\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The bottomless abyss of My hidden mysteries (in which\r\nI order everything according to My eternal providence), let no one explore,\r\nfor no one can fathom it. And yet, in this abyss, what thou askest about and\r\nmany things besides are possible, which yet never happen. However, know this\r\nmuch, that, in the order in which emanated beings now are, a more acceptable\r\nor more pleasing way could not be. The Lord of nature knows well what He can\r\ndo in nature. He knows what is best suited to every creature, and He\r\noperates accordingly. How should man better know the hidden things of God\r\nthan in His assumed Humanity? How might he, who has forfeited all joy\r\nthrough irregular lusts, be rendered susceptible of regular and eternal joy?\r\nHow would it be possible to follow the unpracticed way of a hard and\r\ndespised life, unless it had been followed by God Himself? If thou didst lie\r\nunder sentence of death, how could He, who should suffer the fatal penalty\r\nin thy stead, better prove His fidelity and love towards thee, or better\r\nexcite thee to love Him in return? Him, therefore, whom My unfathomable\r\nlove, My unspeakable mercy, and My bright divinity, My most affable\r\nhumanity, brotherly truth, espousing friendship, cannot move to ardent love,\r\nwhat else shall soften his stony heart? Ask the fair array of all created\r\nbeings if ever I could have maintained My justice, evinced My fathomless\r\nmercy, ennobled human nature, poured out My goodness, reconciled heaven and\r\nearth, in a way more efficacious than by My bitter death?\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, truly, I begin to perceive that it is even so, and\r\nhe whom want of understanding has not blinded, and who well considers the\r\nsubject, must confess it to Thee, and extol the beautiful ways of Thy love\r\nabove all ways. But still to follow Thee is very painful to a slothful body.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Be not terrified at the following of My Passion. For\r\nhe whose interior is so possessed by God that suffering is easy to him has\r\nno cause to complain. No one enjoys Me more in My singular sweetness than he\r\nwho stands with Me in harsh bitterness. No one complains so much of the\r\nbitterness of the husks as he to whom the interior sweetness of the kernel\r\nis unknown. For him who has a good second the fight is half won.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, Thy comforting words have given me such heart,\r\nthat, methinks, I am able to do and suffer all things in Thee.

To Me, a free heart, unconcerned about perishable love, and ever\r\nintent on following the main thing according to the type of My contemplated\r\nPassion, is more agreeable than if thou didst always bewail Me, and didst\r\nshed as many tears from weeping over My torments as there ever rained drops\r\nof water from the sky; for the following of Me was the cause in which I\r\nsuffered bitter death, although tears are also pleasing and agreeable to Me.\r\nThe Servant.--O sweet Lord, since then an affectionate following of Thy\r\nmeek life and voluntary Passion is so agreeable to Thee, I will in future be\r\nmore assiduous in a voluntary following than in a weeping sorrow.

Therefore,\r\ndo Him honour today in me, and graciously forget that wherein I may have\r\nangered Thee. For, methinks it were easier for me to suffer death than ever\r\nto anger Thee, my heavenly Father, again. Neither afflictions nor\r\noppressions, neither hell nor purgatory, are such causes of lamentation to\r\nmy heart, as that I ever should have angered and dishonoured Thee, my\r\nCreator, my Lord, my God, my Saviour, the joy and delight of my heart. Oh,\r\nif for this I could give voice to my grief of soul, through all the heavens,\r\ntill my heart should burst into a thousand pieces, how gladly would I do it!\r\nAnd the more entirely Thou forgivest my evil deeds, so much the greater is\r\nmy sorrow of heart at having been so ungrateful in return for thy great\r\ngoodness. And Thou, my only consolation, Thou my tender elected one, Eternal\r\nWisdom! how can I ever make Thee a complete and proper return of thanks for\r\nhaving at so dear a rate healed and reconciled with Thy pangs and wounds the\r\nbreach which all created beings could not have made good? And, therefore, my\r\neternal joy, teach me how to bear Thy wounds and love-marks on my entire\r\nbody, and how to have them at all times in my keeping, so that all this\r\nworld, and all the heavenly host, may see that I am grateful for the\r\ninfinite good which, out of Thy unfathomable goodness alone, Thou hast\r\nbestowed on my lost soul.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Thou shouldst give thyself and all that is thine to Me\r\ncheerfully, and never take them back. All that is not of absolute necessity\r\nto thee shouldst thou leave untouched; then will thy hands be truly nailed\r\nto My cross. Thou shouldst cheerfully set about good works and persevere in\r\nthem; then will thy left foot be made fast. Thy inconstant mind and\r\nwandering thoughts shouldst thou make constant and collected in Me; and thus\r\nthy right foot will be nailed to My cross. Thy mental and bodily powers must\r\nnot seek rest in lukewarmness; in the likeness of My arms they should be\r\nstretched out in My service. Thy sickly body must often, in honour of my\r\ndislocated bones, be wearied out in spiritual exercises, and rendered\r\nincapable of fulfilling its own desires. Many an unknown suffering must\r\nstrain thee to Me on the narrow bed of the cross, by which thou wilt become\r\nlovely like Me, and of the colour of blood. The withering away of thy nature\r\nmust make Me blooming again; thy spontaneous hardships must be to My weary\r\nback as a bed; thy resolute resistance to sin must relieve My spirit; thy\r\ndevout heart must soften My pains, and thy high flaming heart must kindle My\r\nfervid heart.\r\nThe Servant.--Now, then, fulfill Thou my good wishes, according to Thy\r\nhighest praise, and according to Thy very best will; for indeed Thy yoke is\r\nsweet, and Thy burthen light: this do all those know who have experienced\r\nit, and who were once overladen with the heavy load of sin."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER VI.

Lord, one\r\nlittle hour without Thee is a whole year; to be estranged one day from Thee\r\nis as much as a thousand years to a loving heart. Therefore, Thou branch of\r\nsalvation, Thou bush of May, Thou red blooming rose-tree, open and spread\r\nout the green branches of Thy divine nature. Lord, Thy countenance is so\r\nfull of graciousness, Thy mouth so full of living words, Thy whole carriage\r\nsuch a pure mirror of all discipline and meekness! O Thou aspect of\r\ngraciousness to all the saints, how very blessed is he who is found worthy\r\nof Thy sweet espousals!\r\nEternal Wisdom,--Many are called to them, but few are chosen.\r\nThe Servant.--Gentle Lord, either they have broken with Thee, or Thou\r\nwith them.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Lift up, therefore, thy eyes, and behold this vision.\r\nThe Servant lifted up his eyes and was terrified, and, with a deep\r\nsigh, said: Woe to me, dear Lord, that ever I was born! Do I see aright, or\r\nis it only a dream? I saw Thee before in such richness of beauty, and such\r\ntenderness of love; now I see nothing but a poor, outcast, miserable pilgrim\r\nwho stands wretchedly leaning on his staff before an old decayed city. The\r\ntrenches are in ruins, the walls falling down, only that, here and there,\r\nthe high tops of the old timber work still project aloft; and in the city is\r\na great multitude of people; among them are many that look like wild beasts\r\nin a human form: and the miserable pilgrim goes wandering about to see if\r\nany one will take him by the hand. Alas! I behold the multitude drive him\r\nwith insult away, and hardly look at him, because of the things about which\r\nthey are busy. And yet some, but only a very few, offer to give him their\r\nhands; this the other wild beasts come and prevent. Now I hear the miserable\r\npilgrim begin to sigh woefully, and cry aloud: O heaven and earth have pity\r\non me--me who have garnered up this city with such bitter toil, and who am\r\nso badly welcomed in it, while those who have spent no labour upon it are\r\nyet so kindly received!\r\nLord, such is what has been shown me in the vision. O Thou eternal God,\r\nwhat does it mean? Am I right or wrong?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--This vision is a vision of pure truth. Hearken to a\r\nlamentable thing; O let it touch thy heart with pity! I am the miserable\r\npilgrim whom thou didst see. At one time I was in great honour in that city,\r\nbut now I am brought down to great misery and driven out.\r\nThe Servant.--Dearest Lord! what is this city, what are the people in\r\nit?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--This decayed city is an image of that spiritual life\r\nin which I was once so worthily served. And while they were living in it so\r\nholily and securely, it begins in many places to fall very much to ruin; the\r\ntrenches begin to decay, and the walls to crack, that is to say, devout\r\nobedience, voluntary poverty, secluded purity in holy simplicity, begin to\r\ndisappear, and, at last, to such a degree that nothing is to be seen\r\nstanding, except the high timber work of mere exterior observance. As to the\r\ngreat multitude, the beasts in human form, they are worldly hearts under\r\nspiritual disguises, who, in the vain pursuit of transitory things, drive Me\r\nout of their souls. That a few should, nevertheless, offer to give Me their\r\nhands, but are hindered by the rest, signifies that some men of good\r\nintentions and devout feelings are perverted by the speech and evil example\r\nof others. The staff on which thou didst see Me stand leaning, is the cross\r\nof My bitter passion, with which I admonish them at all times to think on My\r\nsufferings, and to turn, with the love of their hearts to Me alone. But the\r\ncry of misery thou didst hear is My death which even here begins to cry\r\naloud, and ever cries aloud, because of those in whom neither My\r\nunfathomable love nor My bitter death is able to do so much as to expel the\r\nworm of sinful thoughts from their hearts.\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, how it cuts through my very heart and soul to\r\nthink Thou art so lovable, and yet, in spite of all Thy advances, art in\r\nmany hearts so utterly despised. Ah! tender Lord, what will Thy advances be\r\nto those who, though they see Thee in the miserable shape in which Thou art\r\nrejected by the multitude, yet stretch out their hands to Thee with sincere\r\nfaith and love?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Those who for My sake give up perishable affections,\r\nand receive Me with sincere faith and love, and remain constant to the end,\r\nwill I espouse with My divine love and sweetness, and will give them My hand\r\nin death, and exalt them on the throne of My glory before the whole court of\r\nheaven.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, there be many who think they will still love Thee\r\nwithout giving up perishable love. Lord, they will needs be very dear to\r\nThee, and yet will not the less indulge in temporal love.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--It is as impossible as to compress the heavens\r\ntogether and enclose them in a nut shell. Such persons array themselves in\r\nfair words, they build upon the wind, and construct upon the rainbow. How\r\nmay the eternal abide with the temporal, when even one temporal thing\r\nneither can nor will endure another? He but deceives himself who thinks he\r\ncan lodge the King of kings in a common inn, or thrust Him into the mean\r\ndwelling of a servant. In entire seclusion from all creatures must he keep\r\nhimself who is desirous of receiving his guest as he ought.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas, sweet Lord, how completely bewitched must they all\r\nbe not to see this!\r\nEternal Wisdom.--They stand in deep blindness. They endure many a hard\r\nstruggle for pleasures which they neither fix their attachment nor afford\r\nthem full gratification. Before they obtain one joy they meet with ten\r\nsorrows, and the more they pursue their lusts the more are these upbraided\r\nwith being insufficient. Lo! godless hearts must needs be at all times in\r\nfear and trembling. Even the fleeting pleasure they obtain proves very harsh\r\nto them, for they procure it with much toil, they enjoy it in great anxiety,\r\nand lose it with much bitterness. The world is full of untruth, falsehood,\r\nand inconstancy; when profit is at an end, friendship is at an end, and to\r\nspeak shortly, neither true love, nor entire joy, nor constant peace of\r\nmind, was ever obtained by any heart from creatures.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! dear Lord, what a lamentable thing it is, that so\r\nmany a noble soul, so many a languishing heart, so many an image formed\r\nafter God in such beauty and sweetness, that in Thy espousals ought to be\r\nqueens and empresses, powerful in heaven and on earth, should so foolishly\r\ngo astray and degrade themselves! Oh, wonder of wonders! to think that of\r\ntheir own accord they should be lost! since, according to Thy words of\r\ntruth, the fell separation of the soul from the body were better for them\r\nthan that Thou, the Life Eternal, shouldest have to separate from their\r\nsouls where Thou findest no dwelling-place. Oh, ye dull fools, behold how\r\nyour great ruin prospers, how your great loss increases, how you allow the\r\nprecious, the fair, the delightsome moments to pass away, which ye may\r\nhardly or indeed never again possess, and how gaily you carry yourselves the\r\nwhile, as though it concerned you not! Alas! Thou gentle Wisdom, did they\r\nbut know it and feel it surely they would desist.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Listen to a wonderful and lamentable thing. They know\r\nit and feel it at all hours, and yet do not desist; they know it and yet\r\nwill not know it; they beautify it, like unsound argument, with dazzling\r\nbrightness, which yet is unlike the naked truth, as so many of them at last,\r\nwhen it is too late, will have to feel.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! tender Wisdom, how senseless they are, or what does\r\nit mean?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Here will they needs escape calamity and suffering,\r\nand yet fall into the midst of it; and as they will not endure the eternal\r\ngood and My sweet yoke, they will be overwhelmed by the inevitable doom of\r\nMy severe justice with many a heavy burthen. They fear the frost, and fall\r\ninto the snow.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! tender and merciful Wisdom, remember that, without\r\nbeing strengthened by Thee, no one can accomplish anything. I see no other\r\nhelp for them than to raise their eyes to Thee, and to fall at Thy feet with\r\nbitter, heart-felt tears, entreating that Thou wouldst vouchsafe to\r\nenlighten them, and free them from the bonds with which they are made fast.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--I am at all times ready to help them, if only they be\r\nready. I do not turn away from them.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, it is painful for love to separate from love.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Very true, if I could not and would not lovingly make\r\ngood all love in hearts of love.\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, it is impossible to leave off old custom.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--But it will be yet more impossible to endure future\r\ntorments.\r\nThe Servant.--They are perhaps so well regulated in themselves that it\r\ndoes them no injury.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--I was the best regulated of men, and yet the most\r\nself-mortified. How may that be regulated which, from its very nature,\r\ncorrupts the heart, confuses the mind, perverts discipline, draws off the\r\nheart from all fervour, and robs it of its peace? It breaks open the gates,\r\nbehind which godly living lies hidden, that is, the five senses. It casts\r\nforth sobriety and introduces audaciousness, the loss of grace, estrangement\r\nfrom God, interior tepidity, and exterior sloth.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, they do not think they are hindered so much, if\r\nonly what they love have the appearance of a spiritual life.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--A clear-seeing eye may just as easily be blinded by\r\nwhile meal as by pale ashes. Behold, was ever any person's presence so\r\nharmless as Mine among My disciples? No unprofitable words fell from us,\r\namong us there was no extravagant demeanour, no beginning loftily in the\r\nspirit, and sinking down in the depth of endless words; there was nothing\r\nbut real earnestness and entire truth without any deceit. And yet, My bodily\r\npresence had to be withdrawn from them before they became susceptible of My\r\nspirit. What a hindrance, then, must not a merely human presence prove!\r\nBefore they are influenced to good by one person, they are seduced by a\r\nthousand; before they are reformed in one point by good precept, they are\r\noften led astray by bad example; and, to speak briefly, as the sharp frost\r\nin May nips the blossoms and scatters them abroad, so the love of perishable\r\nthings blights godly seriousness and religious discipline. If thou hast\r\nstill a doubt respecting it, look around thee into the beautiful, fruitful\r\nvineyards which formerly were so delightful in their first bloom, how\r\nutterly withered and ruined they are, so that they contain few traces more\r\nof fervent seriousness and great devotion. Now, this produces an irreparable\r\ninjury, for it has become a thing of habit, a spiritual decorum, which,\r\nsecretly, is so destructive of all spiritual salvation. It is all the more\r\npernicious as it appears innocent. How many a precious spice-garden is\r\nthere, which, adorned with delightful gifts, was a heavenly paradise, where\r\nGod was well pleased to dwell, which, now, by reason of perishable love, has\r\nbecome a garden of wild weeds; where lilies and roses formerly grew, now\r\nstands thorns, nettles, and briars, and where angels were used to dwell,\r\nswine now root up the soil. Woe betide the hour, when all lost time, when\r\nall good works neglected, shall be reckoned up, when every idle word spoken,\r\nthought, written, whether in secret or in public, shall be read out before\r\nGod and the whole world, and its meaning, without disguise, be understood!\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! my Lord, some hearts there are, of so tender a\r\nnature, that they are much sooner attracted by love than fear, and as Thou,\r\nthe Lord of nature, art not a destroyer but a fulfiller of nature, O,\r\ntherefore, most kind and gracious Lord, put an end to this sad discourse,\r\nand tell me how Thou art a Mother of beautiful love, and how sweet Thy love\r\nis."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                   CHAPTER VII.

Thou canst show Thyself so lovely and so tender, that all\r\nhearts must needs languish for Thee and endure, for Thy sake, all the misery\r\nof tender desire; Thy words of love flow so sweetly out of Thy sweet mouth,\r\nand so powerfully affect many hearts in their days of youthful bloom, that\r\nperishable love is wholly extinguished in them. O my dear Lord, this it is\r\nfor which my soul sighs, this it is which makes my spirit sad, this it is\r\nabout which I would gladly hear Thee speak. Now, then, my only elected\r\nComforter, speak one little word to my soul, to Thy poor handmaid; for, lo!\r\nI am fallen softly asleep beneath Thy shadow, and my heart watcheth.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Listen, then, my son, and see, incline to Me thy ears,\r\nenter wholly into thy interior, and forget thyself and all things. I am in\r\nMyself the incomprehensible good, which always was and always is, which\r\nnever was and never will be uttered. I may indeed give Myself to men\'s\r\nhearts to be felt by them, but no tongue can truly express Me in words. And\r\nyet, when I, the Supernatural, immutable good, present Myself to every\r\ncreature according to its capacity to be susceptible of Me, I bind the sun\'s\r\nsplendour, as it were, in a cloth, and give thee spiritual perceptions of Me\r\nand of My sweet love in bodily words thus: I set Myself tenderly before the\r\neyes of thy heart; now adorn and clothe thou Me in spiritual perceptions and\r\nrepresent Me as delicate and as comely as thy very heart could wish, and\r\nbestow on Me all those things that can move the heart to especial love and\r\nentire delight of soul. Lo! all and everything that thou and all men can\r\npossibly imagine of form, of elegance, and grace, is in Me far more\r\nravishing than any one can express, and in words like these do I choose to\r\nmake Myself known. Now, listen further: I am of high birth, of noble race; I\r\nam the Eternal Word of the Fatherly Heart, in which, according to the\r\nlove-abounding abyss of My natural Sonship in His sole paternity, I possess\r\na gratefulness before His tender eyes in the sweet and bright-flaming love\r\nof the Holy Ghost. I am the throne of delight, I am the crown of salvation,\r\nMy eyes are so clear, My mouth so tender, My cheeks so radiant and blooming,\r\nand all My figure so fair and ravishing, yea, and so delicately formed, that\r\nif a man were to lie in the glowing furnace till the day of judgment, only\r\nto have one single glance at My beauty, he would not deserve it. See, I am\r\nso deliciously adorned in garments of light, I am so exquisitely set off\r\nwith all the blooming colours of living flowers, that all May-blossoms, all\r\nthe beautiful shrubs of all dewy fields, all the tender buds of the sunny\r\nmeads, are but as rough thistles compared to My adornment.\r\nIn the Godhead I play the game of bliss,\r\nSuch joy the angels find in this,\r\nThat unto them a thousand years\r\nBut as one little hour appears.\r\nAll the heavenly host follow Me entranced by new wonders, and behold\r\nMe; their eyes are fixed on Mine; their hearts are inclined to Me, their\r\nminds bent on Me without intermission. Happy is he who, in joyous security,\r\nshall take Me by My beautiful hand, and join in My sweet diversions, and\r\ndance for ever the dance of joy amid the ravishing delights of the kingdom\r\nof heaven! One little word there spoken by My sweet mouth will far surpass\r\nthe singing of all angels, the music of all harps, the harmony of all sweet\r\nstrings. My faithfulness is so made to be loved, so lovely am I to be\r\nembraced, and so tender for pure languishing souls to kiss, that all hearts\r\nought to break for My possession. I am condescending and full of sympathy\r\nand always present to the pure soul. I abide with her in secret, at table,\r\nin bed, in the streets, in the fields. Turn Myself whichever way I will, in\r\nMe there is nothing that can displease, in Me is everything that can delight\r\nthe utmost wishes of thy heart and desires of the soul. Lo! I am a good so\r\npure, that he who in his day only gets one drop of Me regards all the\r\npleasures and delights of this world as nothing but bitterness; all its\r\npossessions and honours as worthless, and only fit to be cast away; My\r\nbeloved ones are encompassed by My love, and are absorbed into the One Thing\r\nalone without imaged love and without spoken words, and are taken and\r\ninfused into that good out of which they flowed. My love can also relieve\r\nregenerate hearts from the heavy load of sin, and can give a free, pure, and\r\ngentle heart, and create a clean conscience. Tell Me, what is there in all\r\nthis world able to outweigh this one thing? For he who gives his heart\r\nwholly to Me lives joyfully, dies securely, and obtains the kingdom of\r\nheaven here as well as hereafter.\r\nNow, observe, I have assuredly given thee many words, and yet My beauty\r\nhas been as little touched by them as the firmament by thy little finger,\r\nbecause no eye has ever seen My beauty, nor ear heard it, neither has it\r\never entered any heart. Still let what I have said to thee be as a device to\r\nshow thee the difference between My sweet love and false, perishable love.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah! Thou tender, delicious, wild flower, Thou delight of\r\nthe heart in the embracing arms of the pure loving soul, how familiar is all\r\nthis to him who has even once really felt Thee; but how strange is it to\r\nthat man who knows Thee not, whose heart and mind are still in the body! O,\r\nThou most heart-felt incomprehensible good this is a precious hour, this is\r\na sweet moment, in which I must open to Thee a secret wound which my heart\r\nstill bears from Thy sweet love. Lord, plurality in love is like water in\r\nthe fire. Lord, Thou knowest that real fervent love cannot bear duality.\r\nAlas! Thou only Lord of my heart and soul, my heart desires that Thou\r\nshouldst have a particular love for me, and that I should be particularly\r\npleasing to Thy divine eyes. O Lord, Thou hast so many hearts that ardently\r\nlove Thee, and are of much account with Thee. Alas! my sweet and tender\r\nLord, how stands it with me in this matter?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--My love is of that sort which is not diminished in\r\nunity, nor confounded in multiplicity. I am as entirely concerned and\r\noccupied with thee alone, with the thought how I may at all times love thee\r\nalone, and fulfill everything that appertains to thee, as though I were\r\nwholly disengaged from all other things.\r\nThe Servant.--O rare! O wonderful! whither am I borne, how am I gone\r\nastray! how is my soul utterly dissolved by the sweet friendly words of my\r\nbeloved! Oh, turn away Thy bright eyes from me, for they have overcome\r\nme.[4] Wherever was there a heart so hard, a soul so lukewarm, so cold as,\r\nwhen it heard Thy sweet living words, so exceedingly fiery as they are, was\r\nnot fain to melt and kindle in Thy sweet love! O wonder of wonders! that he\r\nwho thus sees Thee with the eyes of his soul, should not feel his very heart\r\ndissolve in love. How right blessed is he who bears the name of Thy Spouse,\r\nand is so! What sweet consolations and secret tokens of Thy love must not he\r\neternally receive from Thee! O thou sweet virgin St. Agnes, thou fair wooer\r\nof Eternal Wisdom! how well couldst thou console thyself with thy dear\r\nBridegroom, when thou didst say, "His blood has adorned my cheeks as with\r\nroses." O gentle Lord, that my soul were but worthy to be called Thy wooer!\r\nAnd were it indeed possible that all delights, all joy and love, that this\r\nworld can afford, might be found united in one man, how gladly would I\r\nrenounce him for the sake of that name! How blessed is that man, that ever\r\nhe was born into the world who is named Thy friend, and is so! Oh, if a man\r\nhad even a thousand lives, he ought to stake them at once for the sake of\r\nacquiring Thy love. Oh, all ye friends of God, all ye heavenly host, and\r\nthou dear virgin St. Agnes, help me to pray to Him: for never did I rightly\r\nknow what His love was. Alas! thou heart of mine, lay aside, put away all\r\nsloth, and see if, before thy death, thou mayest advance so far as to feel\r\nHis sweet love. O thou tender beautiful Wisdom! O my elected One! What a\r\ntruly right gracious love Thou canst be above all loves else in the world!\r\nHow very different is Thy love and the love of creatures! How false is\r\neverything that appears lovely in this world and gives itself out to be\r\nsomething, as soon as one really begins to know it. Lord, wherever I might\r\ncast my eyes I always found something to disgust me; for, if it was a fair\r\nimage, it was void of grace; if it was fair and lovely, it had not the true\r\nway; or if it had indeed this, still, I always found something either\r\ninwardly or outwardly, to which the entire inclination of my heart was\r\nsecretly opposed. But Thou art beauty with infinite affability, Thou art\r\ngrace in shape and form, the word with the way, nobility with virtue, riches\r\nwith power, interior freedom and exterior brightness, and one thing Thou art\r\nwhich I have never found in time, namely, a power and faculty of perfectly\r\nsatiating every wish and every ardent desire of a truly loving heart. The\r\nmore one knows Thee, the more one loves Thee; the more acquainted one is\r\nwith Thee, the more friendly one finds Thee. Ah me! what an unfathomable,\r\nentirely pure, good Thou art! See how deceived all those hearts are that fix\r\ntheir affections on anything else! Ah! ye false lovers, flee far from me,\r\nnever come near me more. I have chosen for my heart that one only love in\r\nwhich my heart, my soul, my desire, and all my powers can alone be satiated\r\nwith a love that never dissolves away. Oh Lord, could I but trace Thee on my\r\nheart! could I but melt Thee with characters of gold into the innermost core\r\nof my heart and soul, so that Thou mightest never be eradicated out of me!\r\nOh, misery and desolation! that ever I should have troubled my heart with\r\nsuch things! What have I gained with all my lovers, but time lost, forfeited\r\nwords, an empty hand, few good works, and a conscience burdened with\r\ninfirmity? Slay me, rather, in Thy love, O Lord, for from Thy feet I will\r\nnever more be separated.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--I go forth to meet those who seek Me, and I receive\r\nwith affectionate joy such as desire My love. All that thou canst ever\r\nexperience of My sweet love in time, is but as a little drop to the ocean of\r\nMy love in eternity.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER VIII.

Woe is me! How\r\nvery terrible is Thy angry countenance, how very intolerable Thy ungentle\r\naverted looks! So full of fire are Thy threatening words that they cut\r\nthrough heart and soul.

Lo! when I only\r\ndoubt, lest, because of my guilty deeds Thou mayest have turned Thy face\r\nangrily away from me, it is a thing so insupportable, that nothing in all\r\nthis world is so bitter to me.

Lord, let no one confide in Thy silence, for verily Thy silence\r\nwill soon be turned to dreadful thunder. Lord, the angry countenance of Thy\r\nFatherly anger to that man who is fearful of provoking and losing Thee, is a\r\nhell above all hells.

In truth, Lord, when a soul is quite exhausted with\r\nyearning after Thee and the sweet caresses of Thy presence, then, Lord, art\r\nThou silent and sayest not a word. O Lord! ought not this to grieve my\r\nheart, that Thou, my tender Lord, Thou who art my only one love, and the\r\nsole desire of my heart, shouldst yet behave Thyself so strangely, and in\r\nsuch a way hold Thy peace?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--And yet do all creatures cry aloud to Me that it is I.\r\nThe Servant.--O dear Lord! that is not enough for a languishing soul.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--If every little word I utter is a little word of love\r\nto their hearts, and every word of the Sacred Scriptures written by Me is a\r\nsweet love-letter, as though I Myself had written it, ought this not to be\r\nenough for them?\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, Thou knowest well that to a loving heart\r\neverything that is not its only love and its only consolation, is\r\ninsufficient. Lord, Thou art so very intimate, choice, and fathomless a\r\nlove; lo! if even all the tongues of all the angels were to address me, love\r\nunfathomable would still pursue and strive after Him alone whom it longs\r\nfor. A loving soul would still take Thee for the kingdom of heaven, for\r\nsurely Thou art her heaven. Alas! Lord, may I venture to say that Thou\r\nshouldst be a little more favourable to such poor affectionate hearts as\r\npine and languish for Thee, as breathe out so many an unfathomable sigh to\r\nThee, as look up so yearningly to Thee, crying aloud from their very hearts,\r\nReturn to us, O Lord! and speaking and reasoning with themselves thus: \"Have\r\nwe cause to think we have angered Him, and that He will forsake us? Have we\r\ncause to think He will not give us His loving presence back again, so that\r\nwe may affectionately embrace Him with the arms of our hearts, and press Him\r\nto our bosoms till all our sorrow vanish? Lord, all this Thou knowest and\r\nhearest, and yet Thou art silent!\"\r\nEternal Wisdom.--I know it and see it with heart-felt eager joy. But\r\nnow, since thy wonder is so great, answer Me a question. What is that which,\r\nof all things, gives the most delight to the highest of created spirits?\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, I would fain learn this from Thee, for such a\r\nquestion is too great for my understanding.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Then I will tell Thee. Nothing tastes better to the\r\nvery highest angel than, in all things, to do My will; so that if he knew\r\nthat it would tend to My praise to root up nettles, and other weeds it would\r\nbe for him, of all things, the most desirable to perform.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, Lord, how dost Thou strike home to me with this\r\nquestion! For surely Thy meaning is, that I ought to keep myself disengaged\r\nand serene in joy, and seek Thy praise alone, both in sorrow and delight.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--A desertion above all desertion is to be deserted in\r\ndesertion.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! Lord, but it is a very heavy woe.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Where is virtue preserved except in adversity? Yet\r\nknow that I often come and ask for admission into my house, and am denied.\r\nOften am I received like a poor pilgrim, and meanly entertained, and\r\nspeedily driven out. I come even to My beloved, and fondly take up My abode\r\nwith her, but this takes place so secretly that it is totally hidden from\r\nall men, except those only who live in entire seclusion, and perceive My\r\nways, who are ever careful to correspond to My graces. For in virtue of My\r\ndivinity, I am a perfectly pure essential spirit, and am spiritually\r\nreceived into pure spirits.\r\nThe Servant.--Gentle Lord, methinks Thou art altogether a hidden lover,\r\ntherefore I desire Thou wouldst give me some signs of Thy true presence.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--In nothing canst thou discern My presence so well as\r\nin this, namely, when I hide and withdraw Myself from the soul, as not till\r\nthen art thou capable of perceiving who I am or what thou art. I am the\r\nEternal Good, without which no one has any good. When I, the Eternal Good,\r\npour Myself out so graciously and lovingly, everything into which I enter is\r\nmade good. By this goodness My presence is to be known even as is the sun by\r\nhis brightness, who, in his substance, is yet not to be seen. If ever thou\r\nart sensible of Me, enter into thyself and learn to separate the roses from\r\nthe thorns, and to choose out the flowers from the grass.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, truly I seek and find in myself a great inequality.\r\nWhen my soul is deserted, she is like a sick person who can relish nothing;\r\nwho is disgusted with everything; the body is languid, the spirits are dull;\r\ndryness within, and sadness without; all that I see and hear is then\r\nrepugnant to me, and I know not how good it is, for I have lost all\r\ndiscrimination. I am then inclined to sin, weak in resisting my enemies,\r\ncold and lukewarm in all that is good; he who visits me finds an empty\r\nhouse, for the master, who gives wise counsel and makes all the family glad\r\nat heart, is not within. But, Lord, when in the midst of my soul the bright\r\nmorning star rises, all my sorrow passes away, all my darkness is scattered,\r\nand laughing cheerfulness appears. Lord, then leaps my heart, then are my\r\nspirits gay, then rejoices my soul, then is it my marriage feast, while all\r\nthat is in me or about me is turned to Thy praise. What before was hard,\r\ntroublesome, and impossible, becomes easy and pleasant; fasting, watching,\r\npraying, self-denial, and every sort of rigour, are made sweet by Thy\r\npresence. Then do I acquire great assurance in many things, which, in my\r\ndereliction I had lost; my soul is then overflowed with clearness, truth,\r\nand sweetness, so that she forgets all her toil; my heart can sweetly\r\nmeditate, my tongue loftily discourse, and whoever seeks high counsel from\r\nme touching his heart's desire finds it; for then I am as though I had\r\noverstepped the bounds of time and space, and stood in the ante-chamber of\r\neternal salvation. Alas, Lord! who will grant that it might only be of\r\nlonger duration, for behold, in a moment it is snatched away, and I am again\r\nstripped and forsaken. Sometimes I pursue it as if I had never gained it,\r\ntill at last, after much sorrow and trouble of heart, it comes back. Lord!\r\nart Thou this thing, or am I it, or what is it?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Thou art and hast of thyself nothing but imperfection;\r\nI am it, and this is the game of love.\r\nThe Servant.--But, Lord, what is the game of love?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--All the time that love is with love, love does not\r\nknow how dear love is; but when love separates from love, then only does\r\nlove feel how dear love was.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord! this is a dreary game. Alas, Lord! is inconstancy\r\nnever cast aside in any one while time lasts?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--In very few persons, for constancy belongs to\r\neternity.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, who are these persons?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The very purest of all, and in eternity the most like\r\nto God.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, which are they?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--They are those persons who have denied themselves in\r\nthe most perfect manner.\r\nThe Servant.--Gentle Lord, teach me how, in my imperfection, I ought to\r\nbehave in this manner.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--In good days thou oughtest to look at evil days, and\r\nin evil days not to forget good days; thus can neither elation injure thee\r\nin My company nor despondency in dereliction. If, in thy faintheartedness,\r\nthou canst not endure My absence with pleasure, wait for Me at least with\r\npatience, and seek Me diligently.\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, long waiting is painful.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--He who will needs have love in time, must know how to\r\nbear weal and woe. It is not enough to devote to Me only a portion of the\r\nday. He who would enjoy God's intimacy, who would hear His mysterious words,\r\nand mark their secret meaning, ought always to keep within doors. Alas! how\r\nis it that thou always permittest thy eyes to wander so thoughtlessly\r\naround, when thou hast standing before thee the Blessed and Eternal Image of\r\nthe Godhead which never for a moment turns away from thee? Why dost thou let\r\nthy ears escape from thee when I address thee so many a sweet word? How is\r\nit that thou so readily forgettest thyself when thou art so perfectly\r\nencompassed with the eternal good? What is it thy soul seeks in exterior\r\nthings who carries within herself so secretly the kingdom of heaven?\r\nThe Servant.--What is the kingdom of heaven, O Lord, which is in the\r\nsoul?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--It is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy\r\nGhost.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, I understand from this discourse, that Thou hast\r\nmuch hidden intercourse with the soul, which is wholly hidden from her, and\r\nthat Thou dost secretly attract the soul, and dost leisurely initiate her\r\ninto the love and knowledge of Thy high divinity, her who at first was only\r\nconcerned with Thy fair humanity."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER X.

Scarcely is any one, say they, admitted to Thy\r\nfriendship, but he has forthwith to gather up his courage for suffering.\r\nLord, by Thy goodness! what sweetness can they have in all this? Or how\r\ncanst Thou permit it in Thy friends? Or art Thou pleased not to know\r\nanything about it?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Even as My Father loves Me, so do I love My friends. I\r\ndo to My friends now as I have done from the beginning of the world.\r\nThe Servant.--This is what they complain of; and therefore, say they,\r\nThou hast so few friends because Thou allowest them to prosper in this world\r\nso very sorrily.

According to\r\nthy natural essence thou art a mirror of the Divinity, thou art an image of\r\nthe Trinity, and a copy of eternity; for as I, in My eternal uncreated\r\nentity, am the good which is infinite, so art thou according to thy desires,\r\nfathomless, and as little as a small drop can yield in the vast depth of the\r\nsea, just so little can all that this world is able to afford contribute to\r\nthe fulfillment of thy desires. Thus, then, art thou in this wretched valley\r\nof tears, where joy and sorrow, laughing and weeping, mirth and sadness, are\r\nmingled together; where no heart ever obtained perfect happiness; for it is\r\nfalse and deceitful, more than I will tell thee.

Behold, above the ninth heaven, which is\r\nincalculably more than a hundred thousand times larger than the entire\r\nearth, there is another heaven which is called Coelum Empyreum, the fiery\r\nheaven, so called, not from its being of fire, but from its immeasurably\r\ntransparent brightness, which is immovable and unchangeable in its nature;\r\nand this is the glorious court in which the heavenly hosts dwell, where the\r\nmorning star with the rest praises Me, and all the children of God rejoice.\r\nThere stand, encompassed with inconceivable light, the everlasting thrones,\r\nfrom which the evil spirits were hurled, in which the elect are seated. See\r\nhow the delightful city shines with beaten gold, how it glitters with costly\r\njewels, inlaid with precious stones, transparent as crystal, reflecting red\r\nroses, white lilies, and all living flowers. Now, look on the beautiful\r\nheavenly fields themselves. Lo! here all delights of summer, here sunny\r\nmeads of May, here the very valley of bliss, here the glad moments are seen\r\nflitting from joy to joy; here harps and viols, here singing, and leaping,\r\nand dancing, hand in hand for ever! here the gratification of every desire,\r\nhere pleasure without pain in everlasting security! Now, look how the\r\ncountless multitude drink to their hearts\' desire at the living fountains of\r\ngushing water; look how they feast their eyes on the pure, clear mirror of\r\nthe revealed Divinity, in which all things are made plain and evident to\r\nthem.

I shall adorn her interiorly with\r\nthe beautiful garment of the eternal light of that glory which will exalt\r\nher above all her natural powers. She will be clothed exteriorly with the\r\nglorified body, which is seven times brighter than the sun\'s light, swift,\r\nsubtle, and to suffering, impassive; then I shall put on her the crown of\r\ndelight, and on the crown a golden garland.\r\nThe Servant.--Gentle Lord, what is the morning gift, and what the crown\r\nand golden garland?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The morning gift is a clear vision of that which here\r\nbelow thou dost merely believe in, an actual comprehending of that which now\r\nthou hopest for, and a heartfelt pleasant enjoyment of that which on earth\r\nthou lovest. As to the beautiful crown, it is essential reward, but the\r\nblooming garland is accidental reward.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, what is that?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Accidental reward consists in such particular delight\r\nas souls obtain by particular and meritorious works wherewith they have\r\nconquered here below, even as the souls of great doctors, steadfast martyrs,\r\nand pure virgins. But Essential reward consists in the contemplative union\r\nof the soul with the pure Divinity, for rest she never can till she be born\r\nabove all her powers and capacities, and introduced to the natural entity of\r\nthe Persons, and to the clear vision of their real essence. And in the\r\nemanation of the splendour of Their essence she will find full and perfect\r\nsatisfaction and everlasting happiness; and the more disengaged and\r\nabstracted the self-expression of such souls is, the more free will be their\r\nsoaring exaltation; and the more free their exaltation, the deeper will be\r\ntheir penetration into the vast wilderness and unfathomable abyss of the\r\nunknown Godhead, wherein they are immersed, overflowed, and blended up,[5]\r\nso that they desire to have no other will than God\'s will, and that they\r\nbecome the very same that God is: in other words, that they be made blessed\r\nby grace as He is by nature.

Where now the bowed heads, the cast down eyes? where the\r\nsuppressed sorrow of heart, the deep sighs and bitter tears? where the pale\r\nlooks, the dire poverty, and manifold infirmities? Where is now the\r\nmiserable voice thus speaking: "Alas, my Lord and my God, how sad at heart I\r\nam!" Where are all those now who so greatly oppressed and despised you? No\r\nmore are heard such words at these: "Ho, for the combat! ho, for the strife!\r\nbe ready day and night like one who fights against the heathen!" Where is\r\nnow what you were wont, in the presence of grace, to say a thousand times\r\ninteriorly: "Art thou prepared to combat steadily when forsaken?" No more is\r\nheard the sad and lamentable cry which you so often uttered: "O God, why\r\nhast Thou forsaken me!" Rather do I hear the sweet words lovingly sounding\r\nin your ears: "Come hither to Me, My blessed ones, possess the everlasting\r\nkingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world." Where is now all\r\nthe sorrow and affliction which ye ever endured on earth? O God, how swiftly\r\nis it all vanished like a dream as though ye had never known tribulation! Of\r\na truth, gentle Lord, how inscrutable are Thy judgments to the world! Happy\r\nyou, ye elect, it is all over now with dwelling in nooks and corners, with\r\nstealing away and hiding yourselves from the senseless follies of other men.\r\nOh, if all hearts were but one heart, they could not sufficiently reflect on\r\nthe great honour, the immeasurable deserts, the praise which you will\r\nevermore possess.

Yes, my gentle Lord, my chosen One, how good it is to be here! O my\r\nonly Love, let us tarry here!\r\nEternal Wisdom.--It is not yet time to tarry here. Many a sharp\r\nconflict hast thou still to endure. This vision has only been shown to thee\r\nthat thou mayest presently revert to it in all thy sufferings, as thus thou\r\ncanst never lose courage, and wilt forget all thy sorrow; and further, as an\r\nanswer to the complaint of foolish men who say that I allow My friends to\r\nfare so hard. See then what a difference there is between My friendship and\r\nthe friendship of this temporal state; and to speak according to the truth,\r\nhow much better than others My friends fare at My hands. I will say nothing\r\nof the great trouble, labour, and many a severe tribulation in which they\r\nswim and wade, night and day; only this, that they are so blinded they do\r\nnot understand it. It is indeed My eternal economy that a mind not regulated\r\nshould be a sharp torment and heavy burden to itself. My friends have bodily\r\ndistress, but then they have peace of heart. The friends of the world hunt\r\nafter bodily comfort and ease, but in their hearts, their souls and minds,\r\nthey gain nothing but trouble and vexation.\r\nThe Servant.--Those persons, Lord, are out of their right senses, and\r\nare raving, who would needs compare Thy faithful friendship and the world\'s\r\nfriendship together. That they should do so because Thou hast few friends\r\nwho have no suffering to complain of, is the fault of their great blindness.\r\nO Lord, how very soft and gentle is Thy Fatherly rod! Blessed is he on whom\r\nThou sparest it not. Lord, I now plainly see that tribulation does not\r\nproceed from Thy harshness, but rather from Thy tender love. Let no one say\r\nfor the future that Thou hast forgotten Thy friends. Those hast Thou\r\nforgotten (for Thou hast despaired of them), on whom Thou dost spare\r\nchastisement here below. Lord, in all fairness those ought not to have\r\njoyous days, nor pleasures, nor comfort here below, whom Thou dost intend to\r\nshield above from eternal misery, and endow with everlasting delight. Grant,\r\nO Lord, that these two visions may never disappear from the eyes of my\r\nheart, so that I never may lose Thy friendship.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"   CHAPTER XIII.

My dwelling is in the pure soul as in a paradise of delights,\r\nfor which reason I cannot endure that she should lovingly and longingly\r\nattach herself to anything. But, from her very nature, she is inclined to\r\npernicious lusts, and therefore I encompass her path with thorns. I garnish\r\nall her outlets with adversity, whether she like it or not, so that she may\r\nnot escape from Me; her ways I strew with tribulation, so that she may not\r\nset the foot of her heart's desire anywhere except in the loftiness of My\r\ndivine nature. And if all hearts were but one heart, they would not be able\r\nto bear even that least reward which I certainly will give for the suffering\r\nendured by anyone for love of Me. Such is My eternal order in all nature,\r\nfrom which I do not swerve; what is precious and good must be earned with\r\nbitterness; he who recoils at thus, let him recoil; many are indeed called,\r\nbut few are chosen.\r\nThe Servant.--It may well be, Lord, that suffering is an infinite good,\r\nprovided it be not without measure, and not too dreadful and overwhelming.\r\nLord, Thou alone knowest all hidden things, and didst create all things in\r\nweight, in number and measure; Thou knowest also that my sufferings are\r\nmeasureless, that they are wholly beyond my strength. Lord, is there anyone\r\nin all this world who has constantly more painful sufferings than I? They\r\nare to me invincible--how am I to endure them? Lord, if Thou wouldst send me\r\nordinary sufferings, I could bear them, but I do not see how I can ever\r\nendure such extraordinary sufferings as these--sufferings which in so hidden\r\na manner oppress my heart and soul, which only Thou canst perfectly\r\nunderstand.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Every sick man imagines that his own sickness is the\r\nworst, and every man in distress, his own distress the greatest. Had I sent\r\nthee other sufferings it would have been the same. Conform thyself freely to\r\nMy will under every pain which I ordain thee to suffer, without excepting\r\nthis or the other suffering. Dost thou not know that I only desire what is\r\nbest for thee, even with as kindly a feeling as thou thyself? Hence it is\r\nthat I am the Eternal Wisdom, and that I know better than thou what is for\r\nthy good. Hence it is that thou mayst have felt that the sufferings which I\r\nsend are much more exquisite, and penetrate deeper, and operate better, for\r\nhim who does them justice, than all self-chosen sufferings. Why then dost\r\nthou so complain to Me? Address Me rather as follows: O my most faithful\r\nFather, do to me at all times what Thou wilt!\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, it is so easy to talk, but the reality is so\r\ndifficult to endure, for it is so very painful.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--If suffering gave no pain, it could not becalled\r\nsuffering. There is nothing more painful than suffering, and nothing more\r\njoyful than to have suffered. Suffering is a short pain and a long joy.\r\nSuffering gives to the sufferer pain here and joy hereinafter. Suffering\r\nkills suffering. Suffering is ordained that the sufferer may not suffer\r\neternally. Hadst thou so much spiritual sweetness and divine consolation and\r\nheavenly delight as, at all times, to overflow with the divine dew, it would\r\nnot be for thee so very meritorious of itself, since, for all this together,\r\nI should not have to thank thee so much; it could not exculpate thee so much\r\nas an affectionate suffering or patience in adversity, in which thou\r\nsufferest for My sake. Sooner will ten be perverted and ruined in the midst\r\nof a great delight and joyous sweetness than one in the midst of constant\r\nsuffering and adversity. If thou hadst as much science as all the\r\nastronomers, if thou couldst discourse as ably of God as all the tongues of\r\nmen and angels, and didst possess the treasures of knowledge of all the\r\nmasters, not all this could avail to advance thee in a good life, so much as\r\nif thou didst give thyself up, and didst abandon thyself in all thy\r\nsufferings to God; for the former is common to the good and the bad, but the\r\nlatter is proper to My elect alone. If anyone were able rightly to weigh\r\ntime and eternity, he ought rather to desire to lie in a fiery furnace for a\r\nhundred years than to be deprived in eternity of the smallest reward for the\r\nsmallest suffering; for this has an end, but the other is without end.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, sweet and dear Lord, how like a sweet harp are these\r\nwords to a suffering mortal! Lord, Lord, wouldst Thou but cheer me thus and\r\ncome to visit me in my sufferings, I should be glad to suffer; it would then\r\nbe better for me to suffer than not to suffer.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Now, then, hearken to the sweet music of the distended\r\nstrings of that Divine harp--a God-suffering man--how richly it sounds, how\r\nsweetly it vibrates. Before the world, suffering is a reproach, but before\r\nMe it is an infinite honour. Suffering is an extinguisher of My wrath, and\r\nan obtainer of My favour. Suffering makes a man in My sight worthy of love,\r\nfor the sufferer is like Me. Suffering is a hidden treasure which no one can\r\nmake good; and though a man might kneel before Me a hundred years to beg a\r\nfriendly suffering, he nevertheless would not earn it. Suffering changes an\r\nearthly man into a heavenly man. Suffering brings with it the estrangement\r\nof the world, but confers, instead, My intimate familiarity. It lessens\r\ndelight and increases grace. He to whom I am to show Myself a friend, must\r\nbe wholly disclaimed and abandoned by the world. Suffering is the surest\r\nway, the nearest way, and the shortest way. He who rightly knows how\r\nprofitable suffering is, ought to receive it as a gift worthy of God. Oh,\r\nhow many a man there is who once was a child of eternal death, and plunged\r\nin the profoundest sleep, whom suffering has wakened up and encouraged to a\r\ngood life. How many a wild beast, how many an untamed bird, there is in\r\nhuman form, whom constant suffering has shut up, as it were, in a cage, who,\r\nif any one were to leave him time and place free, would do his best to\r\nescape from his salvation. Suffering is a safeguard against grievous falls;\r\nit makes a man know himself, rely on himself, and have faith in his\r\nneighbour. Suffering keeps the soul humble and teaches patience. It is the\r\nguardian of purity, and confers the crown of eternal salvation. There is\r\nprobably no man living but who derives good from suffering, whether he be in\r\na state of sin, or on the eve of conversion, or in the fruition of grace, or\r\non the summit of perfection; for it purges the soul as fire purges iron and\r\npurifies gold; it adorns the wrought jewel. Suffering takes away sin,\r\nlessens the fire of purgatory, expels temptation, consumes imperfections,\r\nand renovates the spirit. It imparts true confidence, a clear conscience,\r\nand constant loftiness of mind. Know that it is a healthy beverage, and a\r\nwholesome herb above all the herbs of paradise. It chastises the body which,\r\nat any rate, must rot away, but it nourishes the noble soul which shall\r\nendure for ever. Behold, the noble soul blooms by suffering even as the\r\nbeautiful rose by the fresh dews of May! Suffering makes a wise mind and an\r\nexperienced man. A man who has not suffered what does he know? Suffering is\r\naffection's rod, a paternal blow given to My elect. Suffering draws and\r\nforces men to God, whether they like it or not. He who is always cheerful in\r\nsuffering, has for his servants joy and sorrow, friend and foe. How often\r\nhast thou not thrust an iron bit between the gnashing teeth of thy enemies,\r\nand rendered them, with thy joyous praise, and thy meekness in suffering,\r\npowerless? Sooner would I create suffering out of nothing than leave my\r\nfriends unprovided with it; for in suffering, every virtue is preserved, man\r\nadorned, his neighbour reformed, and God praised. Patience in suffering is a\r\nliving sacrifice, it is a sweet smell of balsam before My divine face, it is\r\nan appealing wonder before the entire host of heaven. Never was a skillful\r\nknight in a tournament so gazed at as a man who suffers well is gazed at by\r\nall the heavenly court. All the saints are on the side of the suffering man;\r\nfor, indeed, they have all partaken of it before him, and they call out to\r\nhim with one voice that it contains no poison, but is a wholesome beverage.\r\nPatience in suffering is superior to raising the dead, or the performing of\r\nother miracles. It is a narrow way which leads direct to the gates of\r\nheaven. Suffering makes us companions of the martyrs, it carries honour with\r\nit, and leads to victory against every foe. Suffering clothes the soul in\r\ngarments of rose colour, and in the brightness of purple; in suffering she\r\nwears the garland of red roses, and carries the sceptre of green palms.\r\nSuffering is for her as a shining ruby in a young maiden's necklace. Adorned\r\nwith it, she sings with a sweet voice and a free heart a new song which not\r\nall the angelic choirs could ever sing, because they never knew suffering.\r\nAnd, to be short, those who suffer are called the poor before the world, but\r\nbefore Me they are called the blessed, for they are My elect.\r\nThe Servant.--Oh, how plainly does it appear that Thou art the Eternal\r\nWisdom, since Thou canst bring the truth home with such cogency that no one\r\ndoubts it any longer. No wonder that he, to whom Thou dost make suffering\r\nappear so lovely, can bear sufferings. Lord, in consequence of Thy words,\r\nall sufferings in future must be easier and full of joy for me. Lord, my\r\ntrue Father, behold, I kneel before Thee this day, and praise Thee fervently\r\nfor my present sufferings, and also for the measureless sufferings of the\r\npast, which I deemed so very great, because they appeared so hostile to me.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--But what is thy opinion now?\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, my opinion in very truth is this: that when I look\r\nat Thee, Thou delight of my eyes, with looks of love, the great and violent\r\nsufferings with which, in so paternal a manner, Thou hast disciplined me,\r\nand at the sight of which Thy pious friends were filled with such terror on\r\nmy account, have been like a sweet fall of dew in May.\r\n(Now, when the same preacher had begun to write on suffering, there\r\nappeared to him, in the way already mentioned above, the same two persons\r\nthat were in sorrow and trouble, sitting before him, and one of them prayed\r\nhim to play on the harp to her. This he took amiss, and answered that it\r\nwould be an unpriestly thing. Then he was told that it would not be\r\nunpriestly, and presently there entered a youth who prepared a harp, and\r\nwhen he had turned it, he spun the two threads crosswise over the strings,\r\nand gave it into the hands of the brother, and then the brother began to\r\nwrite on suffering)."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER XIV.

Oh, what a sure path is the way of Thy\r\nPassion, along the way of truth, up to the very pinnacle of all perfection.\r\nAll hail to thee, glorious St Paul! thou noble light among all the stars of\r\nheaven, who was wrapt up so high and initiated so deeply into the mysteries\r\nof the Godhead, when thou didst hear the deep words which it is not given to\r\nman to utter, and who yet wast so sweetly touched in thy heart by this very\r\npassion of infinite love, above everything else, that thou didst exclaim: \"I\r\ndetermined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and Him\r\ncrucified.\"[6] Blessed be thou, too, among all doctors, sweet St. Bernard,\r\nwhose soul was so illuminated with the brightness of the eternal Word that\r\nmost sweetly did thy tongue exhale from a full heart the passion of His\r\nhumility, when thy fervent soul thus spoke: The green bunch of myrrh of my\r\nLord's bitter Passion have I fondly taken betwixt my breasts, and tenderly\r\npressed to my heart; I do not ask, like the bride, where He rests at noon\r\nwhom I embrace in the midst of my heart: I do not ask where He feeds His\r\nflock at noon, whom my soul so longingly beholds on the cross; that is\r\ncertainly loftier, but this is sweeter and easier to attain. From this\r\nlove-o'erflowing Passion, I take what fully makes up for the insufficiency\r\nof my own small merits; herein lies my complete justification; to meditate\r\non this Passion, I call eternal wisdom, the perfection of all knowledge, the\r\nriches of all salvation, an entire satisfaction of all desert; it casts me\r\ndown in prosperity, it raises me up in adversity, it keeps me in an even\r\nbalance between this world's weal and woe, and guards me against all evil in\r\ncomplete security. Sometimes I have drunk out of it a draught of salutary\r\nbitterness, but at other times I have also drunk out of it a draught of\r\nspiritual consolation and divine sweetness.[7] O sweet St. Bernard,\r\ntherefore is it but just that thy tongue should overflow with sweetness,\r\nsince thy heart was so wholly sweetened with sweet suffering. O Eternal\r\nWisdom, in this, I observe that, whoever is desirous of great reward and\r\neverlasting salvation, of high knowledge and deep wisdom, of standing erect\r\nin joy and sorrow, of possessing full security against all evil, whoever\r\nwishes to drink a draught of Thy bitter Passion, and Thy singular sweetness,\r\nmust carry Thee at all times, O crucified Jesus, before the eyes of his\r\nheart.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Thou dost not rightly know what good is lodged in it.\r\nBehold, assiduous meditation on My Passion makes out of a simple man a\r\nmaster of high knowledge; truly it is a living book in which everything is\r\nto be found. How right blessed is that man who has it ever before his eyes\r\nand studies it! What wisdom, grace, consolation, sweetness, what cleansing\r\nfrom all imperfection, may not such a man obtain through the devout\r\ncontemplation of My living presence! Respecting which, listen to what\r\nfollows. It fell out many years ago, that a certain preacher in the\r\nbeginning of his conversion had a bitter affliction of inordinate\r\ndespondency, which, at times, so overpowered him that no heart which had not\r\nexperienced it could conceive it. And, as he once sat after meat in his\r\ncell, his affliction was so great that he could neither study nor pray, nor\r\nperform any other good deed, except sitting there so sadly in his cell, and\r\nlaying his hands in his lap, as though he meant only to take care of the\r\ncell, for God's sake, because he was no longer of any use in spiritual\r\nthings. And, as he thus sat disconsolate, it suddenly seemed to him as\r\nthough he heard these words distinctly addressed to him: Why dost thou sit\r\nhere? Arise and betake thee to My sorrowful Passion, for then wilt thou\r\novercome thy own sorrow. And immediately he arose, for the words were the\r\nsame to him as though they came from heaven, and he began to meditate on the\r\nsorrowful Passion of the Lord, in which all his own sorrow was lost, so that\r\nhe never felt it again in the same manner.\r\nThe Servant.--O my sweet Wisdom, Thou understandest all hearts, and\r\nknowest that, above all things, I desire to have my heart penetrated with\r\nThy Passion, in the face of all men, and my eyes turned day and night into\r\nrunning fountains of bitter tears. Alas! there is just now in my soul a\r\nbitter complaint, that Thy Passion does not at all times thoroughly\r\npenetrate my heart, and that I do not meditate on it so affectionately as in\r\nreason I ought to do, and as is worthy of Thee, my Lord elect; teach me,\r\ntherefore, how I ought to comport myself!\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The meditation on My torments must not be made by\r\ngoing through them in a hasty manner, when one has time and opportunity, but\r\nit must be made by going through them with heartfelt love and a\r\ncompassionate searching into their mysteries; for, otherwise, the heart\r\nremains as unaffected by devotion, as the mouth by unchewed sweet-tasting\r\nfood. If thou hast no liking to meditate on My Passion with weeping eyes,\r\nbecause of the bitter agony I suffered, then oughtest thou to meditate on it\r\nwith a laughing heart, because of the joyous benefit thou wilt find in it.\r\nBut if thou hast no mind either to laugh or to cry, thou oughtest to\r\nmeditate on it in the dryness of thy heart, to My honour and praise, by\r\ndoing which thou wilt have done no less than if thou hadst been dissolved in\r\ntears or steeped in sweetness; for then thou actest from love of virtue,\r\nwithout regard to thyself. And that thou mayest take it all the more to\r\nheart, listen to what follows. Such is My severe justice that it permits no\r\nwrong deed in all nature, be it great or small, to pass without atonement\r\nand without being made good. Now, how should a great sinner, who has perhaps\r\ncommitted more than a hundred mortal sins, and for every mortal sin\r\nsubjected himself, by the law of My Church, to do penance seven years long,\r\nor else to complete his upperformed penance in the furnace of grim\r\npurgatory--how should such a miserable soul fulfill her penance? When would\r\nthere be an end to her sighs and tears? Oh, how long, how much too long,\r\nwould it not appear to her! Behold, she has speedily made all good by means\r\nof My innocent, meritorious Passion! with reason, then, let her grasp the\r\ntreasure of My acquired merits, and apply it to herself, in virtue of which,\r\neven if she ought to burn a thousand years in Purgatory, she will be able,\r\nin a short time, to discharge her guilt and penance, so as to attain heaven\r\nwithout any purgatory at all.\r\nThe Servant.--O tender and Eternal Wisdom, teach me this in Thy\r\ngoodness; how glad should I be to make such a grasp!\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The way to make such a grasp is this. Let a man often\r\nand seriously weigh with a penitent heart the greatness and multitude of his\r\nevil deeds, by which he has so wantonly incensed the eyes of his Heavenly\r\nFather; in the next place, let him account as nothing the works of his own\r\nsatisfaction, since, reckoned against his sins, they are but as a little\r\ndrop in the deep ocean; and then, let him confidently weigh the immeasurable\r\ngreatness of My satisfaction; for the least drop of My precious Blood, which\r\neverywhere flowed without measure out of My body, would alone suffice to\r\natone for the sins of a thousand worlds. Every man, therefore, appropriates\r\nso much of My satisfaction to himself, in proportion as he assimilates\r\nhimself to Me by sympathetic participation in My sufferings. Moreover let a\r\nman humbly and modestly merge the smallness of his works in the greatness of\r\nMy satisfaction or atonement. And to tell it thee in a few words, know then,\r\nthat all the masters of numbers and measures would be unable to calculate\r\nthe immeasurable benefit which lies hidden in the zealous meditation of My\r\nPassion."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER XV.

Or how didst\r\nThou bear Thyself in Thy sufferings towards Thy sorrowing Mother?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Oh, listen now to a woeful thing, and let it sink into\r\nthy heart. When, as thou hast heard, I hung suspended in mortal anguish\r\nbefore them, behold, they stood over against Me, and, with their voices,\r\ncalled out scoffingly to Me, wagging their heads contemptuously, and\r\nscorning Me utterly in their hearts, as though I had been a loathsome worm.\r\nBut I was firm amidst it all, and prayed fervently for them to My heavenly\r\nFather; behold, I, the innocent Lamb, was likened to the guilty thieves; by\r\none of these was I reviled, but by the other invoked. I listened to his\r\nprayer and forgave him all his evil deeds. I opened to him the celestial\r\nparadise. Hearken to a lamentable thing. I gazed around Me and found Myself\r\nutterly abandoned by all mankind, and those very friends who had followed\r\nMe, stood now afar off; yea, My beloved disciples had all fled from Me. Thus\r\nwas I left naked, and stripped of all My clothes. I had lost all power Andes\r\nwithout victory. They treated Me without pity, but I bore Myself like a meek\r\nand silent lamb. On whichever side I turned I was encompassed by bitter\r\ndistress of heart. Below Me stood My sorrowful Mother, who suffered in the\r\nbottom of her motherly heart all that I suffered in My body. My tender heart\r\nwas, in consequence, deeply touched, because I alone knew the depth of her\r\ngreat sorrow, and beheld her distressful gestures and heard her lamentable\r\nwords. I consoled her very tenderly at My mortal departure, and commended\r\nher to the filial care of My beloved disciple, and gave the disciple in\r\ncharge to her maternal fidelity.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, gentle Lord, who can here refrain from sighing\r\ninwardly, and weeping bitterly?

Tender God, oh, that Thy servant had but been\r\nthere to represent all mankind! Oh, that I had stood up there for my Lord,\r\nor else had gone to bitter death with my only Love; or, had they not chosen\r\nto kill me with my only Love, that I yet might have embraced, with the arms\r\nof my heart, in sorrow and desolation, the hard stone socket of the cross,\r\nand, when it burst asunder for very pity, that my wretched heart, too, might\r\nhave burst with the desire to follow my Beloved.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--It was by Me from all eternity ordained, that when My\r\nhour was come, I alone should drink the cup of My bitter Passion for all\r\nmankind. But thou, and all those who desire to imitate Me, deny yourselves,\r\nand take up, each of you, your own cross, and follow Me. For this dying to\r\nyourselves is as agreeable to Me as though you had actually gone with Me to\r\nbitter death itself.\r\nThe Servant.--Gentle Lord, teach me then, how I should die with Thee,\r\nand what my own cross is. For, truly, Lord, since Thou hast died for me, I\r\nought not to live any more for myself.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--When thou dost strive to do thy best as well as thou\r\ndost understand it, and for so doing, dost earn scornful words and\r\ncontemptuous gestures from thy fellow men, and they so utterly despise thee\r\nin their hearts that they regard thee as unable, nay, as afraid, to revenge\r\nthyself, and still thou continuest not only firm and unshaken in thy\r\nconduct, but dost lovingly pray for thy revilers to thy heavenly Father, and\r\ndost sincerely excuse them before Him; lo! as often as thou diest thus to\r\nthyself for love of Me, so often is My own death freshly renewed and made to\r\nbloom again in thee. When thou dost keep thyself pure and innocent and still\r\nthy good works are so misrepresented, that with the joyful consent of thy\r\nown heart thou art reckoned as one of the wicked, and that from the bottom\r\nof thy heart thou art as ready to forgive all the injury thou hast received\r\nas though it never had happened, and, moreover, to be useful to and assist\r\nthy persecutors by word and deed, in imitation of My forgiveness of My\r\ncrucifiers, then truly art thou crucified with thy Beloved. When thou dost\r\nrenounce the love of all mankind, and all comfort and advantage, so far as\r\nthy absolute necessities will allow, the forsaken state in which thou dost\r\nthen stand, forsaken by all earthly love, fills up the place of all those\r\nwho forsook Me when My hour was come. When thou dost stand, for My sake, so\r\ndisengaged from all thy friends in those things by means of which they are\r\nan impediment between Me and thee, even as though thy friends did not belong\r\nto thee, then art thou to Me a dear disciple and brother, standing at the\r\nfoot of My cross, and helping Me to support My sufferings.

When, in every adversity which may befall thee from\r\nthy neighbour, thou art oppressed for the love of Me, and dost endure the\r\nfurious wrath of all men from whichever side its blast come, how fiercely\r\nsoever it come, and whether thou be right or wrong, as meekly as a silent\r\nlamb, so that, in virtue o' thy meek heart, and sweet words, and gentle\r\nlooks, thou disarmest the malice of the hearts of thy enemies; behold even\r\nthis is the true image of My death accomplished in thee. Yes, wherever I\r\nfind this likeness, what delight and satisfaction have I not then, and My\r\nheavenly Father also, in man.

O ye exalted spirits, ye pure souls,\r\nstand forth, extol and praise, commend and exult in the ravishing paradise\r\nof all delight, the sublime Queen! for I am not worthy to do so, unless in\r\nher goodness she vouchsafe to allow me. O thou chosen bosom friend of God,\r\nthou fair golden crown of Eternal Wisdom, permit me, a poor sinner, even me\r\nin my weakness, to speak to thee a little in confidence. With a trembling\r\nheart, with a countenance of shame, with dejected eyes, my soul falls down\r\nbefore thee. O thou mother of all graces, methinks neither my soul nor any\r\nother sinful soul requires permission or a passport to repair to thee. Art\r\nthou not the immediate mediatrix of all sinners? The more sinful a soul is,\r\nthe more reasonable it seems to her that she should have free access to\r\nthee; the deeper she is in wickedness, the more reason she has to press\r\nforwards to thee. Therefore, my soul, step joyfully forth! If thy great\r\ncrimes drive thee away, her unfathomable goodness invites thee to draw near.\r\nO, therefore, thou only consolation of all sinful hearts, thou only refuge\r\nof guilty mortals, to whom so many a wet eye, so many a wounded, miserable\r\nheart is raised up, be a gracious mediatrix and channel of reconciliation\r\nbetween me and the Eternal Wisdom. O think, think, thou mild Queen elect,\r\nthat thou derivest all thy merits from us poor sinners. What was it made\r\nthee God's mother, made thee a casket in which the Eternal Wisdom reposed? O\r\nLady, it was the sins of us poor mortals! How couldst thou becalled a mother\r\nof graces and compassion, except through our wretchedness, which has need of\r\ngrace and compassion. Our poverty has made thee rich, our crimes have\r\nennobled thee above all pure creatures. O turn hither then the eyes of thy\r\ncompassion, which thy gentle heart never turned from a sinner, from a\r\nforlorn mortal! Take me under thy protection, for my consolation and\r\nconfidence are in thee. How many a guilty soul, after having bid farewell to\r\nGod and all the heavenly host, by denying God and despairing of Him, and\r\nbeing lamentably separated from Him, has, by still clinging to thee, been\r\nsweetly detained, till at length, through thy intercession, it has again\r\nattained to grace. Who is the sinner, how great soever his crimes, to whom\r\nthy overflowing goodness has denied assistance? Lo, when my soul seriously\r\nreflects within herself, methinks it were only right, if it were possible,\r\nthat while my eyes wept for joy, my heart should leap out of my mouth; so\r\ndoes thy name dissolve in my mouth like honey from the comb. Even thou art\r\ncalled the mother, the Queen of Compassion, yes, tender mother, yes, gentle\r\nmother of compassion! O what a name! O how unfathomable is the being whose\r\nname is so rich in grace! Did ever the melody of song resound as soothingly\r\nin an agitated heart as thy pure name in our penitent hearts? At this\r\nexalted name all heads in reason ought to incline, all knees to bend. How\r\noften hast thou not put to flight the hostile powers of wicked spirits, how\r\noften hast thou not allayed the angry justice of the severe judge! How often\r\nhast thou not obtained from Him grace and consolation! Yes, poor sinful\r\nmortals as we are, what have we to say to it? How shall we ever acknowledge\r\nsuch great goodness? If all angelic tongues, all pure spirits and souls, if\r\nheaven and earth and all that is contained in them cannot properly praise\r\nher merits, her ravishing beauty, her graciousness and immeasurable dignity,\r\nalas! what shall we sinful hearts be able to do? Let us do our best, and\r\nexpress to her our acknowledgements, our thanks; for indeed her great\r\nkindness does not look at the smallness of the gift, it looks at the purity\r\nof intention. ah, sweet Queen, with what justice may not thy sex rejoice in\r\nthy sweet name; for cursed was the first Eve that she ever eat of the bitter\r\nfruit of the tree of knowledge; blessed be the second Eve that she brought\r\nus again the sweet fruit of heaven! Let no one lament over Paradise; one\r\nparadise we lost, and have won two others. For is she not a paradise in whom\r\ngrew the fruit of the living tree? in whom all delight and joy are contained\r\ntogether? And is not that also a paradise above every paradise in whom the\r\ndead again live, if they only taste His fruit from whose hands,feet, and\r\nside the living fountains which irrigate all the earth flow,[9] the\r\nfountains of inexhaustible mercy, fathomless wisdom, overflowing sweetness,\r\nardent love, the fountains of eternal life? Truly, Lord, whoever tastes of\r\nthis fruit, whoever has drunk of this fountain, knows that these two gardens\r\nof paradise far surpass the earthly paradise. But thou, O Queen elect, art\r\nthe gate of all grace, the door of compassion, that never yet was shut.\r\nHeaven and earth may pass away, ere thou wilt permit anyone who earnestly\r\nseeks thy assistance to depart from thee without obtaining it. Behold, for\r\nthis very reason art thou the first object my soul sees when I awake, the\r\nlast when I lie down to sleep. How should anything which thy pure hands\r\npresent before God and commend unto Him, how small soever in itself, be\r\nrejected? Take, O take, therefore, the smallness of my works and present it,\r\nso that, in thy hands it may appear something before the eyes of God\r\nAlmighty. Even thou art the pure vessel of red gold, melted down with\r\ngraces, inlaid with precious emeralds, and sapphires, and all virtues, whose\r\nsingle aspect, in the sight of the heavenly King, surpasses that of all\r\nother creatures. O, thou lovely divine spouse elect, if King Ahasuerus was\r\ncaptivated by the beauty of Esther, if she was found pleasing in his eyes\r\nabove all women, if she found favour above them all, so that he did for her\r\nwhatever she desired, O thou, all red roses and lilies, surpassing beauty,\r\nhow justly may the King of Heaven be captivated by thy spotless purity, thy\r\nmeek humility, by the sweet smelling nosegay of all thy virtues and graces!\r\nOr, who has ever caught the wild and noble unicorn, if not thou?[10] How\r\ninfinitely pleasing, above all mortals, in His eyes is thy delicate and\r\nlove-inspiring beauty, before which all other beauty fades like a glow-worm\r\nbefore the brightness of the sun. What overflowing grace hast thou not found\r\nbefore Him for thyself and us mortals who are without grace! How should, how\r\ncan, then, the Heavenly King deny thee anything? Truly mayest thou say, My\r\nBeloved is mine, and I am His. Ah! thou art God's, and God is thine, and ye\r\ntwo have an eternal and unfathomable reciprocation of love which no duality\r\ncan divide. Think of us poor needy ones, who continue to wander so\r\nwretchedly in sorrowful affliction. Yes, exalted Lady of heaven and earth,\r\narise now and be to us a mediatrix, and an obtainer of grace with thy tender\r\nChild, the Eternal Wisdom. Ah, Eternal Wisdom, wilt Thou deny me anything?\r\nEven as I present Thee before Thy heavenly Father, so do I present Thy pure\r\ntender mother before Thee. Look at her mild eyes which so often looked\r\nkindly on Thee; behold Those fair cheeks which she so often affectionately\r\npressed to Thy infant face. O look at her sweet mouth which used to kiss\r\nThee so fondly and tenderly again and again. Look at her pure hands which so\r\noften ministered to Thee. O Thou goodness above all goodness, how canst thou\r\ndeny anything to her who suckled Thee so affectionately and bore Thee in her\r\narms; who laid Thee to rest, wakened Thee and tenderly reared Thee! O Lord,\r\nlet me remind Thee of all the love Thou ever didst experience from her in\r\nThy childhood's days, when Thou didst sit in her motherly lap, and with Thy\r\nplayful eyes didst laugh so pleasantly and tenderly in her face with that\r\nfathomless love Thou hadst for her above all other creatures! Think, too, of\r\nthe heart-rending woe which her maternal heart endured with Thee under the\r\ngibbet of Thy miserable cross, where she saw Thee in the agony of death, and\r\nwhen her heart and soul so often died away in sorrow and distress with Thee.\r\nLord, I entreat Thee, for her sake, to grant me every means of shaking off\r\nmy sins, of acquiring Thy grace, and never losing it again."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER XVII.

Pure Lady and noble\r\nQueen of Heaven and Earth, touch my stony heart with one of thy scalding\r\ntears, one of those which thou didst shed in bitter distress for thy tender\r\nChild under the wretched cross, so that my heart of stone may be softened,\r\nand may hearken to thee; for heart-rending grief is of such a nature, that\r\nno one can have a true knowledge of it, except him whom it touches. Touch\r\nthen my heart, O Lady Elect, with thy sorrowful words, and tell me in short\r\nsignificant terms, simply as an admonition, how it was with thee in thy\r\nmind, and how thou didst support thyself at the foot of the cross, when thou\r\ndidst behold thy tender Child, the beautiful and tender Wisdom, so\r\nlamentably expire.\r\nAnswer.--Thou shouldst hearken to it with sorrow and heartfelt woe; for\r\nalthough I am now exempt from suffering, yet, at that time I was not. Before\r\nI had reached the foot of the cross, I had endured many a great unspeakable\r\nanguish of heart, especially at the spot where I first caught sight of the\r\nbeating, kicking, and ill-usage of my Child, on beholding which my strength\r\nforsook me, and thus helpless was I carried after my dear Son to the foot of\r\nthe cross. But, in respect of what thou askest, how I felt in my mind, and\r\nhow I supported myself, listen to as much as it is possible for thee to\r\nknow; for the whole no heart that ever was made can fathom. Understand,\r\nthen, that all the sorrow that ever could afflict a heart would only be as a\r\ndrop in the ocean compared to the unfathomable sorrow which my maternal\r\nheart at that time endured; and, understand, at the same time, that the\r\ndearer, the sweeter, the more precious the beloved one is, the more\r\ninsupportable is his loss and death. Now, where on the whole earth was there\r\never a more tender one born, a lovelier one seen than my own best beloved\r\none, Jesus Christ, by whom and in whom I had entire possession of all that\r\nthe world could bestow? I was already dead to myself, and lived only in Him,\r\nand when at last my own fair love was slain, then only did I utterly die;\r\nand, as my only love was but one, and, moreover, dear to me above all other\r\nloves, so my only sorrow was but one, and a sorrow above all sorrows that\r\never were expressed. His fair and gentle humanity was, to me, a delightful\r\nspectacle; His dignified divinity was, to my eyes, a sweet contemplation; to\r\nthink of Him was my heart's delight; to speak of Him was my pastime; to hear\r\nHis sweet words was music to my soul. He was my heart's mirror, my soul's\r\ncomfort; heaven and earth, and all that is in them, I possessed in His sweet\r\npresence. Lo, when I saw my love suspended in mortal agony before me, alas,\r\nthe sight! Alas, what a moment was that! How died my heart within me! How\r\nwas my courage extinguished! How did my strength fail me! I looked up, but I\r\ncould not help my child. I looked down, and saw only those who so cruelly\r\nill-used Him. O how narrow then to me was all this world! I had lost all\r\nheart; my voice had died from me; I had, moreover, lost all strength and\r\nyet, when I came to myself, I raised thy feeble voice, and spoke to my\r\nChild, complaining, such words as these: Alas, my Child! Alas, thou Child of\r\nmine! Alas, my heart's delightful mirror, in which I have so often taken\r\ndelight to behold myself, how do I now see Thee miserably suspended before\r\nme! Alas, thou treasure above all this world! My mother, my father, and all\r\nthat my heart can express (such art Thou to me), take me with Thee! Or, to\r\nwhom wilt Thou leave Thy wretched mother? Oh, who will permit me to die for\r\nThee, to suffer for Thee this bitter death? Oh, misery and distress of a\r\nlove-torn mother, how am I robbed of all joy, of all love, of all\r\nconsolation! Oh, thou greedy death, why sparest thou me? Take, take away the\r\npoor mother with her poor Child; to her, to live is bitterer than to die!\r\nHim, even Him, whom my soul loveth, I see dying! And as I thus lifted up my\r\nvoice in lamentation, behold, my Child consoled me very affectionately, and,\r\namong other things, said: That in no other way might mankind be redeemed,\r\nand that on the third day He intended to rise again and appear to me and His\r\ndisciples; and He said further: Woman, cease thy weeping; weep no more, my\r\nfair mother, I will not forsake thee for ever! And while my Child thus\r\ntenderly consoled me, and commended me to the disciple whom He loved, and\r\nwho also stood by, full of sorrow (those words of His were conveyed to my\r\nheart in a tone so lamentable, and so broken by sighs, that they pierced\r\nthrough my heart and soul like a sharp sword), even the hard hearts of the\r\nJews were moved to compassion for me. I cast up my arms and my hands, and,\r\nin the anguish of my heart, would gladly have embraced my beloved, yet this\r\nI might not do. And then I sank down, overwhelmed by my heart-rending grief,\r\nat the foot of the cross and became speechless; and when I returned to\r\nmyself, and could do nothing else, I kissed the blood that trickled down\r\nfrom His wounds, so that my pale cheeks and mouth were all tinged with\r\nblood.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, Thou unfathomable goodness, what infinite torture,\r\nwhat infinite misery is this! Whither shall I turn, or to whom shall I cast\r\nmy eyes? If I look up at the beautiful Wisdom, I only see woe and distress,\r\nat which my heart is like to sink within me. They cry out and shout against\r\nHim outwardly, the agony of death struggles with Him inwardly, all His veins\r\nare on the rack, all His blood gushes away, it is nothing but ejaculations\r\nof woe, and cheerless dying without recovery. Then, if I but turn my eyes to\r\nHis pure Mother, I see her tender heart pierced, alas! with wounds as though\r\na thousand blades had transfixed it. I see her pure soul lacerated by woe.\r\nNever were such gestures of misery and longing seen as hers; deprived was\r\nher sick body of all strength, her fair countenance besmeared with mortified\r\nblood. Oh, great misery above all misery! The torture of His heart consists\r\nin the affliction of His sorrowing Mother; the torture of His sorrowing\r\nMother consists in the innocent death of her beloved Son, more painful to\r\nher than her own death. He beholds her and consoles her tenderly; she\r\nstretches out her hands to Him, and would gladly die instead of Him. Alas!\r\nwhich of the two feels here the most bitterly? Whose is the greater\r\ndistress? To both it is so unfathomable that there never was any equal to\r\nit. Alas! the motherly heart. Alas! the tender womanly mind. How was thy\r\nmaternal heart ever able to support this infinite sorrow? Blessed be that\r\nheart compared to whose sorrow everything that ever was uttered of a heart's\r\nsorrow is only as a dream to the reality. Blessed be Thou, O rising blush of\r\nmorning, above all creatures! And blessed be the flower-enamelled\r\nrose-scented meadow of Thy fair countenance, adorned with the ruby red blood\r\nof Eternal Wisdom! Alas! Thou affable countenance of beautiful wisdom, how\r\ndost Thou fade in death! Alas! Thou beautiful body, how dost Thou hang\r\nsuspended! Woe is me, Thou pure blood, how hotly dost Thou run down on Thy\r\npure Mother who bore Thee! Lament, ye mothers, lament with me over this\r\naffliction! All ye pure hearts, let this rose-coloured, pure blood which so\r\nbe sprinkles your pure Mother, go to your hearts! Behold, all hearts, ye who\r\never had sorrow, behold and see, if ever there was sorrow like unto this\r\nsorrow! Truly, it is a wonder that our hearts melt not here for pity and\r\ncompassion; so great, indeed, was this distress, that hard stones were rent\r\nasunder, the earth trembled, the sun was extinguished, because they would\r\nfain show compassion for their Creator!"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER XVIII.

Or, when did Thy sufferings come to an end?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Now, hearken to a misery of miseries, such as thou\r\nnever yet didst hear of. Although My soul, according to her highest powers,\r\nwas at that time wrapt in the vision and enjoyment of the pure divinity,\r\nnoble as, in truth, she is, behold, the lower powers of My exterior and\r\ninterior nature were yet wholly abandoned to themselves, even to the very\r\nlast drop of infinite bitterness of suffering, without any consolation, so\r\nthat no torment was ever equal to it. And as I was thus left entirely\r\nhelpless and forsaken, with running wounds, with weeping eyes, with extended\r\narms, with the veins of My body on the rack, in the agony of death, then it\r\nwas that I lifted up My voice in lamentation, and cried out miserably to My\r\nFather: My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? And still in all this, My\r\nwill was united in eternal conformity with His will. And when all My blood\r\nwas poured out, and all My strength exhausted, behold, I was seized by a\r\nbitter thirst, because of My mortal agony. But I thirsted still more for the\r\nsalvation of man. Then did they reach Me vinegar and gall to quench the\r\nburning thirst of My parched mouth. And when I had accomplished the work of\r\nhuman redemption, I cried out: It is finished! I was entirely obedient to My\r\nFather, even unto death. My Spirit I commended into His hands, saying: Into\r\nThy hands I commend My Spirit. And then My noble Soul separated from My\r\nbody, both of which yet remained unseparated from the divinity! After this a\r\nsharp spear was thrust into My right side; forthwith a stream of precious\r\nblood gushed out, and with it a fountain of living water.

Alas! noble Lord, how\r\nardently didst Thou love me, how generously didst Thou redeem me!

If I had Samson's strength, Absalom's beauty,\r\nSolomon's wisdom, and the riches and greatness of all kings, my only wish\r\nwould be to devote them to Thy praise and service. But, Lord, I am nothing,\r\nand therefore can do nothing. O Lord, how am I to thank Thee?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--If thou hadst the tongues of all the angels, the good\r\nworks of all mankind, and the powers of all created beings, thou yet couldst\r\nnot thank Me, nor requite Me, for the least pang which I suffered for the\r\nlove of thee.\r\nThe Servant.--Tender Lord, inform and teach me, then, how I may become\r\npleasing to Thee by means of Thy grace, since no one is able to make Thee a\r\nreturn for the tokens of Thy love.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Thou shouldst often set My sorrowful cross before thy\r\neyes, and let My bitter torments penetrate to thy heart, and shape thy own\r\nsufferings after them. If I allow thee to pine and wither in disconsolate\r\naffliction and dryness, without any sweetness, thou shouldst not seek after\r\nstrange consolation. Let thy cry of misery rise to thy heavenly Father with\r\na renunciation of thyself and all thy desires, according to His Fatherly\r\nwill. The bitter thy suffering is from without, and the more resigned thou\r\nart from within, the more like art thou to Me, and the more dear to My\r\nheavenly Father, for herein the most pious are put to the strongest proof.\r\nWhat though thy desires may have a thirsty craving to seek satisfaction and\r\ndelight in something that might be pleasant to them, yet shouldst thou\r\nforego it for My sake, and thus will thy thirsty mouth be steeped with me in\r\nbitterness. Thou shouldst thirst after the salvation of men. Thy good works\r\nthou shouldst direct to a perfect life, and persevere to the end.

Alas, pure and\r\ntender Mother, let me remind thee today of thy miserable separation; think\r\nof thy bitter separating from thy tender Child, and help me that I may not\r\nbe separated either from thee or from His joyous countenance.\r\nYes, pure Mother, even as my soul now stands by thee with compassionate\r\nsympathy, and embraces thee with ardent desire, and, in contemplation with\r\nheartfelt desire, with thanksgiving and praise, leads thee from the sepuchre\r\nthrough the gate of Jerusalem back again to thy house, so do I crave that,\r\nat my last departure, my soul may be again led by thee, O pure and tender\r\nMother, to its Fatherland, and there be confirmed in everlasting bliss.\r\nAmen."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                           THE SECOND PART\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER XXI.

Therefore, do I desire\r\nfrom the very bottom of my heart that Thou, the Eternal Wisdom, wouldst\r\nteach me still more. Lord, what is that which belongs, above all things, to\r\na servant of Eternal Wisdom, who is desirous to live for Thee alone? Lord, I\r\nshould like to hear about the union of pure reason with the Holy Trinity,\r\nwhen, in the true reflection of the eternal birth of the Word, and in the\r\nregeneration of her own Spirit, reason is ravished from herself and stands\r\nface to face with God.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Let not him ask about what is highest in doctrine, who\r\nstill stands on what is lowest in a good life. I will teach thee what will\r\nprofit thee more.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, what wilt Thou teach me?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--I will teach thee to die and will teach thee to live.\r\nI will teach thee to receive Me lovingly, and will teach thee to praise Me\r\nlovingly. Behold, this is what properly belongs to thee.\r\nThe Servant.--Eternal Wisdom, if I had the power to fulfill my wishes,\r\nI know not whether, in this temporal state, I ought to wish anything else,\r\nas to doctrine, than how to die to myself and all the world, how to live\r\nwholly for Thee, to cherish Thy love with all my heart, to receive Thee\r\nlovingly, and to praise Thee lovingly. O God, how blessed is that man who is\r\nable to do this, and who consumes in it his whole life. But, Lord, dost Thou\r\nmean a spiritual dying or a bodily dying?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--I mean both one and the other.\r\nThe Servant.--What need have I, Lord, of being taught to die bodily?\r\nSurely it teaches itself when it comes.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--He who puts his teaching off till then, will find it\r\ntoo late.\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, it is still somewhat bitter for me to hear about\r\ndeath.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Behold, even this is the source of those unprovided\r\nand terrible deaths whereof the towns and convents now are full. Behold,\r\ndeath has often bridled thee secretly, and had fain ridden thee from hence,\r\nin the same way as he does the countless multitude, one of whom I will now\r\nshow thee. Open, therefore, thy interior sense, and see and listen; see what\r\ngrim death is like in the person of thy neighbour, do but mark the\r\nlamentable voice thou wilt hear.\r\nThe Servant heard with his understanding the voice of an unprepared\r\ndying man cry aloud and speak as follows: The sorrows of death have\r\nsurrounded me.[11] Woe is me, Thou God of Heaven, that ever I was born into\r\nthe world. The beginning of my life was with crying and weeping, and now my\r\ndeparture from it is also with bitter crying and weeping. Alas, the sorrows\r\nof death have surrounded me, the pains of hell have encompassed me! O death,\r\nO furious death, what an unwelcome guest thou art to my young and joyous\r\nheart! How little was I prepared for thy coming! Thou hast attacked me from\r\nbehind, thou hast run me down. Thou leadest me away in thy chains like one\r\nthat leads a condemned man bound and fettered to the place where he is to be\r\nslain. I clasp my hands above my head, I wring them with anguish in each\r\nother, for gladly would I escape from him. I look around me into all the\r\nends of the earth to see if any one will give me advice or help, and it\r\ncannot be. Death I hear thus fatally speaking within me: Neither learning,\r\nnor money, nor friends can avail thee; thou art mine by right. Alas, and\r\nmust it be so? O God, and must I then depart from hence? Is a last\r\nseparation really at hand? Woe is me that ever I was born! O death, what art\r\nthou going to do with me?\r\nThe Servant.--Dear man, why dost thou take it so hard? This is the\r\ncommon lot of rich and poor, young and old. Many more have died in their\r\nyouth than in their old age. Or wouldst thou, perhaps, alone escape death?\r\nThis would prove a great want of understanding in thee.\r\nThe unprepared dying man.--O Lord, what bitter consolation is this! I\r\nam not without understanding. Those are without understanding who have not\r\nlived for Him, and who are not frightened at death. Such persons are blind;\r\nthey die like cattle; they know not what they have before them. I do not\r\ncomplain that I must die; I complain that I must die unprepared. I do not\r\nmerely lament the end of my life, I lament and weep over the delightful days\r\nwhich are so utterly lost and vanished without any profit. For truly I am\r\nlike an untimely and rejected abortion, like a blossom torn off in May. My\r\ndays have sped swifter than an arrow from the bow. I am forgotten as though\r\nI had never been, like a track which a bird makes through the air, which\r\ncloses behind it and is unknown to all men. Therefore are my words so full\r\nof bitterness, therefore is my speech so full of woe! Oh, who will enable me\r\nto be as I once was, to have again those pleasant times before me, and to\r\nknow then what I know now! When those times were mine I did not rightly\r\nestimate them; I, foolish man, let them pass swiftly away; now are they\r\nvanished from me; I cannot recall them, I cannot overtake them. No hour so\r\nshort but I ought to have valued it more preciously and thankfully than a\r\npoor man about to receive a kingdom as a gift. Lo, this is why my eyes shed\r\nsalt tears, because they cannot restore what I have lost. Woe is me, O God;\r\nthat I should have feasted so many day away, and that it profits me now so\r\nlittle. Why did not I learn to die all the time? O ye blooming roses, that\r\nhave still your days before you, look at me and learn wisdom; turn your\r\nyouth to God, and with Him alone occupy your time, so that what has happened\r\nto me may not happen to you. Ah, me! how have I consumed my youth! No one\r\nwould I believe; my wayward spirit would listen to no one. Alas, now am I\r\nfallen into the snare of bitter death! My days have vanished, my youth has\r\nsped. Better were it for me had my mother's womb become my grave than that I\r\nshould so have squandered away my time.\r\nThe Servant.--Be converted to God; repent of thy sins; if thy end be\r\nwell, then will all be well.\r\nUnprepared dying man.--Alas, what do I hear? How shall I do penance?\r\nSeest thou not how terrified I am, how exceeding great is my distress? Even\r\nas a little bird caught in the claws of a cruel falcon, and become senseless\r\nin the agony of dying, I am unconscious of everything except that I would\r\ngladly escape and cannot. Death and the bitterness of separation oppress me.\r\nAlas, the repentance and free conversion of him who is capable of right\r\ndoing, what a sure thing you are! He who puts you off will hardly fail of\r\nbeing himself put off. O long protraction of my amendment, how much too\r\nprotracted hast thou not proved! My good intentions without works, my good\r\npromises without performance, have ruined me. I have said to God, Tomorrow\r\nand tomorrow, till I am fallen into the night of death. O Thou Almighty God,\r\nis it not a misery above all miseries, ought it not deeply to afflict me,\r\nthat I should thus have lost the whole of my life, my thirty, my forty\r\nyears? I know not that I ever spent a day wholly according to God's will, or\r\nthat I ever rendered to God, as in reason I ought to have done, a truly\r\nacceptable service. Oh, how the thought cuts me to the heart! O God, how\r\nwretchedly shall I not stand before Thee and the whole heavenly host! Lo,\r\nnow I am departing hence; and now, even at this hour, a single Pater Noster,\r\nuttered with devotion, would rejoice me more than if anyone were to put into\r\nmy hands a thousand pounds of gold. Ah, my God, what have I not eternally\r\nneglected, what evil have I not inflicted on myself in not having seen this\r\nwhile it was in my power! What hours upon hours have escaped me! How have I\r\nallowed myself to be led wrong by small things in the great affair of my\r\nsalvation! It would now be more agreeable to me, and would procure me more\r\neternal reward if, from divine love, I had foregone the pleasure I took at\r\nthe sight of a friend, when such pleasure was contrary to God's will, than\r\nif that friend were to demand a reward for me from God thirty years long on\r\nhis knees. Hear, hear, all men, a lamentable thing: I go begging round and\r\nround, because my time is short, and beg a small alms out of the merits of\r\ngood people as an expiation for myself, and it is refused me; for they are\r\nall afraid lest they should want oil in their lamps. Alas, Thou God of\r\nHeaven, let this move Thy compassion, that with my healthy body I could have\r\nearned such great reward and wealth on so many a day when I went about idle,\r\nand that now this small alms, begged only as an expiation, not as a reward,\r\nfor which, moreover, I should stand indebted, no one will give me. Oh, let\r\nthis, ye old and young, go to your hearts, and hoard up in the good season\r\nwhile ye can, so that ye may not become beggars, and be denied in an hour\r\nlike this.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas, my dear friend, thy distress rends my very heart.\r\nBy the living God, I conjure thee, give me some advice so that I may not\r\ncome into trouble.\r\nThe unprepared dying man.--The best advice I can give thee, the\r\ngreatest wisdom and prudence on earth, is this: That thou prepare thyself by\r\na full confession of and an abstinence from all those things with which thou\r\nknowest thyself to be infected, and that thou hold thyself at all times\r\nready, as though thou shouldst have to depart hence in a day, or at latest\r\nin a week. Imagine now, in thy heart, that thy soul is in Purgatory, and\r\ndoomed to remain there ten years for her evil deeds, and that this year\r\nalone is granted thee to help her in. Look at her very often, see how\r\nwoefully she calls out to thee and speaks to thee: O thou my best beloved\r\nfriend, reach me thy hand, have pity on me, and help me to pray that I may\r\nspeedily come out of this raging fire of Purgatory, for I am so miserable,\r\nthat there is nobody, except thee alone, to help me ;with charitable works.\r\nI am forgotten by all the world, because every one is busy about himself.\r\nThe Servant.--This were a choice doctrine for whoever might actually\r\nfeel it like Thee in their hearts. But though Thy words are so piercing, yet\r\ndo people sit here and give little heed to them; they have ears and hear\r\nnot; they have eyes and see not; no one will really die before his soul\r\ndeparts out of him.\r\nThe unprepared dying man.--Wherefore, when at last they are caught on\r\nthe hook of death, and cry aloud in woeful distress and cruel pain, they are\r\nnot heard. Lo, even as among a hundred persons who wear the appearance of\r\nholiness (of others I will say nothing), not one pays attention to my words,\r\nthat he may be converted and reform his life, so is it come to that pass\r\nthat among a hundred, not one but falls into the snare of death unprepared;\r\nas also certainly happens to those who die suddenly, or in an unconscious\r\nstate; for the comforts of the body, perishable love, and the greedy\r\npursuits of sustenance, blind the multitude. But if thou wouldst be\r\ndelivered from this miserable and unprovided death, then follow my advice.\r\nBehold, diligent meditation on death, and faithful assistance given to thy\r\npoor soul, who appeals so piteously to Thee, will advance thee so far that\r\nthou wilt not only be without fear, but more, thou wilt expect death with\r\nall the ardour of thy heart. Think of me every day, and write down my words\r\nin the bottom of thy heart. In my bitter distress see what thy future lot\r\nwill be; look what a night this is. Oh, happy the man, that ever he was\r\nborn, who arrives well prepared at this hour, for his passage will be a good\r\none, however bitter his death; behold the bright angels will guard him, the\r\nsaints escort him, the celestial court receive him; his final marching forth\r\nwill be a glorious entry into his everlasting fatherland. But me, alas!\r\nwhere will my soul lodge this very night in that strange, mysterious\r\ncountry? Oh, my soul, how art thou utterly forsaken! O God, how very\r\nmiserable she will be among all miserable souls! Who is there that will help\r\nher with entire fidelity? And now let me put an end to my sad complaints;\r\nfor my hour is come. I see now that it cannot be otherwise. My hands begin\r\nto grow cold, my face to turn livid, my eyes to lose their sight. Alas, the\r\nshocks of furious death wrestle with my poor heart. I begin to fetch my\r\nbreath very hard. The light of this world begins to vanish from me. I begin\r\nto see into the next world. O God, my God, what a sight! The horrible forms\r\nof black Moors assemble together; the wild beasts of hell surround me. They\r\ngloat over my poor soul to see if it will be theirs. O Thou just judge of\r\nthe severe judgment seat, how very heavy in Thy scales are those things\r\nwhich in ours are so light! The cold sweat of death bursts, from very\r\nanxiety, through my flesh. Oh, the wrathful aspect of the severe judge, how\r\nvery sharp Thy judgments are! Now let me turn in spirit to that world where\r\nI am led by the hand into Purgatory, and where, in the land of torments, I\r\nsee anguish and distress. O God, I see the wild, hot flames dart up on high,\r\nand meet over the heads of suffering souls. They wander up and down amid the\r\ndark flames, and great is their affliction. What heart would like to\r\ncontemplate our pangs, the bitterness of our woe? Many a sad cry is heard.\r\nHelp! help! ah, where is all the help of our false friends? Where are the\r\nfair promises of our false friends? How have they deserted us, how have they\r\nutterly forgotten us? Oh, have pity on us, some little pity; at least you\r\nour best beloved friends! What services have we not rendered you, and how\r\nare we now repaid. Oh that we should not have warded off these sufferings\r\nwhen we could have done so with things so trifling! Is not the least torment\r\nhere greater, much greater, indeed, than any torment ever was on earth? One\r\nhour in Purgatory lasts a hundred years. Lo! now we boil, now we burn, now\r\nwe shriek aloud for help; but, more than all it is our misfortune to be\r\ndeprived so long of the joy of His countenance; this it is that cuts through\r\nthe heart, the sense, the soul!--And thus I expire.\r\nThe Servant.--O Eternal Wisdom, how hast Thou forsaken me! O God, how\r\nhas death all at once become present before me! Alas, thou soul of mine, art\r\nthou still in my body? Lord of Heaven, do I still live? Ah, Lord, now will I\r\npraise Thee, and vow reformation to Thee till death. Oh, how very terrified\r\nI am! I did not think death was so near me. Truly, Lord, this sight shall\r\nnot fail to profit me; every day I will be on the watch for death, and will\r\nlook about me that he take me not by surprise. I will learn how to die; I\r\nwill turn my thoughts to yonder world. Lord, I see that there is no\r\nremaining here; Lord, in sooth, I will not save up my sorrow and repentance\r\ntill death. Oh, how terrified I am at this spectacle, I marvel that my soul\r\nis still in my body! Begone, begone, from me, soft reclining, long sleeping,\r\ngood eating and drinking, perishable honours, delicateness and luxury! If\r\nbut a little suffering here is so painful to me, how shall I ever endure\r\nimmeasurable agony? O God, it indeed I were now to die thus, how would it be\r\nwith me? What a load have I not still upon me! Lord, this very day I will\r\nset a poor man[12] to pray for my poor soul, and since all her friends have\r\nforsaken her I will befriend her.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--See; this shouldst thou diligently look to whilst thou\r\nart in thy youth, and whilst thou hast still time to make things better. But\r\nwhen, in truth, thou hast reached this hour, and thou canst not make things\r\nbetter, then shouldst thou look at nothing on earth, except My death and My\r\ninfinite mercy; so that Thy trust may repose wholly in Me.\r\nThe Servant.-- O Lord, I prostrate myself at Thy feet, and I beseech\r\nThee with bitter tears to chastise me here as Thou wilt, only keep it not in\r\nstore for me in the next world. Woe is me, Lord, the fire of Purgatory and\r\nits unspeakable torments, how could I ever be so foolish as to think lightly\r\nof them, and how do I now stand in such great fear of them!\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Be of good heart, this thy fear is the beginning of\r\nwisdom, and a path to salvation. Or hast thou forgotten how all the\r\nScriptures declare what great salvation is contained in the fear and\r\ndiligent contemplation of death? Thou shouldst always praise God, for not to\r\none in a thousand has it been granted to know Him, as to thee. Listen to a\r\nlamentable thing: they hear it spoken of; they know of it beforehand, and\r\nyet they allow it to pass by, and heed it not till they be swallowed up by\r\nit, and then they howl and weep when it is too late. Open thy eyes, count\r\nupon thy fingers, see how many of them have died around thee in thy own\r\ntimes; talk with them a little in thy heart; join thy old man to them as\r\nthough it were dead; question them together; see with what fathomless sighs,\r\nwith what bitter tears they will say: Oh, blessed is he that ever he was\r\nborn, who follows sweet counsel and, in the misfortunes of others, learns\r\nwisdom! Prepare thyself well for thy departure hence; for truly thou sittest\r\nas a bird on the bough, and art as a man who stands on the water's edge, and\r\nlooks at the swift sailing ship in which he will presently take his seat,\r\nand sail away for a strange land whence he will never more return.\r\nTherefore, so regulate thy life that when the ship comes for thee thou\r\nmayest be ready, and mayest joyfully take thy departure hence."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"    CHAPTER XXII.

And as to other exercises, such as poverty, fasting, watching, and\r\nevery other castigation, bend them all to this as to their end, and use just\r\nso much and so many of them as may advance thee to it.

And if ever thou losest sight of it, let it be to thee\r\nas if thy eternal salvation were taken away from thee; and do thou speedily\r\nturn to it again, so that thou mayest again obtain possession of it; and\r\nthen must thou look carefully to thyself, for, if it escape from thee, thou\r\nart like a sailor from whose grasp the oars in a strong swell have slipped,\r\nand who does not know whither he shall direct his course. But if thou mayest\r\nnot as yet have a constant abiding place in divine contemplation, let the\r\nperpetually repeated collecting of thy wandering thoughts, and the assiduous\r\nwithdrawing of thyself to engage in it, procure thee constancy so far as it\r\nis possible. Listen, listen, My child, to the faithful instructions of thy\r\nfaithful Father. O give heed to them! Shut them up in the bottom of thy\r\nheart; think Who it is that teaches thee all this, and how very much in\r\nearnest He is. Dost thou wish to become ever more and more faithful? Then\r\nset My precepts before thy eyes. Wherever thou sittest, standest, or\r\nwalkest, think that I am present to thee, and that I either admonish or\r\nconverse with thee. O, My child, keep within thyself keep thyself pure,\r\ndisengaged, and retired.

And this would be my question: Lord, Thou hast so entirely poured out\r\nthe abyss of Thy divine love in Thy Passion, that I wonder if Thou canst\r\nshow any more signs of Thy love?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Yes. Even as the stars of heaven are countless, so the\r\nlove-tokens of My unfathomable love are uncounted.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, sweet Love of mine! ah, tender Lord elect! how my\r\nsoul languishes for Thy love! Turn Thy mild countenance towards me, outcast\r\ncreature that I am; see how everything vanishes and passes away in me except\r\nonly the one treasure of Thy ardent love, and therefore tell me something\r\nfurther of this rich and hidden treasure. Lord, Thou knowest well that it is\r\nlove's right never to be satisfied with what concerns the Beloved; that the\r\nmore it has the more it desires, how unworthy soever it may acknowledge\r\nitself to be, for such is the effect of the omnipotent power of love. O,\r\nbeautiful Wisdom, now tell me the greatest and dearest mark of Thy love that\r\nin Thy adopted human nature Thou didst ever manifest, without taking into\r\naccount the unfathomable love-token of Thy bitter death.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Answer Me now a question. What is that of all lovely\r\nthings which is most agreeable to a loving heart?\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, to my understanding nothing is so agreeable to a\r\nloving heart as the beloved Himself and His sweet presence.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Even so. See, and on this account, that nothing which\r\nbelongs to true love might be wanting to those who love Me, did My\r\nunfathomable love, as soon as I had resolved to depart by death out of this\r\nworld to My Father, compel Me to give Myself and My loving presence at the\r\ntable of the last supper to My dear disciples, and in all future times to My\r\nelect, because I knew beforehand the misery which many a languishing heart\r\nwould suffer for My sake.\r\nThe Servant.--Oh, dearest Lord, and art Thou Thyself, Thy very Self,\r\nreally here?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Thou hast Me in the sacrament, before thee and with\r\nthee, as truly and really God and Man, according to soul and body, with\r\nflesh and blood, as truly as My pure Mother carried Me in her arms, and as\r\ntruly as I am in heaven in My perfect glory.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, gentle Wisdom, there is yet something in My heart,\r\nmay I be allowed to utter it to Thee? Lord, it does not proceed from\r\nunbelief, I believe that what Thou willest Thou canst do; but, tender Lord,\r\nit is a marvel to me (if I may venture to say so) how the beautiful, the\r\ndelightful and glorified body of my Lord in all its greatness, in all its\r\ndivinity, can thus essentially conceal itself under the little shape of the\r\nbread which, relatively considered, is so out of all relation. Gentle Lord,\r\nbe nor angry with me on this account, for, as Thou art my Wisdom elect, I\r\nshould be glad by Thy favour to hear something on this head out of Thy sweet\r\nmouth.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--In what manner My glorified body and My soul,\r\naccording to the whole truth, are in the Sacrament, this can no tongue\r\nexpress, nor any mind conceive, for it is a work of My omnipotence.\r\nTherefore oughtest thou to believe it in all simplicity, and not pry much\r\ninto it. And yet I must say a little to thee about it. I will thrust this\r\nwonder aside for thee with another wonder. Tell Me how it can be in nature\r\nthat a great house should shape itself in a small mirror, or in every\r\nfragment of a mirror, when the mirror is broken? Or, how can this be, that\r\nthe vast heavens should compress themselves into so small a space as thy\r\nsmall eye, the two being so very unequal to each other in greatness?\r\nThe Servant.--Truly, Lord, I cannot tell, it is a strange thing, for my\r\neye is to the heavens but as a small point.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Behold, though neither thy eye nor anything else in\r\nnature is equal to the heavens, yet nature can do this thing, why should not\r\nI, the Lord of nature, be able to do many more things above nature? But now,\r\ntell me further, is it not just as great a miracle to create heaven and\r\nearth, and all creatures out of nothing, as to change bread invisibly into\r\nMy body?\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, it is just as possible for Thee, so far as I can\r\nunderstand, to change something into something, as to create something out\r\nof nothing.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Dost thou wonder then at that, and not at this? Tell\r\nMe further, thou believest that I fed five thousand persons with five\r\nloaves, where was the hidden matter which obeyed My words?\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, I know not.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Or dost thou believe thou hast a soul?\r\nThe Servant.--This I do not believe, because I know it, for otherwise I\r\nshould not be alive.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--And yet thou canst not see thy soul with thy bodily\r\neyes.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, I know that there are many more beings invisible to\r\nhuman eyes than such as we can see.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Now listen: many a person there is of senses so gross\r\nas hardly to believe that anything which he cannot perceive with his senses\r\nreally exists, concerning which the learned know that it is false. In like\r\nmanner does the human understanding stand related to divine knowledge. Had I\r\nasked thee how the portals of the abyss are constructed, or how the waters\r\nin the firmament are held together, thou wouldst perhaps have answered thus:\r\nIt is a question too deep for me, I cannot go into it: I never descended\r\ninto the abyss, nor ever mounted up to the firmament. Well, I have only\r\nasked thee about earthly things which thou seest and hearest, and\r\nunderstandest not. Why shouldst thou wish, then, to understand what\r\nsurpasses all the earth, all the heavens, and all the senses? Or why wilt\r\nthou needs inquire into it? Behold, all such wondering and prying thoughts\r\nproceed alone from grossness of sense, which takes divine and supernatural\r\nthings after the likeness of things earthly and natural, and such is not the\r\ncase. If a woman were to give birth to a child in a dark tower, and it were\r\nto be brought up there, and its mother were to tell it of the sun and the\r\nstars, the child would marvel greatly, and would think it all against reason\r\nand incredible, which its mother, nevertheless, knows so well to be true.\r\nThe Servant.--Indeed, Lord, I have nothing more to say, for Thou hast\r\nso enlightened my faith that I ought to think of marvelling in my heart\r\nagain, or why should I seek to enquire into the highest, who cannot\r\ncomprehend the lowest? Thou art the truth which cannot lie; Thou art the\r\nhighest wisdom that can do all things; Thou art the omnipotent who can\r\ndispose of all things. Oh, noble and loving Lord, I have often desired in my\r\nheart that, like holy Simeon in the temple, I might have received Thee\r\nbodily in my arms, might have pressed Thee to my heart and soul, so that the\r\nspiritual kiss of Thy presence might have been as truly mine as it was his.\r\nBut now, Lord, I see that I receive Thee as truly as he, and so much the\r\nmore nobly as Thy tender body is now glorified, and impassible, which then\r\nwas passible. Wherefore, dearest Lord, if my heart had the love of all\r\nhearts, my conscience the purity of all the angels, and my soul the beauty\r\nof all souls so that by Thy grace I should be worthy of Thee, I would fain\r\nreceive Thee today so affectionately, and so bury and sink Thee in the\r\nbottom of my heart and soul, that neither joy nor sorrow, neither life nor\r\ndeath, could separate Thee from me. Ah, sweet Lord, hadst Thou, my chosen\r\nlove, only sent me Thy messenger, I should not have known, for all this\r\nworld, how I ought to offer him a sufficient welcome. How then ought I to\r\nbehave myself towards Him whom my soul loveth? Truly art Thou the only one\r\nthing in which everything is included, that, in time and eternity, my heart\r\ncan desire. Or is there any thing else that my soul can desire of that which\r\nis contrary to Thee, or which is without Thee, for that would be repugnant\r\nto me. Truly art Thou the comeliest of all to the eyes, the sweetest of all\r\nto the mouth, the tenderest of all to the touch, the most beloved of all to\r\nthe heart! Lord, my soul neither sees nor hears, nor feels aught of all that\r\nis here below, but she finds it severally a thousand times lovelier in Thee\r\nmy chosen love. Ah, Eternal Lord, how am I to restrain myself in Thy regard\r\nfrom wonder and delight? Thy presence inflames me, but Thy greatness\r\nterrifies me. My reason will needs do honour to its Lord, but my heart\r\ndesires to love its only good, and lovingly to embrace it. Thou art my Lord\r\nand my God, but Thou art also my Brother, and, if I may venture to say so,\r\nmy beloved Spouse. Oh, what love, what rapture, and what great joy, what\r\ndignity do I not possess in Thee alone! Ah, sweet Lord, methinks that had I\r\nonly been vouchsafed the grace to receive out of Thy open wounds, from Thy\r\nheart, one single drop of blood into my mouth, if I could have had my\r\ndesire, it would have given me the fullness of joy. Ah, heartfelt,\r\ninconceivable wonder, now I have not only received one or two drops, but I\r\nhave received all Thy hot, rose-coloured blood through my mouth into my\r\nheart and soul. Is not this a great thing? Ought I not to appreciate this\r\nwhich to the exalted angels is precious? Lord, would that all my limbs, and\r\nall that I am, were transformed into an unfathomable love for the sake of\r\nthis sign of Thy love. Lord, what is there else in all this world that could\r\nrejoice my heart, or that it could desire, when Thou givest Thyself thus\r\ncordially to me to enjoy and love! Truly is it called a SACRAMENT OF LOVE.\r\nWhen was there anything lovelier seen or heard of than to embrace love\r\nitself; than to be changed by grace into love itself? Lord, I see no\r\ndifference except that Simeon received Thee visibly, and I receive Thee\r\ninvisibly. But as little as my bodily eyes can see Thy true humanity, just\r\nas little could his bodily eyes contemplate Thy divinity, except through\r\nfaith, as I do now. Lord, what new power is lodged in this bodily sight? He\r\nwhose spiritual eyes are opened, has not much to see with his bodily eyes,\r\nfor the eyes of the spirit see far more really and truly. Lord, I know by\r\nfaith, so far as one can know it, that I have Thee here; what do I wish for\r\nmore? Lord, it is a thousand times better for me that I am unable to see\r\nThee; how could I ever have the heart thus visibly to partake of Thee! As it\r\nis, that which is lovely and delightful remains, while that which is inhuman\r\nfalls away. Lord, when I truly reflect how inscrutably well, how lovingly\r\nand wisely Thou hast regulated all things, my heart with a loud voice,\r\nexclaims: Oh, the great treasure of the abyss of Divine Wisdom, what must\r\nThou not be in Thyself, if Thou art so much in Thy fair emanations! Now, O\r\nglorious Lord, look at the great and sincere desire of my heart. Lord, never\r\nwas king or emperor so worthily received, never dear strange guest so\r\ncordially embraced, never bride so beautifully and tenderly taken home, nor\r\nso honourably maintained, as my soul desires to receive Thee, my most\r\nhonoured emperor, my soul's most lovely Bridegroom, this day, and to\r\nintroduce Thee to the innermost and the very best that my heart and soul are\r\nable to afford, and to offer it Thee as worthily as ever it was offered Thee\r\nby any creature. Wherefore, Lord, teach me how I should behave myself\r\ntowards Thee, how, with due honour and love, I should receive Thee.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Thou shouldst receive Me worthily, thou shouldst\r\npartake of Me with humility, thou shouldst keep Me earnestly, thou shouldst\r\nembrace Me with conjugal love, and have Me in My godly dignity before thy\r\neyes. Spiritual hunger and actual devotion must impel thee to Me more than\r\ncustom. The soul that wishes to feel Me interiorly in the recesses of a\r\nsecluded life, and sweetly to enjoy Me, must, first of all, be cleansed from\r\nsin, must be adorned with virtue, encircled with self-denial, decked out\r\nwith the red roses of ardent love, strewn over with the fair violets of\r\nhumble submission, and the white lilies of perfect purity. She should pray\r\nto Me with peace of heart, for in peace is My dwelling-place. She should\r\nclasp Me in her arms to the exclusion of all strange affections; for these I\r\navoid, and flee as the free bird avoids and flees the cage. She should sing\r\nMe the song of Sion, which is a song of fervent, loving, and measureless\r\npraise; then will I embrace her, and she shall incline herself on My breast.\r\nThere, if she finds a calm repose, a pure vision, unusual fruition, a\r\nforetaste of eternal bliss, let her preserve it, let her keep it for\r\nherself, and, with a sighing heart, let her speak as follows: Truly art thou\r\nthe hidden God, the secret good which no one can know that has not felt it.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas, the great blindness in which I have hitherto lived!\r\nI have plucked the red roses and have not smelt them; I have wandered among\r\nthe blooming flowers and have not seen them; I have been as a dry branch\r\namid the fresh dews of May. Never, O never can I sufficiently repent Thy\r\nhaving been for many a day so near me, and my having been so far from Thee.\r\nO, Thou sweet guest of pure souls, what a sorry welcome have I hitherto\r\ngiven Thee, what an ill return have I so frequently made Thee! How little\r\ndesirous have I not shown myself of the sweet bread of angels! I had the\r\nprecious balsam in my mouth, and felt it not. Ah, Thou delight of all\r\nangelic eyes, never as yet did I feel true delight in Thee! If it were\r\nannounced to me that a bodily friend would visit me in the morning should I\r\nnot rejoice at it all the night before? And yet, never did I prepare myself\r\nfor the reception of Thee, as in reason I ought, Thou worthy guest, whom\r\nheaven and earth equally honour. Alas! how have I been wont to turn quickly\r\naway from Thee, how to drive Thee out of Thy own! O Eternal God, Thou even\r\nThou Thyself, art here so truly present, and the angelic host is here, and\r\nyet I have approached so shyly and sluggishly. Of Thee I will say nothing;\r\nbut, truly, Lord, I know of no spot within many miles, whither, if I had\r\nknown for certain of the presence of blessed angels, those high and noble\r\nguests who at all times behold Thee, I should not have repaired of my own\r\naccord, and even if I had not seen them, still my heart, on their account,\r\nwould have leapt in my body for joy. O sweet Lord and God, that Thou\r\nThyself, the Lord of all angels, shouldst have been present here, and\r\nshouldst have had with Thee so many angelic choirs, and that I should not\r\nhave given more heed to the place; this, this must ever be a sore affliction\r\nfor me! I ought, at all events, to have approached the place where I knew\r\nThee to be thus present, even though nothing else might have come of it. O\r\nGod, how often have I stood distracted and without devotion on the very spot\r\nwhere Thou wast before me, and with me in the Blessed Sacrament; my body\r\nindeed stood there, but my heart was elsewhere. How often have I thought so\r\nlittle of Thee in Thy presence, that my heart has not even offered Thee an\r\naffectionate salutation, with a devout inclination. Gentle Lord, my eyes\r\nought to have looked at Thee with joyous delight, my heart ought to have\r\nloved Thee with the fullness of desire, my mouth ought to have praised Thee\r\nwith heartfelt, fervent jubilee; all my strength ought to have melted in Thy\r\nglad service. What did not Thy servant David do who leapt so joyously with\r\nall his might before the ark, in which there was nothing but corporal bread\r\nof heaven, nothing but corporal things! Lord, now do I stand here before\r\nThee, and before all Thy angels, and with bitter tears fall at Thy feet.\r\nRemember, O, remember, tender Lord, that here, before me, Thou art my flesh\r\nand my brother, and forego Thy displeasure. O, forgive me all the dishonour\r\nthat ever I offered Thee, for I am sorry for it, and must ever be sorry for\r\nit; for the light of Thy wisdom begins only now to enlighten me; and the\r\nplace where Thou art, not only according to Thy divinity, but according to\r\nThy humanity, shall be honoured by me evermore. Ah, Thou sweetest good, Thou\r\nworthy Lord and lovely guest of my soul, another question would I gladly\r\nask: Tell me, gentle Lord, what is it Thou givest Thy beloved with Thy real\r\npresence in the Sacrament, provided she receives Thee with love and desire?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Is that a fitting question for a lover? What have I\r\nbetter than Myself? He who possesses the object of his love, what else has\r\nhe to ask for? He who gives himself, what has he refused? I give Myself to\r\nthee, and take thee from thyself, and unite thee to Me. Thou loseth thyself,\r\nand art wholly transformed into Me. What does the sun in his brightest\r\nreflection bestow on the unclouded sky? Yes, what does the bright star of\r\nthe morning dawn bestow on the dark night? Or what do the fair and ravishing\r\nadornments of summer bestow after the cold, wintry, melancholy season?\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, they bestow precious gifts.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--They seem precious to thee because they are visible to\r\nthee. Behold, the smallest gift that flows from Me in the Blessed Sacrament\r\nreflects more splendour in eternity than any sunny brightness; it sheds more\r\nlight than any morning star; it adorns thee more ravishingly in eternal\r\nbeauty than ever did any adornment of summer the earth. Or is not My bright\r\ndivinity more radiant than any sun, My noble soul more resplendent than any\r\nstar, My glorified body more ravishing than any ravishment of summer? And\r\nyet all these things hast thou truly received here.\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, why then are they not more sensibly felt? Lord, I\r\noften approach in such dryness that all light, all grace and sweetness are\r\nas strange to me, methinks, as to a man born blind, who never saw the sun.\r\nLord, if I may venture to say so, I could indeed wish that, in Thy real\r\npresence, Thou hadst given testimony of Thyself.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The less the testimony, the purer thy faith and the\r\ngreater thy reward. The Lord of nature operates with such secrecy a blessed\r\nincrease in many a fair tree, that no eye nor other sense can perceive it\r\ntill it is accomplished. Now, I am not an exteriorly working good, but an\r\ninteriorly shining light; an interiorly working good which is so much the\r\nnobler as it is the more spiritual.\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! how few men there are who perceive this, who weigh\r\nthoroughly what they receive. They draw near like the rest generally, in an\r\nill and inconsiderate manner, and, therefore, as they go up empty, they come\r\naway without grace. They do not ruminate their food so as to ponder what\r\nthey have received.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--To the well prepared I am the bread of eternal life,\r\nto the little prepared the bread of dryness, but to the unprepared I am a\r\ndeadly blow, an eternal curse.\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, what a terrible thing is this! Lord, whom dost\r\nThou call the well prepared, the little prepared, and the unprepared?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--The well prepared are the purified, the little\r\nprepared such as cleave to temporal things, but the unprepared are the\r\nsinful who continue by will and by deed in mortal sin.\r\nThe Servant.--But, tender Lord, if at the time a person is heartily\r\nsorry for his sins, and strives, to the best of his ability, to rid himself\r\nwholly of them, conformably to Christian precept, how is it then with him?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--In such a case a man is, for the time, no longer in\r\nsin.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, in my opinion, it were one of the greatest things\r\nthis world could accomplish, if any person, while living in this temporal\r\nstate, was able to prepare himself worthily enough for Thy reception.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--That person was never yet born; nay, if a man had the\r\nnative purity of all the angels, the sanctity of all the saints, and the\r\ngood works of all mankind, he would yet be unworthy.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, beloved Lord, with what trembling hearts ought not\r\npersons so unworthy, so deprived of grace, as we are, to approach Thee.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--If a man only does his best, nothing more is required\r\nof him, for God completes what is left incomplete. A sick man should cast\r\naside all reserve, and should approach the physician whose attendance is his\r\ncure.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, beloved Lord, which is better, OFTEN, or SELDOM, to\r\nreceive Thee in the Blessed Sacrament?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--For him whose grace and devotion perceptibly increase\r\nby it, to receive Me often is profitable.\r\nThe Servant.-- But, Lord, if a man in his own opinion remains the same,\r\nand cannot prove that he either increases or decreases by it in holiness, or\r\nif he is often visited by spiritual dryness, how should he then behave\r\nhimself?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--A man, provided only he does his part, should not\r\nwithdraw himself because of spiritual dryness. For the salvation of that\r\nsoul which by God's will suffers from spiritual dryness is often\r\naccomplished as nobly in the light of pure faith alone, as in great\r\nsweetness. I am a boon which, turned to account, increases, but which, saved\r\nup, wastes away. It is better to approach once a week with a deep sense of\r\nreal humility, than once a year with an overweening self-approbation.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, at what time does the influence of grace from the\r\nBlessed Sacrament take place?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--In the very moment of actual reception.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, but what if a man have a fervent desire for Thy\r\nbodily presence in the Sacrament, and he must yet be deprived of it?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Many a man after being filled with Me, goes away\r\nhungry, and many a man obtains Me, though the table be empty; the former\r\nmerely receives Me bodily, the latter enjoys Me spiritually.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, has that man any advantage who receives Thee bodily\r\nand spiritually, over him who only receives Thee spiritually?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Tell me whether that man has more who has Me and My\r\ngrace, or he who has only My grace alone?\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, how long dost Thou remain in Thy real presence with\r\na man who has received Thee?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--As long as the image and likeness of the Sacrament\r\nremain."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CHAPTER XXIV.

Who will grant me worthily to praise, in my day, the\r\nbeloved Lord whom my soul loveth? Ah, tender Lord, would that there issued\r\nfrom my heart as many sweet tones as ever have issued from sweet harpings,\r\nas many as there are leaves and blades of grass, would that they were all\r\naddressed on high to Thee in Thy heavenly court, so that a song of such a\r\ndelightful and unheard of praise might burst from my heart, as would be\r\npleasing to the eyes of my Lord, and full of joy to all the heavenly host!\r\nAh, beloved Lord, although I am not worthy to praise Thee, still my soul\r\ndesires that the heavens should praise Thee, when, in their ravishing beauty\r\nand sublime splendour they are lit up with the multitude of glittering\r\nstars; and the fair delightful meadow, when, in all the bliss of summer it\r\nglistens afresh in blithesome beauty, in manifold flowery adornment; and all\r\nthe sweet thoughts and fervent desires that ever a pure and affectionate\r\nheart conceived for Thee when it was encompassed by the refreshing summer\r\ndelights of Thy illuminating Spirit. Lord, when I but think of Thy high\r\npraise, my heart is ready to melt in my breast, my thoughts wander from me,\r\nspeech fails me, and all knowledge escapes me. Something shines in my heart\r\nbeyond the power of words, when I will needs praise Thee, O infinite Good;\r\nfor, if I take the fairest creatures, the most exalted spirits, the purest\r\nbeings, Thou yet surpassest them all unspeakably. If I enter the deep abyss\r\nof Thy goodness, there all praise disappears in its own littleness. Lord,\r\nwhen I behold living forms of beauty, creatures gentle and engaging, they\r\nsay to my heart: Oh, see how right gracious He is from whom we emanate, from\r\nwhom all that is beautiful has issued! If I traverse heaven and earth, the\r\nuniverse and the abyss, wood and grove, mountain and valley, lo! they one\r\nand all fill my ears with a rich canticle of Thy unfathomable praise. Then,\r\nwhen I mark with what infinite beauty and harmony Thou orderest all things,\r\nboth evil and good, I am dumb and speechless. But, Lord, when I remember\r\nthat Thou Thyself art this praiseworthy good which my soul has chosen out\r\nsolely for herself, as her one only and undivided love, my heart, for\r\npraise, is like to burst within me, and to cease its throbbings. Oh, tender\r\nLord, have regard, therefore, for the great and ardent desire of my heart\r\nand soul, and teach me how to praise Thee worthily, and how to serve Thee\r\nacceptably before I depart hence, for this is what my soul thirsts after in\r\nmy body.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Wouldst thou then gladly praise Me?\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! Lord, why dost Thou provoke me? Thou knowest all\r\nhearts, Thou knowest that my heart is ready to turn round in my body from\r\nthe true desire of Thy praise, which from my childhood's day till now I have\r\nhad.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Praise becometh the upright.[14]\r\nThe Servant.--Alas! my Lord all my uprightness lies in Thy boundless\r\ncompassion. Beloved Lord, the frogs praise Thee in the pool, and if they\r\ncannot speak, yet do they croak. Full well do I know who I am. Lord, I know\r\nthat rather than praise Thee, I ought to lament and beg pardon for my sins.\r\nAnd yet, O unfathomable good, scorn not the desire I have to praise Thee,\r\nmiserable worm that I am. Lord, though the cherubim and seraphim, and the\r\ncountless number of all exalted spirits, praise Thee according to their\r\nutmost powers, yet what can they do more as regards Thy infinite dignity,\r\nfar removed above all praise than the very least of Thy creatures? Lord,\r\nThou standest in need of no creature's praise; but Thy infinite goodness is\r\nmade all the more manifest the more Thou givest Thyself to the praise of\r\nthose who are without desert.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Whoever thinks he can praise Me to the fullness of My\r\nworth, acts like him who chases the wind and trys to grasp a shadow. And yet\r\nit is permitted to thee and all creatures to praise Me according to your\r\nability; for there never was a creature so little, nor so great, nor so\r\ngood, nor so wicked, neither will there be one, but it either praises Me or\r\ntestifies to My praise; and the more it is united with Me, the more\r\npraiseworthy it finds Me; and the more thy praise is like the praise of\r\neternal glory, the more praiseworthy it is to Me; and the more this praise\r\nof thine is abstracted in imagination from all creatures and united in true\r\ndevotion to Me, the more it is like the praise of eternal glory. A fervent\r\ncontemplating sounds better in My ears than merely a praising with words,\r\nand a heartfelt sighing sounds better than a lofty appeal. A total\r\nsubjection of one's self under God and all mankind, in the wish to be as\r\nnothing in their sight, is a sound for Me above all sweet sounds. I Myself\r\nnever appeared on earth so worthy of praise before My Father as when I hung\r\nin mortal agony on the cross. Some persons praise Me with fair words, but\r\ntheir hearts are far from Me, and of such praise I make no account. So\r\nlikewise, some persons praise Me when things go according to their desires,\r\nbut when things begin to go wrong with them, their praise ceases, and such\r\npraise is disagreeable to Me. But that praise is good and precious in My\r\ndivine eyes when, with thy heart, thy words and works, thou dost praise me\r\nas fervently in sorrow as in joy, in utter adversity as in full prosperity;\r\nfor then thou thinkest of Me and not of thyself.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, I desire not sufferings from Thee, neither will I\r\ngive cause for such things; but I will give myself up wholly and entirely,\r\naccording to the desire of my heart, to Thy eternal praise, whereas, before,\r\nI never could truly forsake and utterly forget myself. Lord, if Thou wert to\r\npermit me to become the most despised person the whole earth could produce,\r\nLord, even this I would suffer for the sake of Thy praise. Lord, I yield\r\nmyself up this day to Thy grace and mercy; nay, if I were to be accused of\r\nthe foulest murder that ever any man committed, so that whoever say me\r\nshould spit in my face, Lord, I would willingly bear it in praise of Thee,\r\nprovided I only stood guiltless in Thy sight. But even if I were guilty, I\r\nwould still endure it in praise of Thy blessed justice, which is a thousand\r\ntimes more precious to me than my own honour. For every term of reproach\r\ncast at me I would give Thee a particular praise, and with the good thief\r\nwould say to Thee: Lord, I receive the due reward of my deeds, but what hast\r\nThou done amiss? Lord, remember me, when Thou comest into Thy Kingdom! And\r\nshould it be Thy will to take me now from hence, if it were for Thy praise,\r\nI would not look about me for a respite, but I would desire to be taken\r\nhence; and I would desire that, if it should have been my lot to have become\r\nas old even as Mathusaia, every year of the long period, and every week of\r\nthe years, and every day of the weeks, and every hour of the days, and every\r\nminute of the hours, might praise Thee for me in such rapturous praise as\r\nnever did any saint in the veritable bright reflection of the saints, and\r\nthis as many times as the grains of dust are countless in the sunshine, and\r\nthat they might fulfill this my good desire, as though I myself had all the\r\ntime lived to fulfill it. Therefore, Lord, take me early or late to Thyself,\r\nfor such is my heart's desire. Lord, I will say still more, that, if I had\r\nnow to depart hence, and it were to Thy praise that I should burn fifty\r\nyears in purgatory, I am ready to incline myself at Thy feet, and gladly\r\naccept it all to Thy eternal praise; blessed be the fire of purgatory in\r\nwhich Thy praise is fulfilled in me! Lord, Thou, and not myself, art what I\r\nhere love and here seek. Lord, Thou comprehendest all things, Thou knowest\r\nall hearts, Thou knowest that these are my unshaken sentiments; nay, if I\r\nknew that I should have to lie for ever at the bottom of hell, however it\r\nmight afflict my heart to be robbed of Thy ravishing vision, I yet would not\r\ncease from Thy praise; and could I retrieve the lost time of all men, reform\r\ntheir misdeeds, and by means of praise and honour, make full amends for all\r\nthe dishonour that ever was shown Thee, I would willingly do it; and if it\r\nwere indeed possible, then, from the lowest abyss of hell must needs burst\r\nforth from me a beautiful song of praise which would penetrate hell, the\r\nearth, air, and all the heavens, till it arrived before Thy divine\r\ncountenance. But, if this were not possible, I would yet wish to praise Thee\r\nhere all the more, that I might even here rejoice in Thee all the more.\r\nLord, do with Thy poor creature what is for Thy praise; for let what will\r\nhappen to me, so long as there is any breath in my mouth I will utter Thy\r\npraise; and when I lose my utterance, I desire that the raising of my finger\r\nmay be a confirmation and conclusion of all the praise I ever spoke; nay,\r\nwhen my body falls to dust, I desire that, from every grain of dust, an\r\ninfinite praise may pierce through the hard stones, through all the heavens\r\nup to Thy divine presence, till the last day, when body and soul shall again\r\nunite in Thy praise.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--In this desire and good intention thou shouldst remain\r\ntill death--such praise is pleasing to Me.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, sweet Lord, since Thou deignest and desirest to\r\nreceive praise from me, poor sinful person that I am, it is my desire that\r\nThou wouldst show me three things, namely, how, wherewith, and at what time\r\nI ought to praise Thee. Tell me, dearest Lord, is the external praise which\r\nis given by words and singing, any way profitable?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--It is certainly profitable, and especially as it stirs\r\nup the interior man, which it very often stirs up, above all in the case of\r\nnewly converted persons.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, I also am filled with the desire (seeing that one\r\nshould be glad to begin in time, what one will have to practice in eternity)\r\nto attain the diligent praising of Thee in my interior, and that I should\r\nnot be interrupted in Thy praise at any time, even for the space of a\r\nsecond. Lord, out of this very desire I have often spoken as follows: \"O,\r\nthou firmament why dost thou hasten and revolve so fast? I beseech thee,\r\nstand still in this moment, until I shall have thoroughly praised my Lord\r\naccording to my heart's desire. Lord, when perchance I have been a little\r\nwhile neglectful of Thy present praise, and have shortly come to myself, I\r\nhave interiorly cried out as follows: O Lord, it is a thousand years that I\r\nhave thought no more of my Beloved! O Lord, teach me, then, as much as Thou\r\ncanst, while my soul is yet in my body, how I may attain to praise Thee\r\ncontinually and without relaxation.\r\nEternal Wisdom.--He who in all things is mindful of Me, who keeps\r\nhimself from sin, and is diligent in virtue, praises Me at all times; but\r\nstill, if thou wouldst seek after the highest sort of praise, listen to\r\nsomething more: The soul is like to a light peacock's feather; if nothing is\r\nattached to it, it is very easily borne aloft by its own mobility towards\r\nthe sky, but if it is laden with anything it falls to the ground. In like\r\nmanner, a mind that is purified from all heaviness of sin is also raised by\r\nvirtue of its native nobility, with the help of gentle contemplation, to\r\nheavenly things; and therefore, when it happens that a mind is disengaged\r\nfrom all bodily desires, and is set interiorly at rest, so that its every\r\nthought cleaves at all times inseparably to the immutable Good, such a mind\r\nfulfills My praise at all times; for in the state of purity, so far as words\r\ncan express it, man's carnal sense is so wholly drowned and so wholly\r\ntransformed from earthiness into a spiritual and an angelic semblance, that,\r\nwhatever he receives exteriorly, whatever he does or operates, whether he\r\neats, drinks, sleeps, or wakes is nothing else but the very purest praise.\r\nThe Servant.--Ah, Lord, what a truly sweet doctrine is this! Lovely\r\nWisdom, three things there are still that I should be glad to have\r\nexplained. One is: Where shall I find the most reasons to praise Thee?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--In the first origin of all good, and then in its\r\noutflowing springs.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, as to the origin, it is too high for me, too\r\nunknown to me; there let the tall cedars praise Thee, the heavenly spirits,\r\nthe angelic minds. And yet will I too press forward like a rude thistle with\r\nmy praise, that they may be admonished by the spectacle of my impotent\r\nlongings of their own high worthiness, that they may be incited in their\r\npure brightness to praise Thee, just as though the cuckoo were to give the\r\nnightingale occasion to sing a ravishing song. But the outflowings of Thy\r\ngoodness; these will be proper for my praise. Lord, when I ponder well what\r\nI was formerly, how often Thou hast protected me, from what evil chains and\r\nbonds Thou hast delivered me, O Thou Everlasting Good, it is a wonder that\r\nmy heart does not wholly melt in Thy praise! Lord, how long didst Thou not\r\nwait for me, how kindly didst Thou not receive me, how sweetly in secret\r\ndidst Thou not anticipate me and interiorly warn me! How ungrateful soever I\r\nmight sometimes be, still Thou didst not desist until Thou hadst drawn me to\r\nThee. Ought I then not to praise Thee, my gentle Lord? Yes, truly do I\r\ndesire that a rich praise should ascend before Thy eyes, even such a great\r\nand joyous praise as that rendered by the angels when they first beheld the\r\nsight of their own constancy and the reprobation of their fallen companions;\r\nas that uttered in the joy felt by the miserable souls in Purgatory when\r\nthey come forth from their grim prison house before Thee, and behold for the\r\nfirst time Thy countenance beaming with delight and love; a praise even as\r\nthat unfathomable praise which will resound in the streets of the heavenly\r\ncity after the last judgment, when the elect shall be separated in\r\neverlasting security from the wicked. Lord, one thing I should also like to\r\nknow respecting Thy praise is this: How all that is naturally good in me may\r\nbe referred to Thy everlasting praise?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Inasmuch as nobody in this temporal state can be sure,\r\nfrom actual knowledge, of the true difference between nature and grace, so\r\nwhen anything gracious, joyous, or agreeable, arises in thy mind, whether it\r\nbe from nature of from grace, enter quickly and speedily into thy interior,\r\nand make an oblation of it to God, so that it may be consumed in My praise,\r\nbecause I am the Lord of nature and grace, and in this way will nature now\r\nto thee become supernatural.\r\nThe Servant.--Lord, but how then shall I turn even the imaginations of\r\nevil spirits to Thy eternal praise?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--To the suggestions or inspirations of an evil spirit\r\nspeak thou as follows: Lord, as often as this wicked spirit or any other\r\nsends me against my will such disagreeable thoughts, let me of my own\r\npremeditated will send Thee the most fervent praise in his stead, even the\r\nvery praise which the same evil spirit ought to have given Thee throughout\r\nall eternity had he remained loyal, so that in his reprobate state I may\r\nrepresent his place in praising Thee; and as often as he inspires me with\r\nsuch odious thoughts, let my good praise ascend to Thee.\r\nThe Servant.--O Lord, now do I indeed see that to good men all things\r\nmay be turned into good, when even the very worst things of the evil spirit\r\ncan in such a way be made good things. But now tell me one thing more. Ah,\r\nThou gracious Lord, how am i to turn all that I hear, all that I see, to Thy\r\npraise and glory?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--As often as thou seest a great number of people, as\r\noften as thou beholdest an exceeding fair multitude, say from the very\r\nbottom of thy heart: Lord, as often and as beautifully must the thousand\r\ntimes a thousand angelic spirits who stand before Thee salute Thee lovingly\r\nthis day in my name, and the ten thousand times a thousand spirits who serve\r\nThee praise Thee today for me, and they must desire for me all the holy\r\ndesires of the saints, and that the ravishing beauty of all creatures may do\r\nThee honour today for me.\r\nThe Servant.--O my sweet Lord, how hast Thou not refreshed and\r\nincreased my zeal in Thy praise! But truly, Lord, this temporal praise has\r\nstirred up my heart and alas! set my soul a longing for the praise which is\r\neverlasting and eternal. When, my own elected Wisdom, when will the bright\r\nday arise, when will the glad hour arrive of a perfectly prepared death and\r\ndeparture from this scene of wretchedness to my Beloved! Ah me, I begin so\r\nto languish, so ardently to long after my heart's only love! When, O when\r\nshall I ever possess it? How lingering is the time, how late it will be\r\nbefore I behold face to face the delight of my soul's eyes, before I enjoy\r\nThee according to my heart's desire! O misery of banishment, what a misery\r\nthou art to him who considers himself banished in very truth! Behold, Lord,\r\nthere is hardly any one on earth but has some friend to visit, some place on\r\nwhich to rest his foot a little while. Alas, my only one, Thou whom my soul\r\nalone seeks and desires, Thou knowest that I have no other refuge, than in\r\nThee alone! Lord, whatever I hear and see, if I find Thee not, is a torment\r\nto me; the society of all mankind without Thee is bitterness to me. Lord,\r\nwhat should rejoice me, what detain me here?\r\nEternal Wisdom.--Here on earth shouldst thou often wander in the\r\ndelightful orchard of My blooming praise. In this transient life there is no\r\ntruer prelude to the celestial habitations than is to be found among those\r\nwho praise God in the joy of a serene heart. There is nothing that cheers a\r\nman's mind so much, and lightens his sufferings; that drives away evil\r\nspirits, and makes sadness disappear, as joyous praising of God. God is near\r\nthose who praise Him; the angels are familiar with them: they are profitable\r\nto themselves; it betters their neighbour and gladdens the soul; all the\r\nheavenly host is honoured by cheerful minded praise.\r\nThe Servant.--Sweet Lord, my tender, my Eternal Wisdom! I desire that\r\nwhen my eyes first awaken in the morning, my heart may awaken too, and that\r\nthere may burst from it a high-flaming fiery love-torch of Thy praise, with\r\nthe most fervent love of the most loving heart that exists in time,\r\naccording to the most ardent love of the most exalted seraphim in eternity,\r\nin the fathomless love with which Thou, Heavenly Father, lovest Thy only\r\nSon, and with the most sweet love of the Holy Ghost who proceeds from Father\r\nand Son; and I desire that this praise may resound so sweetly in the\r\nFatherly heart as never did yet the strings of all earthly instruments in a\r\njoyous mind; and that this love-torch may send up so sweet a savour of\r\npraise as though it were smoking incense composed of all precious herbs and\r\nspices of all virtues finely powdered together in their highest perfection;\r\nand lastly, that the sight of it may be so beautifully blooming in graces as\r\nnever any May was known to be in its most ravishing bloom; so that it may be\r\na delightful aspect for Thy divine eyes and all the heavenly host. All my\r\ndesire is, that this love-torch may at all times blaze out fervently in my\r\nprayers, from my mouth in my singing, in my thoughts, words, and works, that\r\nit may subdue all my enemies, consume all my sins, and obtain for me a happy\r\nend, so that the end of this my temporal praise may be but the beginning of\r\nmy everlasting, my eternal praise. Amen.\r\nLet everybody who desires to meditate briefly, properly, and earnestly\r\non the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom all our salvation lies, and\r\nwho desires to be thankful for His manifold sufferings, learn by heart the\r\nhundred choice meditations which hereafter follow, severally, according to\r\ntheir sense, which is comprised in few words, and go over them devoutly\r\nevery day, with a hundred venias or otherwise, as it may suit him best, and\r\nat every venia, when it relates to our Blessed Lady, let him say a Pater\r\nNoster, or an Ave Maria, or a Salve Regina, for in this manner were they\r\nrevealed to a preacher by God, at a time when he stood before a crucifix\r\nafter Matins, and fervently complained to God that he could not well\r\nmeditate on His torments, and that it was so bitter a thing for him to\r\nmeditate on them, inasmuch as; up to that hour, he had had herein great\r\ninfirmity,from which he was then relieved. The prayers he afterwards\r\nappended, in a short form, so that all might be free to find matter for\r\nthemselves to pray agreeably to their own feelings, but should the prayers\r\nprove too many for a person all at once, let him divide them into even daily\r\nhours, or into the seven days of the week, according as they are here noted\r\ndown."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(t.code,{children:"                           THE THIRD PART\r\n\r\n                       -----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n ONE HUNDRED MEDITATIONS AND PRAYERS\r\n COMPRISED IN FEW WORDS\r\n\r\n                       -----------------------\r\n\r\n                       ON SUNDAY, OR AT MATINS\r\n\r\n O Eternal Wisdom, my heart reminds Thee of Thy sorrow of soul. 1.

Then he besought our Blessed Lady, the\r\nMother of God, that she would do it. And, on the eve of St. Dominic, at\r\nnight, after he had sung matins, it seemed to him in his sleep, as if he\r\nwere in a chamber; and as if, while he was sitting there, a very fair youth\r\nentered with a ravishing harp, and with him four other youths with flutes.\r\nThen the youth with the harp sat down by the brother, and began to touch his\r\nharp, and play upon it very sweetly. This was pleasant for the brother to\r\nhear, and he said to him, O, when wilt thou come to the place where I dwell,\r\nand lift up my heart a little with thy music? Then the youth asked the\r\nbrother if he was still busy with what he had for a long time been occupied\r\nwith? To which he said, Yes. Then the youth answered and said: It is hard to\r\nplay. So he turned to the four with flutes, and bid them blow. Then one of\r\nthem answered and said that if two of them blew it would be enough. But the\r\nother said, that two would not be enough, and that they must all blow their\r\nflutes together, and he gave them a certain tune, which was well known to\r\nhim, but of which the brother knew nothing, and it was done accordingly.\r\nMeanwhile he presently neither saw nor heard any harp or flute, but saw\r\nthat the youths had in their hands a picture, above all measure lovely, of\r\nour Blessed Lady, and that it was worked in cloth, and the mantle of the\r\npicture was red and purple, with damask embroidery, which it was delightful\r\nto behold, and the ground was as white as snow. Then the brother marvelled\r\ngreatly, and took pleasure in the sight; and he perceived that they would\r\nneeds complete it, and, first of all, fill up the empty space. Then they\r\nsaid, See how it grows! Presently he saw it completed. And then one of them\r\ntook a needle and thread, and made on the fore part of the mantle very\r\nskillful cross stitches, and they were very finely done, and wonderfully\r\nadorned our Blessed Lady. And now his eyes were opened, and he understood\r\nthat he should no longer doubt that it was given him to complete the ground,\r\nthe blank space, and the spiritual picture, which had so long been denied to\r\nhim; for he was accustomed to have all that he had hitherto performed\r\nclearly manifested to him by God in the way of some similitude like the\r\nabove, and so, on the morrow, he finished his work to the end.\r\n[1] A form of prostration, "at full length on the right side," practiced by\r\nthe Dominicans.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[2] viii.2"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[3] Ecclesiasticus xxiv. 24, 26, 27; xl. 20"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[4] Cant. vi. 5"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[5] Without prejudice, however, to their own individuality, as Suso\r\nelsewhere clearly teaches."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[6] Cor. ii.2"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[7] Sancti Bernardi Sermones in Cantica Canticorum.
