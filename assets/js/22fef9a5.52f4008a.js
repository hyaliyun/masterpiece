Though they were peasants they were well off, for the soil on which they lived was fruitful, and yielded rich crops.  One day they all three told their mother they meant to get married.  To which their mother replied:  'Do as you like, but see that you choose good housewives, who will look carefully after your affairs; and, to make certain of this, take with you these three skeins of flax, and give it to them to spin.  Whoever spins the best will be my favourite daughter-in-law.'"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now the two eldest sons had already chosen their wives; so they took the flax from their mother, and carried it off with them, to have it spun as she had said.  But the youngest son was puzzled what to do with his skein, as he knew no girl (never having spoken to any) to whom he could give it to be spun.  He wandered hither and thither, asking the girls that he met if they would undertake the task for him, but at the sight of the flax they laughed in his face and mocked at him.  Then in despair he left their villages, and went out into the country, and, seating himself on the bank of a pond began to cry bitterly."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Suddenly there was a noise close beside him, and a frog jumped out of the water on to the bank and asked him why he was crying.

They all three left the room; and in a few minutes the two eldest returned, bringing with them the linen that had been spun by their chosen wives.  But the youngest brother was greatly troubled, for he had nothing to show for the skein of flax that had been given to him.

The third witch gave the girl a magic purse, filled with money.  Having done this, the witches disappeared, and the youth with his lovely bride drove to his mother's home.  Great was the delight of the mother at her youngest son's good fortune.
