Out of these you must pick out the three described to you by my father.  If they prove shy, and refuse to let you get near them, draw out your knife, and let the sun shine on it so that the whole meadow is lit up by its rays, and the horses will then approach you of their own accord, and will let you lead them away.  When you have them safely, look about till you see a cypress tree, whose roots are of brass, whose boughs are of silver, and whose leaves are of gold.  Go to it, and cut away the roots with your knife, and you will come to countless bags of gold.

Then he drew his knife, and held it up towards the sun, and directly there shone such a glory that the whole meadow was bathed in it.

Deeper and deeper he dug, till far down, below the roots of brass, his knife struck upon the buried treasure, which lay heaped up in bags all around.  With a great effort he lifted them from their hiding place, and laid them one by one on his horses' backs, and when they could carry no more he led them back to the emperor.  And when the emperor saw him, he wondered, but never guessed how it was the young man had been too clever for him, till the betrothal ceremony was over.  Then he asked his newly made son-in-law what dowry he would require with his bride.
