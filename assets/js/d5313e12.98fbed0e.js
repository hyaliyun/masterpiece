When a child\r\n5 years old, I used to bother the other spinners. I was so anxious to\r\nlearn to spin. My father had a small wheel made for me by a wright in\r\nthe neighborhood. I was very jealous of my wheel, and would spin on it\r\nfor hours. The colored women were always indulgent to me, and made\r\nthe proper sized rolls, so I could spin them.

Mr. Brown,\r\nthe overseer, was in the door of my half-brother Richard\'s room,\r\nwith my brother\'s gun in his hands. At the end of the porch was a\r\nsmall room, called the "saddle room." A pane of glass was out of the\r\nwindow and a hen flew out, cackling. Aunt Judy, the colored woman,\r\nwent in to get the egg, and walked in front of Mr. Brown, who raised\r\nthe gun and said: "Judy, I am going to shoot you," not thinking the\r\ngun was loaded. It went off, and aunt Judy fell. Mr. Brown began to\r\nwring his hands and cry in great agony. I screamed and kept running\r\naround a small tree near by. This was Sunday morning. Runners were sent for\r\nthe doctor, and for my parents, who were at church.\r\nAunt Judy got well, but had one eye out; we could always feel the shot\r\nin her forehead.

I can see her\r\nnow, with one child at the breast, and another at her knee, with her\r\nhand on its head, feeling for "buggars." I was very much attached to\r\nthis woman and wanted to take care of her in her old age. I went to\r\nSouthern Texas to get her in 1873.

There are\r\ntwo kingdoms. One of darkness, and one of light. God rules in the latter;\r\nThe Devil in the former. Both have powers above the power of man.\r\nThe magicians at Pharoah\'s court were wizards; and the woman of Endor\r\nwas a witch. The Bible speaks of dealing with "familiar spirits."

My mother was not pleased with\r\nseeing a growing attachment between us, for there was another match she\r\nhad planned for me. When she saw this she would not allow me to sit\r\nalone in the room with him, so our communication was mostly by writing\r\nletters. I never knew Shakespeare until he read it to me, and I became\r\nan ardent admirer of the greatest poet. The volume of Shakespeare on\r\nhis table was our postoffice. In the morning at breakfast he would manage\r\nto call the name "Shakespeare;" then I would know there was a letter\r\nfor me in its leaves. After teaching three months he went to Holden,\r\nMo., and located; sent for his father and mother and in two years we\r\nwere married.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"{illust. caption =\r\nMRS.

I did not fear anything, for I\r\nwas in love, and doubted in him nothing. When Dr. Gloyd came up to\r\nmarry me the 21st of November, 1867, I noticed with pain, that his countenance\r\nwas not bright, he was changed. The day was one of the gloomiest\r\nI ever saw, a mist fell, and not a ray of sunshine. I felt a foreboding\r\non the day I had looked forward to, as being one of the happiest. I did not\r\nfind Dr. Gloyd the lover I expected. He was kind but seemed to want to\r\nbe away from me; used to sit and read, when I was so hungry for his\r\ncaresses and love. I have heard that this is the experience of many other\r\nyoung married women. They are so disappointed that their husbands\r\nchange so after marriage. With my observation and experience I believe\r\nthat men have it in their power to keep the love of ninety-nine women out\r\nof a hundred. Why do women lose love for their husbands? I find it is\r\nmostly due to indifference on the part of the husband. I often hear the\r\nexperience of those poor abandoned sisters. I ask, Why are you in this house\r\nof sin and death? When I can get their confidence, many of them say: "I\r\nmarried a man; he drank, and went with other women. I got discouraged\r\nor spiteful, and went to the bad also." I find that drink causes so much\r\nenmity between the sexes. Drinking men neglect their wives. Their wives\r\nbecome jealous. Men often go with abandoned women under the influence\r\nof that drink that animates the animal passions and asks not for the\r\nassociation of love, but the gratification of lust. Men do not go to the\r\nhouses of ill-fame to meet women they love but oftener those they almost hate.\r\nThe drink habit destroys in men the appreciation of a home life, and when a\r\nwoman leaves all others for one man, she does, and should, expect his\r\ncompanionship, and is not satisfied without it. Libertines, taking advantage\r\nof this, select women whose husbands are neglectful, and he wins victims\r\nby his attentions, and poor woman, as at the first, is beguiled. Marriage,\r\nwhile it is the blissful consummation of pure love, is the most serious of\r\nall relations, and girls and boys should early be instructed about the secrets\r\nof their own natures, the object of marriage, and the serious results of any\r\nmarriage where true love is not the object. I confess myself that I\r\nwas not fit to marry with the ignorance of its holy purpose. Sunday school\r\nteachers, mothers, fathers, and ministers, look into God\'s word and see the\r\nresults of sin. God has written of this so as to force you to educate your\r\nchildren. Talk freely. Truth will purify everything it comes in contact\r\nwith. Ignorance is not innocence, but is the promoter of crime: "My\r\npeople are destroyed for lack of knowledge."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'About five days after we were married, Dr. Gloyd came in, threw\r\nhimself on the bed and fell asleep.

I was terror stricken, and from that time on, I knew why he was\r\nso changed. Not one happy moment did I see; I cried most all the time.\r\nMy husband seemed to understand that I knew his condition. Twice,\r\nwith tears in his eyes, he remarked: "Oh! Pet, I would give my right arm\r\nto make you happy." He would be out until late every night. I never\r\nclosed my eyes.

There is an object lesson\r\ntaught in the Bible. The mother of Samson was told by an angel to\r\n"drink neither wine nor strong drink" before her child was born, and not\r\nto allow him to do so after he was born. God shows by this, that these\r\nthings are injurious. Mothers often make drunkards of their own children,\r\nbefore they are born. My parents heard that Dr. Gloyd was drinking.\r\nMy father came down to visit us, and I went home with him. My\r\nmother told me I must never go back to my husband again. I knew the\r\ntime was near at hand, when I would be helpless, with a drunken husband,\r\nand no means of support. What could I do? I kept writing to\r\n"Charlie," as I called him.

My father gave me several lots; by selling one of these\r\nand Dr. Gloyd\'s library and instruments, I built a house of three rooms\r\non one of the lots and rented the house we lived in, which brought us in\r\na little income, but not sufficient to support us. I wanted to prepare myself\r\nto teach, and I attended the Normal Institute of Warrensburg. I was\r\nnot able to pay my board and Mr. Archie Gilkerson and wife charged me\r\nnothing and were as kind to me as parents. God bless them! I got\r\na certificate and was given the primary room in the Public School at Holden.\r\nMother Gloyd kept house and took care of Charlien, my little girl,\r\nand I made the living. This continued for four years. I lost my position\r\nas teacher in that school this way: A Dr. Moore was a member of the\r\nboard, he criticised me for the way I had the little ones read; for instance,\r\nin the sentence, "I saw a man," I had them use the short a instead of\r\nthe long a, and so with the article a; having them read it as we would\r\nspeak it naturally.

This was a severe blow\r\nto me, for I could not leave mother Gloyd and Charlien to teach in another\r\nplace, and I knew of no other way of making a living except by teaching.\r\nI resolved then to get married. I made it a subject of prayer and went\r\nto the Lord explaining things about this way. I said: "My Lord, you\r\nsee the situation I cannot take care of mother and Charlien. I want you to\r\nhelp me. If it be best for me to marry, I will do so. I have no one picked\r\nout, but I want you to select the one that you think best.

My faith does\r\nnot at all times grasp this or other promises, but there are times when\r\nI can appropriate them and make them mine; there are times when I can\r\npray with faith, believing that I have the things I pray for, other times it\r\nis not so.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'In about ten days from that time I made this a subject of prayer, I\r\nwas walking down the street in Holden and passed a place where Mr.\r\nNation was standing, who had come up from Warrensburg, where he was\r\nthen editing the "Warrensburg Journal". He was standing in the door with\r\nhis back to me, but turned and spoke. There was a peculiar thrill which\r\npassed through my heart which made me start.

Not one of the severe judgements of God but\r\nthey reflect this tender love of God, in destroying that which love hates,\r\nbecause sin is the enemy of love, the bitter foe to the happiness of mankind;\r\ntherefore \'tis an evidence of the intensity of love to destroy sin.\r\nTake for instance the destruction of the Amalekites. This people was a\r\ncurse to the earth and the enemy of all good. "Remember what Amalek\r\ndid unto thee, by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt."\r\n"How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindermost of thee, even\r\nall that were behind thee when thou wast faint and weary; and he\r\nfeared not God.

From the golden throne he sought\r\na retreat, and for forty years was an humble shepherd, learning the lesson\r\nof caring for the flocks of Jethro, before be should be called to take the\r\noversight of the flock of God.

Not\r\none compromise would he make, still true to his prohibition principles.\r\nGod never used or blessed any man or woman that was not a prohibitionist.\r\nEli was one of those conservatives and said only, "Nay verily\r\nmy sons." And he got his neck broke and both of his sons killed in one\r\nday, because he "restrained (or prohibited) not his sons in the iniquity\r\nwhich he knew." Moses, although the meekest of all men, he said to\r\nPharaoh, "There shall not a hoof be left behind." True to the uncompromising\r\nspirit of a great leader. When in the Mount, seeing the idolatry,\r\nsmashed the two tables of stone. Why? He would not deliver the\r\nholy laws to a people who were insulting God. This smashing was a\r\ndemonstration of Moses jealousy for his God. After this I can see him\r\nstriding down to the place of this "ball" or "hugging". The round dance\r\nof the present day is but a repetition of those lascivious plays, and with\r\nhis ax or hatchet he hacked up that malicious property, shaped into a\r\ngolden calf.

The most abundant\r\nsubstance found in the human body, is water. About 130 pounds of\r\nthe weight of a 160-pound person is water, "Quite enough if rightly\r\narranged to drown him." Man has been irreverently described as "about\r\n30 pounds of solids set up in 13 gallons of water."

"It is through the medium of the water contained\r\nin the animal body that all its vital functions are carried on."\r\nDr. W. B. Richardson of England has pointed out more than fifty\r\ncharacteristics of the action of a natural drink upon the system. The action\r\nof alcohol is the opposite of these in every particular, and therefore it\r\nis not a real or natural drink. Of course the water which is found in\r\nmixture in all alcoholic liquors serves to quench thirst, even though it\r\nis often foul water.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"      IS IT A FOOD!\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'We also found, upon taking up the work imposed upon us, that\r\nalcohol had been demonstrated not to be a food. Many classifications\r\nof foods have been made, but about the best is that which divides them\r\nbroadly into two classes: to use homely language, flesh formers and body\r\nwarmers; those which build up or repair the bodily waste, and those\r\nwhich sustain the animal warmth. The slow fire within us being necessary\r\nto life we hunger for that only which will replace the substance\r\ndestroyed by the burning. "To the child of nature all hurtful things\r\nare repulsive, all beautiful things attractive," As to flesh formers, it had\r\nbeen noted that all foods useful in repairing bodily waste contain the\r\nelement nitrogen. Alcohol contains no nitrogen, and so could not be\r\nclassed among body builders. The chief body warmer is sugar. Alcohol\r\nbeing a product of sugar, people were all misled for years into thinking\r\nthat it does in some kind and degree feed the system. The mistake\r\nwas easy, since after taking alcohol there is a temporary increase in\r\nvivacity of mind and manner and in surface temperature, and a lessened\r\nrequirement for regular foods. These opinions had been tested in the\r\nlight of truth and proved erroneous. Axel Gustafson, in his Foundation\r\nof Death, considers this subject at length. As early as 1840 French\r\nphysicians discovered that alcohol actually reduced the temperature of\r\nthe body. Prominent German and English medical men soon confirmed\r\nthe statement, and in 1850, Dr. N. S. Davis of Chicago, the founder of the\r\nAmerican Medical Association, in speaking of a number of observations\r\nduring the active period of digestion after ordinary food, whether nitrogenous\r\nor carbonaceous, the temperature of the body is always increased,\r\nbut after taking alcohol, in either the form of the fermented or the distilled\r\ndrinks, it begins to fall within half an hour and continues to\r\ndecrease for from two to three hours. The extent and duration of the\r\nreduction was in direct proportion to the amount of alcohol taken." The\r\nmost prominent physicians in Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Scandinavia\r\nand Russia reached similar conclusions shortly after this. In explorations\r\nin the Arctic regions where the cold is intense, no alcoholic drinks\r\nare permitted. Dr. Nansen, the great Norwegian, attributes the fatalities of\r\nthe Greely expedition to the use of liquor, and this is the only\r\nexpedition of recent years which permitted the use of alcoholic drinks.\r\nAs a matter of fact it was long ago proved that "Alcohol does not warm\r\nnor cool a person, but only destroys the sensation and decreases the\r\nvitality." Superficial observers, however, have upheld the use of alcohol\r\nas a food, saying, "See how fleshy it makes people." Well, healthy fat\r\nis not always an advantage, but beer drinkers\' fat is not the genuine\r\narticle. Healthy fat represents a stock of body warming food laid up\r\nfor a time of need and is formed only in health. The "fat" usually exhibited\r\nby beer drinkers is not a fat at all; oil is not its chief factor. It\r\nconsists of particles of partly digested flesh forming food which the\r\nsystem required, but which it was unable to assimilate owing to the presence\r\nin the body of the alcohol which the beer contained. This sort of fat\r\ninstead of indicating health points to disease. This general teaching as\r\nto the worthlessness of alcohol as a food had been set forth by the leaders\r\nin medical profession, and accepted largely by the rank and file of\r\npractitioners for about twenty-five years. An occasional cry came from\r\nthe other side, however, and late in 1899 Dr. W. O. Atwater, professor\r\nin Wesleyan University, announced that he had, by an extended series\r\nof experiments, proved the truth of the claims of those experimentors\r\nwho believed alcohol to have value as a food. Dr. Atwater\'s reports were\r\nwidely published by the whiskey press, and a state of some unrest\r\namongst thinking physicians followed, which had not been wholly quieted\r\nwhen this committee began work.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"      IS IT A MEDICINE?\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'At the time we began work, however, it had been demonstrated that\r\nalcohol is not a medicine.

Dr.\r\nNicols, editor Boston Journal of Chemistry, long ago wrote, "The banishment\r\nof alcohol would not deprive us of a single one of the indispensable\r\nagents which modern civilization demands. In no instance of\r\ndisease in any form, is it a medicine which might not be dispensed with."\r\nDr. Bunge, professor of physical chemistry in the University of Basle,\r\nSwitzerland, said: "In general let it be understood that all the workings\r\nof alcohol in the system which usually are considered as excitement\r\nor stimulation are only indications of paralysis. It is a deep-rooted error\r\nsense of fatigue is the safety value of the human organism. Whoever\r\ndulls this sense in order to work harder or longer may be likened to an\r\nengineer who sits down on his safety valve in order to make better speed\r\nwith his engine." Dr. F. H. Hammond of the U. S. army said: "Alcohol\r\nstrengthens no one. It only deadens the feeling of fatigue." Dr. Sims\r\nWoodhead, professor in Cambridge University, England, had given the\r\nfollowing list of conditions in which alcohol should not be used: In\r\nthose (1) who have any family history of drunkenness, insanity or nervous\r\ndisease. (2) Who have used alcohol to excess in childhood or youth.\r\n(3) Who are nervous, irritable or badly nourished. (4) Who suffer\r\nfrom injuries to the head, gross disease of the brain and sunstroke.

There is an increased\r\naction of about four thousand beats in twenty-four hours for every\r\nounce of alcohol used. This fact still misleads some physicians into\r\nprescribing it to strengthen the weak heart, but the increase is not due to\r\nnew force. The heart action normally is the result of arterial pressure\r\nand nervous action, two forces mutually balancing each other. The\r\nnervous action is diminished by the introduction of the alcohol; this\r\ndestroys the balance and deranges the arterial pressure. Dr. James\r\nEdmunds, a great English physician, years ago said: "When we see a\r\nman breathing with great vigor, does it occur to us that he must be in\r\ngood health? Is it an indication that he gets more air? We all know\r\nbetter. It simply shows that he has asthma or some such disease, and\r\nthat his breathing is strained and imperfect. He is making use of less\r\nair than the person who breathes quietly. This is the case with the blood,\r\nwork, so it plunges and struggles in the effort. And the cause of both\r\ncases is the same. There is more carbonic acid in the blood than either\r\nthe heart or the lungs can handle. If for example I were suffering from\r\ngeneral debility and milk were the food best suited to my needs, and if I\r\nshould discover a tramp in my apartments drinking of my already too\r\nlimited supply, would it be reasonable to assert that the exhibition of\r\nstrength which I made in forcing him to desist is an indication that the\r\nentrance of the vagrant bettered my enfeebled condition?

The most\r\npronounced in this way, perhaps, have been the great leaders in medical\r\nscience in Austria, Germany and France. Some of the points made\r\nagainst the use of alcohol were that it interferes with digestion by rendering\r\ninsoluble the active principle of the gastric juice, and especially by\r\npreventing the solution of body-building foods. The natural action of\r\nvarious organs of the body is more or less arrested by alcohol, thus reducing\r\nthe temperature. This from Dr. Edmunds already quoted: \"The\r\nblood carries certain earthy matters in it in a soluble state, these earthy\r\nmatters being necessary for the nutrition of the bones and other parts of\r\nthe body. You all know that when wine is fermented and turned from\r\na weak sweet wine into a strong alcoholic wine, you get what is called\r\na 'crust' formed on the inside of the bottle. What is that crust? That\r\ncrust consists of saline or earthy matters which were soluble in the\r\nsaccharine grape juice, but which are insoluble in the alcoholic fluids.\r\nWe find in drunkards that the blood vessels get into the same state as\r\nthe wine bottles from the deposit of earthy matter which has no business\r\nto be deposited, and forms the 'beeswing' or crust in the blood vessels\r\nof the drunkard, in his eye and in all of the tissues of the body.\" Alcohol\r\nhad been found to prevent the elimination of waste, thus the body is\r\nloaded with worn and decaying tissues, leaving the system an inviting\r\nfield for all sorts of diseases. Life insurance companies, influenced by\r\nbusiness interests wholly, make a distinction between liquor users and\r\nnon-users. Nelson, a distinguished actuary of England, employed as an\r\nexpert by life insurance companies, found after investigating over 7,000\r\ncases, none of which were drunkards, that between the ages of 15 and\r\n20 the proportion of deaths in total abstainers to those in moderate drinkers\r\nis as 10 to 18; between the ages of 25 and 30, as 10 to 31; between\r\n30 and 40 as 10 is to 40."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'With reference to the effect on the offspring of drinking parents, the\r\nmedical profession had accepted the teaching of the French specialist, Dr.\r\nJaccound, that "of the children of drinkers some of them become imbeciles\r\nand idiots; others are feeble in mind, exhibit moral perversion, and sink\r\nby degrees into complete degeneration; still others are epileptics, deaf\r\nand dumb, scrofulous, etc.," and of the English teacher, Dr. Kerr, that\r\n"long continued habitual indulgence in intoxicating drink to an extent far\r\nshort of intoxication is not only sufficient to originate and hand down a\r\nmorbid tendency, but is much more likely to do so than even repeated\r\ndrunken outbreaks with intervals of sobriety between."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Thus the men who have been of the greatest honor to the profession\r\nin every land were a unit in opposing the use of alcohol in health or\r\ndisease and in holding that if people are determined to use it there is less\r\ndanger in health, as then the system is in better condition to throw off\r\nits evil effects."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"      PROGRESS DURING THE PAST YEAR.\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Now as to the progress made during the past year. In June, 1901,\r\nthe American Medical Association met in St. Paul. The branch of it\r\ngiving special study to the temperance question held several sessions,\r\nabout one hundred of the most distinguished physicians in the country\r\nattending. Much time was given to considering Dr. Atwater\'s teaching\r\nto the effect that he had proved alcohol to be a food. During the previous\r\nyear he had published the details of his experiments, and at the convention\r\nit was shown that his own experiments upset his conclusions. It\r\nhad been held that except in rare instances alcohol taken into the system\r\npassed away from it as alcohol without change. Dr. Atwater\'s experiments\r\nstrengthened somewhat the position of those who held that change\r\nis not infrequent, but he concluded that the portion broken up while in the\r\nbody served as a food. A closer examination of his own experiments\r\nshowed that the portion oxidized had gone to form other compounds in\r\nthe system which were possibly more harmful than if it had all passed\r\noff unchanged. Dr. Max Kassowitz, professor in the University of Vienna,\r\nsaid, after Dr. Atwater\'s statement had been published: "For the animal\r\nand human organism, alcohol is not both a food and a poison, but a\r\npoison only, which like other poisons is an irritant when taken in small\r\ndoses while in larger ones it produces paralysis." In connection with\r\nthe fact that alcohol is simply a poison, it may be worth stating, that the\r\noriginal meaning of the word "intoxicated" was "poisoned." After reading\r\nDr. Atwater, the Russian Commission for the study of alcoholism,\r\nafter two years\' work, said: "The claim that alcohol is a food in any\r\nproper sense of the term is not sufficiently proved." In the St. Paul\r\nconvention spoken of, politics obtained a foothold, and some weak resolutions\r\nin favor of the army canteen were adopted but not even the champions\r\nof the canteen were willing to subscribe to the statement that alcohol is\r\never a real food.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Just previous to our last convention much noise was made through\r\nthe daily press concerning a finding of some English scientist to the effect\r\nthat an acquired tendency cannot be transmitted to offspring.
