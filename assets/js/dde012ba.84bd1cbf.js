'There is none but me;\r\nbut let me look,' and he opened the door of the lodge, when,\r\nlo! at a little distance he saw the enraged animal coming on,\r\nwith slow but powerful leaps.  He closed the door.\r\n'Yes,' said he, 'he is indeed a great manito:  my grandchildren,\r\nyou will be the cause of my losing my life; you asked my protection,\r\nand I granted it; so now, come what may, I will protect you.\r\nWhen the bear arrives at the door, you must run out of the other\r\ndoor of the lodge.'  Then putting his hand to the side of\r\nthe lodge where he sat, he brought out a bag which he opened.\r\nTaking out two small black dogs, he placed them before him.\r\n'These are the ones I use when I fight,' said he; and he commenced\r\npatting with both hands the sides of one of them, and he began\r\nto swell out, so that he soon filled the lodge by his bulk;\r\nand he had great strong teeth.  When he attained his full\r\nsize he growled, and from that moment, as from instinct,\r\nhe jumped out at the door and met the bear, who in another leap\r\nwould have reached the lodge.  A terrible combat ensued.\r\nThe skies rang with the howls of the fierce monsters.\r\nThe remaining dog soon took the field.  The brothers, at the onset,\r\ntook the advice of the old man, and escaped through the opposite\r\nside of the lodge.  They had not proceeded far before they heard\r\nthe dying cry of one of the dogs, and soon after of the other.\r\n'Well,' said the leader, 'the old man will share their fate:\r\nso run; he will soon be after us.'  They started with fresh vigor,\r\nfor they had received food from the old man:  but very soon the bear\r\ncame in sight, and again was fast gaining upon them.  Again the leader\r\nasked the brothers if they could do nothing for their safety.\r\nAll were silent.  The leader, running forward, did as before.\r\n'I dreamed,' he cried, 'that, being in great trouble, an old\r\nman helped me who was a manito; we shall soon see his lodge.'\r\nTaking courage, they still went on.  After going a short distance\r\nthey saw the lodge of the old manito.

The old man\r\nopened the door and saw him coming.  He shut it slowly, and said:\r\n'Yes, my grandchildren, you have brought trouble upon me.'\r\nProcuring his medicine-sack, he took out his small war-clubs of\r\nblack stone, and told the young men to run through the other side\r\nof the lodge.  As he handled the clubs, they became very large,\r\nand the old man stepped out just as the bear reached the door.\r\nThen striking him with one of the clubs, it broke in pieces;\r\nthe bear stumbled.  Renewing the attempt with the other\r\nwar-club, that also was broken, but the bear fell senseless.\r\nEach blow the old man gave him sounded like a clap of thunder,\r\nand the howls of the bear ran along till they filled the\r\nheavens."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The young men had now run some distance, when they looked back.\r\nThey could see that the bear was recovering from the blows.\r\nFirst he moved his paws, and soon they saw him rise\r\non his feet.

The reason is plain:\r\na pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and\r\nentirely independent human being that lived in the earth.\r\nKings are but the hampered servants of parliament and people;\r\nparliaments sit in chains forged by their constituency;\r\nthe editor of a newspaper cannot be independent, but must\r\nwork with one hand tied behind him by party and patrons,\r\nand be content to utter only half or two-thirds of his mind;\r\nno clergyman is a free man and may speak the whole truth,\r\nregardless of his parish's opinions; writers of all kinds are\r\nmanacled servants of the public.  We write frankly and fearlessly,\r\nbut then we 'modify' before we print.  In truth, every man and\r\nwoman and child has a master, and worries and frets in servitude;\r\nbut in the day I write of, the Mississippi pilot had none.\r\nThe captain could stand upon the hurricane deck, in the pomp\r\nof a very brief authority, and give him five or six orders while\r\nthe vessel backed into the stream, and then that skipper's reign\r\nwas over.  The moment that the boat was under way in the river,\r\nshe was under the sole and unquestioned control of the pilot.\r\nHe could do with her exactly as he pleased, run her when and whither\r\nhe chose, and tie her up to the bank whenever his judgment said\r\nthat that course was best.  His movements were entirely free;\r\nhe consulted no one, he received commands from nobody,\r\nhe promptly resented even the merest suggestions.  Indeed, the law\r\nof the United States forbade him to listen to commands\r\nor suggestions, rightly considering that the pilot necessarily\r\nknew better how to handle the boat than anybody could tell him.\r\nSo here was the novelty of a king without a keeper, an absolute monarch\r\nwho was absolute in sober truth and not by a fiction of words.\r\nI have seen a boy of eighteen taking a great steamer serenely\r\ninto what seemed almost certain destruction, and the aged captain\r\nstanding mutely by, filled with apprehension but powerless\r\nto interfere.  His interference, in that particular instance,\r\nmight have been an excellent thing, but to permit it would\r\nhave been to establish a most pernicious precedent.  It will\r\neasily be guessed, considering the pilot's boundless authority,\r\nthat he was a great personage in the old steamboating days.\r\nHe was treated with marked courtesy by the captain and with marked\r\ndeference by all the officers and servants; and this deferential\r\nspirit was quickly communicated to the passengers, too.  I think\r\npilots were about the only people I ever knew who failed to show,\r\nin some degree, embarrassment in the presence of traveling\r\nforeign princes.

Once, when we spun around,\r\nwe only missed a house about twenty feet, that had a light burning\r\nin the window; and in the same instant that house went overboard.\r\nNobody could stay on our forecastle; the water swept across\r\nit in a torrent every time we plunged athwart the current.\r\nAt the end of our fourth effort we brought up in the woods two miles\r\nbelow the cut-off; all the country there was overflowed, of course.\r\nA day or two later the cut-off was three-quarters of a mile wide,\r\nand boats passed up through it without much difficulty, and so\r\nsaved ten miles."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The old Raccourci cut-off reduced the river's length twenty-eight miles.\r\nThere used to be a tradition connected with it.

While lying in jail, his health\r\nbegan to fail, and he was threatened with consumption.\r\nThis fact, together with the opportunity for reflection afforded\r\nby solitary confinement, had its effect--its natural effect.\r\nHe fell into serious thought; his early training asserted itself with\r\npower, and wrought with strong influence upon his mind and heart.\r\nHe put his old life behind him, and became an earnest Christian.\r\nSome ladies in the town heard of this, visited him,\r\nand by their encouraging words supported him in his good\r\nresolutions and strengthened him to continue in his new life.\r\nThe trial ended in his conviction and sentence to the State\r\nprison for the term of nine years, as I have before said.\r\nIn the prison he became acquainted with the poor wretch\r\nreferred to in the beginning of my talk, Jack Hunt,\r\nthe writer of the letter which I am going to read.\r\nYou will see that the acquaintanceship bore fruit for Hunt.\r\nWhen Hunt's time was out, he wandered to St. Louis;\r\nand from that place he wrote his letter to Williams.\r\nThe letter got no further than the office of the prison warden,\r\nof course; prisoners are not often allowed to receive letters\r\nfrom outside.
