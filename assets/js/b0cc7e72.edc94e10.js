Well, they give me an explanation or a confirmation of lots of different ideas that have come into my own mind. But what surprises me, Mr. Manders, is that, properly speaking, there is nothing at all new in these books. There is nothing more in them than what most people think and believe. The only thing is, that most people either take no account of it or won't admit it to themselves."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. But, good heavens, do you seriously think that most people--?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. Yes, indeed, I do."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. But not here in the country at any rate? Not here amongst people like ourselves?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. Yes, amongst people like ourselves too."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. Well, really, I must say--!"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. But what is the particular objection that you have to these books?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. What objection? You surely don't suppose that I take any particular interest in such productions?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving.

My dear Mrs. Alving, there are many occasions in life when one has to rely on the opinion of others. That is the way in this world, and it is quite right that it should be so.

But--?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders (lowering his voice). But one doesn't talk about it, Mrs. Alving.

I quite agree with you."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders.

Yes, I freely admit that. But it was about the Orphanage..."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. It was about the Orphanage we were going to talk; quite so. Well--walk warily, dear Mrs. Alving!

The deeds?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Manders. Yes, the whole lot--and everything in order; I can tell you it has been no easy matter to get them in time. I had positively to put pressure on the authorities; they are almost painfully conscientious when it is a question of settling property. But here they are at last. (Turns over the papers.) Here is the deed of conveyance of that part of the Rosenvold estate known as the Solvik property, together with the buildings newly erected thereon-- the school, the masters\' houses and the chapel. And here is the legal sanction for the statutes of the institution.

That seems all in order."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Manders. I thought "Captain " was the better title to use, rather than your husband\'s Court title of "Chamberlain."

And here is the certificate for the investment of the capital in the bank, the interest being earmarked for the current expenses of the Orphanage."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. Many thanks; but I think it will be most convenient if you will kindly take charge of them."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. With pleasure. I think it will be best to leave the money in the bank for the present. The interest is not very high, it is true; four per cent at six months' call; later on, if we can find some good mortgage--of course it must be a first mortgage and on unexceptionable security--we can consider the matter further."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. Yes, yes, my dear Mr. Manders, you know best about all that."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. I will keep my eye on it, anyway.

Shall we insure the buildings, or not?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. Of course we must insure them."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. Ah, but wait a moment, dear lady.

Certainly, but--"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. As far as I am personally concerned, I can conscientiously say that I don't see the smallest objection to our insuring ourselves against all risks."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving.

Well, I was thinking particularly of persons of such independent and influential position that one could hardly refuse to attach weight to their opinion."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. There are a certain number of such people here, who might perhaps take exception to it if we--"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. That's just it, you see. In town there are lots of them. All my fellow-clergymen's congregations, for instance! It would be so extremely easy for them to interpret it as meaning that neither you nor I had a proper reliance on Divine protection."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. But as far as you are concerned, my dear friend, you have at all events the consciousness that--"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. Yes I know I know; my own mind is quite easy about it, it is true. But we should not be able to prevent a wrong and injurious interpretation of our action. And that sort of thing, moreover, might very easily end in exercising a hampering influence on the work of the Orphanage."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. Oh, well, if that is likely to be the effect of it--"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. Nor can I entirely overlook the difficult--indeed, I may say, painful--position I might possibly be placed in. In the best circles in town the matter of this Orphanage is attracting a great deal of attention. Indeed the Orphanage is to some extent built for the benefit of the town too, and it is to be hoped that it may result in the lowering of our poor-rate by a considerable amount. But as I have been your adviser in the matter and have taken charge of the business side of it, I should be afraid that it would be I that spiteful persons would attack first of all."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving.

No, we will give up the idea."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders (leaning back in his chair).

No; I tell you quite plainly I would not do so under any circumstances."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. Still, you know, Mrs. Alving--after all, it is a serious responsibility that we are taking upon ourselves."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. But do you think we can do otherwise?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. No, that's just it. We really can't do otherwise.

You ought not to, as a clergyman, at any rate."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders.

Do you mean it!"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Mrs. Alving. Oh, as a matter of fact it was nothing of any consequence.

Oh well, perhaps he does."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Manders. He feels so strongly that he needs someone who can keep a hold on him when temptations assail him.
