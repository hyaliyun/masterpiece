He could  turn things into almost gold. But just now he had used up all the gold that he  had round the house, and gold was high.

They were all much obliged to him, and willing  to give him $1.37 1/2 in gold. Gold was now 2.69 3/4, so Mr. Peterkin found in  the newspaper. This gave Agamemnon a pretty little sum. He sat himself down to  do it. But there was the coffee! All sat and thought awhile, till Elizabeth  Eliza said, \"Why don't we go to the herb-woman?\" Elizabeth Eliza was the only  daughter. She was named after her two aunts,-Elizabeth, from the sister of her  father; Eliza, from her mother's sister. Now, the herb-woman was an old woman  who came round to sell herbs, and knew a great deal. They all shouted with joy  at the idea of asking her, and Solomon John and the younger children agreed to  go and find her too. The herb-woman lived  down at the very end of the street;  so the boys put on their india-rubber boots again, and they set off. It was a  long walk through the village, but they came at last to the herb-woman's house,  at the foot of a high hill. They went through her little garden. Here she had  marigolds and hollyhocks, and old maids and tall sunflowers, and all kinds of  sweet-smelling herbs, so that the air was full of tansy-tea and elder-blow. Over  the porch grew a hop-vine, and a brandy-cherry tree shaded the door, and a  luxuriant cranberry-vine flung its delicious fruit across the window. They went  into a small parlor, which smelt very spicy. All around hung little bags full of  catnip, and peppermint, and all kinds of herbs; and dried stalks hung from the  ceiling; and on the shelves were jars of rhubarb, senna, manna, and the like."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But there was no little old woman. She had gone up into the woods to get some  more wild herbs, so they all thought they would follow her,-Elizabeth Eliza,  Solomon John, and the little boys. They had to climb up over high rocks, and in  among huckleberry-bushes and black berry-vines. But the little boys had their  india-rubber boots. At last they discovered the little old woman. They knew her  by her hat. It was steeple-crowned, without any vane. They saw her digging with  her trowel round a sassafras bush. They told her their story,-how their mother  had put salt in her coffee, and how the chemist had made it worse instead of  better, and how their mother couldn't drink it, and wouldn't she come and see  what she could do? And she said she would, and took up her little old apron,  with pockets all round, all filled with everlasting and pennyroyal, and went  back to her house."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There she stopped, and stuffed her huge pockets with some of all the kinds of  herbs. She took some tansy and peppermint, and caraway-seed and dill, spearmint  and cloves, pennyroyal and sweet marjoram, basil and rosemary, wild thyme and  some of the other time,-such as you have in clocks,-sappermint and oppermint,  catnip, valerian, and hop; indeed, there isn't a kind of herb you can think of  that the little old woman didn't have done up in her little paper bags, that had  all been dried in her little Dutch-oven. She packed these all up, and then went  back with the children, taking her stick."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Meanwhile Mrs. Peterkin was getting quite impatient for her coffee."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As soon as the little old woman came she had it set over the fire, and began to  stir in the different herbs. First she put in a little hop for the bitter. Mrs."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Peterkin said it tasted like hop-tea, and not at all like coffee.

The children tasted after each mixture, but made up  dreadful faces. Mrs. Peterkin tasted, and did the same. The more the old woman  stirred, and the more she put in, the worse it all seemed to taste."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So the old woman shook her head, and muttered a few words, and said she must  go. She believed the coffee was bewitched. She bundled up her packets of herbs,  and took her trowel, and her basket, and her stick, and went back to her root of  sassafras, that she had left half in the air and half out. And all she would  take for pay was five cents in currency."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Then the family were in despair, and all sat and thought a great while.

Mrs. Peterkin had used her very last on some beets they had the day  before. \"Suppose we go and ask the minister's wife,\" said Elizabeth Eliza. So  they all went to the minister's wife.
