(Pseudonym of Thomas Alexander Browne) A Story of Life and Adventure in the Bush and in the Goldfields of Australia Preface to New Edition I dedicate this `ower true tale&#x27; of the wilder aspects of Australian life to my old comrade R. Murray Smith, late Agent-General in London for the colony of Victoria, with hearty thanks for the time and trouble he has devoted to its publication.  I trust it will do no discredit to the rising reputation of Australian romance.  But though presented in the guise of fiction, this chronicle of the Marston family must not be set down by the reader as wholly fanciful or exaggerated. Much of the narrative is literally true, as can be verified by official records.  A lifelong residence in Australia may be accepted as a guarantee for fidelity as to local colour and descriptive detail. I take this opportunity of acknowledging the prompt and liberal recognition of the tale by the proprietors of the `Sydney Mail&#x27;, but for which it might never have seen the light. ROLF BOLDREWOOD. 117 Collins Street West,   Melbourne, 12th December 1888. Chapter 1 My name&#x27;s Dick Marston, Sydney-side native.  I&#x27;m twenty-nine years old, six feet in my stocking soles, and thirteen stone weight. Pretty strong and active with it, so they say.  I don&#x27;t want to blow -- not here, any road -- but it takes a good man to put me on my back, or stand up to me with the gloves, or the naked mauleys. I can ride anything -- anything that ever was lapped in horsehide -- swim like a musk-duck, and track like a Myall blackfellow. Most things that a man can do I&#x27;m up to, and that&#x27;s all about it. As I lift myself now I can feel the muscle swell on my arm like a cricket ball, in spite of the -- well, in spite of everything. The morning sun comes shining through the window bars; and ever since he was up have I been cursing the daylight, cursing myself, and them that brought me into the world.  Did I curse mother, and the hour I was born into this miserable life? Why should I curse the day?  Why do I lie here, groaning; yes, crying like a child, and beating my head against the stone floor? I am not mad, though I am shut up in a cell.  No.  Better for me if I was. But it&#x27;s all up now; there&#x27;s no get away this time; and I, Dick Marston, as strong as a bullock, as active as a rock-wallaby, chock-full of life and spirits and health, have been tried for bush-ranging -- robbery under arms they call it -- and though the blood runs through my veins like the water in the mountain creeks, and every bit of bone and sinew is as sound as the day I was born, I must die on the gallows this day month. Die -- die -- yes, die; be strung up like a dog, as they say. I&#x27;m blessed if ever I did know of a dog being hanged, though, if it comes to that, a shot or a bait generally makes an end of &#x27;em in this country.  Ha, ha!  Did I laugh?  What a rum thing it is that a man should have a laugh in him when he&#x27;s only got twenty-nine days more to live -- a day for every year of my life. Well, laughing or crying, this is what it has come to at last. All the drinking and recklessness; the flash talk and the idle ways; the merry cross-country rides that we used to have, night or day, it made no odds to us; every man well mounted, as like as not on a racehorse in training taken out of his stable within the week; the sharp brushes with the police, when now and then a man was wounded on each side, but no one killed.  That came later on, worse luck. The jolly sprees we used to have in the bush townships, where we chucked our money about like gentlemen, where all the girls had a smile and a kind word for a lot of game upstanding chaps, that acted like men, if they did keep the road a little lively. Our `bush telegraphs&#x27; were safe to let us know when the `traps&#x27; were closing in on us, and then -- why the coach would be `stuck up&#x27; a hundred miles away, in a different direction, within twenty-four hours. Marston&#x27;s gang again!  The police are in pursuit!  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;d see in the papers.  We had &#x27;em sent to us regular; besides having the pick of &#x27;em when we cut open the mail bags. And now -- that chain rubbed a sore, curse it! -- all that racket&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s more than hard to die in this settled, infernal, fixed sort of way, like a bullock in the killing-yard, all ready to be `pithed&#x27;. I used to pity them when I was a boy, walking round the yard, pushing their noses through the rails, trying for a likely place to jump, stamping and pawing and roaring and knocking their heads against the heavy close rails, with misery and rage in their eyes, till their time was up.  Nobody told THEM beforehand, though! Have I and the likes of me ever felt much the same, I wonder, shut up in a pen like this, with the rails up, and not a place a rat could creep through, waiting till our killing time was come? The poor devils of steers have never done anything but ramble off the run now and again, while we -- but it&#x27;s too late to think of that. It IS hard.  There&#x27;s no saying it isn&#x27;t; no, nor thinking what a fool, what a blind, stupid, thundering idiot a fellow&#x27;s been, to laugh at the steady working life that would have helped him up, bit by bit, to a good farm, a good wife, and innocent little kids about him, like that chap, George Storefield, that came to see me last week. He was real rightdown sorry for me, I could tell, though Jim and I used to laugh at him, and call him a regular old crawler of a milker&#x27;s calf in the old days.  The tears came into his eyes reg&#x27;lar like a woman as he gave my hand a squeeze and turned his head away. We was little chaps together, you know.  A man always feels that, you know. And old George, he&#x27;ll go back -- a fifty-mile ride, but what&#x27;s that on a good horse?  He&#x27;ll be late home, but he can cross the rock ford the short way over the creek.  I can see him turn his horse loose at the garden-gate, and walk through the quinces that lead up to the cottage, with his saddle on his arm.  Can&#x27;t I see it all, as plain as if I was there? And his wife and the young &#x27;uns &#x27;ll run out when they hear father&#x27;s horse, and want to hear all the news.  When he goes in there&#x27;s his meal tidy and decent waiting for him, while he tells them about the poor chap he&#x27;s been to see as is to be scragged next month. Ha! ha! what a rum joke it is, isn&#x27;t it? And then he&#x27;ll go out in the verandah, with the roses growin&#x27; all over the posts and smellin&#x27; sweet in the cool night air.  After that he&#x27;ll have his smoke, and sit there thinkin&#x27; about me, perhaps, and old days, and what not, till all hours -- till his wife comes and fetches him in. And here I lie -- my God! why didn&#x27;t they knock me on the head when I was born, like a lamb in a dry season, or a blind puppy -- blind enough, God knows!  They do so in some countries, if the books say true, and what a hell of misery that must save some people from! Well, it&#x27;s done now, and there&#x27;s no get away.  I may as well make the best of it.  A sergeant of police was shot in our last scrimmage, and they must fit some one over that.  It&#x27;s only natural. He was rash, or Starlight would never have dropped him that day. Not if he&#x27;d been sober either.  We&#x27;d been drinking all night at that Willow Tree shanty.  Bad grog, too!  When a man&#x27;s half drunk he&#x27;s fit for any devilment that comes before him.  Drink!  How do you think a chap that&#x27;s taken to the bush -- regularly turned out, I mean, with a price on his head, and a fire burning in his heart night and day -- can stand his life if he don&#x27;t drink?  When he thinks of what he might have been, and what he is!  Why, nearly every man he meets is paid to run him down, or trap him some way like a stray dog that&#x27;s taken to sheep-killin&#x27;.  He knows a score of men, and women too, that are only looking out for a chance to sell his blood on the quiet and pouch the money.  Do you think that makes a chap mad and miserable, and tired of his life, or not?  And if a drop of grog will take him right out of his wretched self for a bit why shouldn&#x27;t he drink? People don&#x27;t know what they are talking about.  Why, he is that miserable that he wonders why he don&#x27;t hang himself, and save the Government all the trouble; and if a few nobblers make him feel as if he might have some good chances yet, and that it doesn&#x27;t so much matter after all, why shouldn&#x27;t he drink? He does drink, of course; every miserable man, and a good many women as have something to fear or repent of, drink.  The worst of it is that too much of it brings on the `horrors&#x27;, and then the devil, instead of giving you a jog now and then, sends one of his imps to grin in your face and pull your heartstrings all day and all night long. By George, I&#x27;m getting clever -- too clever, altogether, I think. If I could forget for one moment, in the middle of all the nonsense, that I was to die on Thursday three weeks! die on Thursday three weeks! die on Thursday!  That&#x27;s the way the time runs in my ears like a chime of bells.  But it&#x27;s all mere bosh I&#x27;ve been reading these long six months I&#x27;ve been chained up here -- after I was committed for trial.  When I came out of the hospital after curing me of that wound -- for I was hit bad by that black tracker -- they gave me some books to read for fear I&#x27;d go mad and cheat the hangman.  I was always fond of reading, and many a night I&#x27;ve read to poor old mother and Aileen before I left the old place.  I was that weak and low, after I took the turn, and I felt glad to get a book to take me away from sitting, staring, and blinking at nothing by the hour together.  It was all very well then; I was too weak to think much.  But when I began to get well again I kept always coming across something in the book that made me groan or cry out, as if some one had stuck a knife in me. A dark chap did once -- through the ribs -- it didn&#x27;t feel so bad, a little sharpish at first; why didn&#x27;t he aim a bit higher? He never was no good, even at that.  As I was saying, there&#x27;d be something about a horse, or the country, or the spring weather -- it&#x27;s just coming in now, and the Indian corn&#x27;s shooting after the rain, and I&#x27;LL never see it; or they&#x27;d put in a bit about the cows walking through the river in the hot summer afternoons; or they&#x27;d go describing about a girl, until I began to think of sister Aileen again; then I&#x27;d run my head against the wall, or do something like a madman, and they&#x27;d stop the books for a week; and I&#x27;d be as miserable as a bandicoot, worse and worse a lot, with all the devil&#x27;s tricks and bad thoughts in my head, and nothing to put them away. I must either kill myself, or get something to fill up my time till the day -- yes, the day comes.  I&#x27;ve always been a middling writer, tho&#x27; I can&#x27;t say much for the grammar, and spelling, and that, but I&#x27;ll put it all down, from the beginning to the end, and maybe it&#x27;ll save some other unfortunate young chap from pulling back like a colt when he&#x27;s first roped, setting himself against everything in the way of proper breaking, making a fool of himself generally, and choking himself down, as I&#x27;ve done. The gaoler -- he looks hard -- he has to do that, there&#x27;s more than one or two within here that would have him by the throat, with his heart&#x27;s blood running, in half a minute, if they had their way, and the warder was off guard. He knows that very well.  But he&#x27;s not a bad-hearted chap. `You can have books, or paper and pens, anything you like,&#x27; he said, `you unfortunate young beggar, until you&#x27;re turned off.&#x27; `If I&#x27;d only had you to see after me when I was young,&#x27; says I ---- `Come; don&#x27;t whine,&#x27; he said, then he burst out laughing. `You didn&#x27;t mean it, I see.  I ought to have known better. You&#x27;re not one of that sort, and I like you all the better for it.&#x27; .    .    .    .    . Well, here goes.  Lots of pens, a big bottle of ink, and ever so much foolscap paper, the right sort for me, or I shouldn&#x27;t have been here. I&#x27;m blessed if it doesn&#x27;t look as if I was going to write copies again. Don&#x27;t I remember how I used to go to school in old times; the rides there and back on the old pony; and pretty little Grace Storefield that I was so fond of, and used to show her how to do her lessons. I believe I learned more that way than if I&#x27;d had only myself to think about. There was another girl, the daughter of the poundkeeper, that I wanted her to beat; and the way we both worked, and I coached her up, was a caution.  And she did get above her in her class.  How proud we were! She gave me a kiss, too, and a bit of her hair.  Poor Gracey! I wonder where she is now, and what she&#x27;d think if she saw me here to-day. If I could have looked ahead, and seen myself -- chained now like a dog, and going to die a dog&#x27;s death this day month! Anyhow, I must make a start.  How do people begin when they set to work to write their own sayings and doings?  There&#x27;s been a deal more doing than talking in my life -- it was the wrong sort -- more&#x27;s the pity. Well, let&#x27;s see; his parents were poor, but respectable.  That&#x27;s what they always say.  My parents were poor, and mother was as good a soul as ever broke bread, and wouldn&#x27;t have taken a shilling&#x27;s worth that wasn&#x27;t her own if she&#x27;d been starving.  But as for father, he&#x27;d been a poacher in England, a Lincolnshire man he was, and got sent out for it.  He wasn&#x27;t much more than a boy, he said, and it was only for a hare or two, which didn&#x27;t seem much. But I begin to think, being able to see the right of things a bit now, and having no bad grog inside of me to turn a fellow&#x27;s head upside down, as poaching must be something like cattle and horse duffing -- not the worst thing in the world itself, but mighty likely to lead to it. Dad had always been a hard-working, steady-going sort of chap, good at most things, and like a lot more of the Government men, as the convicts were always called round our part, he saved some money as soon as he had done his time, and married mother, who was a simple emigrant girl just out from Ireland.  Father was a square-built, good-looking chap, I believe, then; not so tall as I am by three inches, but wonderfully strong and quick on his pins.  They did say as he could hammer any man in the district before he got old and stiff. I never saw him `shape&#x27; but once, and then he rolled into a man big enough to eat him, and polished him off in a way that showed me -- though I was a bit of a boy then -- that he&#x27;d been at the game before. He didn&#x27;t ride so bad either, though he hadn&#x27;t had much of it where he came from; but he was afraid of nothing, and had a quiet way with colts.  He could make pretty good play in thick country, and ride a roughish horse, too. Well, our farm was on a good little flat, with a big mountain in front, and a scrubby, rangy country at the back for miles.  People often asked him why he chose such a place.  `It suits me,&#x27; he used to say, with a laugh, and talk of something else.  We could only raise about enough corn and potatoes, in a general way, for ourselves from the flat; but there were other chances and pickings which helped to make the pot boil, and them we&#x27;d have been a deal better without. First of all, though our cultivation paddock was small, and the good land seemed squeezed in between the hills, there was a narrow tract up the creek, and here it widened out into a large well-grassed flat.  This was where our cattle ran, for, of course, we had a team of workers and a few milkers when we came. No one ever took up a farm in those days without a dray and a team, a year&#x27;s rations, a few horses and milkers, pigs and fowls, and a little furniture.  They didn&#x27;t collar a 40-acre selection, as they do now -- spend all their money in getting the land and squat down as bare as robins -- a man with his wife and children all under a sheet of bark, nothing on their backs, and very little in their bellies.  However, some of them do pretty well, though they do say they have to live on &#x27;possums for a time. We didn&#x27;t do much, in spite of our grand start. The flat was well enough, but there were other places in the gullies beyond that that father had dropped upon when he was out shooting. He was a tremendous chap for poking about on foot or on horseback, and though he was an Englishman, he was what you call a born bushman. I never saw any man almost as was his equal.  Wherever he&#x27;d been once, there he could take you to again; and what was more, if it was in the dead of the night he could do it just the same. People said he was as good as a blackfellow, but I never saw one that was as good as he was, all round.  In a strange country, too. That was what beat me -- he&#x27;d know the way the creek run, and noticed when the cattle headed to camp, and a lot of things that other people couldn&#x27;t see, or if they did, couldn&#x27;t remember again. He was a great man for solitary walks, too -- he and an old dog he had, called Crib, a cross-bred mongrel-looking brute, most like what they call a lurcher in England, father said.  Anyhow, he could do most anything but talk.  He could bite to some purpose, drive cattle or sheep, catch a kangaroo, if it wasn&#x27;t a regular flyer, fight like a bulldog, and swim like a retriever, track anything, and fetch and carry, but bark he wouldn&#x27;t.  He&#x27;d stand and look at dad as if he worshipped him, and he&#x27;d make him some sign and off he&#x27;d go like a child that&#x27;s got a message. Why he was so fond of the old man we boys couldn&#x27;t make out. We were afraid of him, and as far as we could see he never patted or made much of Crib.  He thrashed him unmerciful as he did us boys. Still the dog was that fond of him you&#x27;d think he&#x27;d like to die for him there and then.  But dogs are not like boys, or men either -- better, perhaps. Well, we were all born at the hut by the creek, I suppose, for I remember it as soon as I could remember anything. It was a snug hut enough, for father was a good bush carpenter, and didn&#x27;t turn his back to any one for splitting and fencing, hut-building and shingle-splitting; he had had a year or two at sawing, too, but after he was married he dropped that.  But I&#x27;ve heard mother say that he took great pride in the hut when he brought her to it first, and said it was the best-built hut within fifty miles. He split every slab, cut every post and wallplate and rafter himself, with a man to help him at odd times; and after the frame was up, and the bark on the roof, he camped underneath and finished every bit of it -- chimney, flooring, doors, windows, and partitions -- by himself. Then he dug up a little garden in front, and planted a dozen or two peaches and quinces in it; put a couple of roses -- a red and a white one -- by the posts of the verandah, and it was all ready for his pretty Norah, as she says he used to call her then.  If I&#x27;ve heard her tell about the garden and the quince trees and the two roses once, I&#x27;ve heard her tell it a hundred times.  Poor mother! we used to get round her -- Aileen, and Jim, and I -- and say, `Tell us about the garden, mother.&#x27; She&#x27;d never refuse; those were her happy days, she always said. She used to cry afterwards -- nearly always. The first thing almost that I can remember was riding the old pony, &#x27;Possum, out to bring in the milkers.  Father was away somewhere, so mother took us all out and put me on the pony, and let me have a whip. Aileen walked alongside, and very proud I was.  My legs stuck out straight on the old pony&#x27;s fat back.  Mother had ridden him up when she came -- the first horse she ever rode, she said.  He was a quiet little old roan, with a bright eye and legs like gate-posts, but he never fell down with us boys, for all that.  If we fell off he stopped still and began to feed, so that he suited us all to pieces.  We soon got sharp enough to flail him along with a quince stick, and we used to bring up the milkers, I expect, a good deal faster than was good for them. After a bit we could milk, leg-rope, and bail up for ourselves, and help dad brand the calves, which began to come pretty thick. There were only three of us children -- my brother Jim, who was two years younger than I was, and then Aileen, who was four years behind him. I know we were both able to nurse the baby a while after she came, and neither of us wanted better fun than to be allowed to watch her, or rock the cradle, or as a great treat to carry her a few steps. Somehow we was that fond and proud of her from the first that we&#x27;d have done anything in the world for her.  And so we would now -- I was going to say -- but that poor Jim lies under a forest oak on a sandhill, and I -- well, I&#x27;m here, and if I&#x27;d listened to her advice I should have been a free man.  A free man!  How it sounds, doesn&#x27;t it? with the sun shining, and the blue sky over your head, and the birds twittering, and the grass beneath your feet! I wonder if I shall go mad before my time&#x27;s up. Mother was a Roman Catholic -- most Irishwomen are; and dad was a Protestant, if he was anything.  However, that says nothing.  People that don&#x27;t talk much about their religion, or follow it up at all, won&#x27;t change it for all that. So father, though mother tried him hard enough when they were first married, wouldn&#x27;t hear of turning, not if he was to be killed for it, as I once heard him say.  `No!&#x27; he says, `my father and grandfather, and all the lot, was Church people, and so I shall live and die. I don&#x27;t know as it would make much matter to me, but such as my notions is, I shall stick to &#x27;em as long as the craft holds together. You can bring up the girl in your own way; it&#x27;s made a good woman of you, or found you one, which is most likely, and so she may take her chance. But I stand for Church and King, and so shall the boys, as sure as my name&#x27;s Ben Marston.&#x27; Chapter 2 Father was one of those people that gets shut of a deal of trouble in this world by always sticking to one thing.  If he said he&#x27;d do this or that he always did it and nothing else.  As for turning him, a wild bull half-way down a range was a likelier try-on. So nobody ever bothered him after he&#x27;d once opened his mouth. They knew it was so much lost labour.  I sometimes thought Aileen was a bit like him in her way of sticking to things. But then she was always right, you see. So that clinched it.  Mother gave in like a wise woman, as she was. The clergyman from Bargo came one day and christened me and Jim -- made one job of it.  But mother took Aileen herself in the spring cart all the way to the township and had her christened in the chapel, in the middle of the service all right and regular, by Father Roche. There&#x27;s good and bad of every sort, and I&#x27;ve met plenty that were no chop of all churches; but if Father Roche, or Father anybody else, had any hand in making mother and Aileen half as good as they were, I&#x27;d turn to-morrow, if I ever got out again.  I don&#x27;t suppose it was the religion that made much difference in our case, for Patsey Daly and his three brothers, that lived on the creek higher up, were as much on the cross as men could be, and many a time I&#x27;ve seen them ride to chapel and attend mass, and look as if they&#x27;d never seen a `clearskin&#x27; in their lives.  Patsey was hanged afterwards for bush-ranging and gold robbery, and he had more than one man&#x27;s blood to answer for.  Now we weren&#x27;t like that; we never troubled the church one way or the other.  We knew we were doing what we oughtn&#x27;t to do, and scorned to look pious and keep two faces under one hood. By degrees we all grew older, began to be active and able to do half a man&#x27;s work.  We learned to ride pretty well -- at least, that is we could ride a bare-backed horse at full gallop through timber or down a range; could back a colt just caught and have him as quiet as an old cow in a week.  We could use the axe and the cross-cut saw, for father dropped that sort of work himself, and made Jim and I do all the rough jobs of mending the fences, getting firewood, milking the cows, and, after a bit, ploughing the bit of flat we kept in cultivation. Jim and I, when we were fifteen and thirteen -- he was bigger for his age than I was, and so near my own strength that I didn&#x27;t care about touching him -- were the smartest lads on the creek, father said -- he didn&#x27;t often praise us, either.  We had often ridden over to help at the muster of the large cattle stations that were on the side of the range, and not more than twenty or thirty miles from us. Some of our young stock used to stray among the squatters&#x27; cattle, and we liked attending the muster because there was plenty of galloping about and cutting out, and fun in the men&#x27;s hut at night, and often a half-crown or so for helping some one away with a big mob of cattle or a lot for the pound.  Father didn&#x27;t go himself, and I used to notice that whenever we came up and said we were Ben Marston&#x27;s boys both master and super looked rather glum, and then appeared not to think any more about it.  I heard the owner of one of these stations say to his managing man, `Pity, isn&#x27;t it? fine boys, too.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t understand what they meant.  I do now. We could do a few things besides riding, because, as I told you before, we had been to a bit of a school kept by an old chap that had once seen better days, that lived three miles off, near a little bush township. This village, like most of these places, had a public-house and a blacksmith&#x27;s shop.  That was about all.  The publican kept the store, and managed pretty well to get hold of all the money that was made by the people round about, that is of those that were `good drinking men&#x27;. He had half-a-dozen children, and, though he was not up to much, he wasn&#x27;t that bad that he didn&#x27;t want his children to have the chance of being better than himself.  I&#x27;ve seen a good many crooked people in my day, but very few that, though they&#x27;d given themselves up as a bad job, didn&#x27;t hope a bit that their youngsters mightn&#x27;t take after them. Curious, isn&#x27;t it?  But it is true, I can tell you.  So Lammerby, the publican, though he was a greedy, sly sort of fellow, that bought things he knew were stolen, and lent out money and charged everybody two prices for the things he sold &#x27;em, didn&#x27;t like the thought of his children growing up like Myall cattle, as he said himself, and so he fished out this old Mr. Howard, that had been a friend or a victim or some kind of pal of his in old times, near Sydney, and got him to come and keep school. He was a curious man, this Mr. Howard.  What he had been or done none of us ever knew, but he spoke up to one of the squatters that said something sharp to him one day in a way that showed us boys that he thought himself as good as he was.  And he stood up straight and looked him in the face, till we hardly could think he was the same man that was so bent and shambling and broken-down-looking most times. He used to live in a little hut in the township all by himself. It was just big enough to hold him and us at our lessons. He had his dinner at the inn, along with Mr. and Mrs. Lammerby. She was always kind to him, and made him puddings and things when he was ill. He was pretty often ill, and then he&#x27;d hear us our lessons at the bedside, and make a short day of it. Mostly he drank nothing but tea.  He used to smoke a good deal out of a big meerschaum pipe with figures on it that he used to show us when he was in a good humour.  But two or three times a year he used to set-to and drink for a week, and then school was left off till he was right.  We didn&#x27;t think much of that.  Everybody, almost, that we knew did the same -- all the men -- nearly all, that is -- and some of the women -- not mother, though; she wouldn&#x27;t have touched a drop of wine or spirits to save her life, and never did to her dying day. We just thought of it as if they&#x27;d got a touch of fever or sunstroke, or broke a rib or something.  They&#x27;d get over it in a week or two, and be all right again. All the same, poor old Mr. Howard wasn&#x27;t always on the booze, not by any manner of means.  He never touched a drop of anything, not even ginger-beer, while he was straight, and he kept us all going from nine o&#x27;clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, summer and winter, for more than six years.  Then he died, poor old chap -- found dead in his bed one morning.  Many a basting he gave me and Jim with an old malacca cane he had with a silver knob to it.  We were all pretty frightened of him.  He&#x27;d say to me and Jim and the other boys, `It&#x27;s the best chance of making men of yourselves you ever had, if you only knew it.  You&#x27;ll be rich farmers or settlers, perhaps magistrates, one of these days -- that is, if you&#x27;re not hanged. It&#x27;s you, I mean,&#x27; he&#x27;d say, pointing to me and Jim and the Dalys; `I believe some of you WILL be hanged unless you change a good deal. It&#x27;s cold blood and bad blood that runs in your veins, and you&#x27;ll come to earn the wages of sin some day.  It&#x27;s a strange thing,&#x27; he used to say, as if he was talking to himself, `that the girls are so good, while the boys are delivered over to the Evil One, except a case here and there.  Look at Mary Darcy and Jane Lammerby, and my little pet Aileen here.  I defy any village in Britain to turn out such girls -- plenty of rosy-cheeked gigglers -- but the natural refinement and intelligence of these little damsels astonishes me.&#x27; Well, the old man died suddenly, as I said, and we were all very sorry, and the school was broken up.  But he had taught us all to write fairly and to keep accounts, to read and spell decently, and to know a little geography.  It wasn&#x27;t a great deal, but what we knew we knew well, and I often think of what he said, now it&#x27;s too late, we ought to have made better use of it. After school broke up father said Jim and I knew quite as much as was likely to be any good to us, and we must work for our living like other people.  We&#x27;d always done a pretty fair share of that, and our hands were hard with using the axe and the spade, let alone holding the plough at odd times and harrowing, helping father to kill and brand, and a lot of other things, besides getting up while the stars were in the sky so as to get the cows milked early, before it was time to go to school. All this time we had lived in a free kind of way -- we wanted for nothing. We had plenty of good beef, and a calf now and then.  About this time I began to wonder how it was that so many cattle and horses passed through father&#x27;s hands, and what became of them. I hadn&#x27;t lived all my life on Rocky Creek, and among some of the smartest hands in that line that old New South Wales ever bred, without knowing what `clearskins&#x27; and `cross&#x27; beasts meant, and being well aware that our brand was often put on a calf that no cow of ours ever suckled.  Don&#x27;t I remember well the first calf I ever helped to put our letters on?  I&#x27;ve often wished I&#x27;d defied father, then taken my licking, and bolted away from home.  It&#x27;s that very calf and the things it led to that&#x27;s helped to put me where I am! Just as I sit here, and these cursed irons rattle whenever I move my feet, I can see that very evening, and father and the old dog with a little mob of our crawling cattle and half-a-dozen head of strangers, cows and calves, and a fat little steer coming through the scrub to the old stockyard. It was an awkward place for a yard, people used to say; scrubby and stony all round, a blind sort of hole -- you couldn&#x27;t see till you were right on the top of it.  But there was a `wing&#x27; ran out a good way through the scrub -- there&#x27;s no better guide to a yard like that -- and there was a sort of track cattle followed easy enough once you were round the hill.  Anyhow, between father and the dog and the old mare he always rode, very few beasts ever broke away. These strange cattle had been driven a good way, I could see. The cows and calves looked done up, and the steer&#x27;s tongue was out -- it was hottish weather; the old dog had been `heeling&#x27; him up too, for he was bleeding up to the hocks, and the end of his tail was bitten off. He was a savage old wretch was Crib.  Like all dogs that never bark -- and men too -- his bite was all the worse. `Go and get the brands -- confound you -- don&#x27;t stand there frightening the cattle,&#x27; says father, as the tired cattle, after smelling and jostling a bit, rushed into the yard. `You, Jim, make a fire, and look sharp about it.  I want to brand old Polly&#x27;s calf and another or two.&#x27;  Father came down to the hut while the brands were getting ready, and began to look at the harness-cask, which stood in a little back skillion.  It was pretty empty; we had been living on eggs, bacon, and bread and butter for a week. `Oh, mother! there&#x27;s such a pretty red calf in the yard,&#x27; I said, `with a star and a white spot on the flank; and there&#x27;s a yellow steer fat enough to kill!&#x27; `What!&#x27; said mother, turning round and looking at father with her eyes staring -- a sort of dark blue they were -- people used to say mine and Jim&#x27;s were the same colour -- and her brown hair pushed back off her face, as if she was looking at a ghost.  `Is it doing that again you are, after all you promised me, and you so nearly caught -- after the last one? Didn&#x27;t I go on my knees to ye to ask ye to drop it and lead a good life, and didn&#x27;t ye tell me ye&#x27;d never do the like again?  And the poor innocent children, too, I wonder ye&#x27;ve the heart to do it.&#x27; It came into my head now to wonder why the sergeant and two policemen had come down from Bargo, very early in the morning, about three months ago, and asked father to show them the beef in his cask, and the hide belonging to it.  I wondered at the time the beast was killed why father made the hide into a rope, and before he did that had cut out the brand and dropped it into a hot fire.  The police saw a hide with our brand on, all right -- killed about a fortnight. They didn&#x27;t know it had been taken off a cancered bullock, and that father took the trouble to `stick&#x27; him and bleed him before he took the hide off, so as it shouldn&#x27;t look dark. Father certainly knew most things in the way of working on the cross. I can see now he&#x27;d have made his money a deal easier, and no trouble of mind, if he&#x27;d only chosen to go straight. When mother said this, father looked at her for a bit as if he was sorry for it; then he straightened himself up, and an ugly look came into his face as he growled out -- `You mind your own business; we must live as well as other people. There&#x27;s squatters here that does as bad.  They&#x27;re just like the squires at home; think a poor man hasn&#x27;t a right to live. You bring the brand and look alive, Dick, or I&#x27;ll sharpen ye up a bit.&#x27; The brand was in the corner, but mother got between me and it, and stretched out her hand to father as if to stop me and him. `In God&#x27;s name,&#x27; she cried out, `aren&#x27;t ye satisfied with losing your own soul and bringing disgrace upon your family, but ye must be the ruin of your innocent children? Don&#x27;t touch the brand, Dick!&#x27; But father wasn&#x27;t a man to be crossed, and what made it worse he had a couple of glasses of bad grog in him.  There was an old villain of a shanty-keeper that lived on a back creek.  He&#x27;d been there as he came by and had a glass or two.  He had a regular savage temper, father had, though he was quiet enough and not bad to us when he was right. But the grog always spoiled him. He gave poor mother a shove which sent her reeling against the wall, where she fell down and hit her head against the stool, and lay there. Aileen, sitting down in the corner, turned white, and began to cry, while father catches me a box on the ear which sends me kicking, picks up the brand out of the corner, and walks out, with me after him. I think if I&#x27;d been another year or so older I&#x27;d have struck back -- I felt that savage about poor mother that I could have gone at him myself -- but we had been too long used to do everything he told us; and somehow, even if a chap&#x27;s father&#x27;s a bad one, he don&#x27;t seem like other men to him. So, as Jim had lighted the fire, we branded the little red heifer calf first -- a fine fat six-months-old nugget she was -- and then three bull calves, all strangers, and then Polly&#x27;s calf, I suppose just for a blind. Jim and I knew the four calves were all strangers, but we didn&#x27;t know the brands of the mothers; they all seemed different. After this all was made right to kill a beast.  The gallows was ready rigged in a corner of the yard; father brought his gun and shot the yellow steer. The calves were put into our calf-pen -- Polly&#x27;s and all -- and all the cows turned out to go where they liked. We helped father to skin and hang up the beast, and pretty late it was when we finished.  Mother had laid us out our tea and gone to bed with Aileen. We had ours and then went to bed.  Father sat outside and smoked in the starlight.  Hours after I woke up and heard mother crying. Before daylight we were up again, and the steer was cut up and salted and in the harness-cask soon after sunrise.  His head and feet were all popped into a big pot where we used to make soup for the pigs, and by the time it had been boiling an hour or two there was no fear of any one swearing to the yellow steer by `head-mark&#x27;. We had a hearty breakfast off the `skirt&#x27;, but mother wouldn&#x27;t touch a bit, nor let Aileen take any; she took nothing but a bit of bread and a cup of tea, and sat there looking miserable and downcast.  Father said nothing, but sat very dark-looking, and ate his food as if nothing was the matter. After breakfast he took his mare, the old dog followed; there was no need to whistle for him -- it&#x27;s my belief he knew more than many a Christian -- and away they went.  Father didn&#x27;t come home for a week -- he had got into the habit of staying away for days and days together. Then things went on the old way. Chapter 3 So the years went on -- slow enough they seemed to us sometimes -- the green winters, pretty cold, I tell you, with frost and hail-storms, and the long hot summers.  We were not called boys any longer, except by mother and Aileen, but took our places among the men of the district. We lived mostly at home, in the old way; sometimes working pretty hard, sometimes doing very little.  When the cows were milked and the wood chopped, there was nothing to do for the rest of the day.  The creek was that close that mother used to go and dip the bucket into it herself, when she wanted one, from a little wooden step above the clear reedy waterhole. Now and then we used to dig in the garden.  There was reaping and corn-pulling and husking for part of the year; but often, for weeks at a time, there was next to nothing to do.  No hunting worth much -- we were sick of kangarooing, like the dogs themselves, that as they grew old would run a little way and then pull up if a mob came, jump, jump, past them. No shooting, except a few ducks and pigeons.  Father used to laugh at the shooting in this country, and say they&#x27;d never have poachers here -- the game wasn&#x27;t worth it.  No fishing, except an odd codfish, in the deepest waterholes; and you might sit half a day without a bite. Now this was very bad for us boys.  Lads want plenty of work, and a little play now and then to keep them straight.  If there&#x27;s none, they&#x27;ll make it; and you can&#x27;t tell how far they&#x27;ll go when they once start. Well, Jim and I used to get our horses and ride off quietly in the afternoon, as if we were going after cattle; but, in reality, as soon as we were out of sight of mother, to ride over to that old villain, Grimes, the shanty-keeper, where we met the young Dalys, and others of the same sort -- talked a good deal of nonsense and gossip; what was worse played at all-fours and euchre, which we had learned from an American harvest hand, at one of the large farms. Besides playing for money, which put us rather into trouble sometimes, as we couldn&#x27;t always find a half-crown if we lost it, we learned another bad habit, and that was to drink spirits. What burning nasty stuff I thought it at first; and so did we all! But every one wanted to be thought a man, and up to all kinds of wickedness, so we used to make it a point of drinking our nobbler, and sometimes treating the others twice, if we had cash. There was another family that lived a couple of miles off, higher up the creek, and we had always been good friends with them, though they never came to our house, and only we boys went to theirs. They were the parents of the little girl that went to school with us, and a boy who was a year older than me. Their father had been a gardener at home, and he married a native girl who was born somewhere about the Hawkesbury, near Windsor. Her father had been a farmer, and many a time she told us how sorry she was to go away from the old place, and what fine corn and pumpkins they grew; and how they had a church at Windsor, and used to take their hay and fruit and potatoes to Sydney, and what a grand place Sydney was, with stone buildings called markets for people to sell fruit and vegetables and poultry in; and how you could walk down into Lower George Street and see Sydney Harbour, a great shining salt-water plain, a thousand times as big as the biggest waterhole, with ships and boats and sailors, and every kind of strange thing upon it. Mrs. Storefield was pretty fond of talking, and she was always fond of me, because once when she was out after the cows, and her man was away, and she had left Grace at home, the little thing crawled down to the waterhole and tumbled in.  I happened to be riding up with a message for mother, to borrow some soap, when I heard a little cry like a lamb&#x27;s, and there was poor little Gracey struggling in the water like a drowning kitten, with her face under.  Another minute or two would have finished her, but I was off the old pony and into the water like a teal flapper. I had her out in a second or two, and she gasped and cried a bit, but soon came to, and when Mrs. Storefield came home she first cried over her as if she would break her heart, and kissed her, and then she kissed me, and said, `Now, Dick Marston, you look here.  Your mother&#x27;s a good woman, though simple; your father I don&#x27;t like, and I hear many stories about him that makes me think the less we ought to see of the lot of you the better. But you&#x27;ve saved my child&#x27;s life to-day, and I&#x27;ll be a friend and a mother to you as long as I live, even if you turn out bad, and I&#x27;m rather afraid you will -- you and Jim both -- but it won&#x27;t be my fault for want of trying to keep you straight; and John and I will be your kind and loving friends as long as we live, no matter what happens.&#x27; After that -- it was strange enough -- but I always took to the little toddling thing that I&#x27;d pulled out of the water. I wasn&#x27;t very big myself, if it comes to that, and she seemed to have a feeling about it, for she&#x27;d come to me every time I went there, and sit on my knee and look at me with her big brown serious eyes -- they were just the same after she grew up -- and talk to me in her little childish lingo.  I believe she knew all about it, for she used to say, `Dick pull Gracey out of water;&#x27; and then she&#x27;d throw her arms round my neck and kiss me, and walk off to her mother. If I&#x27;d let her drown then, and tied a stone round my neck and dropped through the reeds to the bottom of the big waterhole, it would have been better for both of us. When John came home he was nearly as bad as the old woman, and wanted to give me a filly, but I wouldn&#x27;t have it, boy as I was. I never cared for money nor money&#x27;s worth, and I was not going to be paid for picking a kid out of the water. George Storefield, Gracey&#x27;s brother, was about my own age. He thought a lot of what I&#x27;d done for her, and years afterwards I threatened to punch his head if he said anything more about it. He laughed, and held out his hand. `You and I might have been better friends lately,&#x27; says he; `but don&#x27;t you forget you&#x27;ve got another brother besides Jim -- one that will stick to you, too, fair weather or foul.&#x27; I always had a great belief in George, though we didn&#x27;t get on over well, and often had fallings out.  He was too steady and hardworking altogether for Jim and me.  He worked all day and every day, and saved every penny he made.  Catch him gaffing! -- no, not for a sixpence. He called the Dalys and Jacksons thieves and swindlers, who would be locked up, or even hanged, some day, unless they mended themselves. As for drinking a glass of grog, you might just as soon ask him to take a little laudanum or arsenic. `Why should I drink grog,&#x27; he used to say -- `such stuff, too, as you get at that old villain Grimes&#x27;s -- with a good appetite and a good conscience? I&#x27;m afraid of no man; the police may come and live on my ground for what I care.  I work all day, have a read in the evening, and sleep like a top when I turn in.  What do I want more?&#x27; `Oh, but you never see any life,&#x27; Jim said; `you&#x27;re just like an old working bullock that walks up to the yoke in the morning and never stops hauling till he&#x27;s let go at night.  This is a free country, and I don&#x27;t think a fellow was born for that kind of thing and nothing else.&#x27; `This country&#x27;s like any other country, Jim,&#x27; George would say, holding up his head, and looking straight at him with his steady gray eyes; `a man must work and save when he&#x27;s young if he don&#x27;t want to be a beggar or a slave when he&#x27;s old.  I believe in a man enjoying himself as well as you do, but my notion of that is to have a good farm, well stocked and paid for, by and by, and then to take it easy, perhaps when my back is a little stiffer than it is now.&#x27; `But a man must have a little fun when he is young,&#x27; I said. `What&#x27;s the use of having money when you&#x27;re old and rusty, and can&#x27;t take pleasure in anything?&#x27; `A man needn&#x27;t be so very old at forty,&#x27; he says then, `and twenty years&#x27; steady work will put all of us youngsters well up the ladder.  Besides, I don&#x27;t call it fun getting half-drunk with a lot of blackguards at a low pothouse or a shanty, listening to the stupid talk and boasting lies of a pack of loafers and worse. They&#x27;re fit for nothing better; but you and Jim are.  Now, look here, I&#x27;ve got a small contract from Mr. Andrews for a lot of fencing stuff. It will pay us wages and something over.  If you like to go in with me, we&#x27;ll go share and share.  I know what hands you both are at splitting and fencing.  What do you say?&#x27; Jim, poor Jim, was inclined to take George&#x27;s offer.  He was that good-hearted that a kind word would turn him any time.  But I was put out at his laying it down so about the Dalys and us shantying and gaffing, and I do think now that some folks are born so as they can&#x27;t do without a taste of some sort of fun once in a way.  I can&#x27;t put it out clear, but it ought to be fixed somehow for us chaps that haven&#x27;t got the gift of working all day and every day, but can do two days&#x27; work in one when we like, that we should have our allowance of reasonable fun and pleasure -- that is, what we called pleasure, not what somebody thinks we ought to take pleasure in.  Anyway, I turned on George rather rough, and I says, `We&#x27;re not good enough for the likes of you, Mr. Storefield. It&#x27;s very kind of you to think of us, but we&#x27;ll take our own line and you take yours.&#x27; `I&#x27;m sorry for it, Dick, and more sorry that you take huff at an old friend. All I want is to do you good, and act a friend&#x27;s part.  Good-bye -- some day you&#x27;ll see it.&#x27; `You&#x27;re hard on George,&#x27; says Jim, `there&#x27;s no pleasing you to-day; one would think there were lots of chaps fighting how to give us a lift. Good-bye, George, old man; I&#x27;m sorry we can&#x27;t wire in with you; we&#x27;d soon knock out those posts and rails on the ironbark range.&#x27; `You&#x27;d better stop, Jim, and take a hand in the deal,&#x27; says I (or, rather, the devil, for I believe he gets inside a chap at times), `and then you and George can take a turn at local-preaching when you&#x27;re cut out.  I&#x27;m off.&#x27;  So without another word I jumped on to my horse and went off down the hill, across the creek, and over the boulders the other side, without much caring where I was going. The fact was, I felt I had acted meanly in sneering at a man who only said what he did for my good; and I wasn&#x27;t at all sure that I hadn&#x27;t made a breach between Gracey and myself, and, though I had such a temper when it was roused that all the world wouldn&#x27;t have stopped me, every time I thought of not seeing that girl again made my heart ache as if it would burst. I was nearly home before I heard the clatter of a horse&#x27;s feet, and Jim rode up alongside of me.  He was just the same as ever, with a smile on his face.  You didn&#x27;t often see it without one. I knew he had come after me, and had given up his own fancy for mine. `I thought you were going to stay and turn good,&#x27; I said.  `Why didn&#x27;t you?&#x27; `It might have been better for me if I had,&#x27; he said, `but you know very well, Dick, that whatever turns up, whether it&#x27;s for good or evil, you and I go together.&#x27; We looked at one another for a moment.  Our eyes met.  We didn&#x27;t say anything; but we understood one another as well as if we had talked for a week. We rode up to the door of our cottage without speaking.  The sun had set, and some of the stars had come out, early as it was, for it was late autumn. Aileen was sitting on a bench in the verandah reading, mother was working away as usual at something in the house. Mother couldn&#x27;t read or write, but you never caught her sitting with her hands before her.  Except when she was asleep I don&#x27;t think she ever was quite still. Aileen ran out to us, and stood while we let go our horses, and brought the saddles and bridles under the verandah. `I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re come home for one thing,&#x27; she said.  `There is a message from father.  He wants you to meet him.&#x27; `Who brought it?&#x27; I said. `One of the Dalys -- Patsey, I think.&#x27; `All right,&#x27; said Jim, kissing her as he lifted her up in his great strong arms.  `I must go in and have a gossip with the old woman. Aileen can tell me after tea.  I daresay it&#x27;s not so good that it won&#x27;t keep.&#x27; Mother was that fond of both of us that I believe, as sure as I sit here, she&#x27;d have put her head on the block, or died in any other way for either of her boys, not because it was her duty, but glad and cheerful like, to have saved us from death or disgrace. I think she was fonder of us two than she was of Aileen. Mothers are generally fonder of their sons.  Why I never could see; and if she thought more of one than the other it was Jim. He was the youngest, and he had that kind of big, frolicsome, loving way with him, like a Newfoundland pup about half-grown. I always used to think, somehow, nobody ever seemed to be able to get into a pelter with Jim, not even father, and that was a thing as some people couldn&#x27;t be got to believe.  As for mother and Aileen, they were as fond of him as if he&#x27;d been a big baby. So while he went to sit down on the stretcher, and let mother put her arms round his neck and hug him and cry over him, as she always did if he&#x27;d been away more than a day or two, I took a walk down the creek with Aileen in the starlight, to hear all about this message from father.  Besides, I could see that she was very serious over it, and I thought there might be something in it more than common. `First of all, did you make any agreement with George Storefield?&#x27; she said. `No; why should I?  Has he been talking to you about me? What right has he to meddle with my business?&#x27; `Oh, Dick, don&#x27;t talk like that.  Anything that he said was only to do you a kindness, and Jim.&#x27; `Hang him, and his kindness too,&#x27; I said.  `Let him keep it for those that want it.  But what did he tell you?&#x27; `He said, first of all,&#x27; answered poor Aileen, with the tears in her eyes, and trying to take hold of my hand, `that he had a contract for fencing timber, which he had taken at good prices, which he would share with you and Jim; that he knew you two and himself could finish it in a few weeks, and that he expected to get the contract for the timber for the new bridge at Dargo, which he would let you go shares in too. He didn&#x27;t like to speak about that, because it wasn&#x27;t certain; but he had calculated all the quantities and prices, and he was sure you would make 70 or 80 Pounds each before Christmas. Now, was there any harm in that; and don&#x27;t you think it was very good of him to think of it?&#x27; `Well, he&#x27;s not a bad fellow, old George,&#x27; I said, `but he&#x27;s a little too fond of interfering with other people&#x27;s business.  Jim and I are quite able to manage our own affairs, as I told him this evening, when I refused to have anything to do with his fencing arrangement.&#x27; `Oh, Dick, did you?&#x27; she said.  `What a pity!  I made sure Jim would have liked it so, for only last week he said he was sick and tired of having nothing to do -- that he should soon lose all his knack at using tools that he used to be so proud of. Didn&#x27;t he say he&#x27;d like to join George?&#x27; `He would, I daresay, and I told him to do as he liked. I came away by myself, and only saw him just before we crossed the range. He&#x27;s big enough and old enough to take his own line.&#x27; `But you know he thinks so much of you,&#x27; she groaned out, `that he&#x27;d follow you to destruction.  That will be the end of it, depend upon it, Dick.  I tell you so now; you&#x27;ve taken to bad ways; you&#x27;ll have his blood on your head yet.&#x27; `Jim&#x27;s old enough and big enough to take care of himself,&#x27; I said sulkily. `If he likes to come my way I won&#x27;t hinder him; I won&#x27;t try to persuade him one way or the other.  Let him take his own line; I don&#x27;t believe in preaching and old women&#x27;s talk.  Let a man act and think for himself.&#x27; `You&#x27;ll break my heart and poor mother&#x27;s, too,&#x27; said Aileen, suddenly taking both my hands in hers.  `What has she done but love us ever since we were born, and what does she live for?  You know she has no pleasure of any kind, you know she&#x27;s afraid every morning she wakes that the police will get father for some of his cross doings; and now you and Jim are going the same wild way, and what ever -- what ever will be the end of it?&#x27; Here she let go my hands, and sobbed and cried as if she was a child again, much as I remember her doing one day when my kangaroo dog killed her favourite cat.  And Aileen was a girl that didn&#x27;t cry much generally, and never about anything that happened to herself; it was always about somebody else and their misfortunes.  She was a quiet girl, too, very determined, and not much given to talking about what she was going to do; but when she made up her mind she was sure to stick to it.  I used to think she was more like father than any of us.  She had his coloured hair and eyes, and his way of standing and looking, as if the whole world wouldn&#x27;t shift him.  But she&#x27;d mother&#x27;s soft heart for all that, and I took the more notice of her crying and whimpering this time because it was so strange for her. If any one could have seen straight into my heart just then I was regularly knocked over, and had two minds to go inside to Jim and tell him we&#x27;d take George&#x27;s splitting job, and start to tackle it first thing to-morrow morning; but just then one of those confounded night-hawks flitted on a dead tree before us and began his `hoo-ho&#x27;, as if it was laughing at me.  I can see the place now -- the mountain black and dismal, the moon low and strange-looking, the little waterhole glittering in the half-light, and this dark bird hooting away in the night.  An odd feeling seemed to come over my mind, and if it had been the devil himself standing on the dead limb it could not have had a worse effect on me as I stopped there, uncertain whether to turn to the right or the left. We don&#x27;t often know in this world sometimes whether we are turning off along a road where we shall never come back from, or whether we can go just a little way and look at the far-off hills and new rivers, and come home safe. I remember the whole lot of bad-meaning thoughts coming with a rush over my heart, and I laughed at myself for being so soft as to choose a hard-working, pokey kind of life at the word of a slow fellow like George, when I might be riding about the country on a fine horse, eating and drinking of the best, and only doing what people said half the old settlers had made their money by. Poor Aileen told me afterwards that if she&#x27;d thought for a moment I could be turned she&#x27;d have gone down on her knees and never got up till I promised to keep straight and begin to work at honest daily labour like a man -- like a man who hoped to end his days in a good house, on a good farm, with a good wife and nice children round him, and not in a prison cell.  Some people would call the first, after years of honest work, and being always able to look every one in the face, being more of a man than the other.  But people have different ways and different ideas. `Come, Ailie,&#x27; I said, `are you going to whine and cry all night? I shall be afraid to come home if you&#x27;re going to be like this. What&#x27;s the message from father?&#x27; She wiped away her tears, and, putting her hand on my shoulder, looked steadily into my face. `Poor boy -- poor, dear Dick,&#x27; she said, `I feel as if I should see that fresh face of yours looking very different some day or other. Something tells me that there&#x27;s bad luck before you.  But never mind, you&#x27;ll never lose your sister if the luck&#x27;s ever so bad.  Father sent word you and Jim were to meet him at Broken Creek and bring your whips with you.&#x27; `What in the world&#x27;s that for?&#x27; I said, half speaking to myself. `It looks as if there was a big mob to drive, and where&#x27;s he to get a big mob there in that mountainous, beastly place, where the cattle all bolt like wallabies, and where I never saw twenty head together?&#x27; `He&#x27;s got some reason for it,&#x27; said Aileen sorrowfully.  `If I were you I wouldn&#x27;t go.  It&#x27;s no good, and father&#x27;s trying now to drag you and Jim into the bad ways he&#x27;s been following these years.&#x27; `How do you know it&#x27;s so bad?&#x27; said I.  `How can a girl like you know?&#x27; `I know very well,&#x27; she said.  `Do you think I&#x27;ve lived here all these years and don&#x27;t know things?  What makes him always come home after dark, and be that nervous every time he sees a stranger coming up you&#x27;d think he was come out of gaol?  Why has he always got money, and why does mother look so miserable when he&#x27;s at home, and cheer up when he goes away?&#x27; `He may get jobs of droving or something,&#x27; I said.  `You have no right to say that he&#x27;s robbing, or something of that sort, because he doesn&#x27;t care about tying himself to mother&#x27;s apron-string.&#x27; Aileen laughed, but it was more like crying. `You told me just now,&#x27; she said -- oh! so sorrowfully -- `that you and Jim were old enough to take a line of your own. Why don&#x27;t you do it now?&#x27; `And tell father we&#x27;ll have nothing more to do with him!&#x27; `Why not?&#x27; she said, standing up straight before me, and facing me just as I saw father face the big bullock-driver before he knocked him down. `Why not?  You need never ask him for another meal; you can earn an easy living in half-a-dozen ways, you and Jim.  Why should you let him spoil your life and ruin your soul for evermore?&#x27; `The priest put that into your head,&#x27; I said sneeringly; `Father Doyle -- of course he knows what they&#x27;ll do with a fellow after he&#x27;s dead.&#x27; `No!&#x27; she said, `Father Doyle never said a word about you that wasn&#x27;t good and kind.  He says mother&#x27;s a good Catholic, and he takes an interest in you boys and me because of her.&#x27; `He can persuade you women to do anything,&#x27; I said, not that I had any grudge against poor old Father Doyle, who used to come riding up the rough mountain track on his white horse, and tiring his old bones, just `to look after his flock,&#x27; as he said -- and nice lambs some of them were -- but I wanted to tease her and make her break off with this fancy of hers. `He never does, and couldn&#x27;t persuade me, except for my good,&#x27; said she, getting more and more roused, and her black eyes glowed again, `and I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll do to prove it.  It&#x27;s a sin, but if it is I&#x27;ll stand by it, and now I&#x27;ll swear it (here she knelt down), as Almighty God shall help me at the last day, if you and Jim will promise me to start straight off up the country and take bush-work till shearing comes on, and never to have any truck with cross chaps and their ways, I&#x27;ll turn Protestant.  I&#x27;ll go to church with you, and keep to it till I die.&#x27; Wasn&#x27;t she a trump?  I&#x27;ve known women that would give up a lot for a man they were sweet on, and wives that would follow their husbands about like spaniels, and women that would lie and deceive and all but rob and murder for men they were fond of, and sometimes do nearly as much to spite other women.  But I don&#x27;t think I ever knew a woman that would give up her religion for any one before, and it&#x27;s not as if she wasn&#x27;t staunch to her own faith.  She was as regular in her prayers and crossings and beads and all the rest of it as mother herself, and if there ever was a good girl in the whole world she was one.  She turned faint as she said this, and I thought she was going to drop down.  If anything could have turned me then it would have been this. It was almost like giving her life for ours, and I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;d have valued hers two straws if she could have saved us. There&#x27;s a great deal said about different kinds of love in this world, but I can&#x27;t help thinking that the love between brothers and sisters that have been brought up together and have had very few other people to care about is a higher, better sort than any other in the world. There&#x27;s less selfishness about it -- no thought but for the other&#x27;s good. If that can be made safe, death and pain and poverty and misery are all little things.  And wasn&#x27;t I fond of Aileen, in spite of all my hardness and cross-grained obstinacy? -- so fond that I was just going to hug her to me and say, `Take it all your own way, Ailie dear,&#x27; when Jim came tearing out of the hut, bareheaded, and stood listening to a far-off sound that caught all our ears at once.  We made out the source of it too well -- far too well. What was the noise at that hour of the night? It was a hollow, faint, distant roaring that gradually kept getting louder. It was the strange mournful bellowing that comes from a drove of cattle forced along an unknown track.  As we listened the sound came clearly on the night wind, faint, yet still clearly coming nearer. `Cattle being driven,&#x27; Jim cried out; `and a big mob too.  It&#x27;s father -- for a note.  Let&#x27;s get our horses and meet him.&#x27; Chapter 4 `All right,&#x27; said I, `he must have got there a day before his time. It is a big mob and no mistake.  I wonder where they&#x27;re taking them to.&#x27; Aileen shrugged her shoulders and walked in to mother with a look of misery and despair on her face such as I never saw there before. She knew it was no use talking to me now.  The idea of going out to meet a large lot of unknown cattle had strongly excited us, as would have been the case with every bush-bred lad.  All sorts of wonders passed through our minds as we walked down the creek bank, with our bridles in our hands, towards where our horses usually fed. One was easy to catch, the other with a little management was secured. In ten minutes we were riding fast through the dark trees and fallen timber towards the wild gullies and rock-strewed hills of Broken Creek. It was not more than an hour when we got up to the cattle. We could hear them a good while before we saw them.  `My word,&#x27; said Jim, `ain&#x27;t they restless.  They can&#x27;t have come far, or they wouldn&#x27;t roar so. Where can the old man have &quot;touched&quot; for them?&#x27; `How should I know?&#x27; I said roughly.  I had a kind of idea, but I thought he would never be so rash. When we got up I could see the cattle had been rounded up in a flat with stony ridges all round.  There must have been three or four hundred of them, only a man and a boy riding round and wheeling them every now and then. Their horses were pretty well knocked up.  I knew father at once, and the old chestnut mare he used to ride -- an animal with legs like timbers and a mule rump; but you couldn&#x27;t tire her, and no beast that ever was calved could get away from her.  The boy was a half-caste that father had picked up somewhere; he was as good as two men any day. `So you&#x27;ve come at last,&#x27; growled father, `and a good thing too. I didn&#x27;t expect to be here till to-morrow morning.  The dog came home, I suppose -- that&#x27;s what brought you here, wasn&#x27;t it? I thought the infernal cattle would beat Warrigal and me, and we&#x27;d have all our trouble for nothing.&#x27; `Whose cattle are they, and what are you going to do with them?&#x27; `Never you mind; ask no questions, and you&#x27;ll see all about it to-morrow. I&#x27;ll go and take a snooze now; I&#x27;ve had no sleep for three nights.&#x27; With our fresh horses and riding round so we kept the cattle easily enough. We did not tell Warrigal he might go to rest, not thinking a half-caste brat like him wanted any.  He didn&#x27;t say anything, but went to sleep on his horse, which walked in and out among the angry cattle as he sat on the saddle with his head down on the horse&#x27;s neck. They sniffed at him once or twice, some of the old cows, but none of them horned him; and daylight came rather quicker than one would think. Then we saw whose cattle they were; they had all Hunter&#x27;s and Falkland&#x27;s brands on, which showed that they belonged to Banda and Elingamah stations. `By George!&#x27; says Jim, `they&#x27;re Mr. Hunter&#x27;s cattle, and all these circle dots belong to Banda.  What a mob of calves! not one of them branded! What in the world does father intend to do with them?&#x27; Father was up, and came over where we stood with our horses in our hands before we had time to say more.  He wasn&#x27;t one of those that slept after daylight, whether he had work to do or not. He certainly COULD work; daylight or dark, wet or dry, cold or hot, it was all one to father.  It seems a pity what he did was no use to him, as it turned out; for he was a man, was old dad, every inch of him. `Now, boys,&#x27; he said, quite brisk and almost good-natured for him, `look alive and we&#x27;ll start the cattle; we&#x27;ve been long enough here; let &#x27;em head up that gully, and I&#x27;ll show you something you&#x27;ve never seen before for as long as you&#x27;ve known Broken Creek Ranges.&#x27; `But where are you going to take &#x27;em to?&#x27; I said.  `They&#x27;re all Mr. Hunter&#x27;s and Mr. Falkland&#x27;s; the brands are plain enough.&#x27; `Are the calves branded, you blasted fool?&#x27; he said, while the black look came over his face that had so often frightened me when I was a child. `You do what I tell you if you&#x27;ve any pluck and gumption about you; or else you and your brother can ride over to Dargo Police Station and &quot;give me away&quot; if you like; only don&#x27;t come home again, I warn you, sons or no sons.&#x27; If I had done what I had two minds to do -- for I wasn&#x27;t afraid of him then, savage as he looked -- told him to do his own duffing and ridden away with Jim there and then -- poor Jim, who sat on his horse staring at both of us, and saying nothing -- how much better it would have been for all of us, the old man as well as ourselves; but it seemed as if it wasn&#x27;t to be. Partly from use, and partly from a love of danger and something new, which is at the bottom of half the crime in the bush districts, I turned my horse&#x27;s head after the cattle, which were now beginning to straggle.  Jim did the same on his side.  How easy is it for chaps to take the road to hell! for that was about the size of it, and we were soon too busy to think about much else. The track we were driving on led along a narrow rocky gully which looked as if it had been split up or made out of a crack in the earth thousands of years ago by an earthquake or something of that kind. The hills were that steep that every now and then some of the young cattle that were not used to that sort of country would come sliding down and bellow as if they thought they were going to break their necks. The water rushed down it like a torrent in wet winters, and formed a sort of creek, and the bed of it made what track there was. There were overhanging rocks and places that made you giddy to look at, and some of these must have fallen down and blocked up the creek at one time or other.  We had to scramble round them the best way we could. When we got nearly up to the head of the gully -- and great work it was to force the footsore cattle along, as we couldn&#x27;t use our whips overmuch -- Jim called out -- `Why, here comes old Crib.  Who&#x27;d have thought he&#x27;d have seen the track? Well done, old man.  Now we&#x27;re right.&#x27; Father never took any notice of the poor brute as he came limping along the stones.  Woman or child, horse or dog, it&#x27;s the same old thing -- the more any creature loves a man in this world the worse they&#x27;re treated. It looks like it, at any rate.  I saw how it was; father had given Crib a cruel beating the night before, when he was put out for some trifling matter, and the dog had left him and run home.  But now he had thought better of it, and seen our tracks and come to work and slave, with his bleeding feet -- for they were cut all to pieces -- and got the whip across his back now and then for his pains. It&#x27;s a queer world! When we got right to the top of this confounded gully, nearly dead-beat all of us, and only for the dog heeling them up every now and then, and making his teeth nearly meet in them, without a whimper, I believe the cattle would have charged back and beat us. There was a sort of rough table-land -- scrubby and stony and thick it was, but still the grass wasn&#x27;t bad in summer, when the country below was all dried up.  There were wild horses in troops there, and a few wild cattle, so Jim and I knew the place well; but it was too far and too much of a journey for our own horses to go often. `Do you see that sugar-loaf hill with the bald top, across the range?&#x27; said father, riding up just then, as we were taking it easy a little. `Don&#x27;t let the cattle straggle, and make straight for that.&#x27; `Why, it&#x27;s miles away,&#x27; said Jim, looking rather dismal. `We could never get &#x27;em there.&#x27; `We&#x27;re not going there, stupid,&#x27; says father; `that&#x27;s only the line to keep. I&#x27;ll show you something about dinner-time that&#x27;ll open your eyes a bit.&#x27; Poor Jim brightened up at the mention of dinner-time, for, boylike, he was getting very hungry, and as he wasn&#x27;t done growing he had no end of an appetite.  I was hungry enough for the matter of that, but I wouldn&#x27;t own to it. `Well, we shall come to somewhere, I suppose,&#x27; says Jim, when father was gone. `Blest if I didn&#x27;t think he was going to keep us wandering in this blessed Nulla Mountain all day.  I wish I&#x27;d never seen the blessed cattle.  I was only waiting for you to hook it when we first seen the brands by daylight, and I&#x27;d ha&#x27; been off like a brindle &quot;Mickey&quot; down a range.&#x27; `Better for us if we had,&#x27; I said; `but it&#x27;s too late now. We must stick to it, I suppose.&#x27; We had kept the cattle going for three or four miles through the thickest of the country, every now and then steering our course by the clear round top of Sugarloaf, that could be seen for miles round, but never seemed to get any nearer, when we came on a rough sort of log-fence, which ran the way we were going. `I didn&#x27;t think there were any farms up here,&#x27; I said to Jim. `It&#x27;s a &quot;break&quot;,&#x27; he said, almost in a whisper.  `There&#x27;s a &quot;duffing-yard&quot; somewhere handy; that&#x27;s what&#x27;s the matter.&#x27; `Keep the cattle along it, anyway.  We&#x27;ll soon see what it leads to.&#x27; The cattle ran along the fence, as if they expected to get to the end of their troubles soon.  The scrub was terribly thick in places, and every now and then there was a break in the fence, when one of us had to go outside and hunt them until we came to the next bit. At last we came to a little open kind of flat, with the scrub that thick round it as you couldn&#x27;t hardly ride through it, and, just as Jim said, there was the yard. It was a `duffing-yard&#x27; sure enough.  No one but people who had cattle to hide and young stock they didn&#x27;t want other people to see branded would have made a place there. Just on the south side of the yard, which was built of great heavy stringy-bark trees cut down in the line of the fence, and made up with limbs and logs, the range went up as steep as the side of a house. The cattle were that tired and footsore -- half their feet were bleeding, poor devils -- that they ran in through the sliprails and began to lay down. `Light a fire, one of you boys,&#x27; says father, putting up the heavy sliprails and fastening them.  `We must brand these calves before dark.  One of you can go to that gunyah, just under the range where that big white rock is, and you&#x27;ll find tea and sugar and something to eat.&#x27; Jim rushed off at once, while I sulkily began to put some bark and twigs together and build a fire. `What&#x27;s the use of all this cross work?&#x27; I said to father; `we&#x27;re bound to be caught some day if we keep on at it.  Then there&#x27;ll be no one left to take care of mother and Aileen.&#x27; He looked rather struck at this, and then said quietly -- `You and your brother can go back now.  Never say I kept you against your will.  You may as well lend a hand to brand these calves; then you may clear out as soon as you like.&#x27; Well, I didn&#x27;t quite like leaving the old chap in the middle of the work like that.  I remember thinking, like many another young fool, I suppose, that I could draw back in time, just after I&#x27;d tackled this job. Draw back, indeed!  When does a man ever get the chance of doing that, once he&#x27;s regularly gone in for any of the devil&#x27;s work and wages? He takes care there isn&#x27;t much drawing back afterwards.  So I said -- `We may as well give you a hand with this lot; but we&#x27;ll go home then, and drop all this duffing work.  It don&#x27;t pay.  I&#x27;m old enough to know that, and you&#x27;ll find it out yet, I expect, father, yourself.&#x27; `The fox lives long, and gives the hounds many a long chase before he&#x27;s run into,&#x27; he said, with a grim chuckle.  `I swore I&#x27;d be revenged on &#x27;em all when they locked me up and sent me out here for a paltry hare; broke my old mother&#x27;s heart, so it did.  I&#x27;ve had a pound for every hair in her skin, and I shall go on till I die.  After all, if a man goes to work cautious and runs mute it&#x27;s not so easy to catch him in this country, at any rate.&#x27; Jim at this came running out of the cave with a face of joy, a bag of ship-biscuit, and a lot of other things. `Here&#x27;s tea and sugar,&#x27; he said; `and there&#x27;s biscuits and jam, and a big lump of cheese.  Get the fire right, Dick, while I get some water. We&#x27;ll soon have some tea, and these biscuits are jolly.&#x27; The tea was made, and we all had a good meal.  Father found a bottle of rum, too; he took a good drink himself, and gave Jim and me a sip each.  I felt less inclined to quarrel with father after that. So we drafted all the calves into a small pen-yard, and began to put our brand on them as quick as we could catch &#x27;em. A hundred and sixty of &#x27;em altogether -- all ages, from a month old to nearly a year.  Fine strong calves, and in rare condition, too. We could see they were all belonging to Mr. Hunter and Mr. Falkland. How they came to leave them all so long unbranded I can&#x27;t say. Very careless they often are on these large cattle-stations, so that sharp people like father and the Dalys, and a lot more, get an easy chance at them. Whatever father was going to do with them all when he had branded &#x27;em, we couldn&#x27;t make out. `There&#x27;s no place to tail or wean &#x27;em,&#x27; whispered Jim.  `We&#x27;re not above thirty miles from Banda in a straight line.  These cows are dead sure to make straight back the very minute they&#x27;re let out, and very nice work it&#x27;ll look with all these calves with our brand on sucking these cows.&#x27; Father happened to come round for a hot brand just as Jim finished. `Never you mind about the weaning,&#x27; he snarled.  `I shan&#x27;t ask you to tail them either.  It wouldn&#x27;t be a nice job here, would it?&#x27; and father actually laughed.  It wasn&#x27;t a very gay kind of a laugh, and he shut up his mouth with a sort of snap again. Jim and I hadn&#x27;t seen him laugh for I don&#x27;t know how long, and it almost frightened us. As Jim said, it wouldn&#x27;t do to let the cattle out again. If calves are weaned, and have only one brand on, it is very hard for any man to swear that they are not the property of the man to whom that brand belongs. He may believe them to be his, but may never have seen them in his life; and if he has seen them on a camp or on the run, it&#x27;s very hard to swear to any one particular red or spotted calf as you would to a horse. The great dart is to keep the young stock away from their mothers until they forget one another, and then most of the danger is past. But if calves with one man&#x27;s brand on are seen sucking another man&#x27;s cows, it is pretty plain that the brand on the calves has been put on without the consent of the owner of the cows -- which is cattle-stealing; a felony, according to the Act 7 and 8 George IV, No. 29, punishable with three years&#x27; imprisonment, with hard labour on the roads of the colony or other place, as the Judge may direct. There&#x27;s a lot of law!  How did I learn it?  I had plenty of time in Berrima Gaol -- worse luck -- my first stretch.  But it was after I&#x27;d done the foolishness, and not before. Chapter 5 `Now then, you boys!&#x27; says father, coming up all of a sudden like, and bringing out his words as if it was old times with us, when we didn&#x27;t know whether he&#x27;d hit first and talk afterwards, or the other way on, `get out the lot we&#x27;ve just branded, and drive &#x27;em straight for that peak, where the water shines dripping over the stones, right again the sun, and look slippy; we&#x27;re burning daylight, and these cows are making row enough, blast &#x27;em! to be heard all the way to Banda.  I&#x27;ll go on and steady the lead; you keep &#x27;em close up to me.&#x27; Father mounted the old mare.  The dog stopped behind; he knew he&#x27;d have to mind the tail -- that is the hindmost cattle -- and stop &#x27;em from breaking or running clear away from the others.  We threw down the rails. Away the cattle rushed out, all in a long string.  You&#x27;d &#x27;a thought no mortal men could &#x27;a kept &#x27;em in that blind hole of a place. But father headed &#x27;em, and turned &#x27;em towards the peak. The dog worried those that wanted to stay by the yard or turn another way. We dropped our whip on &#x27;em, and kept &#x27;em going.  In five minutes they were all a-moving along in one mob at a pretty sharpish trot like a lot of store cattle.  Father knew his way about, whether the country was thick or open.  It was all as one to him. What a slashing stockman he would have made in new country, if he only could have kept straight. It took us an hour&#x27;s hard dinkum to get near the peak.  Sometimes it was awful rocky, as well as scrubby, and the poor devils of cattle got as sore-footed as babies -- blood up to the knee, some of &#x27;em; but we crowded &#x27;em on; there was no help for it. At last we rounded up on a flat, rocky, open kind of a place; and here father held up his hand. `Let &#x27;em ring a bit; some of their tongues are out.  These young things is generally soft.  Come here, Dick.&#x27;  I rode up, and he told me to follow him. We walked our horses up to the edge of the mountain and looked over. It was like the end of the world.  Far down there was a dark, dreadful drop into a sort of deep valley below.  You couldn&#x27;t see the bottom of it. The trees on the mountain side looked like bushes, and they were big ironbarks and messmates too.  On three sides of us was this awful, desolate-looking precipice -- a dreary, gloomy, God-forsaken kind of spot. The sky got cloudy, and the breeze turned cold and began to murmur and whistle in an odd, unnatural kind of way, while father, seeing how scared and puzzled I was, began to laugh.  I shuddered.  A thought crossed my mind that it might be the Enemy of Souls, in his shape, going to carry us off for doing such a piece of wickedness. `Looks queer, doesn&#x27;t it?&#x27; says father, going to the brink and kicking down a boulder, that rolled and crashed down the steep mountain side, tearing its way through scrub and heath till it settled down in the glen below.  `It won&#x27;t do for a man&#x27;s horse to slip, will it, boy? And yet there&#x27;s a track here into a fine large paddock, open and clear, too, where I&#x27;m going to put these cattle into.&#x27; I stared at him, without speaking, thinking was he mad. `No! the old man isn&#x27;t mad, youngster,&#x27; he said; `not yet, at least. I&#x27;m going to show you a trick that none of you native boys are up to, smart as you think yourselves.&#x27;  Here he got off the old mare, and began to lead her to the edge of the mountain. `Now, you rally the cattle well after me,&#x27; he said; `they&#x27;ll follow the old mare after a bit.  I left a few cows among &#x27;em on purpose, and when they &quot;draw&quot; keep &#x27;em going well up, but not too fast.&#x27; He had lengthened the bridle of the mare, and tied the end of a light tether rope that he had round her neck to it. I saw her follow him slowly, and turn down a rocky track that seemed to lead straight over a bluff of the precipice. However, I gave the word to `head on&#x27;.  The dog had started rounding &#x27;em up as soon as he saw the old mare walk towards the mountain side, and the cattle were soon crushed up pretty close to the mare&#x27;s heels. Mind this, that they were so footsore and tender about the hoofs that they could not have run away from us on foot if they had tried. After `ringing&#x27; a bit, one of the quiet cows followed up the old mare that was walking step by step forward, and all the rest followed her like sheep.  Cattle will do that.  I&#x27;ve seen a stockrider, when all the horses were dead beat, trying to get fat cattle to take a river in flood, jump off and turn his horse loose into the stream. If he went straight, and swam across, all the cattle would follow him like sheep. Well, when the old mare got to the bluff she turned short round to the right, and then I saw that she had struck a narrow path down a gully that got deeper and deeper every yard we went.  There was just room for a couple or three calves to go abreast, and by and by all of &#x27;em was walking down it like as if they was the beasts agoing into Noah&#x27;s Ark. It wound and wound and got deeper and deeper till the walls of rock were ever so far above our heads.  Our work was done then; the cattle had to walk on like sheep in a race.  We led our horses behind them, and the dog walked along, saving his sore feet as well as he could, and never tried to bite a beast once he got within the walls. He looked quite satisfied, and kept chuckling almost to himself. I really believe I&#x27;ve seen dogs laugh.  Once upon a time I&#x27;ve read of they&#x27;d have taken poor Crib for a familiar spirit, and hanged or burnt him. Well, he knew a lot, and no mistake.  I&#x27;ve seen plenty of Christians as he could buy and sell, and no trouble to him.  I&#x27;m dashed if the old mare, too, didn&#x27;t take a pleasure in working cattle on the cross. She was the laziest old wretch bringing up the cows at home, or running in the horses.  Many a time Jim and I took a turn out of her when father didn&#x27;t know.  But put her after a big mob of cattle -- she must have known they couldn&#x27;t be ours -- and she&#x27;d clatter down a range like the wall of a house, and bite and kick the tail cattle if they didn&#x27;t get out of her way.  They say dogs and horses are all honest, and it&#x27;s only us as teaches &#x27;em to do wrong.  My notion&#x27;s they&#x27;re a deal like ourselves, and some of &#x27;em fancies the square racket dull and safe, while some takes a deal kindlier to the other.  Anyhow, no cattle-duffer in the colonies could have had a better pair of mates than old Sally and Crib, if the devil himself had broken &#x27;em in special for the trade. It was child&#x27;s play now, as far as the driving went.  Jim and I walked along, leading our horses and yarning away as we used to do when we were little chaps bringing in the milkers. `My word, Dick, dad&#x27;s dropped into a fine road through this thundering mountain, hasn&#x27;t he?  I wonder where it leads to? How high the rock-walls are getting above us!&#x27; he says.  `I know now. I think I heard long ago from one of the Crosbies of a place in the ranges down towards behind the Nulla Mountain, &quot;Terrible Hollow&quot;. He didn&#x27;t know about it himself, but said an old stockman told him about it when he was drunk.  He said the Government men used to hide the cattle and horses there in old times, and that it was never found out.&#x27; `Why wasn&#x27;t it found out, Jim?  If the old fellow &quot;split&quot; about it some one else would get to know.&#x27; `Well, old Dan said that they killed one man that talked of telling; the rest were too frightened after that, and they all swore a big oath never to tell any one except he was on the cross.&#x27; `That&#x27;s how dad come to know, I suppose,&#x27; said Jim.  `I wish he never had. I don&#x27;t care about those cross doings.  I never did.  I never seen any good come out of them yet.&#x27; `Well, we must go through with it now, I suppose.  It won&#x27;t do to leave old dad in the lurch.  You won&#x27;t, will you, Jim?&#x27; `You know very well I won&#x27;t,&#x27; says Jim, very soberlike.  `I don&#x27;t like it any the more for that.  But I wish father had broke his leg, and was lying up at home, with mother nursing him, before he found out this hell-hole of a place.&#x27; `Well, we&#x27;re going to get out of it, and soon too.  The gully seems getting wider, and I can see a bit of open country through the trees.&#x27; `Thank God for that!&#x27; says Jim.  `My boots&#x27;ll part company soon, and the poor devils of calves won&#x27;t have any hoofs either, if there&#x27;s much more of this.&#x27; `They&#x27;re drawing faster now.  The leading cattle are beginning to run. We&#x27;re at the end of the drive.&#x27; So it was.  The deep, rocky gully gradually widened into an open and pretty smooth flat; this, again, into a splendid little plain, up to the knees in grass; a big natural park, closed round on every side with sandstone rockwalls, as upright as if they were built, and a couple of thousand feet above the place where we stood. This scrub country was crossed by two good creeks; it was several miles across, and a trifle more in length.  Our hungry weaners spread out and began to feed, without a notion of their mothers they&#x27;d left behind; but they were not the only ones there. We could see other mobs of cattle, some near, some farther off; horses, too; and the well-worn track in several ways showed that this was no new grazing ground. Father came riding back quite comfortable and hearty-like for him. `Welcome to Terrible Hollow, lads,&#x27; says he.  `You&#x27;re the youngest chaps it has ever been shown to, and if I didn&#x27;t know you were the right stuff, you&#x27;d never have seen it, though you&#x27;re my own flesh and blood. Jump off, and let your horses go.  They can&#x27;t get away, even if they tried; they don&#x27;t look much like that.&#x27; Our poor nags were something like the cattle, pretty hungry and stiff. They put their heads down to the thick green grass, and went in at it with a will. `Bring your saddles along with you,&#x27; father said, `and come after me. I&#x27;ll show you a good camping place.  You deserve a treat after last night&#x27;s work.&#x27; We turned back towards the rocky wall, near to where we had come in, and there, behind a bush and a big piece of sandstone that had fallen down, was the entrance to a cave.  The walls of it were quite clean and white-looking, the floor was smooth, and the roof was pretty high, well blackened with smoke, too, from the fires which had been lighted in it for many a year gone by. A kind of natural cellar had been made by scooping out the soft sandstone behind a ledge.  From this father took a bag of flour and corn-meal. We very soon made some cakes in the pan, that tasted well, I can tell you. Tea and sugar too, and quart pots, some bacon in a flour-bag; and that rasher fried in the pan was the sweetest meat I ever ate in all my born days. Then father brought out a keg and poured some rum into a pint pot. He took a pretty stiff pull, and then handed it to us.  `A little of it won&#x27;t hurt you, boys,&#x27; he said, `after a night&#x27;s work.&#x27; I took some -- not much; we hadn&#x27;t learned to drink then -- to keep down the fear of something hanging over us.  A dreadful fear it is. It makes a coward of every man who doesn&#x27;t lead a square life, let him be as game as he may. Jim wouldn&#x27;t touch it.  `No,&#x27; he said, when I laughed at him, `I promised mother last time I had more than was good for me at Dargo Races that I wouldn&#x27;t touch it again for two years; and I won&#x27;t either. I can stand what any other man can, and without the hard stuff, either.&#x27; `Please yourself,&#x27; said father.  `When you&#x27;re ready we&#x27;ll have a ride through the stock.&#x27; We finished our meal, and a first-rate one it was.  A man never has the same appetite for his meals anywhere else that he has in the bush, specially if he has been up half the night.  It&#x27;s so fresh, and the air makes him feel as if he&#x27;d ate nothing for a week. Sitting on a log, or in the cave, as we were, I&#x27;ve had the best meal I&#x27;ve ever tasted since I was born.  Not like the close-feeling, close-smelling, dirty-clean graveyard they call a gaol. But it&#x27;s no use beginning on that.  We were young men, and free, too.  Free! By all the devils in hell, if there are devils -- and there must be to tempt a man, or how could he be so great a fool, so blind a born idiot, as to do anything in this world that would put his freedom in jeopardy? And what for?  For folly and nonsense.  For a few pounds he could earn with a month&#x27;s honest work and be all the better man for it. For a false woman&#x27;s smile that he could buy, and ten like her, if he only kept straight and saving.  For a bit of sudden pride or vanity or passion.  A short bit of what looks like pleasure, against months and years of weariness, and cold and heat, and dull half-death, with maybe a dog&#x27;s death at the end! I could cry like a child when I think of it now.  I have cried many&#x27;s the time and often since I have been shut up here, and dashed my head against the stones till I pretty nigh knocked all sense and feeling out of it, not so much in repentance, though I don&#x27;t say I feel sorry, but to think what a fool, fool, fool I&#x27;d been.  Yes, fool, three times over -- a hundred times -- to put my liberty and life against such a miserable stake -- a stake the devil that deals the pack is so safe to win at the end. I may as well go on.  But I can&#x27;t help breaking out sometimes when I hear the birds calling to one another as they fly over the yard, and know it&#x27;s fresh air and sun and green grass outside that I never shall see again.  Never see the river rippling under the big drooping trees, or the cattle coming down in the twilight to drink after the long hot day.  Never, never more!  And whose fault is it? Who have I to blame?  Perhaps father helped a bit; but I knew better, and no one is half as much to blame as myself. Where were we?  Oh, at the cave-mouth, coming out with our bridles in our hands to catch our horses.  We soon did that, and then we rode away to the other cattle.  They were a queer lot, in fine condition, but all sorts of ages and breeds, with every kind of brand and ear-mark. Lots of the brands we didn&#x27;t know, and had never heard of. Some had no brands at all -- full-grown beasts, too; that was a thing we had very seldom seen.  Some of the best cattle and some of the finest horses -- and there were some real plums among the horses -- had a strange brand, JJ. `Who does the JJ brand belong to?&#x27; I said to father. `They&#x27;re the pick of the lot, whose ever they are.&#x27; Father looked black for a bit, and then he growled out, `Don&#x27;t you ask too many questions, lad.  There&#x27;s only four living men besides yourselves knows about this place; so take care and don&#x27;t act foolishly, or you&#x27;ll lose a plant that may save your life, as well as keep you in cash for many a year to come.  That brand belongs to Starlight, and he was the only man left alive of the men that first found it and used it to put away stock in.  He wanted help, and told me five years ago. He took in a half-caste chap, too, against my will.  He helped him with that last lot of cattle that you noticed.&#x27; `But where did those horses come from?&#x27; Jim said.  `I never hardly saw such a lot before.  All got the JJ brand on, too, and nothing else; all about three year old.&#x27; `They were brought here as foals,&#x27; says father, `following their mothers. Some of them was foaled here; and, of course, as they&#x27;ve only the one brand on they never can be claimed or sworn to.  They&#x27;re from some of Mr. Maxwell&#x27;s best thoroughbred mares, and their sire was Earl of Atheling, imported. He was here for a year.&#x27; `Well, they might look the real thing,&#x27; said Jim, his eyes brightening as he gazed at them.  `I&#x27;d like to have that dark bay colt with the star. My word, what a forehand he&#x27;s got; and what quarters, too.  If he can&#x27;t gallop I&#x27;ll never say I know a horse from a poley cow.&#x27; `You shall have him, or as good, never fear, if you stick to your work,&#x27; says father.  `You mustn&#x27;t cross Starlight, for he&#x27;s a born devil when he&#x27;s taken the wrong way, though he talks so soft.  The half-caste is an out-and-out chap with cattle, and the horse doesn&#x27;t stand on four legs that he can&#x27;t ride -- and make follow him, for the matter of that. But he&#x27;s worth watching.  I don&#x27;t believe in him myself. And now ye have the lot.&#x27; `And a d----d fine lot they are,&#x27; I said, for I was vexed with Jim for taking so easy to the bait father held out to him about the horse. `A very smart crowd to be on the roads inside of five years, and drag us in with &#x27;em.&#x27; `How do you make that out?&#x27; says father.  `Are you going to turn dog, now you know the way in?  Isn&#x27;t it as easy to carry on for a few years more as it was twenty years ago?&#x27; `Not by a long chalk,&#x27; I said, for my blood was up, and I felt as if I could talk back to father and give him as good as he sent, and all for Jim&#x27;s sake.  Poor Jim!  He&#x27;d always go to the mischief for the sake of a good horse, and many another `Currency&#x27; chap has gone the same way.  It&#x27;s a pity for some of &#x27;em that a blood horse was ever foaled. `You think you can&#x27;t be tracked,&#x27; says I, `but you must bear in mind you haven&#x27;t got to do with the old-fashioned mounted police as was potterin&#x27; about when this &quot;bot&quot; was first hit on. There&#x27;s chaps in the police getting now, natives or all the same, as can ride and track every bit as well as the half-caste you&#x27;re talking about.  Some day they&#x27;ll drop on the track of a mob coming in or getting out, and then the game will be all up.&#x27; `You can cut it if you like now,&#x27; said father, looking at me curious like. `Don&#x27;t say I dragged you in.  You and your brother can go home, and no one will ever know where you were; no more than if you&#x27;d gone to the moon.&#x27; Jim looked at the brown colt that just came trotting up as dad finished speaking -- trotting up with his head high and his tail stuck out like a circus horse.  If he&#x27;d been the devil in a horsehide he couldn&#x27;t have chosen a better moment.  Then his eyes began to glitter. We all three looked at each other.  No one spoke.  The colt stopped, turned, and galloped back to his mates like a red flyer with the dogs close behind him. It was not long.  We all began to speak at once.  But in that time the die was cast, the stakes were down, and in the pool were three men&#x27;s lives. `I don&#x27;t care whether we go back or not,&#x27; says Jim; `I&#x27;ll do either way that Dick likes.  But that colt I must have.&#x27; `I never intended to go back,&#x27; I said.  `But we&#x27;re three d----d fools all the same -- father and sons.  It&#x27;ll be the dearest horse you ever bought, Jim, old man, and so I tell you.&#x27; `Well, I suppose it&#x27;s settled now,&#x27; says father; `so let&#x27;s have no more chat. We&#x27;re like a pack of old women, blessed if we ain&#x27;t.&#x27; After that we got on more sociably.  Father took us all over the place, and a splendid paddock it was -- walled all round but where we had come in, and a narrow gash in the far side that not one man in a thousand could ever hit on, except he was put up to it; a wild country for miles when you did get out -- all scrub and rock, that few people ever had call to ride over.  There was splendid grass everywhere, water, and shelter. It was warmer, too, than the country above, as you could see by the coats of the cattle and horses. `If it had only been honestly come by,&#x27; Jim said, `what a jolly place it would have been!&#x27; Towards the north end of the paddock was a narrow gully with great sandstone walls all round, and where it narrowed the first discoverers had built a stockyard, partly with dry stone walls and partly with logs and rails. There was no trouble in getting the cattle or horses into this, and there were all kinds of narrow yards and pens for branding the stock if they were clearskins, and altering or `faking&#x27; the brands if they were plain.  This led into another yard, which opened into the narrowest part of the gully.  Once in this, like the one they came down, and the cattle or horses had no chance but to walk slowly up, one behind the other, till they got on the tableland above. Here, of course, every kind of work that can be done to help disguise cattle was done.  Ear-marks were cut out and altered in shape, or else the whole ear was cropped off; every letter in the alphabet was altered by means of straight bars or half-circles, figures, crosses, everything you could think of. `Mr. Starlight is an edicated man,&#x27; said father.  `This is all his notion; and many a man has looked at his own beast, with the ears altered and the brand faked, and never dreamed he ever owned it. He&#x27;s a great card is Starlight.  It&#x27;s a pity he ever took to this kind of life.&#x27; Father said this with a kind of real sorrow that made me look at him to see if the grog had got into his head; just as if his life, mine, and Jim&#x27;s didn&#x27;t matter a straw compared to this man&#x27;s, whoever he was, that had had so many better chances than we had and had chucked &#x27;em all away. But it&#x27;s a strange thing that I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any place in the world where men feel a more real out-and-out respect for a gentleman than in Australia.  Everybody&#x27;s supposed to be free and equal now; of course, they couldn&#x27;t be in the convict days.  But somehow a man that&#x27;s born and bred a gentleman will always be different from other men to the end of the world.  What&#x27;s the most surprising part of it is that men like father, who have hated the breed and suffered by them, too, can&#x27;t help having a curious liking and admiration for them. They&#x27;ll follow them like dogs, fight for them, shed their blood, and die for them; must be some sort of a natural feeling. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s there safe enough, and nothing can knock it out of nine-tenths of all the men and women you meet.  I began to be uneasy to see this wonderful mate of father&#x27;s, who was so many things at once -- a cattle-stealer, a bush-ranger, and a gentleman. Chapter 6 After we&#x27;d fairly settled to stay, father began to be more pleasant than he&#x27;d ever been before.  We were pretty likely, he said, to have a visit from Starlight and the half-caste in a day or two, if we&#x27;d like to wait.  He was to meet him at the Hollow on purpose to help him out with the mob of fat bullocks we had looked at. Father, it appears, was coming here by himself when he met this outlying lot of Mr. Hunter&#x27;s cattle, and thought he and old Crib could bring them in by themselves.  And a mighty good haul it was. Father said we should share the weaners between the three of us; that meant 50 Pounds a piece at least.  The devil always helps beginners. We put through a couple of days pleasantly enough, after our hardish bit of work.  Jim found some fish-hooks and a line, and we caught plenty of mullet and eels in the deep, clear waterholes. We found a couple of double-barrelled guns, and shot ducks enough to last us a week.  No wonder the old frequenters of the Hollow used to live here for a month at a time, having great times of it as long as their grog lasted; and sometimes having the tribe of blacks that inhabited the district to make merry and carouse with them, like the buccaneers of the Spanish Main that I&#x27;ve read about, till the plunder was all gone.  There were scrawls on the wall of the first cave we had been in that showed all the visitors had not been rude, untaught people; and Jim picked up part of a woman&#x27;s dress splashed with blood, and in one place, among some smouldering packages and boxes, a long lock of woman&#x27;s hair, fair, bright-brown, that looked as if the name of Terrible Hollow might not have been given to this lonely, wonderful glen for nothing. We spent nearly a week in this way, and were beginning to get rather sick of the life, when father, who used always to be looking at a bare patch in the scrub above us, said -- `They&#x27;re coming at last.&#x27; `Who are coming -- friends?&#x27; `Why, friends, of course.  That&#x27;s Starlight&#x27;s signal.  See that smoke? The half-caste always sends that up -- like the blacks in his mother&#x27;s tribe, I suppose.&#x27; `Any cattle or horses with them?&#x27; said Jim. `No, or they&#x27;d send up two smokes.  They&#x27;ll be here about dinner-time, so we must get ready for them.&#x27; We had plenty of time to get ourselves or anything else ready. In about four hours we began to look at them through a strong spyglass which father brought out.  By and by we got sight of two men coming along on horseback on the top of the range the other side of the far wall. They wasn&#x27;t particularly easy to see, and every now and then we&#x27;d lose sight of &#x27;em as they got into thick timber or behind rocks. Father got the spyglass on to &#x27;em at last, pretty clear, and nearly threw it down with an oath. `By ----!&#x27; he says, `I believe Starlight&#x27;s hurt somehow. He&#x27;s so infernal rash.  I can see the half-caste holding him on. If the police are on his tracks they&#x27;ll spring the plant here, and the whole thing&#x27;ll be blown.&#x27; We saw them come to the top of the wall, as it were, then they stopped for a long while, then all of a sudden they seemed to disappear. `Let&#x27;s go over to the other side,&#x27; says father; `they&#x27;re coming down the gully now.  It&#x27;s a terrible steep, rough track, worse than the other.  If Starlight&#x27;s hurt bad he&#x27;ll never ride down. But he has the pluck of the devil, sure enough.&#x27; We rode over to the other side, where there was a kind of gully that came in, something like the one we came in by, but rougher, and full of gibbers (boulders).  There was a path, but it looked as if cattle could never be driven or forced up it.  We found afterwards that they had an old pack bullock that they&#x27;d trained to walk up this, and down, too, when they wanted him, and the other cattle followed in his track, as cattle will. Father showed us a sort of cave by the side of the track, where one man, with a couple of guns and a pistol or two, could have shot down a small regiment as they came down one at a time. We stayed in there by the track, and after about half-an-hour we heard the two horses coming down slowly, step by step, kicking the stones down before them.  Then we could hear a man groaning, as if he couldn&#x27;t bear the pain, and partly as if he was trying to smother it. Then another man&#x27;s voice, very soft and soothing like, trying to comfort another. `My head&#x27;s a-fire, and these cursed ribs are grinding against one another every step of this infernal ladder.  Is it far now?&#x27;  How he groaned then! `Just got the bottom; hold on a bit longer and you&#x27;ll be all right.&#x27; Just then the leading horse came out into the open before the cave. We had a good look at him and his rider.  I never forgot them. It was a bad day I ever saw either, and many a man had cause to say the same. The horse held up his head and snorted as he came abreast of us, and we showed out.  He was one of the grandest animals I&#x27;d ever seen, and I afterwards found he was better than he looked.  He came stepping down that beastly rocky goat-track, he, a clean thoroughbred that ought never to have trod upon anything rougher than a rolled training track, or the sound bush turf.  And here he was with a heavy weight on his back -- a half-dead, fainting man, that couldn&#x27;t hold the reins -- and him walking down as steady as an old mountain bull or a wallaroo on the side of a creek bank. I hadn&#x27;t much time to look him over.  I was too much taken up with the rider, who was lying forward on his chest across a coat rolled round and strapped in front of the saddle, and his arms round the horse&#x27;s neck. He was as pale as a ghost.  His eyes -- great dark ones they were, too -- were staring out of his head.  I thought he was dead, and called out to father and Jim that he was. They ran up, and we lifted him off after undoing some straps and a rope. He was tied on (that was what the half-caste was waiting for at the top of the gully).  When we laid him down his head fell back, and he looked as much like a corpse as if he had been dead a day. Then we saw he had been wounded.  There was blood on his shirt, and the upper part of his arm was bandaged. `It&#x27;s too late, father,&#x27; said I; `he&#x27;s a dead man.  What pluck he must have had to ride down there!&#x27; `He&#x27;s worth two dead &#x27;uns yet,&#x27; said father, who had his hand on his pulse. `Hold his head up one of you while I go for the brandy. How did he get hit, Warrigal?&#x27; `That ---- Sergeant Goring,&#x27; said the boy, a slight, active-looking chap, about sixteen, that looked as if he could jump into a gum tree and back again, and I believe he could.  `Sergeant Goring, he very near grab us at Dilligah. We got a lot of old Jobson&#x27;s cattle when he came on us.  He jump off his horse when he see he couldn&#x27;t catch us, and very near drop Starlight. My word, he very nearly fall off -- just like that&#x27; (here he imitated a man reeling in his saddle); `but the old horse stop steady with him, my word, till he come to.  Then the sergeant fire at him again; hit him in the shoulder with his pistol.  Then Starlight come to his senses, and we clear. My word, he couldn&#x27;t see the way the old horse went.  Ha, ha!&#x27; -- here the young devil laughed till the trees and rocks rang again. `Gallop different ways, too, and met at the old needle-rock. But they was miles away then.&#x27; Before the wild boy had come to the end of his story the wounded man had proved that it was only a dead faint, as the women call it, not the real thing.  And after he had tasted a pannikin full of brandy and water, which father brought him, he sat up and looked like a living man once more. `Better have a look at my shoulder,&#x27; he said.  `That ---- fellow shot like a prize-winner at Wimbledon.  I&#x27;ve had a squeak for it.&#x27; `Puts me in mind of our old poaching rows,&#x27; said father, while he carefully cut the shirt off, that was stiffened with blood and showed where the bullet had passed through the muscle, narrowly missing the bone of the joint. We washed it, and relieved the wounded man by discovering that the other bullet had only been spent, after striking a tree most like, when it had knocked the wind out of him and nearly unhorsed him, as Warrigal said. `Fill my pipe, one of you.  Who the devil are these lads? Yours, I suppose, Marston, or you wouldn&#x27;t be fool enough to bring them here. Why didn&#x27;t you leave them at home with their mother? Don&#x27;t you think you and I and this devil&#x27;s limb enough for this precious trade of ours?&#x27; `They&#x27;ll take their luck as it comes, like others,&#x27; growled father; `what&#x27;s good enough for me isn&#x27;t too bad for them.  We want another hand or two to work things right.&#x27; `Oh! we do, do we?&#x27; said the stranger, fixing his eyes on father as if he was going to burn a hole in him with a burning-glass; `but if I&#x27;d a brace of fine boys like those of my own I&#x27;d hang myself before I&#x27;d drag them into the pit after myself.&#x27; `That&#x27;s all very fine,&#x27; said father, looking very dark and dangerous. `Is Mr. Starlight going to turn parson?  You&#x27;ll be just in time, for we&#x27;ll all be shopped if you run against the police like this, and next thing to lay them on to the Hollow by making for it when you&#x27;re too weak to ride.&#x27; `What would you have me do?  Pull up and hold up my hands? There was nowhere else to go; and that new sergeant rode devilish well, I can tell you, with a big chestnut well-bred horse, that gave old Rainbow here all he knew to lose him.  Now, once for all, no more of that, Marston, and mind your own business. I&#x27;m the superior officer in this ship&#x27;s company -- you know that very well -- your business is to obey me, and take second place.&#x27; Father growled out something, but did not offer to deny it. We could see plainly that the stranger was or had been far above our rank, whatever were the reasons which had led to his present kind of life. We stayed for about ten days, while the stranger&#x27;s arm got well. With care and rest, it soon healed.  He was pleasant enough, too, when the pain went away.  He had been in other countries, and told us all kinds of stories about them. He said nothing, though, about his own former ways, and we often wondered whatever could have made him take to such a life.  Unknown to father, too, he gave us good advice, warned us that what we were in was the road to imprisonment or death in due course, and not to flatter ourselves that any other ending was possible. `I have my own reasons for leading the life I do,&#x27; he said, `and must run my own course, of which I foresee the end as plainly as if it was written in a book before me.  Your father had a long account to square with society, and he has a right to settle it his own way. That yellow whelp was never intended for anything better. But for you lads&#x27; -- and here he looked kindly in poor old Jim&#x27;s honest face (and an honest face and heart Jim&#x27;s was, and that I&#x27;ll live and die on) -- `my advice to you is, to clear off home, when we go, and never come back here again.  Tell your father you won&#x27;t come; cut loose from him, once and for all.  You&#x27;d better drown yourselves comfortably at once than take to this cursed trade.  Now, mind what I tell you, and keep your own counsel.&#x27; By and by, the day came when the horses were run in for father and Mr. Starlight and Warrigal, who packed up to be off for some other part. When they were in the yard we had a good look at his own horse -- a good look -- and if I&#x27;d been a fellow that painted pictures, and that kind of thing, I could draw a middlin&#x27; good likeness of him now. By George! how fond I am of a good horse -- a real well-bred clinker. I&#x27;d never have been here if it hadn&#x27;t been for that, I do believe; and many another Currency chap can say the same -- a horse or a woman -- that&#x27;s about the size of it, one or t&#x27;other generally fetches us. I shall never put foot in stirrup again, but I&#x27;ll try and scratch out a sort of likeness of Rainbow. He was a dark bay horse, nearly brown, without a white hair on him. He wasn&#x27;t above 15 hands and an inch high, but looked a deal bigger than he was, for the way he held his head up and carried himself. He was deep and thick through behind the shoulders, and girthed ever so much more than you&#x27;d think.  He had a short back, and his ribs went out like a cask, long quarter, great thighs and hocks, wonderful legs, and feet of course to do the work he did.  His head was plainish, but clean and bony, and his eye was big and well opened, with no white showing.  His shoulder was sloped back that much that he couldn&#x27;t fall, no matter what happened his fore legs. All his paces were good too.  I believe he could jump -- jump anything he was ridden at, and very few horses could get the better of him for one mile or three. Where he&#x27;d come from, of course, we were not to know then. He had a small private sort of brand that didn&#x27;t belong to any of the big studs; but he was never bred by a poor man. I afterwards found out that he was stolen before he was foaled, like many another plum, and his dam killed as soon as she had weaned him. So, of course, no one could swear to him, and Starlight could have ridden past the Supreme Court, at the assizes, and never been stopped, as far as this horse was concerned. Before we went away father and Starlight had some terrible long talks, and one evening Jim came to me, and says he -- `What do you think they&#x27;re up to now?&#x27; `How should I know?  Sticking up a bank, or boning a flock of maiden ewes to take up a run with?  They seem to be game for anything. There&#x27;ll be a hanging match in the family if us boys don&#x27;t look out.&#x27; `There&#x27;s no knowing,&#x27; says Jim, with a roguish look in his eye (I didn&#x27;t think then how near the truth I was), `but it&#x27;s about a horse this time.&#x27; `Oh! a horse; that alters the matter.  But what&#x27;s one horse to make such a shine about?&#x27; `Ah, that&#x27;s the point,&#x27; says poor old Jim, `it&#x27;s a horse worth talking about. Don&#x27;t you remember the imported entire that they had his picture in the papers -- him that Mr. Windhall gave 2000 Pounds for?&#x27; `What! the Marquis of Lorne?  Why, you don&#x27;t mean to say they&#x27;re going for him?&#x27; `By George, I do!&#x27; says Jim; `and they&#x27;ll have him here, and twenty blood mares to put to him, before September.&#x27; `They&#x27;re all gone mad -- they&#x27;ll raise the country on us. Every police trooper in the colony&#x27;ll be after us like a pack of dingoes after an old man kangaroo when the ground&#x27;s boggy, and they&#x27;ll run us down, too; they can&#x27;t be off it.  Whatever made &#x27;em think of such a big touch as that?&#x27; `That Starlight&#x27;s the devil, I think,&#x27; said Jim slowly.  `Father didn&#x27;t seem to like it at first, but he brought him round bit by bit -- said he knew a squatter in Queensland he could pass him on to; that they&#x27;d keep him there for a year and get a crop of foals by him, and when the &quot;derry&quot; was off he&#x27;d take him over himself.&#x27; `But how&#x27;s he going to nail him?  People say Windhall keeps him locked up at night, and his box is close to his house.&#x27; `Starlight says he has a friend handy; he seems to have one or two everywhere. It&#x27;s wonderful, as father told him, where he gets information.&#x27; `By George! it would be a touch, and no mistake.  And if we could get a few colts by him out of thoroughbred mares we might win half the races every year on our side and no one a bit the wiser.&#x27; It did seem a grand sort of thing -- young fools that we were -- to get hold of this wonderful stallion that we&#x27;d heard so much of, as thoroughbred as Eclipse; good as anything England could turn out. I say again, if it weren&#x27;t for the horse-flesh part of it, the fun and hard-riding and tracking, and all the rest of it, there wouldn&#x27;t be anything like the cross-work that there is in Australia. It lies partly between that and the dry weather.  There&#x27;s the long spells of drought when nothing can be done by young or old.  Sometimes for months you can&#x27;t work in the garden, nor plough, nor sow, nor do anything useful to keep the devil out of your heart.  Only sit at home and do nothing, or else go out and watch the grass witherin&#x27; and the water dryin&#x27; up, and the stock dyin&#x27; by inches before your eyes.  And no change, maybe, for months.  The ground like iron and the sky like brass, as the parson said, and very true, too, last Sunday. Then the youngsters, havin&#x27; so much idle time on their hands, take to gaffin&#x27; and flash talk; and money must be got to sport and pay up if they lose; and the stock all ramblin&#x27; about and mixed up, and there&#x27;s a temptation to collar somebody&#x27;s calves or foals, like we did that first red heifer.  I shall remember her to my dying day. It seems as if I had put that brand on my own heart when I jammed it down on her soft skin.  Anyhow, I never forgot it, and there&#x27;s many another like me, I&#x27;ll be bound. The next morning Jim and I started off home.  Father said he should stay in the Hollow till Starlight got round a bit. He told us not to tell mother or Ailie a word about where we&#x27;d been. Of course they couldn&#x27;t be off knowin&#x27; that we&#x27;d been with him; but we were to stall them off by saying we&#x27;d been helping him with a bit of bush-work or anything we could think off.  `It&#x27;ll do no good, and your mother&#x27;s quite miserable enough as it is, boys,&#x27; he said. `She&#x27;ll know time enough, and maybe break her heart over it, too. Poor Norah!&#x27; Dashed if I ever heard father say a soft thing before. I couldn&#x27;t &#x27;a believed it.  I always thought he was ironbark outside and in. But he seemed real sorry for once.  And I was near sayin&#x27;, `Why don&#x27;t ye cut the whole blessed lot, then, and come home and work steady and make us all comfortable and happy?&#x27;  But when I looked again his face was all changed and hard-like.  `Off you go,&#x27; he says, with his old voice.  `Next time I want either of you I&#x27;ll send Warrigal for you.&#x27; And with that he walked off from the yard where we had been catching our horses, and never looked nigh us again. We rode away to the low end of the gully, and then we led the horses up, foot by foot, and hard work it was -- like climbing up the roof of a house. We were almost done when we got to the tableland at the top. We made our way to the yard, where there were the tracks of the cows all round about it, but nothing but the wild horses had ever been there since. `What a scrubby hole it is!&#x27; said Jim; `I wonder how in the world they ever found out the way to the Hollow?&#x27; `Some runaway Government men, I believe, so that half-caste chap told me, and a gin* showed &#x27;em the track down, and where to get water and everything. They lived on kangaroos at first.  Then, by degrees, they used to crawl out by moonlight and collar a horse or two or a few cattle. They managed to live there years and years; one died, one was killed by the blacks; the last man showed it to the chaps that passed it on to Starlight.  Warrigal&#x27;s mother, or aunt or something, was the gin that showed it to the first white men.&#x27; -- * A black woman. -- Chapter 7 It was pretty late that night when we got home, and poor mother and Aileen were that glad to see us that they didn&#x27;t ask too many questions. Mother would sit and look at the pair of us for ever so long without speaking, and then the tears would come into her eyes and she&#x27;d turn away her head. The old place looked very snug, clean, and comfortable, too, after all the camping-out, and it was first-rate to have our own beds again. Then the milk and fresh butter, and the eggs and bacon -- my word! how Jim did lay in; you&#x27;d have thought he was goin&#x27; on all night. `By George! home&#x27;s a jolly place after all,&#x27; he said.  `I am going to stay ever so long this time, and work like an old near-side poler -- see if I don&#x27;t.  Let&#x27;s look at your hands, Aileen; my word, you&#x27;ve been doin&#x27; your share.&#x27; `Indeed, has she,&#x27; said mother.  `It&#x27;s a shame, so it is, and her with two big brothers, too.&#x27; `Poor Ailie,&#x27; said Jim, `she had to take an axe, had she, in her pretty little hands; but she didn&#x27;t cut all that wood that&#x27;s outside the door and I nearly broke my neck over, I&#x27;ll go bail.&#x27; `How do you know?&#x27; says she, smiling roguish-like.  `All the world might have been here for what you&#x27;d been the wiser -- going away nobody knows where, and coming home at night like -- like ----&#x27; `Bush-rangers,&#x27; says I.  `Say it out; but we haven&#x27;t turned out yet, if that&#x27;s what you mean, Miss Marston.&#x27; `I don&#x27;t mean anything but what&#x27;s kind and loving, you naughty boy,&#x27; says she, throwing her arms about my neck; `but why will you break our hearts, poor mother&#x27;s and mine, by going off in such a wild way and staying away, as if you were doing something that you were ashamed of?&#x27; `Women shouldn&#x27;t ask questions,&#x27; I said roughly.  `You&#x27;ll know time enough, and if you never know, perhaps it&#x27;s all the better.&#x27; Jim was alongside of mother by this time, lying down like a child on the old native dogskin rug that we tanned ourselves with wattle bark. She had her hand on his hair -- thick and curly it was always from a child. She didn&#x27;t say anything, but I could see the tears drip, drip down from her face; her head was on Jim&#x27;s shoulder, and by and by he put his arms round her neck.  I went off to bed, I remember, and left them to it. Next morning Jim and I were up at sunrise and got in the milkers, as we always did when we were at home.  Aileen was up too.  She had done all the dairying lately by herself.  There were about a dozen cows to milk, and she had managed it all herself every day that we were away; put up the calves every afternoon, drove up the cows in the cold mornings, made the butter, which she used to salt and put into a keg, and feed the pigs with the skim milk.  It was rather hard work for her, but I never saw her equal for farm work -- rough or smooth. And she used to manage to dress neat and look pretty all the time; not like some small settlers&#x27; daughters that I have seen, slouching about with a pair of Blucher boots on, no bonnet, a dirty frock, and a petticoat like a blanket rag -- not bad-looking girls either -- and their hair like a dry mop.  No, Aileen was always neat and tidy, with a good pair of thick boots outside and a thin pair for the house when she&#x27;d done her work. She could frighten a wildish cow and bail up anything that would stay in a yard with her.  She could ride like a bird and drive bullocks on a pinch in a dray or at plough, chop wood, too, as well as here and there a one. But when she was in the house and regularly set down to her sewing she&#x27;d look that quiet and steady-going you&#x27;d think she was only fit to teach in a school or sell laces and gloves. And so she was when she was let work in her own way, but if she was crossed or put upon, or saw anything going wrong, she&#x27;d hold up her head and talk as straight as any man I ever saw. She&#x27;d a look just like father when he&#x27;d made up his mind, only her way was always the right way.  What a difference it makes, doesn&#x27;t it? And she was so handsome with it.  I&#x27;ve seen a goodish lot of women since I left the old place, let alone her that&#x27;s helped to put me where I am, but I don&#x27;t think I ever saw a girl that was a patch on Aileen for looks. She had a wonderful fair skin, and her eyes were large and soft like poor mother&#x27;s.  When she was a little raised-like you&#x27;d see a pink flush come on her cheeks like a peach blossom in September, and her eyes had a bright startled look like a doe kangaroo when she jumps up and looks round.  Her teeth were as white and even as a black gin&#x27;s.  The mouth was something like father&#x27;s, and when she shut it up we boys always knew she&#x27;d made up her mind, and wasn&#x27;t going to be turned from it.  But her heart was that good that she was always thinking of others and not of herself. I believe -- I know -- she&#x27;d have died for any one she loved. She had more sense than all the rest of us put together. I&#x27;ve often thought if she&#x27;d been the oldest boy instead of me she&#x27;d have kept Jim straight, and managed to drive father out of his cross ways -- that is, if any one living could have done it. As for riding, I have never seen any one that could sit a horse or handle him through rough, thick country like her.  She could ride barebacked, or next to it, sitting sideways on nothing but a gunny-bag, and send a young horse flying through scrub and rocks, or down ranges where you&#x27;d think a horse could hardly keep his feet. We could all ride a bit out of the common, if it comes to that. Better if we&#x27;d learned nothing but how to walk behind a plough, year in year out, like some of the folks in father&#x27;s village in England, as he used to tell us about when he was in a good humour.  But that&#x27;s all as people are reared, I suppose.  We&#x27;d been used to the outside of a horse ever since we could walk almost, and it came natural to us. Anyhow, I think Aileen was about the best of the lot of us at that, as in everything else. Well, for a bit all went on pretty well at home.  Jim and I worked away steady, got in a tidy bit of crop, and did everything that lay in our way right and regular.  We milked the cows in the morning, and brought in a big stack of firewood and chopped as much as would last for a month or two.  We mended up the paddock fence, and tidied the garden. The old place hadn&#x27;t looked so smart for many a day. When we came in at night old mother used to look that pleased and happy we couldn&#x27;t help feeling better in our hearts.  Aileen used to read something out of the paper that she thought might amuse us. I could read pretty fair, and so could Jim; but we were both lazy at it, and after working pretty hard all day didn&#x27;t so much care about spelling out the long words in the farming news or the stories they put in. All the same, it would have paid us better if we&#x27;d read a little more and put the `bullocking&#x27; on one side, at odd times.  A man can learn as much out of a book or a paper sometimes in an hour as will save his work for a week, or put him up to working to better purpose.  I can see that now -- too late, and more&#x27;s the pity. Anyhow, Aileen could read pretty near as fast as any one I ever saw, and she used to reel it out for us, as we sat smoking over the fire, in a way that kept us jolly and laughing till it was nearly turning-in time. Now and then George Storefield would come and stay an hour or two. He could read well; nearly as well as she could.  Then he had always something to show her that she&#x27;d been asking about. His place was eight miles off, but he&#x27;d always get his horse and go home, whatever the night was like. `I must be at my work in the morning,&#x27; he&#x27;d say; `it&#x27;s more than half a day gone if you lose that, and I&#x27;ve no half-days to spare, or quarter-days either.&#x27; .    .    .    .    . So we all got on first-rate, and anybody would have thought that there wasn&#x27;t a more steady-going, hard-working, happy family in the colony.  No more there wasn&#x27;t, while it lasted.  After all, what is there that&#x27;s half as good as being all right and square, working hard for the food you eat, and the sleep you enjoy, able to look all the world in the face, and afraid of nothing and nobody! We were so quiet and comfortable till the winter was over and the spring coming on, till about September, that I almost began to believe we&#x27;d never done anything in our lives we could be made to suffer for. Now and then, of course, I used to wake up in the night, and my thoughts would go back to `Terrible Hollow&#x27;, that wonderful place; and one night with the unbranded cattle, and Starlight, with the blood dripping on to his horse&#x27;s shoulder, and the half-caste, with his hawk&#x27;s eye and glittering teeth -- father, with his gloomy face and dark words.  I wondered whether it was all a dream; whether I and Jim had been in at all; whether any of the `cross-work&#x27; had been found out; and, if so, what would be done to me and Jim; most of all, though, whether father and Starlight were away after some `big touch&#x27;; and, if so, where and what it was, and how soon we should hear of it. As for Jim, he was one of those happy-go-lucky fellows that didn&#x27;t bother himself about anything he didn&#x27;t see or run against. I don&#x27;t think it ever troubled him.  It was the only bad thing he&#x27;d ever been in.  He&#x27;d been drawn in against his will, and I think he had made up his mind -- pretty nearly -- not to go in for any more. I have often seen Aileen talking to him, and they&#x27;d walk along in the evening when the work was done -- he with his arm round her waist, and she looking at him with that quiet, pleased face of hers, seeming so proud and fond of him, as if he&#x27;d been the little chap she used to lead about and put on the old pony, and bring into the calf-pen when she was milking.  I remember he had a fight with a little bull-calf, about a week old, that came in with a wild heifer, and Aileen made as much of his pluck as if it had been a mallee scrubber. The calf baaed and butted at Jim, as even the youngest of them will, if they&#x27;ve the wild blood in &#x27;em, and nearly upset him; he was only a bit of a toddler.  But Jim picked up a loose leg of a milking-stool, and the two went at it hammer and tongs.  I could hardly stand for laughing, till the calf gave him best and walked. Aileen pulled him out, and carried him in to mother, telling her that he was the bravest little chap in the world; and I remember I got scolded for not going to help him.  How these little things come back! `I&#x27;m beginning to be afraid,&#x27; says George, one evening, `that it&#x27;s going to be a dry season.&#x27; `There&#x27;s plenty of time yet,&#x27; says Jim, who always took the bright side of things; `it might rain towards the end of the month.&#x27; `I was thinking the same thing,&#x27; I said.  `We haven&#x27;t had any rain to speak of for a couple of months, and that bit of wheat of ours is beginning to go back. The oats look better.&#x27; `Now I think of it,&#x27; put in Jim, `Dick Dawson came in from outside, and he said things are shocking bad; all the frontage bare already, and the water drying up.&#x27; `It&#x27;s always the way,&#x27; I said, bitter-like.  `As soon as a poor man&#x27;s got a chance of a decent crop, the season turns against him or prices go down, so that he never gets a chance.&#x27; `It&#x27;s as bad for the rich man, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27; said George.  `It&#x27;s God&#x27;s will, and we can&#x27;t make or mend things by complaining.&#x27; `I don&#x27;t know so much about that,&#x27; I said sullenly.  `But it&#x27;s not as bad for the rich man.  Even if the squatters suffer by a drought and lose their stock, they&#x27;ve more stock and money in the bank, or else credit to fall back on; while the like of us lose all we have in the world, and no one would lend us a pound afterwards to save our lives.&#x27; `It&#x27;s not quite so bad as that,&#x27; said George.  `I shall lose my year&#x27;s work unless rain comes, and most of the cattle and horses besides; but I shall be able to get a few pounds to go on with, however the season goes.&#x27; `Oh! if you like to bow and scrape to rich people, well and good,&#x27; I said; `but that&#x27;s not my way.  We have as good a right to our share of the land and some other good things as they have, and why should we be done out of it?&#x27; `If we pay for the land as they do, certainly,&#x27; said George. `But why should we pay?  God Almighty, I suppose, made the land and the people too, one to live on the other.  Why should we pay for what is our own?  I believe in getting my share somehow.&#x27; `That&#x27;s a sort of argument that doesn&#x27;t come out right,&#x27; said George. `How would you like another man to come and want to halve the farm with you?&#x27; `I shouldn&#x27;t mind; I should go halves with some one else who had a bigger one,&#x27; I said.  `More money too, more horses, more sheep, a bigger house!  Why should he have it and not me?&#x27; `That&#x27;s a lazy man&#x27;s argument, and -- well, not an honest man&#x27;s,&#x27; said George, getting up and putting on his cabbage-tree.  `I can&#x27;t sit and hear you talk such rot.  Nobody can work better than you and Jim, when you like. I wonder you don&#x27;t leave such talk to fellows like Frowser, that&#x27;s always spouting at the Shearers&#x27; Arms.&#x27; `Nonsense or not, if a dry season comes and knocks all our work over, I shall help myself to some one&#x27;s stuff that has more than he knows what to do with.&#x27; `Why can&#x27;t we all go shearing, and make as much as will keep us for six months?&#x27; said George.  `I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;d do without the squatters.&#x27; `Nor I either; more ways than one; but Jim and I are going shearing next week. So perhaps there won&#x27;t be any need for &quot;duffing&quot; after all.&#x27; `Oh, Dick!&#x27; said Aileen, `I can&#x27;t bear to hear you make a joke of that kind of thing.  Don&#x27;t we all know what it leads to! Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to live on dry bread and be honest than to be full of money and never know the day when you&#x27;d be dragged to gaol?&#x27; `I&#x27;ve heard all that before; but ain&#x27;t there lots of people that have made their money by all sorts of villainy, that look as well as the best, and never see a gaol?&#x27; `They&#x27;re always caught some day,&#x27; says poor Aileen, sobbing, `and what a dreadful life of anxiety they must lead!&#x27; `Not at all,&#x27; I said.  `Look at Lucksly, Squeezer, and Frying-pan Jack. Everybody knows how they got their stock and their money. See how they live.  They&#x27;ve got stations, and public-house and town property, and they get richer every year.  I don&#x27;t think it pays to be too honest in a dry country.&#x27; `You&#x27;re a naughty boy, Dick; isn&#x27;t he, Jim?&#x27; she said, smiling through her tears.  `But he doesn&#x27;t mean half what he says, does he?&#x27; `Not he,&#x27; says Jim; `and very likely we&#x27;ll have lots of rain after all.&#x27; Chapter 8 The `big squatter&#x27;, as he was called on our side of the country, was Mr. Falkland.  He was an Englishman that had come young to the colony, and worked his way up by degrees.  He had had no money when he first came, people said; indeed, he often said so himself.  He was not proud, at any rate in that way, for he was not above telling a young fellow that he should never be downhearted because he hadn&#x27;t a coat to his back or a shilling in his pocket, because he, Herbert Falkland, had known what it was to be without either.  `This was the best country in the whole world,&#x27; he used to say, `for a gentleman who was poor or a working man.&#x27;  The first sort could always make an independence if they were moderately strong, liked work, and did not drink. There were very few countries where idle, unsteady people got rich. `As for the poor man, he was the real rich man in Australia; high wages, cheap food, lodging, clothing, travelling. What more did he want?  He could save money, live happily, and die rich, if he wasn&#x27;t a fool or a rogue.  Unfortunately, these last were highly popular professions; and many people, high and low, belonged to them here -- and everywhere else.&#x27; We were all well up in this kind of talk, because for the last two or three years, since we had begun to shear pretty well, we had always shorn at his shed.  He was one of those gentlemen -- and he was a gentleman, if ever there was one -- that takes a deal of notice of his working hands, particularly if they were young.  Jim he took a great fancy to the first moment he saw him.  He didn&#x27;t care so much about me. `You&#x27;re a sulky young dog, Richard Marston,&#x27; he used to say. `I&#x27;m not sure that you&#x27;ll come to any good; and though I don&#x27;t like to say all I hear about your father before you, I&#x27;m afraid he doesn&#x27;t teach you anything worth knowing.  But Jim there&#x27;s a grand fellow; if he&#x27;d been caught young and weaned from all of your lot, he&#x27;d have been an honour to the land he was born in.  He&#x27;s too good for you all.&#x27; `Every one of you gentlemen wants to be a small God Almighty,&#x27; I said impudently.  `You&#x27;d like to break us all in and put us in yokes and bows, like a lot of working bullocks.&#x27; `You mistake me, my boy, and all the rest of us who are worth calling men, let alone gentlemen.  We are your best friends, and would help you in every way if you&#x27;d only let us.&#x27; `I don&#x27;t see so much of that.&#x27; `Because you often fight against your own good.  We should like to see you all have farms of your own -- to be all well taught and able to make the best of your lives -- not driven to drink, as many of you are, because you have no notion of any rational amusement, and anything between hard work and idle dissipation.&#x27; `And suppose you had all this power,&#x27; I said -- for if I was afraid of father there wasn&#x27;t another man living that could overcrow me -- `don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;d know the way to keep all the good things for yourselves? Hasn&#x27;t it always been so?&#x27; `I see your argument,&#x27; he said, quite quiet and reasonable, just as if I had been a swell like himself -- that was why he was unlike any other man I ever knew -- `and it is a perfectly fair way of putting it. But your class might, I think, always rely upon there being enough kindness and wisdom in ours to prevent that state of things.  Unfortunately, neither side trusts the other enough.  And now the bell is going to ring, I think.&#x27; Jim and I stopped at Boree shed till all the sheep were cut out. It pays well if the weather is pretty fair, and it isn&#x27;t bad fun when there&#x27;s twenty or thirty chaps of the right sort in the shearers&#x27; hut; there&#x27;s always some fun going on.  Shearers work pretty hard, and as they buy their own rations generally, they can afford to live well. After a hard day&#x27;s shearing -- that is, from five o&#x27;clock in the morning to seven at night, going best pace all the time, every man working as hard as if he was at it for his life -- one would think a man would be too tired to do anything.  But we were mostly strong and hearty, and at that age a man takes a deal of killing; so we used to have a little card-playing at night to pass away the time. Very few of the fellows had any money to spend.  They couldn&#x27;t get any either until shearing was over and they were paid off; but they&#x27;d get some one who could write to scribble a lot of I O U&#x27;s, and they did as well. We used to play `all-fours&#x27; and `loo&#x27;, and now and then an American game which some of the fellows had picked up.  It was strange how soon we managed to get into big stakes.  I won at first, and then Jim and I began to lose, and had such a lot of I O U&#x27;s out that I was afraid we&#x27;d have no money to take home after shearing.  Then I began to think what a fool I&#x27;d been to play myself and drag Jim into it, for he didn&#x27;t want to play at first. One day I got a couple of letters from home -- one from Aileen and another in a strange hand.  It had come to our little post-office, and Aileen had sent it on to Boree. When I opened it there were a few lines, with father&#x27;s name at the bottom. He couldn&#x27;t write, so I made sure that Starlight had written it for him. He was quite well, it said; and to look out for him about Christmas time; he might come home then, or send for us; to stop at Boree if we could get work, and keep a couple of horses in good trim, as he might want us.  A couple of five-pound notes fell out of the letter as I opened it. When I looked at them first I felt a kind of fear.  I knew what they came from.  And I had a sort of feeling that we should be better without them. However, the devil was too strong for me.  Money&#x27;s a tempting thing, whether it&#x27;s notes or gold, especially when a man&#x27;s in debt. I had begun to think the fellows looked a little cool on us the last three or four nights, as our losses were growing big. So I gave Jim his share; and after tea, when we sat down again, there weren&#x27;t more than a dozen of us that were in the card racket. I flung down my note, and Jim did his, and told them that we owed to take the change out of that and hand us over their paper for the balance. They all stared, for such a thing hadn&#x27;t been seen since the shearing began. Shearers, as a rule, come from their homes in the settled districts very bare.  They are not very well supplied with clothes; their horses are poor and done up; and they very seldom have a note in their pockets, unless they have managed to sell a spare horse on the journey. So we were great men for the time, looked at by the others with wonder and respect.  We were fools enough to be pleased with it. Strangely, too, our luck turned from that minute, and it ended in our winning not only our own back, but more than as much more from the other men. I don&#x27;t think Mr. Falkland liked these goings on.  He wouldn&#x27;t have allowed cards at all if he could have helped it.  He was a man that hated what was wrong, and didn&#x27;t value his own interest a pin when it came in the way.  However, the shearing hut was our own, in a manner of speaking, and as long as we shore clean and kept the shed going the overseer, Mr. M`Intyre, didn&#x27;t trouble his head much about our doings in the hut.  He was anxious to get done with the shearing, to get the wool into the bales before the dust came in, and the grass seed ripened, and the clover burrs began to fall. `Why should ye fash yoursel&#x27;,&#x27; I heard him say once to Mr. Falkland, `aboot these young deevils like the Marstons?  They&#x27;re as good&#x27;s ready money in auld Nick&#x27;s purse.  It&#x27;s bred and born and welded in them. Ye&#x27;ll just have the burrs and seeds amang the wool if ye keep losing a smart shearer for the sake o&#x27; a wheen cards and dice; and ye&#x27;ll mak&#x27; nae heed of convairtin&#x27; thae young caterans ony mair than ye&#x27;ll change a Norroway falcon into a barn-door chuckie.&#x27; I wonder if what he said was true -- if we couldn&#x27;t help it; if it was in our blood?  It seems like it; and yet it&#x27;s hard lines to think a fellow must grow up and get on the cross in spite of himself, and come to the gallows-foot at last, whether he likes it or not. The parson here isn&#x27;t bad at all.  He&#x27;s a man and a gentleman, too; and he&#x27;s talked and read to me by the hour.  I suppose some of us chaps are like the poor stupid tribes that the Israelites found in Canaan, only meant to live for a bit and then to be rubbed out to make room for better people. When the shearing was nearly over we had a Saturday afternoon to ourselves. We had finished all the sheep that were in the shed, and old M`Intyre didn&#x27;t like to begin a fresh flock.  So we got on our horses and took a ride into the township just for the fun of the thing, and for a little change. The horses had got quite fresh with the rest and the spring grass. Their coats were shining, and they all looked very different from what they did when we first came.  Our two were not so poor when they came, so they looked the best of the lot, and jumped about in style when we mounted.  Ah! only to think of a good horse. All the men washed themselves and put on clean clothes. Then we had our dinner and about a dozen of us started off for the town. Poor old Jim, how well he looked that day!  I don&#x27;t think you could pick a young fellow anywhere in the countryside that was a patch on him for good looks and manliness, somewhere about six foot or a little over, as straight as a rush, with a bright blue eye that was always laughing and twinkling, and curly dark brown hair.  No wonder all the girls used to think so much of him.  He could do anything and everything that a man could do.  He was as strong as a young bull, and as active as a rock wallaby -- and ride!  Well, he sat on his horse as if he was born on one.  With his broad shoulders and upright easy seat he was a regular picture on a good horse. And he had a good one under him to-day; a big, brown, resolute, well-bred horse he had got in a swap because the man that had him was afraid of him.  Now that he had got a little flesh on his bones he looked something quite out of the common.  `A deal too good for a poor man, and him honest,&#x27; as old M`Intyre said. But Jim turned on him pretty sharp, and said he had got the horse in a fair deal, and had as much right to a good mount as any one else -- super or squatter, he didn&#x27;t care who he was. And Mr. Falkland took Jim&#x27;s part, and rather made Mr. M`Intyre out in the wrong for saying what he did.  The old man didn&#x27;t say much more, only shook his head, saying -- `Ah, ye&#x27;re a grand laddie, and buirdly, and no that thrawn, either -- like ye, Dick, ye born deevil,&#x27; looking at me.  `But I misdoot sair ye&#x27;ll die wi&#x27; your boots on.  There&#x27;s a smack o&#x27; Johnnie Armstrong in the glint o&#x27; yer e&#x27;e.  Ye&#x27;ll be to dree yer weird, there&#x27;s nae help for&#x27;t.&#x27; `What&#x27;s all that lingo, Mr. M`Intyre?&#x27; called out Jim, all good-natured again.  `Is it French or Queensland blacks&#x27; yabber? Blest if I understand a word of it.  But I didn&#x27;t want to be nasty, only I am regular shook on this old moke, I believe, and he&#x27;s as square as Mr. Falkland&#x27;s dogcart horse.&#x27; `Maybe ye bocht him fair eneugh.  I&#x27;ll no deny you.  I saw the receipt mysel&#x27;. But where did yon lang-leggit, long-lockit, Fish River moss-trooping callant win haud o&#x27; him?  Answer me that, Jeems.&#x27; `That says nothing,&#x27; answered Jim.  `I&#x27;m not supposed to trace back every horse in the country and find out all the people that owned him since he was a foal.  He&#x27;s mine now, and mine he&#x27;ll be till I get a better one.&#x27; `A contuma-acious and stiff-necked generation,&#x27; said the old man, walking off and shaking his head.  `And yet he&#x27;s a fine laddie; a gra-and laddie wad he be with good guidance.  It&#x27;s the Lord&#x27;s doing, nae doot, and we daurna fault it; it&#x27;s wondrous in our een.&#x27; That was the way old Mac always talked.  Droll lingo, wasn&#x27;t it? Chapter 9 Well, away we went to this township.  Bundah was the name of it; not that there was anything to do or see when we got there. It was the regular up-country village, with a public-house, a store, a pound, and a blacksmith&#x27;s shop.  However, a public-house is not such a bad place -- at any rate it&#x27;s better than nothing when a fellow&#x27;s young and red-hot for anything like a bit of fun, or even a change.  Some people can work away day after day, and year after year, like a bullock in a team or a horse in a chaff-cutting machine.  It&#x27;s all the better for them if they can, though I suppose they never enjoy themselves except in a cold-blooded sort of way.  But there&#x27;s other men that can&#x27;t do that sort of thing, and it&#x27;s no use talking.  They must have life and liberty and a free range. There&#x27;s some birds, and animals too, that either pine in a cage or kill themselves, and I suppose it&#x27;s the same way with some men. They can&#x27;t stand the cage of what&#x27;s called honest labour, which means working for some one else for twenty or thirty years, never having a day to yourself, or doing anything you like, and saving up a trifle for your old age when you can&#x27;t enjoy it. I don&#x27;t wonder youngsters break traces and gallop off like a colt out of a team. Besides, sometimes there&#x27;s a good-looking girl even at a bush public, the daughter or the barmaid, and it&#x27;s odd, now, what a difference that makes. There&#x27;s a few glasses of grog going, a little noisy, rattling talk, a few smiles and a saucy answer or two from the girl, a look at the last newspaper, or a bit of the town news from the landlord; he&#x27;s always time to read.  Hang him -- I mean confound him -- for he&#x27;s generally a sly old spider who sucks us fellows pretty dry, and then don&#x27;t care what becomes of us.  Well, it don&#x27;t amount to much, but it&#x27;s life -- the only taste of it that chaps like us are likely to get. And people may talk as much as they like; boys, and men too, will like it, and take to it, and hanker after it, as long as the world lasts. There&#x27;s danger in it, and misery, and death often enough comes of it, but what of that?  If a man wants a swim on the seashore he won&#x27;t stand all day on the beach because he may be drowned or snapped up by a shark, or knocked against a rock, or tired out and drawn under by the surf. No, if he&#x27;s a man he&#x27;ll jump in and enjoy himself all the more because the waves are high and the waters deep.  So it was very good fun to us, simple as it might sound to some people.  It was pleasant to be bowling along over the firm green turf, along the plain, through the forest, gully, and over the creek.  Our horses were fresh, and we had a scurry or two, of course; but there wasn&#x27;t one that could hold a candle to Jim&#x27;s brown horse. He was a long-striding, smooth goer, but he got over the ground in wonderful style.  He could jump, too, for Jim put him over a big log fence or two, and he sailed over them like a forester buck over the head of a fallen wattle. Well, we&#x27;d had our lark at the Bundah Royal Hotel, and were coming home to tea at the station, all in good spirits, but sober enough, when, just as we were crossing one of the roads that came through the run -- over the `Pretty Plain&#x27;, as they called it -- we heard a horse coming along best pace.  When we looked who should it be but Miss Falkland, the owner&#x27;s only daughter. She was an only child, and the very apple of her father&#x27;s eye, you may be sure.  The shearers mostly knew her by sight, because she had taken a fancy to come down with her father a couple of times to see the shed when we were all in full work. A shed&#x27;s not exactly the best place for a young lady to come into. Shearers are rough in their language now and then.  But every man liked and respected Mr. Falkland, so we all put ourselves on our best behaviour, and the two or three flash fellows who had no sense or decent feeling were warned that if they broke out at all they would get something to remember it by. But when we saw that beautiful, delicate-looking creature stepping down the boards between the two rows of shearers, most of them stripped to their jerseys and working like steam-engines, looking curiously and pitifully at the tired men and the patient sheep, with her great, soft, dark eyes and fair white face like a lily, we began to think we&#x27;d heard of angels from heaven, but never seen one before. Just as she came opposite Jim, who was trying to shear sheep and sheep with the `ringer&#x27; of the shed, who was next on our right, the wether he was holding kicked, and knocking the shears out of his hand, sent them point down against his wrist.  One of the points went right in, and though it didn&#x27;t cut the sinews, as luck would have it, the point stuck out at the other side; out spurted the blood, and Jim was just going to let out when he looked up and saw Miss Falkland looking at him, with her beautiful eyes so full of pity and surprise that he could have had his hand chopped off, so he told me afterwards, rather than vex her for a moment.  So he shut up his mouth and ground his teeth together, for it was no joke in the way of pain, and the blood began to run like a blind creek after a thunderstorm. `Oh! poor fellow.  What a dreadful cut!  Look, papa!&#x27; she cried out. `Hadn&#x27;t something better be bound round it?  How it bleeds! Does it pain much?&#x27; `Not a bit, miss!&#x27; said Jim, standing up like a schoolboy going to say his lesson.  `That is, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it don&#x27;t stop my shearing.&#x27; `Tar!&#x27; sings out my next-door neighbour.  `Here, boy; tar wanted for No. 36. That&#x27;ll put it all right, Jim; it&#x27;s only a scratch.&#x27; `You mind your shearing, my man,&#x27; said Mr. Falkland quietly.  `I don&#x27;t know whether Mr. M`Intyre will quite approve of that last sheep of yours. This is rather a serious wound.  The best thing is to bind it up at once.&#x27; Before any one could say another word Miss Falkland had whipped out her soft fine cambric handkerchief and torn it in two. `Hold up your hand,&#x27; she said.  `Now, papa, lend me yours.&#x27;  With the last she cleared the wound of the flowing blood, and then neatly and skilfully bound up the wrist firmly with the strips of cambric. This she further protected by her father&#x27;s handkerchief, which she helped herself to and finally stopped the blood with. Jim kept looking at her small white hands all the time she was doing it. Neither of us had ever seen such before -- the dainty skin, the pink nails, the glittering rings. `There,&#x27; she said, `I don&#x27;t think you ought to shear any more to-day; it might bring on inflammation.  I&#x27;ll send to know how it gets on to-morrow.&#x27; `No, miss; my grateful thanks, miss,&#x27; said Jim, opening his eyes and looking as if he&#x27;d like to drop down on his knees and pray to her. `I shall never forget your goodness, Miss Falkland, if I live till I&#x27;m a hundred.&#x27;  Then Jim bent his head a bit -- I don&#x27;t suppose he ever made a bow in his life before -- and then drew himself up as straight as a soldier, and Miss Falkland made a kind of bow and smile to us all and passed out. Jim did shear all the same that afternoon, though the tally wasn&#x27;t any great things.  `I can&#x27;t go and lie down in a bunk in the men&#x27;s hut,&#x27; he said; `I must chance it,&#x27; and he did.  Next day it was worse and very painful, but Jim stuck to the shears, though he used to turn white with the pain at times, and I thought he&#x27;d faint.  However, it gradually got better, and, except a scar, Jim&#x27;s hand was as good as ever. Jim sent back Mr. Falkland&#x27;s handkerchief after getting the cook to wash it and iron it out with a bit of a broken axletree; but the strips of white handkerchief -- one had C. F. in the corner -- he put away in his swag, and made some foolish excuse when I laughed at him about it. She sent down a boy from the house next day to ask how Jim&#x27;s hand was, and the day after that, but she never came to the shed any more. So we didn&#x27;t see her again. So it was this young lady that we saw coming tearing down the back road, as they called it, that led over the Pretty Plain.  A good way behind we saw Mr. Falkland, but he had as much chance of coming up with her as a cattle dog of catching a `brush flyer&#x27;. The stable boy, Billy Donnellan, had told us (of course, like all those sort of youngsters, he was fond of getting among the men and listening to them talk) all about Miss Falkland&#x27;s new mare. She was a great beauty and thoroughbred.  The stud groom had bought her out of a travelling mob from New England when she was dog-poor and hardly able to drag herself along.  Everybody thought she was going to be the best lady&#x27;s horse in the district; but though she was as quiet as a lamb at first she had begun to show a nasty temper lately, and to get very touchy.  `I don&#x27;t care about chestnuts myself,&#x27; says Master Billy, smoking a short pipe as if he was thirty; `they&#x27;ve a deal of temper, and she&#x27;s got too much white in her eye for my money.  I&#x27;m afeard she&#x27;ll do some mischief afore we&#x27;ve done with her; and Miss Falkland&#x27;s that game as she won&#x27;t have nothing done to her. I&#x27;d ride the tail off her but what I&#x27;d bring her to, if I had my way.&#x27; So this was the brute that had got away with Miss Falkland, the day we were coming back from Bundah.  Some horses, and a good many men and women, are all pretty right as long as they&#x27;re well kept under and starved a bit at odd times. But give them an easy life and four feeds of corn a day, and they&#x27;re troublesome brutes, and mischievous too. It seems this mare came of a strain that had turned out more devils and killed more grooms and breakers than any other in the country. She was a Troubadour, it seems; there never was a Troubadour yet that wouldn&#x27;t buck and bolt, and smash himself and his rider, if he got a fright, or his temper was roused.  Men and women, horses and dogs, are very much alike.  I know which can talk best.  As to the rest, I don&#x27;t know whether there&#x27;s so much for us to be proud of. It seems that this cranky wretch of a mare had been sideling and fidgeting when Mr. Falkland and his daughter started for their ride; but had gone pretty fairly -- Miss Falkland, like my sister Aileen, could ride anything in reason -- when suddenly a dead limb dropped off a tree close to the side of the road. I believe she made one wild plunge, and set to; she propped and reared, but Miss Falkland sat her splendidly and got her head up. When she saw she could do nothing that way, she stretched out her head and went off as hard as she could lay legs to the ground. She had one of those mouths that are not so bad when horses are going easy, but get quite callous when they are over-eager and excited. Anyhow, it was like trying to stop a mail-coach going down Mount Victoria with the brake off. So what we saw was the wretch of a mare coming along as if the devil was after her, and heading straight across the plain at its narrowest part; it wasn&#x27;t more than half-a-mile wide there, in fact, it was more like a flat than a plain.  The people about Boree didn&#x27;t see much open country, so they made a lot out of what they had. The mare, like some women when they get their monkey up, was clean out of her senses, and I don&#x27;t believe anything could have held her under a hide rope with a turn round a stockyard post. This was what she wanted, and if it had broken her infernal neck so much the better. Miss Falkland was sitting straight and square, with her hands down, leaning a bit back, and doing her level best to stop the brute. Her hat was off and her hair had fallen down and hung down her back -- plenty of it there was, too.  The mare&#x27;s neck was stretched straight out; her mouth was like a deal board, I expect, by that time. We didn&#x27;t sit staring at her all the time, you bet.  We could see the boy ever so far off.  We gathered up our reins and went after her, not in a hurry, but just collecting ourselves a bit to see what would be the best way to wheel the brute and stop her. Jim&#x27;s horse was far and away the fastest, and he let out to head the mare off from a creek that was just in front and at the end of the plain. `By George!&#x27; said one of the men -- a young fellow who lived near the place -- `the mare&#x27;s turning off her course, and she&#x27;s heading straight for the Trooper&#x27;s Downfall, where the policeman was killed. If she goes over that, they&#x27;ll be smashed up like a matchbox, horse and rider.&#x27; `What&#x27;s that?&#x27; I said, closing up alongside of him.  We were all doing our best, and were just in the line to back up Jim, who looked as if he was overhauling the mare fast. `Why, it&#x27;s a bluff a hundred feet deep -- a straight drop -- and rocks at the bottom.  She&#x27;s making as straight as a bee-line for it now, blast her!&#x27; `And Jim don&#x27;t know it,&#x27; I said; `he&#x27;s closing up to her, but he doesn&#x27;t calculate to do it for a quarter of a mile more; he&#x27;s letting her take it out of herself.&#x27; `He&#x27;ll never catch her in time,&#x27; said the young chap.  `My God! it&#x27;s an awful thing, isn&#x27;t it? and a fine young lady like her -- so kind to us chaps as she was.&#x27; `I&#x27;ll see if I can make Jim hear,&#x27; I said, for though I looked cool I was as nearly mad as I could be to think of such a girl being lost before our eyes.  `No, I can&#x27;t do that, but I&#x27;ll TELEGRAPH.&#x27; Chapter 10 Now Jim and I had had many a long talk together about what we should do in case we wanted to signal to each other very pressing.  We thought the time might come some day when we might be near enough to sign, but not to speak. So we hit upon one or two things a little out of the common. The first idea was, in case of one wanting to give the other the office that he was to look out his very brightest for danger, and not to trust to what appeared to be the state of affairs, the sign was to hold up your hat or cap straight over your head. If the danger threatened on the left, to shift to that side. If it was very pressing and on the jump, as it were, quite unexpected, and as bad as bad could be, the signalman was to get up on the saddle with his knees and turn half round. We could do this easy enough and a lot of circus tricks besides. How had we learned them?  Why, in the long days we had spent in the saddle tailing the milkers and searching after lost horses for many a night. As luck would have it Jim looked round to see how we were getting on, and up went my cap.  I could see him turn his head and keep watching me when I put on the whole box and dice of the telegraph business. He `dropped&#x27;, I could see.  He took up the brown horse, and made such a rush to collar the mare that showed he intended to see for himself what the danger was.  The cross-grained jade! She was a well-bred wretch, and be hanged to her!  Went as if she wanted to win the Derby and gave Jim all he knew to challenge her. We could see a line of timber just ahead of her, and that Jim was riding for his life. `By ----! they&#x27;ll both be over it,&#x27; said the young shearer. `They can&#x27;t stop themselves at that pace, and they must be close up now.&#x27; `He&#x27;s neck and neck,&#x27; I said.  `Stick to her, Jim, old man!&#x27; We were all close together now.  Several of the men knew the place, and the word had been passed round. No one spoke for a few seconds.  We saw the two horses rush up at top speed to the very edge of the timber. `By Jove! they&#x27;re over.  No! he&#x27;s reaching for her rein.  It&#x27;s no use. Now -- now!  She&#x27;s saved!  Oh, my God! they&#x27;re both right.  By the Lord, well done!  Hurrah!  One cheer more for Jim Marston!&#x27; .    .    .    .    . It was all right.  We saw Jim suddenly reach over as the horses were going stride and stride; saw him lift Miss Falkland from her saddle as if she had been a child and place her before him; saw the brown horse prop, and swing round on his haunches in a way that showed he had not been called the crack `cutting-out&#x27; horse on a big cattle run for nothing. We saw Jim jump to the ground and lift the young lady down. We saw only one horse. Three minutes after Mr. Falkland overtook us, and we rode up together. His face was white, and his dry lips couldn&#x27;t find words at first. But he managed to say to Jim, when we got up -- `You have saved my child&#x27;s life, James Marston, and if I forget the service may God in that hour forget me.  You are a noble fellow.  You must allow me to show my gratitude in some way.&#x27; `You needn&#x27;t thank me so out and out as all that, Mr. Falkland,&#x27; said Jim, standing up very straight and looking at the father first, and then at Miss Falkland, who was pale and trembling, not altogether from fear, but excitement, and trying to choke back the sobs that would come out now and then.  `I&#x27;d risk life and limb any day before Miss Falkland&#x27;s finger should be scratched, let alone see her killed before my eyes.  I wonder if there&#x27;s anything left of the mare, poor thing; not that she don&#x27;t deserve it all, and more.&#x27; Here we all walked forward to the deep creek bank.  A yard or two farther and the brown horse and his burden must have gone over the terrible drop, as straight as a plumb-line, on to the awful rocks below. We could see where the brown had torn up the turf as he struck all four hoofs deep into it at once.  Indeed, he had been newly shod, a freak of Jim&#x27;s about a bet with a travelling blacksmith.  Then the other tracks, the long score on the brink -- over the brink -- where the frightened, maddened animal had made an attempt to alter her speed, all in vain, and had plunged over the bank and the hundred feet of fall. We peered over, and saw a bright-coloured mass among the rocks below -- very still.  Just at the time one of the ration-carriers came by with a spring cart.  Mr. Falkland lifted his daughter in and took the reins, leaving his horse to be ridden home by the ration-carrier. As for us we rode back to the shearers&#x27; hut, not quite so fast as we came, with Jim in the middle.  He did not seem inclined to talk much. `It&#x27;s lucky I turned round when I did, Dick,&#x27; he said at last, `and saw you making the &quot;danger-look-out-sharp&quot; signal.  I couldn&#x27;t think what the dickens it was.  I was so cocksure of catching the mare in half-a-mile farther that I couldn&#x27;t help wondering what it was all about. Anyhow, I knew we agreed it was never to be worked for nothing, so thought the best thing I could do was to call in the mare, and see if I could find out anything then.  When I got alongside, I could see that Miss Falkland&#x27;s face was that white that something must be up. It weren&#x27;t the mare she was afraid of.  She was coming back to her. It took something to frighten her, I knew.  So it must be something I did not know, or didn&#x27;t see. `&quot;What is it, Miss Falkland?&quot; I said. `&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried out, &quot;don&#x27;t you know?  Another fifty yards and we&#x27;ll be over the downfall where the trooper was killed.  Oh, my poor father!&quot; `&quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot; I said.  &quot;We&#x27;ll not go over if I can help it.&quot; `So I reached over and got hold of the reins.  I pulled and jerked. She said her hands were cramped, and no wonder.  Pulling double for a four-mile heat is no joke, even if a man&#x27;s in training. Fancy a woman, a young girl, having to sit still and drag at a runaway horse all the time.  I couldn&#x27;t stop the brute; she was boring like a wild bull. So just as we came pretty close I lifted Miss Falkland off the saddle and yelled at old Brownie as if I had been on a cattle camp, swinging round to the near side at the same time.  Round he came like one o&#x27;clock. I could see the mare make one prop to stop herself, and then go flying right through the air, till I heard a beastly &quot;thud&quot; at the bottom. `Miss Falkland didn&#x27;t faint, though she turned white and then red, and trembled like a leaf when I lifted her down, and looked up at me with a sweet smile, and said -- `&quot;Jim, you have paid me for binding up your wrist, haven&#x27;t you? You have saved me from a horrible death, and I shall think of you as a brave and noble fellow all the days of my life.&quot; `What could I say?&#x27; said Jim.  `I stared at her like a fool. &quot;I&#x27;d have gone over the bank with you, Miss Falkland,&quot; I said, &quot;if I could not have saved you.&quot; `&quot;Well, I&#x27;m afraid some of my admirers would have stopped short of that, James,&quot; she said.  She did indeed.  And then Mr. Falkland and all of you came up.&#x27; `I say, Jim,&#x27; said one of the young fellows, `your fortune&#x27;s made. Mr. Falkland &#x27;ll stand a farm, you may be sure, for this little fakement.&#x27; `And I say, Jack,&#x27; says old Jim, very quiet like, `I&#x27;ve told you all the yarn, and if there&#x27;s any chaff about it after this the cove will have to see whether he&#x27;s best man or me; so don&#x27;t make any mistake now.&#x27; There was no more chaff.  They weren&#x27;t afraid.  There were two or three of them pretty smart with their hands, and not likely to take much from anybody.  But Jim was a heavy weight and could hit like a horse kicking; so they thought it wasn&#x27;t good enough, and left him alone. Next day Mr. Falkland came down and wanted to give Jim a cheque for a hundred; but he wouldn&#x27;t hear of so much as a note.  Then he said he&#x27;d give him a billet on the run -- make him under overseer; after a bit buy a farm for him and stock it.  No!  Jim wouldn&#x27;t touch nothing or take a billet on the place.  He wouldn&#x27;t leave his family, he said. And as for taking money or anything else for saving Miss Falkland&#x27;s life, it was ridiculous to think of it.  There wasn&#x27;t a man of the lot in the shed, down to the tarboy, that wouldn&#x27;t have done the same, or tried to. All that was in it was that his horse was the fastest. `It&#x27;s not a bad thing for a poor man to have a fast horse now and then, is it, Mr. Falkland?&#x27; he said, looking up and smiling, just like a boy. He was very shy, was poor Jim. `I don&#x27;t grudge a poor man a good horse or anything else he likes to have or enjoy.  You know that, all of you.  It&#x27;s the fear I have of the effect of the dishonest way that horses of value are come by, and the net of roguery that often entangles fine young fellows like you and your brother; that&#x27;s what I fear,&#x27; said Mr. Falkland, looking at the pair of us so kind and pitiful like. I looked him in the face, though I felt I could not say he was wrong. I felt, too, just then, as if I could have given all the world to be afraid of no man&#x27;s opinion. What a thing it is to be perfectly honest and straight -- to be able to look the whole world in the face! But if more gentlemen were like Mr. Falkland I do really believe no one would rob them for very shame&#x27;s sake.  When shearing was over we were all paid up -- shearers, washers, knock-about men, cooks, and extra shepherds. Every soul about the place except Mr. M`Intyre and Mr. Falkland seemed to have got a cheque and a walking-ticket at the same time. Away they went, like a lot of boys out of school; and half of &#x27;em didn&#x27;t show as much sense either.  As for me and Jim we had no particular wish to go home before Christmas.  So as there&#x27;s always contracts to be let about a big run like Banda we took a contract for some bush work, and went at it.  Mr. M`Intyre looked quite surprised.  But Mr. Falkland praised us up, and was proud we were going to turn over a new leaf. Nobody could say at that time we didn&#x27;t work.  Fencing, dam-making, horse-breaking, stock-riding, from making hay to building a shed, all bushwork came easy enough to us, Jim in particular; he took a pleasure in it, and was never happier than when he&#x27;d had a real tearing day&#x27;s work and was settling himself after his tea to a good steady smoke. A great smoker he&#x27;d come to be.  He never was much for drinking except now and again, and then he could knock it off as easy as any man I ever seen.  Poor old Jim!  He was born good and intended to be so, like mother.  Like her, his luck was dead out in being mixed up with a lot like ours. One day we were out at the back making some lambing yards.  We were about twenty miles from the head station and had about finished the job. We were going in the next day.  We had been camping in an old shepherd&#x27;s hut and had been pretty jolly all by ourselves.  There was first-rate feed for our horses, as the grass was being saved for the lambing season. Jim was in fine spirits, and as we had plenty of good rations and first-rate tobacco we made ourselves pretty comfortable. `What a jolly thing it is to have nothing on your mind!&#x27; Jim used to say. `I hadn&#x27;t once, and what a fine time it was!  Now I&#x27;m always waking up with a start and expecting to see a policeman or that infernal half-caste. He&#x27;s never far off when there&#x27;s villainy on.  Some fine day he&#x27;ll sell us all, I really do believe.&#x27; `If he don&#x27;t somebody else will; but why do you pitch upon him? You don&#x27;t like him somehow; I don&#x27;t see that he&#x27;s worse than any other. Besides, we haven&#x27;t done anything much to have a reward put on us.&#x27; `No! that&#x27;s to come,&#x27; answered Jim, very dismally for him. `I don&#x27;t see what else is to come of it.  Hist! isn&#x27;t that a horse&#x27;s step coming this way?  Yes, and a man on him, too.&#x27; It was a bright night, though only the stars were out; but the weather was that clear that you could see ever so well and hear ever so far also. Jim had a blackfellow&#x27;s hearing; his eyes were like a hawk&#x27;s; he could see in about any light, and read tracks like a printed book. I could hear nothing at first; then I heard a slight noise a good way off, and a stick breaking every now and then. `Talk of the devil!&#x27; growled Jim, `and here he comes. I believe that&#x27;s Master Warrigal, infernal scoundrel that he is. Of course he&#x27;s got a message from our respectable old dad or Starlight, asking us to put our heads in a noose for them again.&#x27; `How do you know?&#x27; `I know it&#x27;s that ambling horse he used to ride,&#x27; says Jim. `I can make out his sideling kind of way of using his legs. All amblers do that.&#x27; `You&#x27;re right,&#x27; I said, after listening for a minute.  `I can hear the regular pace, different from a horse&#x27;s walk.&#x27; `How does he know we&#x27;re here, I wonder?&#x27; says Jim. `Some of the telegraphs piped us, I suppose,&#x27; I answered.  `I begin to wish they forgot us altogether.&#x27; `No such luck,&#x27; says Jim.  `Let&#x27;s keep dark and see what this black snake of a Warrigal will be up to.  I don&#x27;t expect he&#x27;ll ride straight up to the door.&#x27; He was right.  The horse hoofs stopped just inside a thick bit of scrub, just outside the open ground on which the hut stood.  After a few seconds we heard the cry of the mopoke.  It&#x27;s not a cheerful sound at the dead of night, and now, for some reason or other, it affected Jim and me in much the same manner.  I remembered the last time I had heard the bird at home, just before we started over for Terrible Hollow, and it seemed unlucky.  Perhaps we were both a little nervous; we hadn&#x27;t drunk anything but tea for weeks.  We drank it awfully black and strong, and a great lot of it. Anyhow, as we heard the quick light tread of the horse pacing in his two-feet-on-one-side way over the sandy, thin-grassed soil, every moment coming nearer and nearer, and this queer dismal-voiced bird hooting its hoarse deep notes out of the dark tree that swished and sighed-like in front of the sandhill, a queer feeling came over both of us that something unlucky was on the boards for us.  We felt quite relieved when the horse&#x27;s footsteps stopped.  After a minute or so we could see a dark form creeping towards the hut. Chapter 11 Warrigal left his horse at the edge of the timber, for fear he might want him in a hurry, I suppose.  He was pretty `fly&#x27;, and never threw away a chance as long as he was sober.  He could drink a bit, like the rest of us, now and then -- not often -- but when he did it made a regular devil of him -- that is, it brought the devil out that lives low down in most people&#x27;s hearts. He was a worse one than usual, Jim said.  He saw him once in one of his break-outs, and heard him boast of something he&#x27;d done. Jim never liked him afterwards.  For the matter of that he hated Jim and me too.  The only living things he cared about were Starlight and the three-cornered weed he rode, that had been a `brumbee&#x27;, and wouldn&#x27;t let any one touch him, much less ride him, but himself. How he used to snort if a stranger came near him!  He could kick the eye out of a mosquito, and bite too, if he got the chance. As for Warrigal, Starlight used to knock him down like a log if he didn&#x27;t please him, but he never offered to turn upon him. He seemed to like it, and looked regular put out once when Starlight hurt his knuckles against his hard skull. Us he didn&#x27;t like, as I said before -- why, I don&#x27;t know -- nor we him. Likes and dislikes are curious things.  People hardly know the rights of them. But if you take a regular strong down upon a man or woman when you first see &#x27;em it&#x27;s ten to one that you&#x27;ll find some day as you&#x27;ve good reason for it.  We couldn&#x27;t say what grounds we had for hating the sight of Warrigal neither, for he was as good a tracker as ever followed man or beasts.  He could read all the signs of the bush like a printed book.  He could ride any horse in the world, and find his way, day or night, to any place he&#x27;d ever once been to in his life. Sometimes we should have been hard pushed when we were making across country at night only for him.  Hour after hour he&#x27;d ride ahead through scrub or forest, up hill or down dale, with that brute of a horse of his -- he called him `Bilbah&#x27; -- ambling away, till our horses, except Rainbow, used to shake the lives out of us jogging. I believe he did it on purpose. He was a fine shot, and could catch fish and game in all sorts of ways that came in handy when we had to keep dark.  He had pluck enough, and could fight a pretty sharp battle with his fists if he wasn&#x27;t overweighted. There were white men that didn&#x27;t at all find him a good thing if they went to bully him.  He tried it on with Jim once, but he knocked the seven senses out of him inside of three rounds, and that satisfied him. He pretended to make up, but I was always expecting him to play us some dog&#x27;s trick yet.  Anyway, so far he was all right, and as long as Starlight and us were mixed up together, he couldn&#x27;t hurt one without the other.  He came gliding up to the old hut in the dull light by bits of moves, just as if he&#x27;d been a bush that had changed its place. We pretended to be asleep near the fire. He peeped in through a chink.  He could see us by the firelight, and didn&#x27;t suppose we were watching him. `Hullo, Warrigal!&#x27; sung out Jim suddenly, `what&#x27;s up now? Some devil&#x27;s work, I suppose, or you wouldn&#x27;t be in it. Why don&#x27;t you knock at a gentleman&#x27;s door when you come a visiting?&#x27; `Wasn&#x27;t sure it was you,&#x27; he answered, showing his teeth; `it don&#x27;t do to get sold.  Might been troopers, for all I know.&#x27; `Pity we wasn&#x27;t,&#x27; said Jim; `I&#x27;d have the hobbles on you by this time, and you&#x27;d have got &quot;fitted&quot; to rights.  I wish I&#x27;d gone into the police sometimes.  It isn&#x27;t a bad game for a chap that can ride and track, and likes a bit of rough-and-tumble now and then.&#x27; `If I&#x27;d been a police tracker I&#x27;d have had as good a chance of nailing you, Jim Marston,&#x27; spoke up Warrigal.  `Perhaps I will some day. Mr. Garton wanted me bad once, and said they&#x27;d never go agin me for old times. But that says nothin&#x27;.  Starlight&#x27;s out at the back and the old man, too. They want you to go to them -- sharp.&#x27; `What for?&#x27; `Dunno.  I was to tell you, and show the camp; and now gimme some grub, for I&#x27;ve had nothing since sunrise but the leg of a &#x27;possum.&#x27; `All right,&#x27; said Jim, putting the billy on; `here&#x27;s some damper and mutton to go on with while the tea warms.&#x27; `Wait till I hobble out Bilbah; he&#x27;s as hungry as I am, and thirsty too, my word.&#x27; `Take some out of the barrel; we shan&#x27;t want it to-morrow,&#x27; said Jim. Hungry as Warrigal was -- and when he began to eat I thought he never would stop -- he went and looked after his horse first, and got him a couple of buckets of water out of the cask they used to send us out every week.  There was no surface water near the hut. Then he hobbled him out of a bit of old sheep-yard, and came in. The more I know of men the more I see what curious lumps of good and bad they&#x27;re made up of.  People that won&#x27;t stick at anything in some ways will be that soft and good-feeling in others -- ten times more so than your regular good people.  Any one that thinks all mankind&#x27;s divided into good, bad, and middlin&#x27;, and that they can draft &#x27;em like a lot of cattle -- some to one yard, some to another -- don&#x27;t know much. There&#x27;s a mob in most towns though, I think, that wants boilin&#x27; down bad. Some day they&#x27;ll do it, maybe; they&#x27;ll have to when all the good country&#x27;s stocked up.  After Warrigal had his supper he went out again to see his horse, and then coiled himself up before the fire and wouldn&#x27;t hardly say another word. `How far was it to where Starlight was?&#x27; `Long way.  Took me all day to come.&#x27; `Had he been there long?&#x27; `Yes; had a camp there.&#x27; `Anybody else with him?&#x27; `Three more men from this side.&#x27; `Did the old man say we were to come at once?&#x27; `Yes, or leave it alone -- which you liked.&#x27; Then he shut his eyes, and his mouth too, and was soon as fast asleep as if he never intended to wake under a week. `What shall we do, Jim?&#x27; I said; `go or not?&#x27; `If you leave it to me,&#x27; says Jim, `I say, don&#x27;t go.  It&#x27;s only some other cross cattle or horse racket.  We&#x27;re bound to be nobbled some day. Why not cut it now, and stick to the square thing?  We couldn&#x27;t do better than we&#x27;re doing now.  It&#x27;s rather slow, but we&#x27;ll have a good cheque by Christmas.&#x27; `I&#x27;m half a mind to tell Warrigal to go back and say we&#x27;re not on,&#x27; I said. `Lots of other chaps would join without making any bones about it.&#x27; `Hoo -- hoo -- hoo -- hoo,&#x27; sounded once more the night-bird from the black tree outside. `D---- the bird!  I believe he&#x27;s the devil in the shape of a mopoke! And yet I don&#x27;t like Starlight to think we&#x27;re afraid.  He and the old man might be in a fix and want help.  Suppose we toss up?&#x27; `All right,&#x27; says Jim, speaking rather slowly. You couldn&#x27;t tell from his face or voice how he felt about it; but I believe now -- more than that, he let on once to me -- that he was awfully cut up about my changing, and thought we were just in for a spell of straightforward work, and would stash the other thing for good and all. We put the fire together.  It burnt up bright for a bit. I pulled out a shilling. `If it&#x27;s head we go, Jim; if it&#x27;s woman, we stay here.&#x27; I sent up the coin; we both bent over near the fire to look at it. The head was uppermost. `Hoo -- hoo -- hoo -- hoo,&#x27; came the night-bird&#x27;s harsh croak. There was a heavyish stake on that throw, if we&#x27;d only known. Only ruin -- only death.  Four men&#x27;s lives lost, and three women made miserable for life. Jim and I looked at one another.  He smiled and opened the door. `It&#x27;s all the fault of that cursed owl, I believe,&#x27; he said; `I&#x27;ll have his life if he waits till it&#x27;s daylight. We must be off early and get up our horses.  I know what a long day for Warrigal and that ambling three-cornered devil of his means -- seventy or eighty miles, if it&#x27;s a yard.&#x27; We slept sound enough till daybreak, and COULD SLEEP then, whatever was on the card.  As for Jim, he slept like a baby always once he turned in.  When I woke I got up at once.  It was half dark; there was a little light in the east.  But Warrigal had been out before me, and was leading his horse up to the hut with the hobbles in his hand. Our horses were not far off; one of them had a bell on. Jim had his old brown, and I had a chestnut that I thought nearly as good. We weren&#x27;t likely to have anything to ride that wasn&#x27;t middlin&#x27; fast and plucky.  Them that overhauled us would have to ride for it. We saddled up and took our blankets and what few things we couldn&#x27;t do without.  The rest stopped in the hut for any one that came after us.  We left our wages, too, and never asked for &#x27;em from that day to this.  A trifle like that didn&#x27;t matter after what we were going in for.  More&#x27;s the pity. As we moved off my horse propped once or twice, and Warrigal looked at us in a queer side sort of way and showed his teeth a bit -- smile nor laugh it wasn&#x27;t, only a way he had when he thought he knew more than we did. `My word! your horse&#x27;s been where the feed&#x27;s good.  We&#x27;re goin&#x27; a good way to-day.  I wonder if they&#x27;ll be as flash as they are now.&#x27; `They&#x27;ll carry us wherever that three-cornered mule of yours will shuffle to to-night,&#x27; said Jim.  `Never you mind about them. You ride straight, and don&#x27;t get up to any monkey tricks, or, by George, I&#x27;ll straighten you, so as you&#x27;ll know better next time.&#x27; `You know a lot, Jim Marston,&#x27; said the half-caste, looking at him with his long dark sleepy eyes which I always thought were like a half-roused snake&#x27;s.  `Never mind, you&#x27;ll know more one of these days. We&#x27;d better push on.&#x27; He went off at a hand-gallop, and then pulled back into a long darting kind of canter, which Bilbah thought was quite the thing for a journey -- anyhow, he never seemed to think of stopping it -- went on mile after mile as if he was not going to pull up this side of sundown.  A wiry brute, always in condition, was this said Bilbah, and just at this time as hard as nails.  Our horses had been doing nothing lately, and being on good young feed had, of course, got fat, and were rather soft. After four or five miles they began to blow.  We couldn&#x27;t well pull up; the ground was hard in places and bad for tracking.  If we went on at the pace we should cook our horses.  As soon as we got into a bit of open I raced up to him. `Now, look here, Warrigal,&#x27; I said, `you know why you&#x27;re doing this, and so do I.  Our horses are not up to galloping fifty or sixty miles on end just off a spell and with no work for months.  If you don&#x27;t pull up and go our pace I&#x27;ll knock you off your horse.&#x27; `Oh! you&#x27;re riled!&#x27; he said, looking as impudent as he dared, but slackening all the same.  `Pulled up before if I knowed your horses were getting baked.  Thought they were up to anything, same as you and Jim.&#x27; `So they are.  You&#x27;ll find that one of these days.  If there&#x27;s work ahead you ought to have sense enough not to knock smoke out of fresh horses before we begin.&#x27; `All right.  Plenty of work to do, my word.  And Starlight said, &quot;Tell &#x27;em to be here to-day if they can.&quot;  I know he&#x27;s afraid of some one follerin&#x27; up our tracks, as it is.&#x27; `That&#x27;s all right, Warrigal; but you ride steady all the same, and don&#x27;t be tearing away through thick timber, like a mallee scrubber that&#x27;s got into the open and sees the devil behind him until he can get cover again.  We shall be there to-night if it&#x27;s not a hundred miles, and that&#x27;s time enough.&#x27; We did drop in for a long day, and no mistake.  We only pulled up for a short halt in the middle, and Warrigal&#x27;s cast-iron pony was off again, as if he was bound right away for the other side of the continent.  However, though we were not going slow either, but kept up a reasonable fast pace, it must have been past midnight when we rode into Starlight&#x27;s camp; very glad Jim and I were to see the fire -- not a big one either. We had been taking it pretty easy, you see, for a month or two, and were not quite so ready for an eighty-mile ride as if we had been in something like training.  The horses had had enough of it, too, though neither of them would give in, not if we&#x27;d ridden &#x27;em twenty mile farther.  As for Warrigal&#x27;s Bilbah he was near as fresh as when he started, and kept tossin&#x27; his head an&#x27; amblin&#x27; and pacin&#x27; away as if he was walkin&#x27; for a wager round a ring in a show-yard. As we rode up we could see a gunyah made out of boughs, and a longish wing of dogleg fence, made light but well put together. As soon as we got near enough a dog ran out and looked as if he was going to worry us; didn&#x27;t bark either, but turned round and waited for us to get off. `It&#x27;s old Crib,&#x27; said Jim, with a big laugh; `blest if it ain&#x27;t. Father&#x27;s somewhere handy.  They&#x27;re going to take up a back block and do the thing regular:  Marston, Starlight, and Company -- that&#x27;s the fakement.  They want us out to make dams or put up a woolshed or something.  I don&#x27;t see why they shouldn&#x27;t, as well as Crossman and Fakesley.  It&#x27;s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other, as far as being on the square goes.  Depend upon it, dad&#x27;s turned over a new leaf.&#x27; `Do you fellows want anything to eat?&#x27; said a voice that I knew to be Starlight&#x27;s.  `If you do there&#x27;s tea near the fire, and some grub in that flour bag.  Help yourselves and hobble out your horses. We&#x27;ll settle matters a bit in the morning.  Your respected parent&#x27;s abed in his own camp, and it&#x27;s just as well not to wake him, unless you want his blessing ere you sleep.&#x27; We went with Starlight to his gunyah.  A path led through a clump of pines, so thick that a man might ride round it and never dream there was anything but more pines inside.  A clear place had been made in the sandhill, and a snug crib enough rigged with saplings and a few sheets of bark. It was neat and tidy, like everything he had to do with.  `I was at sea when I was young,&#x27; he once said to Jim, when he was a bit `on&#x27;, `and a man learns to be neat there.&#x27;  There was a big chimney outside, and a lot of leaves and rushes out of a swamp which he had made Warrigal gather. `Put your blankets down there, boys, and turn in.  You&#x27;ll see how the land lies in the morning.&#x27;  We didn&#x27;t want asking twice, Jim&#x27;s eyes were nigh shut as it was.  The sun was up when we woke. Outside the first thing we saw was father and Starlight talking. Both of these seemed a bit cranky.  `It&#x27;s a d---- shame,&#x27; we heard Starlight say, as he turned and walked off.  `We could have done it well enough by ourselves.&#x27; `I know what I&#x27;m about,&#x27; says father, `it&#x27;s all or none. What&#x27;s the use of crying after being in it up to our neck?&#x27; `Some day you&#x27;ll think different,&#x27; says Starlight, looking back at him. I often remembered it afterwards. `Well, lads,&#x27; says father, looking straight at us, `I wasn&#x27;t sure as you&#x27;d come.  Starlight has been barneying with me about sending for you. But we&#x27;ve got a big thing on now, and I thought you&#x27;d like to be in it.&#x27; `We have come,&#x27; says I, pretty short.  `Now we&#x27;re here what&#x27;s the play called, and when does the curtain rise?  We&#x27;re on.&#x27; I was riled, vexed at Starlight talking as if we were children, and thought I&#x27;d show as we were men, like a young fool as I was. `All right,&#x27; says father, and he sat down on a log, and began to tell us how there was any quantity of cattle running at the back where they were camped -- a good lot strayed and mixed up, from the last dry season, and had never been mustered for years. The stockmen hardly ever came out till the autumn musters. One of the chaps that was in it knew all this side and had told them. They were going to muster for a month or so, and drive the mob right through to Adelaide.  Store cattle were dear then, and we could get them off easy there and come back by sea.  No one was to know we were not regular overlanders; and when we&#x27;d got the notes in our pockets it would be a hard matter to trace the cattle or prove that we were the men that sold &#x27;em. `How many head do you expect to get?&#x27; says Jim. `A thousand or twelve hundred; half of &#x27;em fat, and two-thirds of them young cattle.&#x27; `By George! that&#x27;s something like a haul; but you can&#x27;t muster such a lot as that without a yard.&#x27; `I know that,&#x27; says father.  `We&#x27;re putting up a yard on a little plain about a mile from here.  When they find it, it&#x27;ll be an old nest, and the birds flown.&#x27; `Well, if that ain&#x27;t the cheekiest thing I ever heard tell of,&#x27; says I laughingly.  `To put up a yard at the back of a man&#x27;s run, and muster his cattle for him!  I never heard the like before, nor any one else.  But suppose the cove or his men come across it?&#x27; `&#x27;Tain&#x27;t no ways likely,&#x27; says father.  `They&#x27;re the sleepiest lot of chaps in this frontage I ever saw.  It&#x27;s hardly worth while &quot;touching&quot; them. There&#x27;s no fun in it.  It&#x27;s like shooting pheasants when they ain&#x27;t preserved. There&#x27;s no risk, and when there&#x27;s no risk there&#x27;s no pleasure. Anyway that&#x27;s my notion.&#x27; `Talking about risks, why didn&#x27;t you work that Marquis of Lorne racket better? We saw in the papers that the troopers hunted you so close you had to kill him in the ranges.&#x27; Father looked over at us and then began to laugh -- not long, and he broke off short.  Laughing wasn&#x27;t much in his line. `Killed him, did we?  And a horse worth nigh on to two thousand pounds. You ought to have known your old father better than that. We did kill A chestnut horse, one we picked out a purpose; white legs, white knee, short under lip, everything quite regular. We even fed him for a week on prairie grass, just like the Marquis had been eating.  Bless you, we knew how to work all that. We deceived Windhall his own self, and he thinks he&#x27;s pretty smart. No! the Marquis is all safe -- you know where.&#x27; I opened my eyes and stared at father. `You&#x27;ve some call to crow if you can work things like that. How you ever got him away beats me; but not more than how you managed to keep him hid with a ring of troopers all round you from every side of the district.&#x27; `We had friends,&#x27; father said.  `Me and Warrigal done all the travelling by night.  No one but him could have gone afoot, I believe, much less led a blood horse through the beastly scrub and ranges he showed us. But the devil himself could not beat him and that little brute Bilbah in rough country.&#x27; `I believe you,&#x27; I said, thinking of our ride yesterday. `It&#x27;s quite bad enough to follow him on level ground.  But don&#x27;t you think our tracks will be easy to follow with a thousand head of cattle before us? Any fool could do that.&#x27; `It ain&#x27;t that as I&#x27;m looking at,&#x27; said father; `of course an old woman could do it, and knit stockings all the time; but our dart is to be off and have a month&#x27;s start before anybody knows they are off the run. They won&#x27;t think of mustering before fat cattle takes a bit of a turn. That won&#x27;t be for a couple of months yet.  Then they may catch us if they can.&#x27; We had a long talk with Starlight, and what he said came to much the same. One stockman they had `squared&#x27;, and he was to stand in. They had got two or three flash chaps to help muster and drive, who were to swear they thought we were dealers, and had bought cattle all right.  One or two more were to meet us farther on. If we could get the cattle together and clear off before anything was suspected the rest was easy.  The yard was nearly up, and Jim and I wired in and soon finished it.  It didn&#x27;t want very grand work putting into it as long as it would last our time. So we put it up roughly, but pretty strong, with pine saplings. The drawing in was the worst, for we had to `hump&#x27; the most of them ourselves. Jim couldn&#x27;t help bursting out laughing from time to time. `It does seem such a jolly cheeky thing,&#x27; he said.  `Driving off a mob of cattle on the quiet I&#x27;ve known happen once or twice; but I&#x27;m dashed if ever I heard tell of putting up duffing improvements of a superior class on a cove&#x27;s run and clearing off with a thousand drafted cattle, all quiet and regular, and him pottering about his home-station and never &quot;dropping&quot; to it no more than if he was in Sydney.&#x27; `People ought to look after their stock closer than they do,&#x27; I said. `It is their fault almost as much as ours.  But they are too lazy to look after their own work, and too miserable to pay a good man to do it for them.  They just get a half-and-half sort of fellow that&#x27;ll take low wages and make it up with duffing, and of course he&#x27;s not likely to look very sharp after the back country.&#x27; `You&#x27;re not far away,&#x27; says Jim; `but don&#x27;t you think they&#x27;d have to look precious sharp and get up very early in the morning to be level with chaps like father and Starlight, let alone Warrigal, who&#x27;s as good by night as day?  Then there&#x27;s you and me. Don&#x27;t try and make us out better than we are, Dick; we&#x27;re all d---- scoundrels, that&#x27;s the truth of it, and honest men haven&#x27;t a chance with us, except in the long run -- except in the long run. That&#x27;s where they&#x27;ll have us, Dick Marston.&#x27; `That&#x27;s quite a long speech for you, Jim,&#x27; I said; `but it don&#x27;t matter much that I know of whose fault it is that we&#x27;re in this duffing racket. It seems to be our fate, as the chap says in the book. We&#x27;ll have a jolly spree in Adelaide if this journey comes out right. And now let&#x27;s finish this evening off.  To-morrow they&#x27;re going to yard the first mob.&#x27; After that we didn&#x27;t talk much except about the work.  Starlight and Warrigal were out every day and all day.  The three new hands were some chaps who formed part of a gang that did most of the horse-stealing in that neighbourhood, though they never showed up.  The way they managed it was this.  They picked up any good-looking nag or second-class racehorse that they fell across, and took them to a certain place.  There they met another lot of fellows, who took the horses from them and cleared out to another colony; at the same time they left the horses they had brought. So each lot travelled different ways, and were sold in places where they were quite strange and no one was likely to claim them. After a man had had a year or two at this kind of work, he was good, or rather bad, for anything.  These young chaps, like us, had done pretty well at these games, and one of them, falling in with Starlight, had proposed to him to put up a couple of hundred head of cattle on Outer Back Momberah, as the run was called; then father and he had seen that a thousand were as easy to get as a hundred.  Of course there was a risky feeling, but it wasn&#x27;t such bad fun while it lasted.  We were out all day running in the cattle.  The horses were in good wind and condition now; we had plenty of rations -- flour, tea, and sugar.  There was no cart, but some good packhorses, just the same as if we were a regular station party on our own run.  Father had worked all that before we came. We had the best of fresh beef and veal too -- you may be sure of that -- there was no stint in that line; and at night we were always sure of a yarn from Starlight -- that is, if he was in a good humour.  Sometimes he wasn&#x27;t, and then nobody dared speak to him, not even father. He was an astonishing man, certainly.  Jim and I used to wonder, by the hour, what he&#x27;d been in the old country.  He&#x27;d been all over the world -- in the Islands and New Zealand; in America, and among Malays and other strange people that we&#x27;d hardly ever heard of. Such stories as he&#x27;d tell us, too, about slaves and wild chiefs that he&#x27;d lived with and gone out to fight with against their enemy. `People think a great deal of a dead man now and then in this innocent country,&#x27; he said once when the grog was uppermost; `why, I&#x27;ve seen fifty men killed before breakfast, and in cold blood, too, chopped up alive, or next thing to it; and a drove of slaves -- men, women, and children -- as big nearly as our mob, handed over to a slave-dealer, and driven off in chains just as you&#x27;d start a lot of station cattle.  They didn&#x27;t like it, going off their run either, poor devils.  The women would try and run back after their pickaninnies when they dropped, just like that heifer when Warrigal knocked her calf on the head to-day.&#x27; What a man he was!  This was something like life, Jim and I thought. When we&#x27;d sold the cattle, if we got &#x27;em down to Adelaide all right, we&#x27;d take a voyage to some foreign country, perhaps, and see sights too. What a paltry thing working for a pound a week seemed when a rise like this was to be made! Well, the long and short of it is that we mustered the cattle quite comfortably, nobody coming anext or anigh us any more than if we&#x27;d taken the thing by contract.  You wouldn&#x27;t have thought there was anybody nearer than Bathurst.  Everything seemed to be in our favour.  So it was, just at the start.  We drafted out all the worst and weediest of the cattle, besides all the old cows, and when we counted the mob out we had nearly eleven hundred first-rate store cattle; lots of fine young bullocks and heifers, more than half fat -- altogether a prime well-bred mob that no squatter or dealer could fault in any way if the price was right. We could afford to sell them for a shade under market price for cash. Ready money, of course, we were bound to have. Just as we were starting there was a fine roan bull came running up with a small mob. `Cut him out, and beat him back,&#x27; says father; `we don&#x27;t want to be bothered with the likes of him.&#x27; `Why, I&#x27;m dashed if that ain&#x27;t Hood&#x27;s imported bull,&#x27; says Billy the Boy, a Monaro native that we had with us.  `I know him well.  How&#x27;s he come to get back?  Why, the cove gave two hundred and fifty notes for him afore he left England, I&#x27;ve heard &#x27;em say.&#x27; `Bring him along,&#x27; said Starlight, who came up just then. `In for a penny, in for a pound.  They&#x27;ll never think of looking for him on the Coorong, and we&#x27;ll be there before they miss any cattle worth talking about.&#x27; So we took `Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge&#x27; along with us; a red roan he was, with a little white about the flank.  He wasn&#x27;t more than four year old. He&#x27;d been brought out from England as a yearling.  How he&#x27;d worked his way out to this back part of the run, where a bull of his quality ain&#x27;t often seen, nobody could say.  But he was a lively active beast, and he&#x27;d got into fine hard fettle with living on saltbush, dry grass, and scrub for the last few months, so he could travel as well as the others. I took particular notice of him, from his little waxy horns to his straight locks and long square quarters.  And so I&#x27;d need to -- but that came after.  He had only a little bit of a private brand on the shoulder.  That was easily faked, and would come out quite different. Chapter 12 We didn&#x27;t go straight ahead along any main track to the Lower Murray and Adelaide exactly.  That would have been a little too open and barefaced. No; we divided the mob into three, and settled where to meet in about a fortnight.  Three men to each mob.  Father and Warrigal took one lot; they had the dog, old Crib, to help them. He was worth about two men and a boy.  Starlight, Jim, and I had another; and the three stranger chaps another.  We&#x27;d had a couple of knockabouts to help with the cooking and stockyard work.  They were paid by the job. They were to stay at the camp for a week, to burn the gunyahs, knock down the yard, and blind the track as much as they could. Some of the cattle we&#x27;d left behind they drove back and forward across the track every day for a week.  If rain came they were to drop it, and make their way into the frontage by another road. If they heard about the job being blown or the police set on our track, they were to wire to one of the border townships we had to pass. Weren&#x27;t we afraid of their selling us?  No, not much; they were well paid, and had often given father and Starlight information before, though they took care never to show out in the cattle or horse-stealing way themselves. As long as chaps in our line have money to spend, they can always get good information and other things, too.  It is when the money runs short that the danger comes in.  I don&#x27;t know whether cattle-duffing was ever done in New South Wales before on such a large scale, or whether it will ever be done again.  Perhaps not.  These wire fences stop a deal of cross-work; but it was done then, you take my word for it -- a man&#x27;s word as hasn&#x27;t that long to live that it&#x27;s worth while to lie -- and it all came out right; that is as far as our getting safe over, selling the cattle, and having the money in our pockets. We kept on working by all sorts of outside tracks on the main line of road -- a good deal by night, too -- for the first two or three hundred miles. After we crossed the Adelaide border we followed the Darling down to the Murray.  We thought we were all right, and got bolder. Starlight had changed his clothes, and was dressed like a swell -- away on a roughish trip, but still like a swell. `They were his cattle; he had brought them from one of his stations on the Narran.  He was going to take up country in the Northern Territory. He expected a friend out from England with a lot more capital.&#x27; Jim and I used to hear him talking like this to some of the squatters whose runs we passed through, as grave as you please.  They used to ask him to stay all night, but he always said `he didn&#x27;t like to leave his men. He made it a practice on the road.&#x27;  When we got within a fortnight&#x27;s drive of Adelaide, he rode in and lived at one of the best hotels. He gave out that he expected a lot of cattle to arrive, and got a friend that he&#x27;d met in the billiard-room (and couldn&#x27;t he play surprisin&#x27;?) to introduce him to one of the leading stock agents there. So he had it all cut and dry, when one day Warrigal and I rode in, and the boy handed him a letter, touching his hat respectfully, as he had been learned to do, before a lot of young squatters and other swells that he was going out to a picnic with. `My confounded cattle come at last,&#x27; he says.  `Excuse me for mentioning business.  I began to hope they&#x27;d never come; &#x27;pon my soul I did.  The time passes so deuced pleasantly here. Well, they&#x27;ll all be at the yards to-morrow.  You fellows had all better come and see them sold.  There&#x27;ll be a little lunch, and perhaps some fizz.  You go to the stock agents, Runnimall and Co.; here&#x27;s their address, Jack,&#x27; he says to me, looking me straight in the eyes. `They&#x27;ll send a man to pilot you to the yards; and now off with you, and don&#x27;t let me see your face till to-morrow.&#x27; How he carried it off!  He cantered away with the rest of the party, as if he hadn&#x27;t a thought in the world except about pleasure and honest business. Nobody couldn&#x27;t have told that he wasn&#x27;t just like them other young gentlemen with only their stock and station to think about, and a little fun at the races now and then.  And what a risk he was running every minute of his life, he and all the rest of us.  I wasn&#x27;t sorry to be out of the town again.  There were lots of police, too. Suppose one of them was to say, `Richard Marston, I arrest you for ----&#x27; It hardly mattered what.  I felt as if I should have tumbled down with sheer fright and cowardliness.  It&#x27;s a queer thing you feel like that off and on.  Other times a man has as much pluck in him as if his life was worth fighting for -- which it isn&#x27;t. The agent knew all about us (or thought he did), and sent a chap to show Mr. Carisforth&#x27;s cattle (Charles Carisforth, Esq., of Sturton, Yorkshire and Banda, Waroona, and Ebor Downs, New South Wales; that was the name he went by) the way to the yards.  We were to draft them all next morning into separate pens -- cows and bullocks, steers and heifers, and so on.  He expected to sell them all to a lot of farmers and small settlers that had taken up a new district lately and were very short of stock. `You couldn&#x27;t have come into a better market, young fellow,&#x27; says the agent&#x27;s man to me.  `Our boss he&#x27;s advertised &#x27;em that well as there&#x27;ll be smart bidding between the farmers and some of the squatters. Good store cattle&#x27;s been scarce, and these is in such rattling condition. That&#x27;s what&#x27;ll sell &#x27;em.  Your master seems a regular free-handed sort of chap.  He&#x27;s the jolliest squatter there&#x27;s been in town these years, I hear folk say.  Puts &#x27;em in mind of Hawdon and Evelyn Sturt in the old overlander days.&#x27; Next day we were at the yards early, you bet.  We wanted to have time to draft them into pens of twenty to fifty each, so that the farmers and small settlers might have a chance to buy.  Besides, it was the last day of our work.  Driving all day and watching half the night is pretty stiffish work, good weather and bad, when you&#x27;ve got to keep it up for months at a time, and we&#x27;d been three months and a week on the road. The other chaps were wild for a spree.  Jim and I had made up our minds to be careful; still, we had a lot to see in a big town like Adelaide; for we&#x27;d never been to Sydney even in our lives, and we&#x27;d never seen the sea. That was something to look at for the first time, wasn&#x27;t it? Well, we got the cattle drafted to rights, every sort and size and age by itself, as near as could be.  That&#x27;s the way to draft stock, whether they&#x27;re cattle, sheep, or horses; then every man can buy what he likes best, and isn&#x27;t obliged to lump up one sort with another. We had time to have a bit of dinner.  None of us had touched a mouthful since before daylight.  Then we began to see the buyers come. There&#x27;d been a big tent rigged, as big as a small woolshed, too. It came out in a cart, and then another cart came with a couple of waiters, and they laid out a long table of boards on trestles with a real first-class feed on it, such as we&#x27;d never seen in our lives before. Fowls and turkeys and tongues and rounds of beef, beer and wine in bottles with gilt labels on.  Such a set-out it was.  Father began to growl a bit. `If he&#x27;s going to feed the whole country this way, he&#x27;ll spend half the stuff before we get it, let alone drawing a down on the whole thing.&#x27; But Jim and me could see how Starlight had been working the thing to rights while he was swelling it in the town among the big bugs. We told him the cattle would fetch that much more money on account of the lunch and the blowing the auctioneer was able to do. These would pay for the feed and the rest of the fal-lals ten times over. `When he gets in with men like his old pals he loses his head, I believe,&#x27; father says, `and fancies he&#x27;s what he used to be.  He&#x27;ll get &quot;fitted&quot; quite simple some day if he doesn&#x27;t keep a better look-out.&#x27; That might be, but it wasn&#x27;t to come about this time. Starlight came riding out by and by, dressed up like a real gentleman, and lookin&#x27; so different that Jim and I hardly dared speak to him -- on a splendid horse too (not Rainbow, he&#x27;d been left behind; he was always left within a hundred miles of The Hollow, and he could do it in one day if he was wanted to), and a lot of fine dressed chaps with him -- young squatters and officers, and what not.  I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised if he&#x27;d had the Governor out with him.  They told us afterwards he did dine at Government House reg&#x27;lar, and was made quite free and welcome there. Well, he jumps down and shakes hands with us before them all. `Well, Jack!  Well, Bill!&#x27; and so on, calls us his good faithful fellows, and how well we&#x27;d brought the cattle over; nods to father, who didn&#x27;t seem able to take it all in; says he&#x27;ll back us against any stockmen in Australia; has up Warrigal and shows him off to the company. `Most intelligent lad.&#x27;  Warrigal grinned and showed his white teeth. It was as good as a play. Then everybody goes to lunch -- swells and selectors, Germans and Paddies, natives and immigrants, a good many of them, too, and there was eating and drinking and speechifying till all was blue.  By and by the auctioneer looks at his watch.  He&#x27;d had a pretty good tuck-in himself, and they must get to business. Father opened his eyes at the price the first pen brought, all prime young bullocks, half fat most of them.  Then they all went off like wildfire; the big men and the little men bidding, quite jealous, sometimes one getting the lot, sometimes another.  One chap made a remark about there being such a lot of different brands; but Starlight said they&#x27;d come from a sort of depot station of his, and were the odds and ends of all the mobs of store cattle that he&#x27;d purchased the last four years. That satisfied &#x27;em, particularly as he said it in a careless, fierce way which he could put on, as if it was like a man&#x27;s ---- impudence to ask him anything.  It made the people laugh; I could see that. By and by we comes to the imported bull.  He was in a pen by himself, looking first-rate.  His brand had been faked, and the hair had grown pretty well.  It would have took a sharp hand to know him again. `Well, gentlemen,&#x27; says the auctioneer, `here is the imported bull &quot;Duke of Brunswick&quot;.  It ain&#x27;t often an animal of his quality comes in with a mob of store cattle; but I am informed by Mr. Carisforth that he left orders for the whole of the cattle to be cleared off the run, and this valuable animal was brought away in mistake.  He was to return by sea; but as he happens to be here to-day, why, sooner than disappoint any intending buyer, Mr. Carisforth has given me instructions to put him up, and if he realises anything near his value he will be sold.&#x27; `Yes!&#x27; drawls Starlight, as if a dozen imported bulls, more or less, made no odds to him, `put him up, by all means, Mr. Runnimall. Expectin&#x27; rather large shipment of Bates&#x27;s &quot;Duchess&quot; tribe next month. Rather prefer them on the whole.  The &quot;Duke&quot; here is full of Booth blood, so he may just as well go with the others.  I shall never get what he cost, though; I know that.  He&#x27;s been a most expensive animal to me.&#x27; Many a true word spoken in jest.  He had good call to know him, as well as the rest of us, for a most expensive animal, before all was said and done.  What he cost us all round it would be hard indeed to cipher up. Anyhow, there was a great laugh at Starlight&#x27;s easy way of taking it. First one and then another of the squatters that was going in for breeding began to bid, thinking he&#x27;d go cheap, until they got warm, and the bull went up to a price that we never dreamed he&#x27;d fetch. Everything seemed to turn out lucky that day.  One would have thought they&#x27;d never seen an imported bull before.  The young squatters got running one another, as I said before, and he went up to 270 Pounds! Then the auctioneer squared off the accounts as sharp as he could; an&#x27; it took him all his time, what with the German and the small farmers, who took their time about it, paying in greasy notes and silver and copper, out of canvas bags, and the squatters, who were too busy chaffing and talking among themselves to pay at all.  It was dark before everything was settled up, and all the lots of cattle delivered.  Starlight told the auctioneer he&#x27;d see him at his office, in a deuced high and mighty kind of way, and rode off with his new friend. All of us went back to our camp.  Our work was over, but we had to settle up among ourselves and divide shares.  I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the cattle all sold and gone, and nothing left at the camp but the horses and the swags. When we got there that night it was late enough.  After tea father and I and Jim had a long yarn, settling over what we should do and wondering whether we were going to get clean away with our share of the money after all. `By George!&#x27; says Jim, `it&#x27;s a big touch, and no mistake. To think of our getting over all right, and selling out so easy, just as if they was our own cattle.  Won&#x27;t there be a jolly row when it&#x27;s all out, and the Momberah people miss their cattle?&#x27; (more than half &#x27;em was theirs).  `And when they muster they can&#x27;t be off seein&#x27; they&#x27;re some hundreds short.&#x27; `That&#x27;s what&#x27;s botherin&#x27; me,&#x27; says father.  `I wish Starlight hadn&#x27;t been so thundering flash with it all.  It&#x27;ll draw more notice on us, and every one &#x27;ll be gassin&#x27; about this big sale, and all that, till people&#x27;s set on to ask where the cattle come from, and what not.&#x27; `I don&#x27;t see as it makes any difference,&#x27; I said.  `Somebody was bound to buy &#x27;em, and we&#x27;d have had to give the brands and receipts just the same. Only if we&#x27;d sold to any one that thought there was a cross look about it, we&#x27;d have had to take half money, that&#x27;s all.  They&#x27;ve fetched a rattling price, through Starlight&#x27;s working the oracle with those swells, and no mistake.&#x27; `Yes, but that ain&#x27;t all of it,&#x27; says the old man, filling his pipe. `We&#x27;ve got to look at what comes after.  I never liked that imported bull being took.  They&#x27;ll rake all the colonies to get hold of him again, partic&#x27;ler as he sold for near three hundred pound.&#x27; `We must take our share of the risk along with the money,&#x27; said Jim. `We shall have our whack of that according to what they fetched to-day. It&#x27;ll be a short life and a merry one, though, dad, if we go on big licks like this.  What&#x27;ll we tackle next -- a bank or Government House?&#x27; `Nothing at all for a good spell, if you&#x27;ve any sense,&#x27; growled father. `It&#x27;ll give us all we know to keep dark when this thing gets into the papers, and the police in three colonies are all in full cry like a pack of beagles. The thing is, what&#x27;ll be our best dart now?&#x27; `I&#x27;ll go back overland,&#x27; says he.  `Starlight&#x27;s going to take Warrigal with him, and they&#x27;ll be off to the islands for a turn. If he knows what&#x27;s best for him, he&#x27;ll never come back. These other chaps say they&#x27;ll separate and sell their horses when they get over to the Murray low down, and work their way up by degrees. Which way are you boys going?&#x27; `Jim and I to Melbourne by next steamer,&#x27; I said.  `May as well see a bit of life now we&#x27;re in it.  We&#x27;ll come back overland when we&#x27;re tired of strange faces.&#x27; `All right,&#x27; says father, `they won&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m lyin&#x27; by for a bit, I&#x27;ll go bail, and the sooner you clear out of Adelaide the better. News like ours don&#x27;t take long to travel, and you might be nabbed very simple. One of ye write a line to your mother and tell her where you&#x27;re off to, or she&#x27;ll be frettin&#x27; herself and the gal too -- frettin&#x27; over what can&#x27;t be helped.  But I suppose it&#x27;s the natur&#x27; o&#x27; some women.&#x27; We done our settling-up next day.  All the sale money was paid over to Starlight.  He cashed the cheques and drew the lot in notes and gold -- such a bundle of &#x27;em there was.  He brought them out to us at the camp, and then we `whacked&#x27; the lot.  There were eight of us that had to share and share alike.  How much do you think we had to divide? Why, not a penny under four thousand pounds.  It had to be divided among the eight of us.  That came to five hundred a man.  A lot of money to carry about, that was the worst of it. Next day there was a regular split and squander.  We didn&#x27;t wait long after daylight, you bet.  Father was off and well on his way before the stars were out of the sky.  He took Warrigal&#x27;s horse, Bilbah, back with him; he and Starlight was going off to the islands together, and couldn&#x27;t take horses with them.  But he was real sorry to part with the cross-grained varmint; I thought he was going to blubber when he saw father leading him off.  Bilbah wouldn&#x27;t go neither at first; pulled back, and snorted and went on as if he&#x27;d never seen only one man afore in his life.  Father got vexed at last and makes a sign to old Crib; he fetches him such a `heeler&#x27; as gave him something else to think of for a few miles.  He didn&#x27;t hang back much after that. The three other chaps went their own road.  They kept very dark all through. I know their names well enough, but there&#x27;s no use in bringing them up now. Jim and I cuts off into the town, thinking we was due for a little fun. We&#x27;d never been in a big town before, and it was something new to us. Adelaide ain&#x27;t as grand quite as Melbourne or Sydney, but there&#x27;s something quiet and homelike about it to my thinking -- great wide streets, planted with trees; lots of steady-going German farmers, with their vineyards and orchards and droll little waggons.  The women work as hard as the men, harder perhaps, and get brown and scorched up in no time -- not that they&#x27;ve got much good looks to lose; leastways none we ever saw. We could always tell the German farmers&#x27; places along the road from one of our people by looking outside the door.  If it was an Englishman or an Australian, you&#x27;d see where they&#x27;d throwed out the teapot leavings; if it was a German, you wouldn&#x27;t see nothing. They drink their own sour wine, if their vines are old enough to make any, or else hop beer; but they won&#x27;t lay out their money in the tea chest or sugar bag; no fear, or the grog either, and not far wrong.  Then the sea!  I can see poor old Jim&#x27;s face now the day we went down to the port and he seen it for the first time. `So we&#x27;ve got to the big waterhole at last,&#x27; he said.  `Don&#x27;t it make a man feel queer and small to think of its going away right from here where we stand to the other side of the world?  It&#x27;s a long way across.&#x27; `Jim,&#x27; says I, `and to think we&#x27;ve lived all our lives up to this time and never set eyes on it before.  Don&#x27;t it seem as if one was shut up in the bush, or tied to a gum tree, so as one can never have a chance to see anything?  I wonder we stayed in it so long.&#x27; `It&#x27;s not a bad place, though it is rather slow and wired in sometimes,&#x27; says Jim.  `We might be sorry we ever left it yet.  When does the steamer go to Melbourne?&#x27; `The day after to-morrow.&#x27; `I&#x27;ll be glad to be clear off; won&#x27;t you?&#x27; We went to the theatre that night, and amused ourselves pretty well next day and till the time came for our boat to start for Melbourne. We had altered ourselves a bit, had our hair cut and our beards trimmed by the hairdresser.  We bought fresh clothes, and what with this, and the feeling of being in a new place and having more money in our pockets than we&#x27;d ever dreamed about before, we looked so transmogrified when we saw ourselves in the glass that we hardly knew ourselves. We had to change our names, too, for the first time in our lives; and it went harder against the grain than you&#x27;d think, for all we were a couple of cattle-duffers, with a warrant apiece sure to be after us before the year was out. `It sounds ugly,&#x27; says Jim, after we had given our names as John Simmons and Henry Smith at the hotel where we put up at till the steamer was ready to start.  `I never thought that Jim Marston was to come to this -- to be afraid to tell a fat, greasy-looking fellow like that innkeeper what his real name was.  Seems such a pitiful mean lie, don&#x27;t it, Dick?&#x27; `It isn&#x27;t so bad as being called No. 14, No. 221, as they sing out for the fellows in Berrima Gaol.  How would you like that, Jim?&#x27; `I&#x27;d blow my brains out first,&#x27; cried out Jim, `or let some other fellow do it for me.  It wouldn&#x27;t matter which.&#x27; It was very pleasant, those two or three days in Adelaide, if they&#x27;d only lasted.  We used to stroll about the lighted streets till all hours, watching the people and the shops and everything that makes a large city different from the country.  The different sorts of people, the carts and carriages, buggies and drays, pony-carriages and spring-carts, all jumbled up together; even the fruit and flowers and oysters and fish under the gas-lights seemed strange and wonderful to us.  We felt as if we would have given all the world to have got mother and Aileen down to see it all.  Then Jim gave a groan. `Only to think,&#x27; says he, `that we might have had all this fun some day, and bought and paid for it honest.  Now it isn&#x27;t paid for. It&#x27;s out of some other man&#x27;s pocket.  There&#x27;s a curse on it; it will have to be paid in blood or prison time before all&#x27;s done. I could shoot myself for being such a cursed fool.&#x27; `Too late to think of that,&#x27; I said; `we&#x27;ll have some fun in Melbourne for a bit, anyhow.  For what comes after we must &quot;chance it&quot;, as we&#x27;ve done before, more than once or twice, either.&#x27; .    .    .    .    . Next day our steamer was to sail.  We got Starlight to come down with us and show us how to take our passage.  We&#x27;d never done it before, and felt awkward at it.  He&#x27;d made up his mind to go to New Zealand, and after that to Honolulu, perhaps to America. `I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll ever come back, boys,&#x27; he said, `and if I were you I don&#x27;t think I would either.  If you get over to San Francisco you&#x27;d find the Pacific Slope a very pleasant country to live in. The people and the place would suit you all to pieces.  At any rate I&#x27;d stay away for a few years and wait till all this blows over.&#x27; I wasn&#x27;t sorry when the steamer cleared the port, and got out of sight of land.  There we were -- where we&#x27;d never been before -- in blue water. There was a stiff breeze, and in half-an-hour we shouldn&#x27;t have turned our heads if we&#x27;d seen Hood and the rest of &#x27;em come riding after us on seahorses, with warrants as big as the mainsail.  Jim made sure he was going to die straight off, and the pair of us wished we&#x27;d never seen Outer Back Momberah, nor Hood&#x27;s cattle, nor Starlight, nor Warrigal. We almost made up our minds to keep straight and square to the last day of our lives.  However, the wind died down a bit next day, and we both felt a lot better -- better in body and worse in mind -- as often happens.  Before we got to Melbourne we could eat and drink, smoke and gamble, and were quite ourselves again.  We&#x27;d laid it out to have a reg&#x27;lar good month of it in town, takin&#x27; it easy, and stopping nice and quiet at a good hotel, havin&#x27; some reasonable pleasure. Why shouldn&#x27;t we see a little life?  We&#x27;d got the cash, and we&#x27;d earned that pretty hard.  It&#x27;s the hardest earned money of all, that&#x27;s got on the cross, if fellows only knew, but they never do till it&#x27;s too late. When we got tired of doing nothing, and being in a strange place, we&#x27;d get across the border, above Albury somewhere, and work on the mountain runs till shearing came round again; and we could earn a fairish bit of money. Then we&#x27;d go home for Christmas after it was all over, and see mother and Aileen again.  How glad and frightened they&#x27;d be to see us. It wouldn&#x27;t be safe altogether, but go we would. Chapter 13 We got to Melbourne all right, and though it&#x27;s a different sort of a place from Sydney, it&#x27;s a jolly enough town for a couple of young chaps with money in their pockets.  Most towns are, for the matter of that. We took it easy, and didn&#x27;t go on the spree or do anything foolish. No, we weren&#x27;t altogether so green as that.  We looked out for a quiet place to lodge, near the sea -- St. Kilda they call it, in front of the beach -- and we went about and saw all the sights, and for a time managed to keep down the thought that perhaps sooner or later we&#x27;d be caught, and have to stand our trial for this last affair of ours, and maybe one or two others.  It wasn&#x27;t a nice thing to think of; and now and then it used to make both of us take an extra drop of grog by way of driving the thoughts of it out of our heads.  That&#x27;s the worst of not being straight and square.  A man&#x27;s almost driven to drink when he can&#x27;t keep from thinking of all sorts of miserable things day and night.  We used to go to the horse-yards now and then, and the cattle-yards too.  It was like old times to see the fat cattle and sheep penned up at Flemington, and the butchers riding out on their spicy nags or driving trotters.  But their cattle-yards was twice as good as ours, and me and Jim used often to wonder why the Sydney people hadn&#x27;t managed to have something like them all these years, instead of the miserable cockatoo things at Homebush that we&#x27;d often heard the drovers and squatters grumble about. However, one day, as we was sitting on the rails, talking away quite comfortable, we heard one butcher say to another, `My word, this is a smart bit of cattle-duffing -- a thousand head too!&#x27;  `What&#x27;s that?&#x27; says the other man.  `Why, haven&#x27;t you heard of it?&#x27; says the first one, and he pulls a paper out of his pocket, with this in big letters: `Great Cattle Robbery. --  A thousand head of Mr. Hood&#x27;s cattle were driven off and sold in Adelaide.  Warrants are out for the suspected parties, who are supposed to have left the colony.&#x27;  Here was a bit of news! We felt as if we could hardly help falling off the rails; but we didn&#x27;t show it, of course, and sat there for half-an-hour, talking to the buyers and sellers and cracking jokes like the others. But we got away home as soon as we could, and then we began to settle what we should do. Warrants were out, of course, for Starlight, and us too.  He was known, and so were we.  Our descriptions were sure to be ready to send out all over the country.  Warrigal they mightn&#x27;t have noticed. It was common enough to have a black boy or a half-caste with a lot of travelling cattle.  Father had not shown up much. He had an old pea-jacket on, and they mightn&#x27;t have dropped down to him or the three other chaps that were in it with us; they were just like any other road hands.  But about there being warrants out, with descriptions, in all the colonies, for a man to be identified, but generally known as Starlight, and for Richard and James Marston, we were as certain as that we were in St. Kilda, in a nice quiet little inn, overlooking the beach; and what a murder it was to have to leave it at all. Leave the place we had to do at once.  It wouldn&#x27;t do to be strollin&#x27; about Melbourne with the chance of every policeman we met taking a look at us to see if we tallied with a full description they had at the office:  `Richard and James Marston are twenty-five and twenty-two, respectively; both tall and strongly built; having the appearance of bushmen. Richard Marston has a scar on left temple.  James Marston has lost a front tooth,&#x27; and so on.  When we came to think of it, they couldn&#x27;t be off knowing us, if they took it into their heads to bail us up any day.  They had our height and make.  We couldn&#x27;t help looking like bushmen -- like men that had been in the open air all their lives, and that had a look as if saddle and bridle rein were more in our way than the spade and plough-handle. We couldn&#x27;t wash the tan off our skins; faces, necks, arms, all showed pretty well that we&#x27;d come from where the sun was hot, and that we&#x27;d had our share of it.  They had my scar, got in a row, and Jim&#x27;s front tooth, knocked out by a fall from a horse when he was a boy; there was nothing for it but to cut and run. `It was time for us to go, my boys,&#x27; as the song the Yankee sailor sung us one night runs, and then, which way to go?  Every ship was watched that close a strange rat couldn&#x27;t get a passage, and, besides, we had that feeling we didn&#x27;t like to clear away altogether out of the old country; there was mother and Aileen still in it, and every man, woman, and child that we&#x27;d known ever since we were born. A chap feels that, even if he ain&#x27;t much good other ways. We couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of clearin&#x27; out for America, as Starlight advised us.  It was like death to us, so we thought we&#x27;d chance it somewhere in Australia for a bit longer. Now where we put up a good many drovers from Gippsland used to stay, as they brought in cattle from there.  The cattle had to be brought over Swanston Street Bridge and right through the town after twelve o&#x27;clock at night.  We&#x27;d once or twice, when we&#x27;d been out late, stopped to look at them, and watched the big heavy bullocks and fat cows staring and starting and slipping all among the lamps and pavements, with the street all so strange and quiet, and laughed at the notion of some of the shopkeepers waking up and seeing a couple of hundred wild cattle, with three or four men behind &#x27;em, shouldering and horning one another, then rushing past their doors at a hard trot, or breaking into a gallop for a bit. Some of these chaps, seeing we was cattle-men and knew most things in that line, used to open out about where they&#x27;d come from, and what a grand place Gippsland was -- splendid grass country, rivers that run all the year round, great fattening country; and snowy mountains at the back, keeping everything cool in the summer. Some of the mountain country, like Omeo, that they talked a lot of, seemed about one of the most out-of-the-way places in the world. More than that, you could get back to old New South Wales by way of the Snowy River, and then on to Monaro.  After that we knew where we were. Going away was easy enough, in a manner of speaking; but we&#x27;d been a month in Melbourne, and when you mind that we were not bad-looking chaps, fairishly dressed, and with our pockets full of money, it was only what might be looked for if we had made another friend or two besides Mrs. Morrison, the landlady of our inn, and Gippsland drovers. When we had time to turn round a bit in Melbourne of course we began to make a few friends.  Wherever a man goes, unless he keeps himself that close that he won&#x27;t talk to any one or let any one talk to him, he&#x27;s sure to find some one he likes to be with better than another. If he&#x27;s old and done with most of his fancies, except smokin&#x27; and drinkin&#x27; it&#x27;s a man.  If he&#x27;s young and got his life before him it&#x27;s a woman. So Jim and I hadn&#x27;t been a week in Melbourne before we fell across a couple of -- well, friends -- that we were hard set to leave. It was a way of mine to walk down to the beach every evening and have a look at the boats in the bay and the fishermen, if there were any -- anything that might be going on.  Sometimes a big steamer would be coming in, churning the water under her paddles and tearing up the bay like a hundred bunyips.  The first screw-boat Jim and I saw we couldn&#x27;t make out for the life of us what she moved by. We thought all steamers had paddles.  Then the sailing boats, flying before the breeze like seagulls, and the waves, if it was a rough day, rolling and beating and thundering on the beach. I generally stayed till the stars came out before I went back to the hotel. Everything was so strange and new to a man who&#x27;d seen so little else except green trees that I was never tired of watching, and wondering, and thinking what a little bit of a shabby world chaps like us lived in that never seen anything but a slab hut, maybe, all the year round, and a bush public on high days and holidays. Sometimes I used to feel as if we hadn&#x27;t done such a bad stroke in cutting loose from all this.  But then the horrible feeling would come back of never being safe, even for a day, of being dragged off and put in the dock, and maybe shut up for years and years.  Sometimes I used to throw myself down upon the sand and curse the day when I ever did anything that I had any call to be ashamed of and put myself in the power of everything bad and evil in all my life through. Well, one day I was strolling along, thinking about these things, and wondering whether there was any other country where a man could go and feel himself safe from being hounded down for the rest of his life, when I saw a woman walking on the beach ahead of me.  I came up with her before long, and as I passed her she turned her head and I saw she was one of two girls that we had seen in the landlady&#x27;s parlour one afternoon.  The landlady was a good, decent Scotch woman, and had taken a fancy to both of us (particularly to Jim -- as usual). She thought -- she was that simple -- that we were up-country squatters from some far-back place, or overseers.  Something in the sheep or cattle line everybody could see that we were.  There was no hiding that. But we didn&#x27;t talk about ourselves overmuch, for very good reasons. The less people say the more others will wonder and guess about you. So we began to be looked upon as bosses of some sort, and to be treated with a lot of respect that we hadn&#x27;t been used to much before. So we began to talk a bit -- natural enough -- this girl and I. She was a good-looking girl, with a wonderful fresh clear skin, full of life and spirits, and pretty well taught.  She and her sister had not been a long time in the country; their father was dead, and they had to live by keeping a very small shop and by dressmaking. They were some kind of cousins of the landlady and the same name, so they used to come and see her of evenings and Sundays. Her name was Kate Morrison and her sister&#x27;s was Jeanie.  This and a lot more she told me before we got back to the hotel, where she said she was going to stay that night and keep Mrs. Morrison company. After this we began to be a deal better acquainted.  It all came easy enough. The landlady thought she was doing the girls a good turn by putting them in the way of a couple of hard-working well-to-do fellows like us; and as Jim and the younger one, Jeanie, seemed to take a fancy to each other, Mrs. Morrison used to make up boating parties, and we soon got to know each other well enough to be joked about falling in love and all the rest of it. After a bit we got quite into the way of calling for Kate and Jeanie after their day&#x27;s work was done, and taking them out for a walk. I don&#x27;t know that I cared so much for Kate in those days anyhow, but by degrees we got to think that we were what people call in love with each other.  It went deeper with her than me, I think. It mostly does with women.  I never really cared for any woman in the world except Gracey Storefield, but she was far away, and I didn&#x27;t see much likelihood of my being able to live in that part of the world, much less to settle down and marry there.  So, though we&#x27;d broken a six-pence together and I had my half, I looked upon her as ever so much beyond me and out of my reach, and didn&#x27;t see any harm in amusing myself with any woman that I might happen to fall across. So, partly from idleness, partly from liking, and partly seeing that the girl had made up her mind to throw in her lot with me for good and all, I just took it as it came; but it meant a deal more than that, if I could have foreseen the end. I hadn&#x27;t seen a great many women, and had made up my mind that, except a few bad ones, they was mostly of one sort -- good to lead, not hard to drive, and, above all, easy to see through and understand. I often wonder what there was about this Kate Morrison to make her so different from other women; but she was born unlike them, I expect. Anyway, I never met another woman like her.  She wasn&#x27;t out-and-out handsome, but there was something very taking about her.  Her figure was pretty near as good as a woman&#x27;s could be; her step was light and active; her feet and hands were small, and she took a pride in showing them. I never thought she had any temper different from other women; but if I&#x27;d noticed her eyes, surely I&#x27;d have seen it there. There was something very strange and out of the way about them. They hardly seemed so bright when you looked at them first; but by degrees, if she got roused and set up about anything, they&#x27;d begin to burn with a steady sort of glitter that got fiercer and brighter till you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d burn everything they looked at. The light in them didn&#x27;t go out again in a hurry, either. It seemed as if those wonderful eyes would keep on shining, whether their owner wished it or not. I didn&#x27;t find out all about her nature at once -- trust a woman for that. Vain and fond of pleasure I could see she was; and from having been always poor, in a worrying, miserable, ill-contented way, she had got to be hungry for money and jewels and fine clothes; just like a person that&#x27;s been starved and shivering with cold longs for a fire and a full meal and a warm bed.  Some people like these things when they can get them; but others never seem to think about anything else, and would sell their souls or do anything in the whole world to get what their hearts are set on. When men are like this they&#x27;re dangerous, but they hardly hurt anybody, only themselves.  When women are born with hearts of this sort it&#x27;s a bad look-out for everybody they come near.  Kate Morrison could see that I had money.  She thought I was rich, and she made up her mind to attract me, and go shares in my property, whatever it might be. She won over her younger sister, Jeanie, to her plans, and our acquaintance was part of a regular put-up scheme.  Jeanie was a soft, good-tempered, good-hearted girl, with beautiful fair hair, blue eyes, and the prettiest mouth in the world.  She was as good as she was pretty, and would have worked away without grumbling in that dismal little shop from that day to this, if she&#x27;d been let alone.  She was only just turned seventeen.  She soon got to like Jim a deal too well for her own good, and used to listen to his talk about the country across the border, and such simple yarns as he could tell her, poor old Jim! until she said she&#x27;d go and live with him under a salt-bush if he&#x27;d come back and marry her after Christmas.  And of course he did promise.  He didn&#x27;t see any harm in that.  He intended to come back if he could, and so did I for that matter.  Well, the long and short of it was that we were both regularly engaged and had made all kinds of plans to be married at Christmas and go over to Tasmania or New Zealand, when this terrible blow fell upon us like a shell.  I did see one explode at a review in Melbourne -- and, my word! what a scatteration it made. Well, we had to let Kate and Jeanie know the best way we could that our business required us to leave Melbourne at once, and that we shouldn&#x27;t be back till after Christmas, if then. It was terrible hard work to make out any kind of a story that would do. Kate questioned and cross-questioned me about the particular kind of business that called us away like a lawyer (I&#x27;ve seen plenty of that since) until at last I was obliged to get a bit cross and refuse to answer any more questions. Jeanie took it easier, and was that down-hearted and miserable at parting with Jim that she hadn&#x27;t the heart to ask any questions of any one, and Jim looked about as dismal as she did.  They sat with their hands in each other&#x27;s till it was nearly twelve o&#x27;clock, when the old mother came and carried the girls off to bed.  We had to start at daylight next morning; but we made up our minds to leave them a hundred pounds apiece to keep for us until we came back, and promised if we were alive to be at St. Kilda next January, which they had to be contented with. Jeanie did not want to take the money; but Jim said he&#x27;d very likely lose it, and so persuaded her. We were miserable and low-spirited enough ourselves at the idea of going away all in a hurry.  We had come to like Melbourne, and had bit by bit cheated ourselves into thinking that we might live comfortably and settle down in Victoria, out of reach of our enemies, and perhaps live and die unsuspected. From this dream we were roused up by the confounded advertisement. Detectives and constables would be seen to be pretty thick in all the colonies, and we could not reasonably expect not to be taken some time or other, most likely before another week. We thought it over and over again, in every way.  The more we thought over it the more dangerous it seemed to stop in Melbourne.  There was only one thing for it, that was to go straight out of the country.  The Gippsland men were the only bushmen we knew at all well, and perhaps that door might shut soon. So we paid our bill.  They thought us a pair of quiet, respectable chaps at that hotel, and never would believe otherwise.  People may say what they like, but it&#x27;s a great thing to have some friends that can say of you -- `Well, I never knew no harm of him; a better tempered chap couldn&#x27;t be; and all the time we knowed him he was that particular about his bills and money matters that a banker couldn&#x27;t have been more regular. He may have had his faults, but we never seen &#x27;em.  I believe a deal that was said of him wasn&#x27;t true, and nothing won&#x27;t ever make me believe it.&#x27; These kind of people will stand up for you all the days of your life, and stick to you till the very last moment, no matter what you turn out to be. Well, there&#x27;s something pleasant in it; and it makes you think human nature ain&#x27;t quite such a low and paltry thing as some people tries to make out. Anyhow, when we went away our good little landlady and her sister was that sorry to lose us, as you&#x27;d have thought they was our blood relations. As for Jim, every one in the house was fit to cry when he went off, from the dogs and cats upwards.  Jim never was in no house where everybody didn&#x27;t seem to take naturally to him.  Poor old Jim! We bought a couple of horses, and rode away down to Sale with these chaps that had sold their cattle in Melbourne and was going home. It rained all the way, and it was the worst road by chalks we&#x27;d ever seen in our lives; but the soil was wonderful, and the grass was something to talk about; we&#x27;d hardly ever seen anything like it.  A few thousand acres there would keep more stock than half the country we&#x27;d been used to. We didn&#x27;t stay more than a day or so in Sale.  Every morning at breakfast some one was sure to turn up the paper and begin jabbering about the same old infernal business, Hood&#x27;s cattle, and what a lot were taken, and whether they&#x27;ll catch Starlight and the other men, and so on. We heard of a job at Omeo while we were in Sale, which we thought would just about suit us.  All the cattle on a run there were to be mustered and delivered to a firm of stock agents that had bought them; they wanted people to do it by contract at so much a head. Anybody who took it must have money enough to buy stock horses. The price per head was pretty fair, what would pay well, and we made up our minds to go in for it. So we made a bargain; bought two more horses each, and started away for Omeo. It was near 200 miles from where we were.  We got up there all right, and found a great rich country with a big lake, I don&#x27;t know how many feet above the sea.  The cattle were as wild as hares, but the country was pretty good to ride over.  We were able to keep our horses in good condition in the paddocks, and when we had mustered the whole lot we found we had a handsome cheque to get. It was a little bit strange buckling to after the easy life we&#x27;d led for the last few months; but after a day or two we found ourselves as good men as ever, and could spin over the limestone boulders and through the thick mountain timber as well as ever we did. A man soon gets right again in the fresh air of the bush; and as it used to snow there every now and then the air was pretty fresh, you bet, particularly in the mornings and evenings. After we&#x27;d settled up we made up our minds to get as far as Monaro, and wait there for a month or two.  After that we might go in for the shearing till Christmas, and then whatever happened we would both make a strike back for home, and have one happy week, at any rate, with mother and Aileen. We tried as well as we could to keep away from the large towns and the regular mail coach road.  We worked on runs where the snow came down every now and then in such a way as to make us think that we might be snowed up alive some fine morning.  It was very slow and tedious work, but the newspapers seldom came there, and we were not worried day after day with telegrams about our Adelaide stroke, and descriptions of Starlight&#x27;s own look and way of speaking. We got into the old way of working hard all day and sleeping well at night. We could eat and drink well; the corned beef and the damper were good, and Jim, like when we were at the back of Boree when Warrigal came, wished that we could stick to this kind of thing always, and never have any fret or crooked dealings again as long as we lived. But it couldn&#x27;t be done.  We had to leave and go shearing when the spring came on.  We did go, and went from one big station to the other when the spring was regularly on and shearers were scarce. By and by the weather gets warmer, and we had cut our last shed before the first week in December. Then we couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer. `I don&#x27;t care,&#x27; says Jim, `if there&#x27;s a policeman standing at every corner of the street, I must make a start for home. They may catch us, but our chance is a pretty good one; and I&#x27;d just as soon be lagged outright as have to hide and keep dark and moulder away life in some of these God-forsaken spots.&#x27; So we made up to start for home and chance it.  We worked our way by degrees up the Snowy River, by Buchan and Galantapee, and gradually made towards Balooka and Buckley&#x27;s Crossing.  On the way we crossed some of the roughest country we had ever seen or ridden over. `My word, Dick,&#x27; said Jim one day, as we were walking along and leading our horses, `we could find a place here if we were hard pushed near as good for hiding in as the Hollow.  Look at that bit of tableland that runs up towards Black Mountain, any man that could find a track up to it might live there for a year and all the police of the country be after him.&#x27; `What would he get to eat if he was there?&#x27; `That long chap we stayed with at Wargulmerang told us that there were wild cattle on all those tablelands. Often they get snowed up in winter and die, making a circle in the snow. Then fish in all the creeks, besides the old Snowy, and there are places on the south side of him that people didn&#x27;t see once in five years. I believe I shall make a camp for myself on the way, and live in it till they&#x27;ve forgot all about these cursed cattle.  Rot their hides, I wish we&#x27;d never have set eyes on one of them.&#x27; `So do I; but like many things in the world it&#x27;s too late -- too late, Jim!&#x27; Chapter 14 One blazing hot day in the Christmas week Jim and I rode up the `gap&#x27; that led from the Southern road towards Rocky Creek and the little flat near the water where our hut stood.  The horses were tired, for we&#x27;d ridden a long way, and not very slow either, to get to the old place.  How small and queer the old homestead looked, and everything about it after all we had seen. The trees in the garden were in full leaf, and we could see that it was not let go to waste.  Mother was sitting in the verandah sewing, pretty near the same as we went away, and a girl was walking slowly up from the creek carrying a bucket of water.  It was Aileen. We knew her at once.  She was always as straight as a rush, and held her head high, as she used to do; but she walked very slow, and looked as if she was dull and weary of everything. All of a sudden Jim jumped off, dropped his horse&#x27;s bridle on the ground, and started to run towards her.  She didn&#x27;t see him till he was pretty close; then she looked up astonished-like, and put her bucket down. She gave a sudden cry and rushed over to him; the next minute she was in his arms, sobbing as if her heart would break. I came along quiet.  I knew she&#x27;d be glad to see me -- but, bless you, she and mother cared more for Jim&#x27;s little finger than for my whole body.  Some people have a way of gettin&#x27; the biggest share of nearly everybody&#x27;s liking that comes next or anigh &#x27;em. I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s done, or what works it.  But so it is; and Jim could always count on every man, woman, and child, wherever he lived, wearing his colours and backing him right out, through thick and thin. When I came up Aileen was saying -- `Oh, Jim, my dear old Jim! now I&#x27;ll die happy; mother and I were only talking of you to-day, and wondering whether we should see you at Christmas -- and now you have come.  Oh, Dick! and you too.  But we shall be frightened every time we hear a horse&#x27;s tread or dog&#x27;s bark.&#x27; `Well, we&#x27;re here now, Aileen, and that&#x27;s something. I had a great notion of clearing out for San Francisco and turning Yankee. What would you have done then?&#x27; We walked up to the house, leading our horses, Jim and Aileen hand in hand. Mother looked up and gave a scream; she nearly fell down; when we got in her face was as white as a sheet. `Mother of Mercy!  I vowed to you for this,&#x27; she said; `sure she hears our prayers.  I wanted to see ye both before I died, and I didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d come.  I was afraid ye&#x27;d be dreadin&#x27; the police, and maybe stay away for good and all.  The Lord be thanked for all His mercies!&#x27; We went in and enjoyed our tea.  We had had nothing to eat that day since breakfast; but better than all was Aileen&#x27;s pleasant, clever tongue, though she said it was getting stiff for want of exercise.  She wanted to know all about our travels, and was never tired of listening to Jim&#x27;s stories of the wonders we had seen in the great cities and the strange places we had been to. `Oh! how happy you must have been!&#x27; she would say, `while we have been pining and wearying here, all through last spring and summer, and then winter again -- cold and miserable it was last year; and now Christmas has come again.  Don&#x27;t go away again for a good while, or mother and I&#x27;ll die straight out.&#x27; Well, what could we say?  Tell her we&#x27;d never go away at all if we could help it -- only she must be a good girl and make the best of things, for mother&#x27;s sake?  When had she seen father last? `Oh! he was away a good while once; that time you and Jim were at Mr. Falkland&#x27;s back country.  You must have had a long job then; no wonder you&#x27;ve got such good clothes and look so smartened up like. He comes every now and then, just like he used.  We never know what&#x27;s become of him.&#x27; `When was he here last?&#x27; `Oh! about a month ago.  He said he might be here about Christmas; but he wasn&#x27;t sure.  And so you saved Miss Falkland from being killed off her horse, Jim?  Tell me all about it, like a good boy, and what sort of a looking young lady is she?&#x27; `All right,&#x27; said Jim.  `I&#x27;ll unload the story bag before we get through; there&#x27;s a lot in there yet; but I want to look at you and hear you talk just now.  How&#x27;s George Storefield?&#x27; `Oh! he&#x27;s just the same good, kind, steady-going fellow he always was,&#x27; says she.  `I don&#x27;t know what we should do without him when you&#x27;re away. He comes and helps with the cows now and then.  Two of the horses got into Bargo pound, and he went and released them for us. Then a storm blew off best part of the roof of the barn, and the bit of wheat would have been spoiled only for him. He&#x27;s the best friend we have.&#x27; `You&#x27;d better make sure of him for good and all,&#x27; I said. `I suppose he&#x27;s pretty well-to-do now with that new farm he bought the other day.&#x27; `Oh! you saw that,&#x27; she said.  `Yes; he bought out the Cumberers. They never did any good with Honeysuckle Flat, though the land was so good. He&#x27;s going to lay it all down in lucerne, he says.&#x27; `And then he&#x27;ll smarten up the cottage, and sister Aileen &#x27;ll go over, and live in it,&#x27; says Jim; `and a better thing she couldn&#x27;t do.&#x27; `I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; she said.  `Poor George, I wish I was fonder of him. There never was a better man, I believe; but I cannot leave mother yet, so it&#x27;s no use talking.&#x27;  Then she got up and went in. `That&#x27;s the way of the world,&#x27; says Jim.  `George worships the ground she treads on, and she can&#x27;t make herself care two straws about him. Perhaps she will in time.  She&#x27;ll have the best home and the best chap in the whole district if she does.&#x27; `There&#x27;s a deal of &quot;if&quot; in this world,&#x27; I said; `and &quot;if&quot; we&#x27;re &quot;copped&quot; on account of that last job, I&#x27;d like to think she and mother had some one to look after them, good weather and bad.&#x27; `We might have done that, and not killed ourselves with work either,&#x27; said Jim, rather sulkily for him; and he lit his pipe and walked off into the bush without saying another word. I thought, too, how we might have been ten times, twenty times, as happy if we&#x27;d only kept on steady ding-dong work, like George Storefield, having patience and seeing ourselves get better off -- even a little -- year by year.  What had he come to?  And what lay before us? And though we were that fond of poor mother and Aileen that we would have done anything in the world for them -- that is, we would have given our lives for them any day -- yet we had left them -- father, Jim, and I -- to lead this miserable, lonesome life, looked down upon by a lot of people not half good enough to tie their shoes, and obliged to a neighbour for help in every little distress. Jim and I thought we&#x27;d chance a few days at home, no matter what risk we ran; but still we knew that if warrants were out the old home would be well watched, and that it was the first place the police would come to. So we made up our minds not to sleep at home, but to go away every night to an old deserted shepherd&#x27;s hut, a couple of miles up the gully, that we used to play in when we were boys.  It had been strongly built at first; time was not much matter then, and there were no wages to speak of, so that it was a good shelter.  The weather was that hot, too, it was just as pleasant sleeping under a tree as anywhere else. So we didn&#x27;t show at home more than one at a time, and took care to be ready for a bolt at any time, day or night, when the police might show themselves.  Our place was middling clear all round now, and it was hard for any one on horseback to get near it without warning; and if we could once reach the gully we knew we could run faster than any man could ride. One night, latish, just as we were walking off to our hut there was a scratching at the door; when we opened it there was old Crib! He ran up to both of us and smelt round our legs for a minute to satisfy himself; then jumped up once to each of us as if he thought he ought to do the civil thing, wagged his stump of a tail, and laid himself down.  He was tired, and had come a long way. We could see that, and that he was footsore too.  We knew that father wasn&#x27;t so very far off, and would soon be in.  If there&#x27;d been anybody strange there Crib would have run back fast enough; then father&#x27;d have dropped there was something up and not shown. No fear of the dog not knowing who was right and who wasn&#x27;t. He could tell every sort of a man a mile off, I believe. He knew the very walk of the police troopers&#x27; horses, and would growl, father said, if he heard their hoofs rattle on the stones of the road. About a quarter of an hour after father walks in, quiet as usual. Nothing never made no difference to him, except he thought it was worth while. He was middlin&#x27; glad to see us, and behaved kind enough to mother, so the poor soul looked quite happy for her.  It was little enough of that she had for her share.  By and by father walks outside with us, and we had a long private talk. It was a brightish kind of starlight night.  As we walked down to the creek I thought how often Jim and I had come out on just such a night &#x27;possum hunting, and came home so tired that we were hardly able to pull our boots off.  Then we had nothing to think about when we woke in the morning but to get in the cows; and didn&#x27;t we enjoy the fresh butter and the damper and bacon and eggs at breakfast time! It seems to me the older people get the more miserable they get in this world. If they don&#x27;t make misery for themselves other people do it for &#x27;em; or just when everything&#x27;s going straight, and they&#x27;re doing their duty first-rate and all that, some accident happens &#x27;em just as if they was the worst people in the world.  I can&#x27;t make it out at all. `Well, boys,&#x27; says dad, `you&#x27;ve been lucky so far; suppose you had a pretty good spree in Melbourne?  You seen the game was up by the papers, didn&#x27;t you?  But why didn&#x27;t you stay where you were?&#x27; `Why, of course, that brought us away,&#x27; says Jim; `we didn&#x27;t want to be fetched back in irons, and thought there was more show for it in the bush here.&#x27; `But even if they&#x27;d grabbed Starlight,&#x27; says the old man, `you&#x27;d no call to be afeard.  Not much chance of his peaching, if it had been a hanging matter.&#x27; `You don&#x27;t mean to say there ain&#x27;t warrants against us and the rest of the lot?&#x27; I said. `There&#x27;s never a warrant out agin any one but Starlight,&#x27; said the old man. `I&#x27;ve had the papers read to me regular, and I rode over to Bargo and saw the reward of 200 Pounds (a chap alongside of me read it) as is offered for a man generally known as Starlight, supposed to have left the country; but not a word about you two and me, or the boy, or them other coves.&#x27; `So we might as well have stayed where we were, Jim.&#x27;  Jim gave a kind of groan.  `Still, when you look at it, isn&#x27;t it queer,&#x27; I went on, `that they should only spot Starlight and leave us out?  It looks as if they was keepin&#x27; dark for fear of frightening us out of the country, but watching all the same.&#x27; `It&#x27;s this way I worked it,&#x27; says father, rubbing his tobacco in his hands the old way, and bringing out his pipe:  `they couldn&#x27;t be off marking down Starlight along of his carryin&#x27; on so.  Of course he drawed notice to himself all roads.  But the rest of us only come in with the mob, and soon as they was sold stashed the camp and cleared out different ways.  Them three fellers is in Queensland long ago, and nobody was to know them from any other road hands.  I was back with the old mare and Bilbah in mighty short time.  I rode &#x27;em night and day, turn about, and they can both travel.  You kept pretty quiet, as luck had it, and was off to Melbourne quick.  I don&#x27;t really believe they dropped to any of us, bar Starlight; and if they don&#x27;t nab him we might get shut of it altogether.  I&#x27;ve known worse things as never turned up in this world, and never will now.&#x27; Here the old man showed his teeth as if he were going to laugh, but thought better of it. `Anyhow, we&#x27;d made it up to come home at Christmas,&#x27; says Jim; `but it&#x27;s all one.  It would have saved us a deal of trouble in our minds all the same if we&#x27;d known there was no warrants out after us two. I wonder if they&#x27;ll nail Starlight.&#x27; `They can&#x27;t be well off it,&#x27; says father.  `He&#x27;s gone off his head, and stopped in some swell town in New Zealand -- Canterbury, I think it&#x27;s called -- livin&#x27; tiptop among a lot of young English swells, instead of makin&#x27; off for the Islands, as he laid out to do.&#x27; `How do you know he&#x27;s there?&#x27; I said. `I know, and that&#x27;s enough,&#x27; snarls father.  `I hear a lot in many ways about things and people that no one guesses on, and I know this -- that he&#x27;s pretty well marked down by old Stillbrook the detective as went down there a month ago.&#x27; `But didn&#x27;t you warn him?&#x27; `Yes, of course, as soon as I heard tell; but it&#x27;s too late, I&#x27;m thinking. He has the devil&#x27;s luck as well as his own, but I always used to tell him it would fail him yet.&#x27; `I believe you&#x27;re the smartest man of the crowd, dad,&#x27; says Jim, laying his hand on father&#x27;s shoulder.  He could pretty nigh get round the old chap once in a way, could Jim, surly as he was. `What do you think we&#x27;d better do?  What&#x27;s our best dart?&#x27; Father shook off his hand, but not roughly, and his voice wasn&#x27;t so hard when he said -- `Why, stop at home quiet, of course, and sleep in your beds at night. Don&#x27;t go planting in the gully, or some one &#x27;ll think you&#x27;re wanted, and let on to the police.  Ride about the country till I give you the office. Never fear but I&#x27;ll have word quick enough.  Go about and see the neighbours round just as usual.&#x27; Jim and I was quite stunned by this bit of news; no doubt we was pretty sorry as ever we left Melbourne, but there was nothing for it now but to follow it out.  After all, we were at home, and it was pleasant to think we wouldn&#x27;t be hunted for a bit and might ride about the old place and enjoy ourselves a bit.  Aileen was as happy as the day was long, and poor mother used to lay her head on Jim&#x27;s neck and cry for joy to have him with her.  Even father used to sit in the front, under the quinces, and smoke his pipe, with old Crib at his feet, most as if he thought he was happy.  I wonder if he ever looked back to the days when he was a farmin&#x27; boy and hadn&#x27;t took to poaching? He must have been a smart, handy kind of lad, and what a different look his face must have had then! We had our own horses in pretty good trim, so we foraged up Aileen&#x27;s mare, and made it up to ride over to George Storefield&#x27;s, and gave him a look-up. He&#x27;d been away when we came, and now we heard he was home. `George has been doing well all this time, of course,&#x27; I said. `I expect he&#x27;ll turn squatter some day and be made a magistrate.&#x27; `Like enough,&#x27; says Jim.  `More than one we could pick began lower down than him, and sits on the Bench and gives coves like us a turn when we&#x27;re brought up before &#x27;em.  Fancy old George sayin&#x27;, &quot;Is anything known, constable, of this prisoner&#x27;s anterseedents?&quot; as I heard old Higgler say one day at Bargo.&#x27; `Why do you make fun of these things, Jim, dear?&#x27; says Aileen, looking so solemn and mournful like.  `Oughtn&#x27;t a steady worker to rise in life, and isn&#x27;t it sad to see cleverer men and better workers -- if they liked -- kept down by their own fault?&#x27; `Why wasn&#x27;t your roan mare born black or chestnut?&#x27; says Jim, laughing, and pretending to touch her up.  `Come along, and let&#x27;s see if she can trot as well as she used to do?&#x27; `Poor Lowan,&#x27; says she, patting the mare&#x27;s smooth neck (she was a wonderful neat, well-bred, dark roan, with black points -- one of dad&#x27;s, perhaps, that he&#x27;d brought her home one time he was in special good humour about something.  Where she was bred or how, nobody ever knew); `she was born pretty and good.  How little trouble her life gives her.  It&#x27;s a pity we can&#x27;t all say as much, or have as little on our minds.&#x27; `Whose fault&#x27;s that?&#x27; says Jim.  `The dingo must live as well as the collie or the sheep either.  One&#x27;s been made just the same as the other. I&#x27;ve often watched a dingo turn round twice, and then pitch himself down in the long grass like as if he was dead.  He&#x27;s not a bad sort, old dingo, and has a good time of it as long as it lasts.&#x27; `Yes, till he&#x27;s trapped or shot or poisoned some day, which he always is,&#x27; said Aileen bitterly.  `I wonder any man should be content with a wicked life and a shameful death.&#x27;  And she struck Lowan with a switch, and spun down the slope of the hill between the trees like a forester-doe with the hunter-hound behind her. When we came up with her she was all right again, and tried to smile. Whatever put her out for the time she always worked things by kindness, and would lead us straight if she could.  Driven, she knew we couldn&#x27;t be; and I believe she did us about ten times as much good that way as if she had scolded and raged, or even sneered at us. When we rode up to Mr. Storefield&#x27;s farm we were quite agreeable and pleasant again, Jim makin&#x27; believe his horse could walk fastest, and saying that her mare&#x27;s pace was only a double shuffle of an amble like Bilbah&#x27;s, and she declaring that the mare&#x27;s was a true walk -- and so it was.  The mare could do pretty well everything but talk, and all her paces were first-class. Old Mrs. Storefield was pottering about in the garden with a big sun-bonnet on.  She was a great woman for flowers. `Come along in, Aileen, my dear,&#x27; she said.  `Gracey&#x27;s in the dairy; she&#x27;ll be out directly.  George only came home yesterday. Who be these you&#x27;ve got with ye?  Why, Dick!&#x27; she says, lookin&#x27; again with her sharp, old, gray eyes, `it&#x27;s you, boy, is it? Well, you&#x27;ve changed a deal too; and Jim too.  Is he as full of mischief as ever?  Well, God bless you, boys, I wish you well!  I wish you well. Come in out of the sun, Aileen; and one of you take the horses up to the stable.  You&#x27;ll find George there somewhere.&#x27; Aileen had jumped down by this time, and had thrown her rein to Jim, so we rode up to the stable, and a very good one it was, not long put up, that we could see.  How the place had changed, and how different it was from ours!  We remembered the time when their hut wasn&#x27;t a patch on ours, when old Isaac Storefield, that had been gardener at Mulgoa to some of the big gentlemen in the old days, had saved a bit of money and taken up a farm; but bit by bit their place had been getting better and bigger every year, while ours had stood still and now was going back. Chapter 15 George Storefield&#x27;s place, for the old man was dead and all the place belonged to him and Gracey, quite stunned Jim and me.  We&#x27;d been away more than a year, and he&#x27;d pulled down the old fences and put up new ones -- first-rate work it was too; he was always a dead hand at splitting. Then there was a big hay-shed, chock-full of good sweet hay and wheat sheaves, and, last of all, the new stable, with six stalls and a loft above, and racks, all built of ironbark slabs, as solid and reg&#x27;lar as a church, Jim said. They&#x27;d a good six-roomed cottage and a new garden fence ever so long. There were more fruit trees in the garden and a lot of good draught horses standing about, that looked well, but as if they&#x27;d come off a journey. The stable door opens, and out comes old George as hearty as ever, but looking full of business. `Glad to see you, boys,&#x27; he says; `what a time you&#x27;ve been away! Been away myself these three months with a lot of teams carrying. I&#x27;ve taken greatly to the business lately.  I&#x27;m just settling up with my drivers, but put the horses in, there&#x27;s chaff and corn in the mangers, and I&#x27;ll be down in a few minutes.  It&#x27;s well on to dinner-time, I see.&#x27; We took the bridles off and tied up the horses -- there was any amount of feed for them -- and strolled down to the cottage again. `Wonder whether Gracey&#x27;s as nice as she used to be,&#x27; says Jim. `Next to Aileen I used to think she wasn&#x27;t to be beat. When I was a little chap I believed you and she must be married for certain. And old George and Aileen.  I never laid out any one for myself, I remember.&#x27; `The first two don&#x27;t look like coming off,&#x27; I said.  `You&#x27;re the likeliest man to marry and settle if Jeanie sticks to you.&#x27; `She&#x27;d better go down to the pier and drown herself comfortably,&#x27; said Jim. `If she knew what was before us all, perhaps she would.  Poor little Jeanie! We&#x27;d no right to drag other people into our troubles.  I believe we&#x27;re getting worse and worse.  The sooner we&#x27;re shot or locked up the better.&#x27; `You won&#x27;t think so when it comes, old man,&#x27; I said.  `Don&#x27;t bother your head -- it ain&#x27;t the best part of you -- about things that can&#x27;t be helped. We&#x27;re not the only horses that can&#x27;t be kept on the course -- with a good turn of speed too.&#x27; `&quot;They want shooting like the dingoes,&quot; as Aileen said. They&#x27;re never no good, except to ruin those that back &#x27;em and disgrace their owners and the stable they come out of. That&#x27;s our sort, all to pieces.  Well, we&#x27;d better come in. Gracey &#x27;ll think we&#x27;re afraid to face her.&#x27; When we went away last Grace Storefield was a little over seventeen, so now she was nineteen all out, and a fine girl she&#x27;d grown. Though I never used to think her a beauty, now I almost began to think she must be.  She wasn&#x27;t tall, and Aileen looked slight alongside of her; but she was wonderful fair and fresh coloured for an Australian girl, with a lot of soft brown hair and a pair of clear blue eyes that always looked kindly and honestly into everybody&#x27;s face. Every look of her seemed to wish to do you good and make you think that nothing that wasn&#x27;t square and right and honest and true could live in the same place with her. She held out both hands to me and said -- `Well, Dick, so you&#x27;re back again.  You must have been to the end of the world, and Jim, too.  I&#x27;m very glad to see you both.&#x27; She looked into my face with that pleased look that put me in mind of her when she was a little child and used to come toddling up to me, staring and smiling all over her face the moment she saw me. Now she was a grown woman, and a sweet-looking one too. I couldn&#x27;t lift her up and kiss her as I used to do, but I felt as if I should like to do it all the same.  She was the only creature in the whole world, I think, that liked me better than Jim. I&#x27;d been trying to drive all thoughts of her out of my heart, seeing the tangle I&#x27;d got into in more ways than one; but now the old feeling which had been a part of me ever since I&#x27;d grown up came rushing back stronger than ever.  I was surprised at myself, and looked queer I daresay. Then Aileen laughed, and Jim comes to the rescue and says -- `Dick doesn&#x27;t remember you, Gracey.  You&#x27;ve grown such a swell, too. You can&#x27;t be the little girl we used to carry on our backs.&#x27; `Dick remembers very well,&#x27; she says, and her very voice was ever so much fuller and softer, `don&#x27;t you, Dick?&#x27; and she looked into my face as innocent as a child.  `I don&#x27;t think he could pull me out of the water and carry me up to the cottage now.&#x27; `You tumble in and we&#x27;ll try,&#x27; says Jim; `first man to keep you for good -- eh, Gracey?  It&#x27;s fine hot weather, and Aileen shall see fair play.&#x27; `You&#x27;re just as saucy as ever, Jim,&#x27; says she, blushing and smiling. `I see George coming, so I must go and fetch in dinner.  Aileen&#x27;s going to help me instead of mother.  You must tell us all about your travels when we sit down.&#x27; When George came in he began to talk to make up for lost time, and told us where he had been -- a long way out in some new back country, just taken up with sheep.  He had got a first-rate paying price for his carriage out, and had brought back and delivered a full load of wool. `I intend to do it every year for a bit,&#x27; he said.  `I can breed and feed a good stamp of draught horse here.  I pay drivers for three waggons and drive the fourth myself.  It pays first-rate so far, and we had very fair feed all the way there and back.&#x27; `Suppose you get a dry season,&#x27; I said, `how will that be?&#x27; `We shall have to carry forage, of course; but then carriage will be higher, and it will come to the same thing.  I don&#x27;t like being so long away from home; but it pays first-rate, and I think I see a way to its paying better still.&#x27; `So you&#x27;ve ridden over to show them the way, Aileen,&#x27; he said, as the girls came in; `very good of you it was.  I was afraid you&#x27;d forgotten the way.&#x27; `I never forget the way to a friend&#x27;s place, George,&#x27; she said, `and you&#x27;ve been our best friend while these naughty boys have left mother and me so long by ourselves.  But you&#x27;ve been away yourself.&#x27; `Only four months,&#x27; he said; `and after a few more trips I shan&#x27;t want to go away any more.&#x27; `That will be a good day for all of us,&#x27; she said.  `You know, Gracey, we can&#x27;t do without George, can we?  I felt quite deserted, I can tell you.&#x27; `He wouldn&#x27;t have gone away at all if you&#x27;d held up your little finger, you know that, you hard-hearted girl,&#x27; said Grace, trying to frown. `It&#x27;s all your fault.&#x27; `Oh! I couldn&#x27;t interfere with Mr. Storefield&#x27;s business,&#x27; said Aileen, looking very grave.  `What kind of a country was it you were out in?&#x27; `Not a bad place for sheep and cattle and blacks,&#x27; said poor George, looking rather glum; `and not a bad country to make money or do anything but live in, but that hot and dry and full of flies and mosquitoes that I&#x27;d sooner live on a pound a week down here than take a good station as a present there.  That is, if I was contented,&#x27; he went on to say, with a sort of a groan. There never was a greater mistake in the world, I believe, than for a man to let a woman know how much he cares for her. It&#x27;s right enough if she&#x27;s made up her mind to take him, no odds what happens. But if there&#x27;s any half-and-half feeling in her mind about him, and she&#x27;s uncertain and doubtful whether she likes him well enough, all this down-on-your-knees business works against you, more than your worst enemy could do.  I didn&#x27;t know so much about it then. I&#x27;ve found it out since, worse luck.  And I really believe if George had had the savey to crack himself up a little, and say he&#x27;d met a nice girl or two in the back country and hid his hand, Aileen would have made it up with him that very Christmas, and been a happy woman all her life. When old Mrs. Storefield came in she put us through our facings pretty brisk -- where we&#x27;d been, what we&#x27;d done?  What took us to Melbourne, -- how we liked it?  What kind of people they were? and so on. We had to tell her a good lot, part of it truth, of course, but pretty mixed. It made rather a good yarn, and I could see Grace was listening with her heart as well as her ears.  Jim said generally we met some very nice people in Melbourne named Jackson, and they were very kind to us. `Were there any daughters in the family, Jim?&#x27; asked Grace. `Oh! yes, three.&#x27; `Were they good-looking?&#x27; `No, rather homely, particularly the youngest.&#x27; `What did they do?&#x27; `Oh! their mother kept a boarding-house.  We stayed there.&#x27; I don&#x27;t think I ever knew Jim do so much lying before; but after he&#x27;d begun he had to stick to it.  He told me afterwards he nearly broke down about the three daughters; but was rather proud of making the youngest the ugliest. `I can see Gracey&#x27;s as fond of you as ever she was, Dick,&#x27; says he; `that&#x27;s why she made me tell all those crammers.  It&#x27;s an awful pity we can&#x27;t all square it, and get spliced this Christmas. Aileen would take George if she wasn&#x27;t a fool, as most women are. I&#x27;d like to bring Jeanie up here, and join George in the carrying business. It&#x27;s going to be a big thing, I can see.  You might marry Gracey, and look after both places while we were away.&#x27; `And how about Kate?&#x27; `The devil take her! and then he&#x27;d have a bargain.  I wish you&#x27;d never dropped across her, and that she wasn&#x27;t Jeanie&#x27;s sister,&#x27; blurts out Jim. `She&#x27;ll bring bad luck among us before she&#x27;s done, I feel, as sure as we&#x27;re standing here.&#x27; `It&#x27;s all a toss up -- like our lives; married or lagged, bushwork or roadwork (in irons), free or bond.  We can&#x27;t tell how it will be with us this day year.&#x27; `I&#x27;ve half a mind to shoot myself,&#x27; says Jim, `and end it all.  I would, too, only for mother and Aileen.  What&#x27;s the use of life that isn&#x27;t life, but fear and misery, from one day&#x27;s end to another, and we only just grown up? It&#x27;s d----d hard that a chap&#x27;s brains don&#x27;t grow along with his legs and arms.&#x27; We didn&#x27;t ride home till quite the evening.  Grace would have us stay for tea; it was a pretty hot day, so there was no use riding in the sun. George saddled his horse, and he and Grace rode part of the way home with us. He&#x27;d got regular sunburnt like us, and, as he could ride a bit, like most natives, he looked better outside of a horse than on his own legs, being rather thick-set and shortish; but his heart was in the right place, like his sister&#x27;s, and his head was screwed on right, too. I think more of old George now than I ever did before, and wish I&#x27;d had the sense to value his independent straight-ahead nature, and the track it led him, as he deserved. Jim and I rode in front, with Gracey between us.  She had on a neat habit and a better hat and gloves than Aileen, but nothing could ever give her the seat and hand and light, easy, graceful way with her in the saddle that our girl had.  All the same she could ride and drive too, and as we rode side by side in the twilight, talking about the places I&#x27;d been to, and she wanting to know everything (Jim drew off a bit when the road got narrow), I felt what a fool I&#x27;d been to let things slide, and would have given my right hand to have been able to put them as they were three short years before. At last we got to the Gap; it was the shortest halt from their home. George shook hands with Aileen, and turned back. `We&#x27;ll come and see you next ----&#x27; he said. `Christmas Eve!&#x27; said Aileen. `Christmas Eve let it be,&#x27; says George. `All right,&#x27; I said, holding Grace&#x27;s hand for a bit.  And so we parted -- for how long, do you think? Chapter 16 When we got home it was pretty late, and the air was beginning to cool after the hot day.  There was a low moon, and everything showed out clear, so that you could see the smallest branches of the trees on Nulla Mountain, where it stood like a dark cloud-bank against the western sky. There wasn&#x27;t the smallest breeze.  The air was that still and quiet you could have heard anything stir in the grass, or almost a &#x27;possum digging his claws into the smooth bark of the white gum trees. The curlews set up a cry from time to time; but they didn&#x27;t sound so queer and shrill as they mostly do at night.  I don&#x27;t know how it was, but everything seemed quiet and pleasant and homelike, as if a chap might live a hundred years, if it was all like this, and keep growing better and happier every day.  I remember all this so particular because it was the only time I&#x27;d felt like it for years, and I never had the same feeling afterwards -- nor likely to. `Oh! what a happy day I&#x27;ve had,&#x27; Aileen said, on a sudden. Jim and I and her had been riding a long spell without speaking. `I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve enjoyed myself so much; I&#x27;ve got quite out of the way of being happy lately, and hardly know the taste of it. How lovely it would be if you and Jim could always stay at home like this, and we could do our work happy and comfortable together, without separating, and all this deadly fear of something terrible happening, that&#x27;s never out of my mind.  Oh! Dick, won&#x27;t you promise me to stop quiet and work steady at home, if you -- if you and Jim haven&#x27;t anything brought against you?&#x27; She bent forward and looked into my face as she said this. I could see her eyes shine, and every word she said seemed to come straight from her heart.  How sad and pitiful she looked, and we felt for a moment just as we did when we were boys, and she used to come and persuade us to go on with our work and not grieve mother, and run the risk of a licking from father when he came home. Her mare, Lowan, was close alongside of my horse, stepping along at her fast tearing walk, throwing up her head and snorting every now and then, but Aileen sat in her saddle better than some people can sit in a chair; she held the rein and whip together and kept her hand on mine till I spoke. `We&#x27;ll do all we can, Aileen dear, for you and poor mother, won&#x27;t we, Jim?&#x27; I felt soft and down-hearted then, if ever I did.  `But it&#x27;s too late -- too late!  You&#x27;ll see us now and then; but we can&#x27;t stop at home quiet, nor work about here all the time as we used to do.  That day&#x27;s gone. Jim knows it as well as me.  There&#x27;s no help for it now. We&#x27;ll have to do like the rest -- enjoy ourselves a bit while we can, and stand up to our fight when the trouble comes.&#x27; She took her hand away, and rode on with her rein loose and her head down. I could see the tears falling down her face, but after a bit she put herself to rights, and we rode quietly up to the door. Mother was working away in her chair, and father walking up and down before the door smoking. When we were letting go the horses, father comes up and says -- `I&#x27;ve got a bit of news for you, boys; Starlight&#x27;s been took, and the darkie with him.&#x27; `Where?&#x27; I said.  Somehow I felt struck all of a heap by hearing this. I&#x27;d got out of the way of thinking they&#x27;d drop on him. As for Jim, he heard it straight enough, but he went on whistling and patting the mare&#x27;s neck, teasing her like, because she was so uneasy to get her head-stall off and run after the others. `Why, in New Zealand, to be sure.  The blamed fool stuck there all this time, just because he found himself comfortably situated among people as he liked. I wonder how he&#x27;ll fancy Berrima after it all?  Sarves him well right.&#x27; `But how did you come to hear about it?&#x27;  We knew father couldn&#x27;t read nor write. `I have a chap as is paid to read the papers reg&#x27;lar, and to put me on when there&#x27;s anything in &#x27;em as I want to know.  He&#x27;s bin over here to-day and give me the office.  Here&#x27;s the paper he left.&#x27; Father pulls out a crumpled-up dirty-lookin&#x27; bit of newspaper. It wasn&#x27;t much to look at; but there was enough to keep us in readin&#x27;, and thinkin&#x27;, too, for a good while, as soon as we made it out. In pretty big letters, too. IMPORTANT CAPTURE BY DETECTIVE STILLBROOK, OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES POLICE. That was atop of the page, then comes this: -- Our readers may remember the description given in this journal, some months since, of a cattle robbery on the largest scale, when upwards of a thousand head were stolen from one of Mr. Hood&#x27;s stations, driven to Adelaide, and then sold, by a party of men whose names have not as yet transpired.  It is satisfactory to find that the leader of the gang, who is well known to the police by the assumed name of `Starlight&#x27;, with a half-caste lad recognised as an accomplice, has been arrested by this active officer. It appears that, from information received, Detective Stillbrook went to New Zealand, and, after several months&#x27; patient search, took his passage in the boat which left that colony, in order to meet the mail steamer, outward bound, for San Francisco.  As the passengers were landing he arrested a gentlemanlike and well-dressed personage, who, with his servant, was about to proceed to Menzies&#x27;s Hotel.  Considerable surprise was manifested by the other passengers, with whom the prisoner had become universally popular.  He indignantly denied all knowledge of the charge; but we have reason to believe that there will be no difficulty as to identification.  A large sum of money in gold and notes was found upon him.  Other arrests are likely to follow. This looked bad; for a bit we didn&#x27;t know what to think. While Jim and I was makin&#x27; it all out, with the help of a bit of candle we smuggled out -- we dursn&#x27;t take it inside -- father was smokin&#x27; his pipe -- in the old fashion -- and saying nothing.  When we&#x27;d done he put up his pipe in his pouch and begins to talk. `It&#x27;s come just as I said, and knowed it would, through Starlight&#x27;s cussed flashness and carryin&#x27;s on in fine company.  If he&#x27;d cleared out and made for the Islands as I warned him to do, and he settled to, or as good, afore he left us that day at the camp, he&#x27;d been safe in some o&#x27; them &#x27;Merikin places he was always gassin&#x27; about, and all this wouldn&#x27;t &#x27;a happened.&#x27; `He couldn&#x27;t help that,&#x27; says Jim; `he thought they&#x27;d never know him from any other swell in Canterbury or wherever he was.  He&#x27;s been took in like many another man.  What I look at is this:  he won&#x27;t squeak. How are they to find out that we had any hand in it?&#x27; `That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m dubersome about,&#x27; says father, lightin&#x27; his pipe again. `Nobody down there got much of a look at me, and I let my beard grow on the road and shaved clean soon&#x27;s I got back, same as I always do. Now the thing is, does any one know that you boys was in the fakement?&#x27; `Nobody&#x27;s likely to know but him and Warrigal.  The knockabouts and those other three chaps won&#x27;t come it on us for their own sakes. We may as well stop here till Christmas is over and then make down to the Barwon, or somewhere thereabouts.  We could take a long job at droving till the derry&#x27;s off a bit.&#x27; `If you&#x27;ll be said by me,&#x27; the old man growls out, `you&#x27;ll make tracks for the Hollow afore daylight and keep dark till we hear how the play goes. I know Starlight&#x27;s as close as a spring-lock; but that chap Warrigal don&#x27;t cotton to either of you, and he&#x27;s likely to give you away if he&#x27;s pinched himself -- that&#x27;s my notion of him.&#x27; `Starlight &#x27;ll keep him from doing that,&#x27; Jim says; `the boy &#x27;ll do nothing his master don&#x27;t agree to, and he&#x27;d break his neck if he found him out in any dog&#x27;s trick like that.&#x27; `Starlight and he ain&#x27;t in the same cell, you take your oath. I don&#x27;t trust no man except him.  I&#x27;ll be off now, and if you&#x27;ll take a fool&#x27;s advice, though he is your father, you&#x27;ll go too; we can be there by daylight.&#x27; Jim and I looked at each other. `We promised to stay Chris&#x27;mas with mother and Aileen,&#x27; says he, `and if all the devils in hell tried to stop us, I wouldn&#x27;t break my word. But we&#x27;ll come to the Hollow on Boxing Day, won&#x27;t we, Dick?&#x27; `All right!  It&#x27;s only two or three days.  The day after to-morrow&#x27;s Chris&#x27;mas Eve.  We&#x27;ll chance that, as it&#x27;s gone so far.&#x27; `Take your own way,&#x27; growls father.  `Fetch me my saddle. The old mare&#x27;s close by the yard.&#x27; Jim fetches the saddle and bridle, and Crib comes after him, out of the verandah, where he had been lying.  Bless you! he knew something was up.  Just like a Christian he was, and nothing never happened that dad was in as he wasn&#x27;t down to. `May as well stop till morning, dad,&#x27; says Jim, as we walked up to the yard. `Not another minute,&#x27; says the old man, and he whips the bridle out of Jim&#x27;s hand and walks over to the old mare.  She lifts up her head from the dry grass and stands as steady as a rock. `Good-bye,&#x27; he says, and he shook hands with both of us; `if I don&#x27;t see you again I&#x27;ll send you word if I hear anything fresh.&#x27; In another minute we heard the old mare&#x27;s hoofs proceeding away among the rocks up the gully, and gradually getting fainter in the distance. Then we went in.  Mother and Aileen had been in bed an hour ago, and all the better for them.  Next morning we told mother and Aileen that father had gone.  They didn&#x27;t say much.  They were used to his ways. They never expected him till they saw him, and had got out of the fashion of asking why he did this or that.  He had reasons of his own, which he never told them, for going or coming, and they&#x27;d left off troubling their heads about it.  Mother was always in dread while he was there, and they were far easier in their minds when he was away off the place. As for us, we had made up our minds to enjoy ourselves while we could, and we had come to his way of thinking, that most likely nothing was known of our being in the cattle affair that Starlight and the boy had been arrested for.  We knew nothing would drag it out of Starlight about his pals in this or any other job.  Now they&#x27;d got him, it would content them for a bit, and maybe take off their attention from us and the others that were in it. There were two days to Christmas.  Next day George and his sister would be over, and we all looked forward to that for a good reminder of old times. We were going to have a merry Christmas at home for once in a way. After that we would clear out and get away to some of the far out stations, where chaps like ourselves always made to when they wanted to keep dark. We might have the luck of other men that we had known of, and never be traced till the whole thing had died out and been half-forgotten.  Though we didn&#x27;t say much to each other we had pretty well made up our minds to go straight from this out.  We might take up a bit of back country, and put stock on it with some of the money we had left.  Lots of men had begun that way that had things against them as bad as us, and had kept steady, and worked through in course of time.  Why shouldn&#x27;t we as well as others? We wanted to see what the papers said of us, so we rode over to a little post town we knew of and got a copy of the `Evening Times&#x27;. There it all was in full: -- CATTLE-LIFTING EXTRAORDINARY. We have heard from time to time of cattle being stolen in lots of reasonable size, say from ten to one hundred, or even as high as two hundred head at the outside.  But we never expected to have to record the erecting of a substantial stockyard and the carrying off and disposing of a whole herd, estimated at a thousand or eleven hundred head, chiefly the property of one proprietor.  Yet this has been done in New South Wales, and done, we regret to say, cleverly and successfully. It has just transpired, beyond all possibility of mistake, that Mr. Hood&#x27;s Outer Back Momberah run has suffered to that extent in the past winter.  The stolen herd was driven to Adelaide, and there sold openly.  The money was received by the robbers, who were permitted to decamp at their leisure. When we mention the name of the notorious `Starlight&#x27;, no one will be surprised that the deed was planned, carried out, and executed with consummate address and completeness.  It seems matter of regret that we cannot persuade this illustrious depredator to take the command of our police force, that body of life-assurers and property-protectors which has proved so singularly ineffective as a preventive service in the present case.  On the well-known proverbial principle we might hope for the best results under Mr. Starlight&#x27;s intelligent supervision. We must not withhold our approval as to one item of success which the force has scored.  Starlight himself and a half-caste henchman have been cleverly captured by Detective Stillbrook, just as the former, who has been ruffling it among the `aristocratic&#x27; settlers of Christchurch, was about to sail for Honolulu.  The names of his other accomplices, six in number, it is said, have not as yet transpired. This last part gave us confidence, but all the same we kept everything ready for a bolt in case of need.  We got up our horses every evening and kept them in the yard all night.  The feed was good by the creek now -- a little dried up but plenty of bite, and better for horses that had been ridden far and fast than if it was green. We had enough of last year&#x27;s hay to give them a feed at night, and that was all they wanted.  They were two pretty good ones and not slow either.  We took care of that when we bought them. Nobody ever saw us on bad ones since we were boys, and we had broken them in to stand and be caught day or night, and to let us jump on and off at a moment&#x27;s notice. All that day, being awful hot and close, we stayed in the house and yarned away with mother and Aileen till they thought -- poor souls -- that we had turned over a new leaf and were going to stay at home and be good boys for the future.  When a man sees how little it takes to make women happy -- them that&#x27;s good and never thinks of anything but doing their best for everybody belonging to &#x27;em -- it&#x27;s wonderful how men ever make up their minds to go wrong and bring all that loves them to shame and grief.  When they&#x27;ve got nobody but themselves to think of it don&#x27;t so much matter as I know of; but to keep on breaking the hearts of those as never did you anything but good, and wouldn&#x27;t if they lived for a hundred years, is cowardly and unmanly any way you look at it.  And yet we&#x27;d done very little else ourselves these years and years. We all sat up till nigh on to midnight with our hands in one another&#x27;s -- Jim down at mother&#x27;s feet; Aileen and I close beside them on the old seat in the verandah that father made such a time ago. At last mother gets up, and they both started for bed.  Aileen seemed as if she couldn&#x27;t tear herself away.  Twice she came back, then she kissed us both, and the tears came into her eyes. `I feel too happy,&#x27; she said; `I never thought I should feel like this again. God bless you both, and keep us all from harm.&#x27;  `Amen,&#x27; said mother from the next room.  We turned out early, and had a bathe in the creek before we went up to the yard to let out the horses.  There wasn&#x27;t a cloud in the sky; it was safe to be a roasting hot day, but it was cool then. The little waterhole where we learned to swim when we were boys was deep on one side and had a rocky ledge to jump off.  The birds just began to give out a note or two; the sun was rising clear and bright, and we could see the dark top of Nulla Mountain getting a sort of rose colour against the sky. `George and Gracey &#x27;ll be over soon after breakfast,&#x27; I said; `we must have everything look ship-shape as well as we can before they turn up.&#x27; `The horses may as well go down to the flat,&#x27; Jim says; `we can catch them easy enough in time to ride back part of the way with them. I&#x27;ll run up Lowan, and give her a bit of hay in the calf-pen.&#x27; We went over to the yard, and Jim let down the rails and walked in. I stopped outside.  Jim had his horse by the mane, and was patting his neck as mine came out, when three police troopers rose up from behind the bushes, and covering us with their rifles called out, `Stand, in the Queen&#x27;s name!&#x27; Jim made one spring on to his horse&#x27;s back, drove his heels into his flank, and was out through the gate and half-way down the hill before you could wink. Just as Jim cleared the gate a tall man rose up close behind me and took a cool pot at him with a revolver.  I saw Jim&#x27;s hat fly off, and another bullet grazed his horse&#x27;s hip.  I saw the hair fly, and the horse make a plunge that would have unseated most men with no saddle between their legs.  But Jim sat close and steady and only threw up his arm and gave a shout as the old horse tore down the hill a few miles an hour faster. `D--n those cartridges,&#x27; said the tall trooper; `they always put too much powder in them for close shooting.  Now, Dick Marston!&#x27; he went on, putting his revolver to my head, `I&#x27;d rather not blow your brains out before your people, but if you don&#x27;t put up your hands by ---- I&#x27;ll shoot you where you stand.&#x27;  I had been staring after Jim all the time; I believe I had never thought of myself till he was safe away. `Get your horses, you d----d fools,&#x27; he shouts out to the men, `and see if you can follow up that madman.  He&#x27;s most likely knocked off against a tree by this time.&#x27; There was nothing else for it but to do it and be handcuffed. As the steel locks snapped I saw mother standing below wringing her hands, and Aileen trying to get her into the house. `Better come down and get your coat on, Dick,&#x27; said the senior constable. `We want to search the place, too.  By Jove! we shall get pepper from Sir Ferdinand when we go in.  I thought we had you both as safe as chickens in a coop.  Who would have thought of Jim givin&#x27; us the slip, on a barebacked horse, without so much as a halter?  I&#x27;m devilish sorry for your family; but if nothing less than a thousand head of cattle will satisfy people, they must expect trouble to come of it.&#x27; `What are you talking about?&#x27; I said.  `You&#x27;ve got the wrong story and the wrong men.&#x27; `All right; we&#x27;ll see about that.  I don&#x27;t know whether you want any breakfast, but I should like a cup of tea.  It&#x27;s deuced slow work watching all night, though it isn&#x27;t cold.  We&#x27;ve got to be in Bargo barracks to-night, so there&#x27;s no time to lose.&#x27; It was all over now -- the worst HAD come.  What fools we had been not to take the old man&#x27;s advice, and clear out when he did.  He was safe in the Hollow, and would chuckle to himself -- and be sorry, too -- when he heard of my being taken, and perhaps Jim.  The odds were he might be smashed against a tree, perhaps killed, at the pace he was going on a horse he could not guide. They searched the house, but the money they didn&#x27;t get. Jim and I had taken care of that, in case of accidents. Mother sat rocking herself backwards and forwards, every now and then crying out in a pitiful way, like the women in her country do, I&#x27;ve heard tell, when some one of their people is dead; `keening&#x27;, I think they call it.  Well, Jim and I were as good as dead. If the troopers had shot the pair of us there and then, same as bushmen told us the black police did their prisoners when they gave &#x27;em any trouble, it would have been better for everybody. However, people don&#x27;t die all at once when they go to the bad, and take to stealing or drinking, or any of the devil&#x27;s favourite traps. Pity they don&#x27;t, and have done with it once and for all. I know I thought so when I was forced to stand there with my hands chained together for the first time in my life (though I&#x27;d worked for it, I know that); and to see Aileen walking about laying the cloth for breakfast like a dead woman, and know what was in her mind. The troopers were civil enough, and Goring, the senior constable, tried to comfort them as much as he could.  He knew it was no fault of theirs; and though he said he meant to have Jim if mortal men and horses could do it he thought he had a fair chance of getting away.  `He&#x27;s sure to be caught in the long run, though,&#x27; he went on to say.  `There&#x27;s a warrant out for him, and a description in every &quot;Police Gazette&quot; in the colonies. My advice to him would be to come back and give himself up. It&#x27;s not a hanging matter, and as it&#x27;s the first time you&#x27;ve been fitted, Dick, the judge, as like as not, will let you off with a light sentence.&#x27; So they talked away until they had finished their breakfast. I couldn&#x27;t touch a mouthful for the life of me, and as soon as it was all over they ran up my horse and put the saddle on.  But I wasn&#x27;t to ride him. No fear!  Goring put me on an old screw of a troop horse, with one leg like a gate-post.  I was helped up and my legs tied under his belly.  Then one of the men took the bridle and led me away. Goring rode in front and the other men behind. As we rose the hill above the place I looked back and saw mother drop down on the ground in a kind of fit, while Aileen bent over her and seemed to be loosening her dress.  Just at that moment George Storefield and his sister rode up to the door.  George jumped off and rushed over to Aileen and mother.  I knew Gracey had seen me, for she sat on her horse as if she had been turned to stone, and let her reins drop on his neck.  Strange things have happened to me since, but I shall never forget that to the last day of my miserable life. Chapter 17 I wasn&#x27;t in the humour for talking, but sometimes anything&#x27;s better than one&#x27;s own thoughts.  Goring threw in a word from time to time. He&#x27;d only lately come into our district, and was sure to be promoted, everybody said.  Like Starlight himself, he&#x27;d seen better days at home in England; but when he got pinched he&#x27;d taken the right turn and not the wrong one, which makes all the difference. He was earning his bread honest, anyway, and he was a chap as liked the fun and dash of a mounted policeman&#x27;s life. As for the risk -- and there is some danger, more than people thinks, now and then -- he liked that the best of it.  He was put out at losing Jim; but he believed he couldn&#x27;t escape, and told me so in a friendly way. `He&#x27;s inside a circle and he can&#x27;t get away, you mark my words,&#x27; he said, two or three times.  `We have every police-station warned by wire, within a hundred miles of here, three days ago.  There&#x27;s not a man in the colony sharper looked after than Master Jim is this minute.&#x27; `Then you only heard about us three days ago?&#x27; I said. `That&#x27;s as it may be,&#x27; he answered, biting his lip.  `Anyhow, there isn&#x27;t a shepherd&#x27;s hut within miles that he can get to without our knowing it. The country&#x27;s rough, but there&#x27;s word gone for a black tracker to go down. You&#x27;ll see him in Bargo before the week&#x27;s out.&#x27; I had a good guess where Jim would make for, and he knew enough to hide his tracks for the last few miles if there was a whole tribe of trackers after him. That night we rode into Bargo.  A long day too we&#x27;d had -- we were all tired enough when we got in.  I was locked up, of course, and as soon as we were in the cell Goring said, `Listen to me,&#x27; and put on his official face -- devilish stern and hard-looking he was then, in spite of all the talking and nonsense we&#x27;d had coming along. `Richard Marston, I charge you with unlawfully taking, stealing, and carrying away, in company with others, one thousand head of mixed cattle, more or less the property of one Walter Hood, of Outer Back, Momberah, in or about the month of June last.&#x27; `All right; why don&#x27;t you make it a few more while you&#x27;re about it?&#x27; `That&#x27;ll do,&#x27; he said, nodding his head, `you decline to say anything. Well, I can&#x27;t exactly wish you a merry Christmas -- fancy this being Christmas Eve, by Jove! -- but you&#x27;ll be cool enough this deuced hot weather till the sessions in February, which is more than some of us can say. Good-night.&#x27;  He went out and locked the door.  I sat down on my blanket on the floor and hid my head in my hands.  I wonder it didn&#x27;t burst with what I felt then.  Strange that I shouldn&#x27;t have felt half as bad when the judge, the other day, sentenced me to be a dead man in a couple of months.  But I was young then. .    .    .    .    . Christmas Day! Christmas Day!  So this is how I was to spend it after all, I thought, as I woke up at dawn, and saw the gray light just beginning to get through the bars of the window of the cell. Here was I locked up, caged, ironed, disgraced, a felon and an outcast for the rest of my life.  Jim, flying for his life, hiding from every honest man, every policeman in the country looking after him, and authorised to catch him or shoot him down like a sheep-killing dog. Father living in the Hollow, like a blackfellow in a cave, afraid to spend the blessed Christmas with his wife and daughter, like the poorest man in the land could do if he was only honest. Mother half dead with grief, and Aileen ashamed to speak to the man that loved and respected her from her childhood.  Gracey Storefield not daring to think of me or say my name, after seeing me carried off a prisoner before her eyes.  Here was a load of misery and disgrace heaped up together, to be borne by the whole family, now and for the time to come -- by the innocent as well as the guilty.  And for what?  Because we had been too idle and careless to work regularly and save our money, though well able to do it, like honest men.  Because, little by little, we had let bad dishonest ways and flash manners grow upon us, all running up an account that had to be paid some day. And now the day of reckoning had come -- sharp and sudden with a vengeance! Well, what call had we to look for anything else?  We had been working for it; now we had got it, and had to bear it.  Not for want of warning, neither. What had mother and Aileen been saying ever since we could remember? Warning upon warning.  Now the end had come just as they said. Of course I knew in a general way that I couldn&#x27;t be punished or be done anything to right off.  I knew law enough for that. The next thing would be that I should have to be brought up before the magistrates and committed for trial as soon as they could get any evidence. After breakfast, flour and water or hominy, I forget which, the warder told me that there wasn&#x27;t much chance of my being brought up before Christmas was over.  The police magistrate was away on a month&#x27;s leave, and the other magistrates would not be likely to attend before the end of the week, anyway.  So I must make myself comfortable where I was.  Comfortable! `Had they caught Jim?&#x27; `Well, not that he&#x27;d heard of; but Goring said it was impossible for him to get away.  At twelve he&#x27;d bring me some dinner.&#x27; I was pretty certain they wouldn&#x27;t catch Jim, in spite of Goring being so cocksure about it.  If he wasn&#x27;t knocked off the first mile or so, he&#x27;d find ways of stopping or steadying his horse, and facing him up to where we had gone to join father at the tableland of the Nulla Mountain. Once he got near there he could let go his horse.  They&#x27;d be following his track, while he made the best of his way on foot to the path that led to the Hollow.  If he had five miles start of them there, as was most likely, all the blacks in the country would never track where he got to.  He and father could live there for a month or so, and take it easy until they could slip out and do a bit of father&#x27;s old trade. That was about what I expected Jim to do, and as it turned out I was as nearly right as could be.  They ran his track for ten miles. Then they followed his horse-tracks till late the second day, and found that the horse had slued round and was making for home again with nobody on him. Jim was nowhere to be seen, and they&#x27;d lost all that time, never expecting that he was going to dismount and leave the horse to go his own way. They searched Nulla Mountain from top to bottom; but some of the smartest men of the old Mounted Police and the best of the stockmen in the old days -- men not easy to beat -- had tried the same country many years before, and never found the path to the Hollow.  So it wasn&#x27;t likely any one else would.  They had to come back and own that they were beat, which put Goring in a rage and made the inspector, Sir Ferdinand Morringer, blow them all up for a lot of duffers and old women.  Altogether they had a bad time of it, not that it made any difference to me. After the holidays a magistrate was fished up somehow, and I was brought before him and the apprehending constable&#x27;s evidence taken. Then I was remanded to the Bench at Nomah, where Mr. Hood and some of the other witnesses were to appear.  So away we started for another journey.  Goring and a trooper went with me, and all sorts of care was taken that I didn&#x27;t give them the slip on the road. Goring used to put one of my handcuffs on his own wrist at night, so there wasn&#x27;t much chance of moving without waking him. I had an old horse to ride that couldn&#x27;t go much faster than I could run, for fear of accident.  It was even betting that he&#x27;d fall and kill me on the road.  If I&#x27;d had a laugh in me, I should have had a joke against the Police Department for not keeping safer horses for their prisoners to ride.  They keep them till they haven&#x27;t a leg to stand upon, and long after they can&#x27;t go a hundred yards without trying to walk on their heads they&#x27;re thought good enough to carry packs and prisoners. `Some day,&#x27; Goring said, `one of those old screws will be the death of a prisoner before he&#x27;s committed for trial, and then there&#x27;ll be a row over it, I suppose.&#x27; We hadn&#x27;t a bad journey of it on the whole.  The troopers were civil enough, and gave me a glass of grog now and then when they had one themselves. They&#x27;d done their duty in catching me, and that was all they thought about. What came afterwards wasn&#x27;t their look-out.  I&#x27;ve no call to have any bad feeling against the police, and I don&#x27;t think most men of my sort have. They&#x27;ve got their work to do, like other people, and as long as they do what they&#x27;re paid for, and don&#x27;t go out of their way to harass men for spite, we don&#x27;t bear them any malice.  If one&#x27;s hit in fair fight it&#x27;s the fortune of war.  What our side don&#x27;t like is men going in for police duty that&#x27;s not in their line.  That&#x27;s interfering, according to our notions, and if they fall into a trap or are met with when they don&#x27;t expect it they get it pretty hot.  They&#x27;ve only themselves to thank for it. Goring, I could see by his ways, had been a swell, something like Starlight. A good many young fellows that don&#x27;t drop into fortunes when they come out here take to the police in Australia, and very good men they make.  They like the half-soldiering kind of life, and if they stick steady at their work, and show pluck and gumption, they mostly get promoted. Goring was a real smart, dashing chap, a good rider for an Englishman; that is, he could set most horses, and hold his own with us natives anywhere but through scrub and mountain country.  No man can ride there, I don&#x27;t care who he is, the same as we can, unless he&#x27;s been at it all his life.  There we have the pull -- not that it is so much after all. But give a native a good horse and thick country, and he&#x27;ll lose any man living that&#x27;s tackled the work after he&#x27;s grown up. By and by we got to Nomah, a regular hot hole of a place, with a log lock-up. I was stuck in, of course, and had leg-irons put on for fear I should get out, as another fellow had done a few weeks back.  Starlight and Warrigal hadn&#x27;t reached yet; they had farther to come.  The trial couldn&#x27;t come till the Quarter Sessions.  January, and February too, passed over, and all this time I was mewed up in a bit of a place enough to stifle a man in the burning weather we had. I heard afterwards that they wanted to bring some of the cattle over, so as Mr. Hood could swear to &#x27;em being his property.  But he said he could only swear to its being his brand; that he most likely had never set eyes on them in his life, and couldn&#x27;t swear on his own knowledge that they hadn&#x27;t been sold, like lots of others, by his manager. So this looked like a hitch, as juries won&#x27;t bring a man in guilty of cattle-stealing unless there&#x27;s clear swearing that the animals he sold were the property of the prosecutor, and known by him to be such. Mr. Hood had to go all the way to Adelaide himself, and they told me we might likely have got out of it all, only for the imported bull. When he saw him he said he could swear to him point blank, brand or no brand. He&#x27;d no brand on him, of course, when he left England; but Hood happened to be in Sydney when he came out, and at the station when he came up.  He was stabled for the first six months, so he used to go and look him over every day, and tell visitors what a pot of money he&#x27;d cost, till he knew every hair in his tail, as the saying is.  As soon as he seen him in Adelaide he said he could swear to him as positive as he could to his favourite riding horse. So he was brought over in a steamer from Adelaide, and then drove all the way up to Nomah.  I wished he&#x27;d broken his neck before we ever saw him. Next thing I saw was Starlight being brought in, handcuffed, between two troopers, and looking as if he&#x27;d ridden a long way. He was just as easy-going and devil-may-care as ever. He said to one of the troopers -- `Here we are at last, and I&#x27;m deuced glad of it.  It&#x27;s perfectly monstrous you fellows haven&#x27;t better horses.  You ought to make me remount agent, and I&#x27;d show you the sort of horses that ought to be bought for police service.  Let me have a glass of beer, that&#x27;s a good fellow, before I&#x27;m locked up.  I suppose there&#x27;s no tap worth speaking of inside.&#x27; The constable laughed, and had one brought to him. `It will be some time before you get another, captain. Here&#x27;s a long one for you; make the most of it.&#x27; Where, in the devil&#x27;s name, is that Warrigal?  I thought to myself. Has he given them the slip?  He had, as it turned out. He had slipped the handcuffs over his slight wrists and small hands, bided his time, and then dashed into a scrub.  There he was at home. They rode and rode, but Warrigal was gone like a rock wallaby. It was a good while before he was as near the gaol again. All this time I&#x27;d been wondering how it was they came to drop on our names so pat, and to find out that Jim and I had a share in the Momberah cattle racket.  All they could have known was that we left the back of Boree at a certain day; and that was nothing, seeing that for all they knew we might have gone away to new country or anywhere.  The more I looked at it the more I felt sure that some one had given to the police information about us -- somebody who was in it and knew all about everything.  It wasn&#x27;t Starlight. We could have depended our life on him.  It might have been one of the other chaps, but I couldn&#x27;t think of any one, except Warrigal. He would do anything in the world to spite me and Jim, I knew; but then he couldn&#x27;t hurt us without drawing the net tighter round Starlight. Sooner than hurt a hair of his head he&#x27;d have put his hand into the fire and kept it there.  I knew that from things I&#x27;d seen him do. Starlight and I hadn&#x27;t much chance of a talk, but we managed to get news from each other, a bit at a time; that can always be managed. We were to be defended, and a lawyer fetched all the way from Sydney to fight our case for us.  The money was there.  Father managed the other part of it through people he had that did every kind of work for him; so when the judge came up we should have a show for it. The weary long summer days -- every one of them about twenty hours long -- came to an end somehow or other.  It was so hot and close and I was that miserable I had two minds to knock my brains out and finish the whole thing.  I couldn&#x27;t settle to read, as I did afterwards. I was always wishing and wondering when I&#x27;d hear some news from home, and none ever came.  Nomah was a bit of a place where hardly anybody did anything but idle and drink, and spend money when they had it. When they had none they went away.  There wasn&#x27;t even a place to take exercise in, and the leg-irons I wore night and day began to eat into my flesh.  I wasn&#x27;t used to them in those days. I could feel them in my heart, too.  Last of all I got ill, and for a while was so weak and low they thought I was going to get out of the trial altogether. At last we heard that the judge and all his lot were on the road, and would be up in a few days.  We were almost as glad when the news came as if we were sure of being let off.  One day they did come, and all the little town was turned upside down.  The judge stopped at one hotel (they told us); the lawyers at another.  Then the witnesses in ours and other cases came in from all parts, and made a great difference, especially to the publicans.  The jurors were summoned, and had to come, unless they had a fancy for being fined.  Most of this I heard from the constables; they seemed to think it was the only thing that made any difference in their lives.  Last of all I heard that Mr. Hood had come, and the imported bull, and some other witnesses. There were some small cases first, and then we were brought out, Starlight and I, and put in the dock.  The court was crammed and crowded; every soul within a hundred miles seemed to have come in; there never were so many people in the little courthouse before. Starlight was quietly dressed, and looked as if he was there by mistake. Anybody would have thought so, the way he lounged and stared about, as if he thought there was something very curious and hard to understand about the whole thing.  I was so weak and ill that I couldn&#x27;t stand up, and after a while the judge told me to sit down, and Starlight too. Starlight made a most polite bow, and thanked his Honour, as he called him. Then the jury were called up, and our lawyer began his work. He stood alongside of Starlight, and whispered something to him, after which Starlight stood up, and about every second man called out `Challenge&#x27;; then that juror had to go down.  It took a good while to get our jury all together.  Our lawyer seemed very particular about the sort of jury he was satisfied with; and when they did manage to get twelve at last they were not the best-looking men in the court by a very long way. The trial had to go on, and then the Crown Prosecutor made a speech, in which he talked about the dishonesty which was creeping unchecked over the land, and the atrocious villainy of criminals who took a thousand head of cattle in one lot, and made out the country was sure to go to destruction if we were not convicted. He said that unfortunately they were not in a position to bring many of the cattle back that had been taken to another colony; but one remarkable animal was as good for purposes of evidence as a hundred. Such an animal he would produce, and he would not trespass on the patience of jurors and gentlemen in attendance any longer, but call his first witness. John Dawson, sworn:  Was head stockman and cattle manager at Momberah; knew the back country, and in a general way the cattle running there; was not out much in the winter; the ground was boggy, and the cattle were hardly ever mustered till spring; when he did go, with some other stock-riders, he saw at once that a large number of the Momberah cattle, branded HOD and other brands, were missing; went to Adelaide a few months after; saw a large number of cattle of the HOD brand, which he was told had been sold by the prisoner now before the court, and known as Starlight, and others, to certain farmers; he could swear that the cattle he saw bore Mr. Hood&#x27;s brand; could not swear that he recognised them as having been at Momberah in his charge; believed so, but could not swear it; he had seen a short-horn bull outside of the court this morning; he last saw the said bull at the station of Messrs. Fordham Brothers, near Adelaide; they made a communication to him concerning the bull; he would and could swear to the identity of the animal with the Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge, an imported short-horn bull, the property of Mr. Hood; had seen him before that at Momberah; knew that Mr. Hood had bought said bull in Sydney, and was at Momberah when he was sent up; could not possibly be mistaken; when he saw the bull at Momberah, nine months since, he had a small brand like H on the shoulder; Mr. Hood put it on in witness&#x27;s presence; it was a horse-brand, now it resembled J-E; the brand had been `faked&#x27; or cleverly altered; witness could see the original brand quite plain underneath; as far as he knew Mr. Hood never sold or gave any one authority to take the animal; he had missed him some months since, and always believed he had strayed; knew the bull to be a valuable animal, worth several hundred pounds. We had one bit of luck in having to be tried in an out-of-the-way place like Nomah.  It was a regular outside bush township, and though the distance oughtn&#x27;t to have much to say to people&#x27;s honesty, you&#x27;ll mostly find that these far-out back-of-beyond places have got men and women to match &#x27;em. Except the squatters and overseers, the other people&#x27;s mostly a shady lot. Some&#x27;s run away from places that were too hot to hold &#x27;em. The women ain&#x27;t the men&#x27;s wives that they live with, but somebody else&#x27;s -- who&#x27;s well rid of &#x27;em too if all was known.  There&#x27;s most likely a bit of horse and cattle stealing done on the quiet, and the publicans and storekeepers know who are their best customers, the square people or the cross ones.  It ain&#x27;t so easy to get a regular up-and-down straight-ahead jury in a place of this sort. So Starlight and I knew that our chance was a lot better than if we&#x27;d been tried at Bargo or Dutton Forest, or any steady-going places of that sort. If we&#x27;d made up our minds from the first that we were to get into it it wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad; we&#x27;d have known we had to bear it. Now we might get out of it, and what a thing it would be to feel free again, and walk about in the sun without any one having the right to stop you. Almost, that is -- there were other things against us; but there wasn&#x27;t so much of a chance of their turning up. This was the great stake.  If we won we were as good as made. I felt ready to swear I&#x27;d go home and never touch a shilling that didn&#x27;t come honest again.  If we lost it seemed as if everything was so much the worse, and blacker than it looked at first, just for this bit of hope and comfort. After the bull had been sworn to by Mr. Hood and another witness, they brought up some more evidence, as they called it, about the other cattle we had sold in Adelaide.  They had fetched some of the farmers up that had been at the sale.  They swore straight enough to having bought cattle with certain brands from Starlight.  They didn&#x27;t know, of course, at the time whose they were, but they could describe the brands fast enough.  There was one fellow that couldn&#x27;t read nor write, but he remembered all the brands, about a dozen, in the pen of steers he bought, and described them one by one. One brand, he said, was like a long-handled shovel.  It turned out to be --D.* TD -- Tom Dawson&#x27;s, of Mungeree.  About a hundred of his were in the mob. They had drawn back for Mungeree, as was nearly all frontage and cold in the winter.  He was the worst witness for us of the lot, very near. He&#x27;d noticed everything and forgot nothing. -- * In the original text, the horizontal bar is represented by a capital &quot;I&quot;   rotated 90 degrees, and a bit lower than centre -- but from the description,   `--D&#x27; may be better, where the `--&#x27; represents the upright of the T in TD.   -- A. L., 1997. -- `Do you recognise either of the prisoners in the dock?&#x27; he was asked. `Yes; both of &#x27;em,&#x27; says he.  I wish I could have got at him. `I see the swell chap first -- him as made out he was the owner, and gammoned all the Adelaide gentlemen so neat.  There was a half-caste chap with him as followed him about everywhere; then there was another man as didn&#x27;t talk much, but seemed, by letting down sliprails and what not, to be in it.  I heard this Starlight, as he calls hisself now, say to him, &quot;You have everything ready to break camp by ten o&#x27;clock, and I&#x27;ll be there to-morrow and square up.&quot;  I thought he meant to pay their wages.  I never dropped but what they was his men -- his hired servants -- as he was going to pay off or send back.&#x27; `Will you swear,&#x27; our lawyer says, `that the younger prisoner is the man you saw at Adelaide with the cattle?&#x27; `Yes; I&#x27;ll swear.  I looked at him pretty sharp, and nothing ain&#x27;t likely to make me forget him.  He&#x27;s the man, and that I&#x27;ll swear to.&#x27; `Were there not other people there with the cattle?&#x27; `Yes; there was an oldish, very quiet, but determined-like man -- he had a stunnin&#x27; dorg with him -- and a young man something like this gentleman -- I mean the prisoner.  I didn&#x27;t see the other young man nor the half-caste in court.&#x27; `That&#x27;s all very well,&#x27; says our lawyer, very fierce; `but will you swear, sir, that the prisoner Marston took any charge or ownership of the cattle?&#x27; `No, I can&#x27;t,&#x27; says the chap.  `I see him a drafting &#x27;em in the morning, and he seemed to know all the brands, and so on; but he done no more than I&#x27;ve seen hired servants do over and over again.&#x27; The other witnesses had done, when some one called out, `Herbert Falkland,&#x27; and Mr. Falkland steps into the court.  He walks in quiet and a little proud; he couldn&#x27;t help feeling it, but he didn&#x27;t show it in his ways and talk, as little as any man I ever saw. He&#x27;s asked by the Crown Prosecutor if he&#x27;s seen the bull outside of the court this day. `Yes; he has seen him.&#x27; `Has he ever seen him before?&#x27; `Never, to his knowledge.&#x27; `He doesn&#x27;t, then, know the name of his former owner?&#x27; `Has heard generally that he belonged to Mr. Hood, of Momberah; but does not know it of his own knowledge.&#x27; `Has he ever seen, or does he know either of the prisoners?&#x27; `Knows the younger prisoner, who has been in the habit of working for him in various ways.&#x27; `When was prisoner Marston working for him last?&#x27; `He, with his brother James, who rendered his family a service he shall never forget, was working for him, after last shearing, for some months.&#x27; `Where were they working?&#x27; `At an out-station at the back of the run.&#x27; `When did they leave?&#x27; `About April or May last.&#x27; `Was it known to you in what direction they proceeded after leaving your service?&#x27; `I have no personal knowledge; I should think it improper to quote hearsay.&#x27; `Had they been settled up with for their former work?&#x27; `No, there was a balance due to them.&#x27; `To what amount?&#x27; `About twenty pounds each was owing.&#x27; `Did you not think it curious that ordinary labourers should leave so large a sum in your hands?&#x27; `It struck me as unusual, but I did not attach much weight to the circumstance.  I thought they would come back and ask for it before the next shearing.  I am heartily sorry that they did not do so, and regret still more deeply that two young men worthy of a better fate should have been arraigned on such a charge.&#x27; `One moment, Mr. Falkland,&#x27; says our counsel, as they call them, and a first-rate counsellor ours was.  If we&#x27;d been as innocent as two schoolgirls he couldn&#x27;t have done more for us. `Did the prisoner Marston work well and conduct himself properly while in your employ?&#x27; `No man better,&#x27; says Mr. Falkland, looking over to me with that pitying kind of look in his eyes as made me feel what a fool and rogue I&#x27;d been ten times worse than anything else. `No man better; he and his brother were in many respects, according to my overseer&#x27;s report, the most hard-working and best-conducted labourers in the establishment.&#x27; Chapter 18 Mr. Runnimall, the auctioneer, swore that the older prisoner placed certain cattle in his hands, to arrive, for sale in the usual way, stating that his name was Mr. Charles Carisforth, and that he had several stations in other colonies.  Had no reason for doubting him. Prisoner was then very well dressed, was gentlemanly in his manners, and came to his office with a young gentleman of property whom he knew well. The cattle were sold in the usual way for rather high prices, as the market was good.  The proceeds in cash were paid over to the prisoner, whom he now knew by the name of Starlight.  He accounted for there being an unusual number of brands by saying publicly at the sale that the station had been used as a depot for other runs of his, and the remainder lots of store cattle kept there. He had seen a short-horn bull outside of the court this day branded `J-E&#x27; on the shoulder.  He identified him as one of the cattle placed in his hands for sale by the prisoner Starlight. He sold and delivered him according to instructions.  He subsequently handed over the proceeds to the said prisoner.  He included the purchase money in a cheque given for the bull and other cattle sold on that day. He could swear positively to the bull; he was a remarkable animal. He had not the slightest doubt as to his identity. `Had he seen the prisoner Marston when the cattle were sold now alleged to belong to Mr. Hood?&#x27; `Yes; he was confident that prisoner was there with some other men whom he (witness) did not particularly remark.  He helped to draft the cattle, and to put them in pens on the morning of the sale.&#x27; `Was he prepared to swear that prisoner Marston was not a hired servant of prisoner Starlight?&#x27; `No; he could not swear.  He had no way of knowing what the relations were between the two.  They were both in the robbery; he could see that.&#x27; `How could you see that?&#x27; said our lawyer.  `Have you never seen a paid stockman do all that you saw prisoner Marston do?&#x27; `Well, I have; but somehow I fancy this man was different.&#x27; `We have nothing to do with your fancies, sir,&#x27; says our man, mighty hot, as he turns upon him; `you are here to give evidence as to facts, not as to what you fancy.  Have you any other grounds for connecting prisoner Marston with the robbery in question?&#x27; `No, he had not.&#x27; `You can go down, sir, and I only wish you may live to experience some of the feelings which fill the breasts of persons who are unjustly convicted.&#x27; .    .    .    .    . This about ended the trial.  There was quite enough proved for a moderate dose of transportation.  A quiet, oldish-looking man got up now and came forward to the witness-box.  I didn&#x27;t know who he was; but Starlight nodded to him quite pleasant.  He had a short, close-trimmed beard, and was one of those nothing-particular-looking old chaps. I&#x27;m blessed if I could have told what he was.  He might have been a merchant, or a squatter, or a head clerk, or a wine merchant, or a broker, or lived in the town, or lived in the country; any of half-a-dozen trades would suit him.  The only thing that was out of the common was his eyes. They had a sort of curious way of looking at you, as if he wondered whether you was speaking true, and yet seein&#x27; nothing and tellin&#x27; nothing. He regular took in Starlight (he told me afterwards) by always talking about the China Seas; he&#x27;d been there, it seems; he&#x27;d been everywhere; he&#x27;d last come from America; he didn&#x27;t say he&#x27;d gone there to collar a clerk that had run off with two or three thousand pounds, and to be ready to meet him as he stepped ashore. Anyhow he&#x27;d watched Starlight in Canterbury when he was riding and flashing about, and had put such a lot of things together that he took a passage in the same boat with him to Melbourne. Why didn&#x27;t he arrest him in New Zealand?  Because he wasn&#x27;t sure of his man. It was from something Starlight let out on board ship.  He told me himself afterwards that he made sure of his being the man he wanted; so he steps into the witness-box, very quiet and respectable-looking, with his white waistcoat and silk coat -- it was hot enough to fry beefsteaks on the roof of the courthouse that day -- and looks about him. The Crown Prosecutor begins with him as civil as you please. `My name is Stephen Stillbrook.  I am a sergeant of detective police in the service of the Government of New South Wales. From information received, I proceeded to Canterbury, in New Zealand, about the month of September last.  I saw there the older prisoner, who was living at a first-class hotel in Christchurch. He was moving in good society, and was apparently possessed of ample means. He frequently gave expensive entertainments, which were attended by the leading inhabitants and high officials of the place. I myself obtained an introduction to him, and partook of his hospitality on several occasions.  I attempted to draw him out in conversation about New South Wales; but he was cautious, and gave me to understand that he had been engaged in large squatting transactions in another colony. From his general bearing and from the character of his associates, I came to the belief that he was not the individual named in the warrant, and determined to return to Sydney.  I was informed that he had taken his passage to Melbourne in a mail steamer.  From something which I one day heard his half-caste servant say, who, being intoxicated, was speaking carelessly, I determined to accompany them to Melbourne. My suspicions were confirmed on the voyage.  As we went ashore at the pier at Sandridge I accosted him.  I said, &quot;I arrest you on suspicion of having stolen a herd of cattle, the property of Walter Hood, of Momberah.&quot; Prisoner was very cool and polite, just as any other gentleman would be, and asked me if I did not think I&#x27;d made a most ridiculous mistake. The other passengers began to laugh, as if it was the best joke in the world. Starlight never moved a muscle.  I&#x27;ve seen a good many cool hands in my time, but I never met any one like him.  I had given notice to one of the Melbourne police as he came aboard, and he arrested the half-caste, known as Warrigal.  I produced a warrant, the one now before the court, which is signed by a magistrate of the territory of New South Wales.&#x27; The witnessing part was all over.  It took the best part of the day, and there we were all the time standing up in the dock, with the court crammed with people staring at us.  I don&#x27;t say that it felt as bad as it might have done nigh home.  Most of the Nomah people looked upon fellows stealing cattle or horses, in small lots or big, just like most people look at boys stealing fruit out of an orchard, or as they used to talk of smugglers on the English coast, as I&#x27;ve heard father tell of.  Any man might take a turn at that sort of thing, now and then, and not be such a bad chap after all. It was the duty of the police to catch him.  If they caught him, well and good, it was so much the worse for him; if they didn&#x27;t, that was their look-out.  It wasn&#x27;t anybody else&#x27;s business anyhow. And a man that wasn&#x27;t caught, or that got turned up at his trial, was about as good as the general run of people; and there was no reason for any one to look shy at him. After the witnesses had said all they knew our lawyer got up and made a stunning speech.  He made us out such first-rate chaps that it looked as if we ought to get off flying.  He blew up the squatters in a general way for taking all the country, and not giving the poor man a chance -- for neglecting their immense herds of cattle and suffering them to roam all over the country, putting temptation in the way of poor people, and causing confusion and recklessness of all kinds.  Some of these cattle are never seen from the time they are branded till they are mustered, every two or three years apparently.  They stray away hundreds of miles -- probably a thousand -- who is to know?  Possibly they are sold. It was admitted by the prosecutor that he had sold 10,000 head of cattle during the last six years, and none had been rebranded to his knowledge. What means had he of knowing whether these cattle that so much was said about had not been legally sold before?  It was a most monstrous thing that men like his clients -- men who were an honour to the land they lived in -- should be dragged up to the very centre of the continent upon a paltry charge like this -- a charge which rested upon the flimsiest evidence it had ever been his good fortune to demolish. With regard to the so-called imported bull the case against his clients was apparently stronger, but he placed no reliance upon the statements of the witnesses, who averred that they knew him so thoroughly that they could not be deceived in him.  He distrusted their evidence and believed the jury would distrust it too.  The brand was as different as possible from the brand seen to have been on the beast originally. One short-horn was very like another.  He would not undertake to swear positively in any such case, and he implored the jury, as men of the world, as men of experience in all transactions relating to stock (here some of the people in the court grinned) to dismiss from their minds everything of the nature of prejudice, and looking solely at the miserable, incomplete, unsatisfactory nature of the evidence, to acquit the prisoners. It sounded all very pleasant after everything before had been so rough on our feelings, and the jury looked as if they&#x27;d more than half made up their minds to let us off. Then the judge put on his glasses and began to go all over the evidence, very grave and steady like, and read bits out of the notes which he&#x27;d taken very careful all the time.  Judges don&#x27;t have such an easy time of it as some people thinks they have.  I&#x27;ve often wondered as they take so much trouble, and works away so patient trying to find out the rights and wrongs of things for people that they never saw before, and won&#x27;t see again.  However, they try to do their best, all as I&#x27;ve ever seen, and they generally get somewhere near the right and justice of things.  So the judge began and read -- went over the evidence bit by bit, and laid it all out before the jury, so as they couldn&#x27;t but see it where it told against us, and, again, where it was a bit in our favour. As for the main body of the cattle, he made out that there was strong grounds for thinking as we&#x27;d taken and sold them at Adelaide, and had the money too. The making of a stockyard at the back of Momberah was not the thing honest men would do.  But neither of us prisoners had been seen there. There was no identification of the actual cattle, branded `HOD&#x27;, alleged to have been stolen, nor could Mr. Hood swear positively that they were his cattle, had never been sold, and were a portion of his herd. It was in the nature of these cases that identification of live stock, roaming over the immense solitudes of the interior, should be difficult, occasionally impossible.  Yet he trusted that the jury would give full weight to all the circumstances which went to show a continuous possession of the animals alleged to be stolen. The persons of both prisoners had been positively sworn to by several witnesses as having been seen at the sale of the cattle referred to.  They were both remarkable-looking men, and such as if once seen would be retained in the memory of the beholder. But the most important piece of evidence (here the judge stopped and took a pinch of snuff) was that afforded by the short-horn bull, Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge -- he had been informed that was his name. That animal, in the first place, was sworn to most positively by Mr. Hood, and claimed as his property.  Other credible witnesses testified also to his identity, and corroborated the evidence of Mr. Hood in all respects; the ownership and identity of the animal are thus established beyond all doubt. Then there was the auctioneer, Mr. Runnimall, who swore that this animal had been, with other cattle, placed in his hands for sale by the older prisoner.  The bull is accordingly sold publicly by him, and in the prisoner&#x27;s presence.  He subsequently receives from the witness the price, about 270 Pounds, for which the bull was sold. The younger prisoner was there at the same time, and witnessed the sale of the bull and other cattle, giving such assistance as would lead to the conclusion that he was concerned in the transaction. He did not wish to reflect upon this or any other jury, but he could not help recalling the fact that a jury in that town once committed the unpardonable fault, the crime, he had almost said, of refusing to find a prisoner guilty against whom well confirmed evidence had been brought.  It had been his advice to the Minister for Justice, so glaring was the miscarriage of justice to which he referred, that the whole of the jurymen who had sat upon that trial should be struck off the roll.  This was accordingly done. He, the judge, was perfectly convinced in his own mind that no impropriety of this sort was likely to be committed by the intelligent, respectable jury whom he saw before him; but it was his duty to warn them that, in his opinion, they could not bring in any verdict but `Guilty&#x27; if they respected their oaths. He should leave the case confidently in their hands, again impressing upon them that they could only find one verdict if they believed the evidence. .    .    .    .    . The jury all went out.  Then another case was called on, and a fresh jury sworn in for to try it.  We sat in the dock.  The judge told Starlight he might sit down, and we waited till they came back. I really believe that waiting is the worst part of the whole thing, the bitterest part of the punishment.  I&#x27;ve seen men when they were being tried for their lives -- haven&#x27;t I done it, and gone through it myself? -- waiting there an hour -- two hours, half through the night, not knowing whether they was to be brought in guilty or not. What a hell they must have gone through in that time -- doubt and dread, hope and fear, wretchedness and despair, over and over and over again. No wonder some of &#x27;em can&#x27;t stand it, but keeps twitching and shifting and getting paler and turning faint when the jury comes back, and they think they see one thing or the other written in their faces. I&#x27;ve seen a strong man drop down like a dead body when the judge opened his mouth to pass sentence on him.  I&#x27;ve seen &#x27;em faint, too, when the foreman of the jury said `Not guilty.&#x27;  One chap, he was an innocent up-country fellow, in for his first bit of duffing, like we was once, he covered his face with his hands when he found he was let off, and cried like a child.  All sorts and kinds of different ways men takes it.  I was in court once when the judge asked a man who&#x27;d just been found guilty if he&#x27;d anything to say why he shouldn&#x27;t pass sentence of death upon him.  He&#x27;d killed a woman, cut her throat, and a regular right down cruel murder it was (only men &#x27;ll kill women and one another, too, for some causes, as long as the world lasts); and he just leaned over the dock rails, as if he&#x27;d been going to get three months, and said, cool and quiet, `No, your Honour; not as I know of.&#x27;  He&#x27;d made up his mind to it from the first, you see, and that makes all the difference.  He knew he hadn&#x27;t the ghost of a chance to get out of it, and when his time came he faced it.  I remember seeing his worst enemy come into the court, and sit and look at him then just to see how he took it, but he didn&#x27;t make the least sign. That man couldn&#x27;t have told whether he seen him or not. Starlight and I wasn&#x27;t likely to break down -- not much -- whatever the jury did or the judge said.  All the same, after an hour had passed, and we still waiting there, it began to be a sickening kind of feeling.  The day had been all taken up with the evidence and the rest of the trial; all long, dragging hours of a hot summer&#x27;s day.  The sun had been blazing away all day on the iron roof of the courthouse and the red dust of the streets, that lay inches deep for a mile all round the town.  The flies buzzed all over the courthouse, and round and round, while the lawyers talked and wrangled with each other; and still the trial went on. Witness after witness was called, and cross-examined and bullied, and confused and contradicted till he was afraid to say what he knew or what he didn&#x27;t know.  I began to think it must be some kind of performance that would go on for ever and never stop, and the day and it never could end. At last the sun came shining level with the lower window, and we knew it was getting late.  After a while the twilight began to get dimmer and grayer.  There isn&#x27;t much out there when the sun goes down. Then the judge ordered the lamps to be lighted. Just at that time the bailiff came forward. `Your Honour, the jury has agreed.&#x27;  I felt my teeth shut hard; but I made no move or sign.  I looked over at Starlight.  He yawned. He did, as I&#x27;m alive. `I wish to heaven they&#x27;d make more haste,&#x27; he said quietly; `his Honour and we are both being done out of our dinners.&#x27; I said nothing.  I was looking at the foreman&#x27;s face.  I thought I knew the word he was going to say, and that word was `Guilty.&#x27;  Sure enough I didn&#x27;t hear anything more for a bit.  I don&#x27;t mind owning that. Most men feel that way the first time.  There was a sound like rushing waters in my ears, and the courthouse and the people all swam before my eyes. The first I heard was Starlight&#x27;s voice again, just as cool and leisurely as ever.  I never heard any difference in it, and I&#x27;ve known him speak in a lot of different situations.  If you shut your eyes you couldn&#x27;t tell from the tone of his voice whether he was fighting for his life or asking you to hand him the salt.  When he said the hardest and fiercest thing -- and he could be hard and fierce -- he didn&#x27;t raise his voice; he only seemed to speak more distinct like.  His eyes were worse than his voice at such times.  There weren&#x27;t many men that liked to look back at him, much less say anything. Now he said, `That means five years of Berrima, Dick, if not seven. It&#x27;s cooler than these infernal logs, that&#x27;s one comfort.&#x27; I said nothing.  I couldn&#x27;t joke.  My throat was dry, and I felt hot and cold by turns.  I thought of the old hut by the creek, and could see mother sitting rocking herself, and crying out loud, and Aileen with a set dull look on her face as if she&#x27;d never speak or smile again.  I thought of the days, months, years that were to pass under lock and key, with irons and shame and solitude all for company. I wondered if the place where they shut up mad people was like a gaol, and why we were not sent there instead. I heard part of what the judge said, but not all -- bits here and there. The jury had brought in a most righteous verdict; just what he should have expected from the effect of the evidence upon an intelligent, well-principled Nomah jury.  (We heard afterwards that they were six to six, and then agreed to toss up how the verdict was to go.) `The crime of cattle and horse stealing had assumed gigantic proportions. Sheep, as yet, appeared to be safe; but then there were not very many within a few hundred miles of Nomah.  It appeared to him that the prisoner known as Starlight, though from old police records his real name appeared to be ----&#x27; Here he drew himself up and faced the judge in defiance.  Then like lightning he seemed to change, and said -- `Your Honour, I submit that it can answer no good purpose to disclose my alleged name.  There are others -- I do not speak for myself.&#x27; The judge stopped a bit; then hesitated.  Starlight bowed. `I do not -- a -- know whether there is any necessity to make public a name which many years since was not better known than honoured. I say the -- a -- prisoner known as Starlight has, from the evidence, taken the principal part in this nefarious transaction. It is not the first offence, as I observe from a paper I hold in my hand. The younger prisoner, Marston, has very properly been found guilty of criminal complicity with the same offence.  It may be that he has been concerned in other offences against the law, but of that we have no proof before this court.  He has not been previously convicted.  I do not offer advice to the elder criminal; his own heart and conscience, the promptings of which I assume to be dulled, not obliterated, I feel convinced, have said more to him in the way of warning, condemnation, and remorse than could the most impressive rebuke, the most solemn exhortation from a judicial bench. But to the younger man, to him whose vigorous frame has but lately attained the full development of early manhood, I feel compelled to appeal with all the weight which age and experience may lend.  I adjure him to accept the warning which the sentence I am about to pass will convey to him, to endure his confinement with submission and repentance, and to lead during his remaining years, which may be long and comparatively peaceful, the free and necessarily happy life of an honest man. The prisoner Starlight is sentenced to seven years&#x27; imprisonment; the prisoner Richard Marston to five years&#x27; imprisonment; both in Berrima Gaol.&#x27; I heard the door of the dock unclose with a snap.  We were taken out; I hardly knew how.  I walked like a man in his sleep.  `Five years, Berrima Gaol!  Berrima Gaol!&#x27; kept ringing in my ears. The day was done, the stars were out, as we moved across from the courthouse to the lock-up.  The air was fresh and cool.  The sun had gone down; so had the sun of our lives, never to rise again. Morning came.  Why did it ever come again? I thought.  What did we want but night? -- black as our hearts -- dark as our fate -- dismal as the death which likely would come quick as a living tomb, and the sooner the better. Mind you, I only felt this way the first time.  All men do, I suppose, that haven&#x27;t been born in gaols and workhouses.  Afterwards they take a more everyday view of things. `You&#x27;re young and soft, Dick,&#x27; Starlight said to me as we were rumbling along in the coach next day, with hand and leg-irons on, and a trooper opposite to us.  `Why don&#x27;t I feel like it?  My good fellow, I have felt it all before.  But if you sear your flesh or your horse&#x27;s with a red-hot iron you&#x27;ll find the flesh hard and callous ever after. My heart was seared once -- ay, twice -- and deeply, too. I have no heart now, or if I ever feel at all it&#x27;s for a horse. I wonder how old Rainbow gets on.&#x27; `You were sorry father let us come in the first time,&#x27; I said. `How do you account for that, if you&#x27;ve no heart?&#x27; `Really!  Well, listen, Richard.  Did I?  If you guillotine a man -- cut off his head, as they do in France, with an axe that falls like the monkey of a pile-driver -- the limbs quiver and stretch, and move almost naturally for a good while afterwards. I&#x27;ve seen the performance more than once.  So I suppose the internal arrangements immediately surrounding my heart must have performed some kind of instinctive motion in your case and Jim&#x27;s. By the way, where the deuce has Jim been all this time?  Clever James!&#x27; `Better ask Evans here if the police knows.  It is not for want of trying if they don&#x27;t.&#x27; `By the Lord Harry, no!&#x27; said the trooper, a young man who saw no reason not to be sociable.  `It&#x27;s the most surprisin&#x27; thing out where he&#x27;s got to. They&#x27;ve been all round him, reg&#x27;lar cordon-like, and he must have disappeared into the earth or gone up in a balloon to get away.&#x27; Chapter 19 It took us a week&#x27;s travelling or more to get to Berrima. Sometimes we were all night in the coach as well as all day. There were other passengers in the coach with us.  Two or three bushmen, a station overseer with his wife and daughter, a Chinaman, and a lunatic that had come from Nomah, too.  I think it&#x27;s rough on the public to pack madmen and convicts in irons in the same coach with them. But it saves the Government a good deal of money, and the people don&#x27;t seem to care.  They stand it, anyhow. We would have made a bolt of it if we&#x27;d had a chance, but we never had, night nor day, not half a one.  The police were civil, but they never left us, and slept by us at night.  That is, one watched while the other slept. We began to sleep soundly ourselves and to have a better appetite. Going through the fresh air had something to do with it, I daresay. And then there was no anxiety.  We had played for a big stake and lost. Now we had to pay and make the best of it.  It was the tenth day (there were no railways then to shorten the journey) when we drove up to the big gate and looked at the high walls and dark, heavy lines of Berrima Gaol, the largest, the most severe, the most dreaded of all the prisons in New South Wales.  It had leaked out the day before, somehow, that the famous Starlight and the other prisoner in the great Momberah cattle robbery were to be brought in this particular day.  There was a fair-sized crowd gathered as we were helped down from the coach.  At the side of the crowd was a small mob of blacks with their dogs, spears, &#x27;possum rugs and all complete. They and their gins and pickaninnies appeared to take great notice of the whole thing.  One tallish gin, darker than the others, and with her hair tucked under an old bonnet, wrapped her &#x27;possum cloak closely round her shoulders and pushed up close to us.  She looked hard at Starlight, who appeared not to see her.  As she drew back some one staggered against her; an angry scowl passed over her face, so savage and bitter that I felt quite astonished.  I should have been astonished, I mean, if I had not been able, by that very change, to know again the restless eyes and grim set mouth of Warrigal. It was only a look, and he was gone.  The lock creaked, the great iron door swung back, and we were swallowed up in a tomb -- a stone vault where men are none the less buried because they have separate cells.  They do not live, though they appear to be alive; they move, and sometimes speak, and appear to hear words.  Some have to be sent away and buried outside. They have been dead a long time, but have not seemed to want putting in the ground.  That makes no change in them -- not much, I mean. If they sleep it&#x27;s all right; if they don&#x27;t sleep anything must be happiness after the life they have escaped.  `Happy are the dead&#x27; is written on all prison walls. What I suffered in that first time no tongue can tell.  I can&#x27;t bear now to think of it and put it down.  The solitary part of it was enough to drive any man mad that had been used to a free life.  Day after day, night after night, the same and the same and the same over again. Then the dark cells.  I got into them for a bit.  I wasn&#x27;t always as cool as I might be -- more times that mad with myself that I could have smashed my own skull against the wall, let alone any one else&#x27;s. There was one of the warders I took a dislike to from the first, and he to me, I don&#x27;t doubt.  I thought he was rough and surly.  He thought I wanted to have my own way, and he made it up to take it out of me, and run me every way he could.  We had a goodish spell of fighting over it, but he gave in at last.  Not but what I&#x27;d had a lot to bear, and took a deal of punishment before he jacked up.  I needn&#x27;t have had it. It was all my own obstinacy and a sort of dogged feeling that made me feel I couldn&#x27;t give in.  I believe it done me good, though.  I do really think I should have gone mad else, thinking of the dreadful long months and years that lay before me without a chance of getting out. Sometimes I&#x27;d take a low fit and refuse my food, and very near give up living altogether.  The least bit more, and I&#x27;d have died outright. One day there was a party of ladies and gentlemen came to be shown over the gaol.  There was a lot of us passing into the exercise yard. I happened to look up for a minute, and saw one of the ladies looking steadily at us, and oh! what a pitying look there was in her face. In a moment I saw it was Miss Falkland, and, by the change that came into her face, that she knew me again, altered as I was.  I wondered how she could have known me.  I was a different-looking chap from when she had seen me last.  With a beastly yellow-gray suit of prison clothes, his face scraped smooth every day, like a fresh-killed pig, and the look of a free man gone out of his face for ever -- how any woman, gentle or simple, ever can know a man in gaol beats me. Whether or no, she knew me.  I suppose she saw the likeness to Jim, and she told him, true enough, she&#x27;d never forget him nor what he&#x27;d done for her. I just looked at her, and turned my head away.  I felt as if I&#x27;d make a fool of myself if I didn&#x27;t.  All the depth down that I&#x27;d fallen since I was shearing there at Boree rushed into my mind at once. I nearly fell down, I know.  I was pretty weak and low then; I&#x27;d only just come out of the doctor&#x27;s hands. I was passing along with the rest of the mob.  I heard her voice quite clear and firm, but soft and sweet, too.  How sweet it sounded to me then! `I wish to speak a few words to the third prisoner in the line -- the tall one.  Can I do so, Captain Wharton?&#x27; `Oh! certainly, Miss Falkland,&#x27; said the old gentleman, who had brought them all in to look at the wonderful neat garden, and the baths, and the hospital, and the unnatural washed-up, swept-up barracks that make the cleanest gaol feel worse than the roughest hut.  He was the visiting magistrate, and took a deal of interest in the place, and believed he knew all the prisoners like a book.  `Oh! certainly, my dear young lady. Is Richard Marston an acquaintance of yours?&#x27; `He and his brother worked for my father at Boree,&#x27; she said, quite stately. `His brother saved my life.&#x27; I was called back by the warder.  Miss Falkland stepped out before them all, and shook hands with me.  Yes, SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME, and the tears came into her eyes as she did so. If anything could have given a man&#x27;s heart a turn the right way that would have done it.  I felt again as if some one cared for me in the world, as if I had a soul worth saving.  And people may talk as they like, but when a man has the notion that everybody has given him up as a bad job, and has dropped troubling themselves about him, he gets worse and worse, and meets the devil half-way. She said -- `Richard Marston, I cannot tell how grieved I am to see you here. Both papa and I were so sorry to hear all about those Momberah cattle.&#x27; I stammered out something or other, I hardly knew what. She looked at me again with her great beautiful eyes like a wondering child. `Is your brother here too?&#x27; `No, Miss Falkland,&#x27; I said.  `They&#x27;ve never caught Jim yet, and, what&#x27;s more, I don&#x27;t think they will.  He jumped on a bare-backed horse without saddle or bridle, and got clear.&#x27; She looked as if she was going to smile, but she didn&#x27;t. I saw her eyes sparkle, though, and she said softly -- `Poor Jim! so he got away; I am glad of that.  What a wonderful rider he was! But I suppose he will be caught some day.  Oh, I do so wish I could say anything that would make you repent of what you have done, and try and do better by and by.  Papa says you have a long life before you most likely, and might do so much with it yet.  You will try, for my sake; won&#x27;t you now?&#x27; `I&#x27;ll do what I can, miss,&#x27; I said; `and if I ever see Jim again I&#x27;ll tell him of your kindness.&#x27; `Thank you, and good-bye,&#x27; she said, and she held out her hand again and took mine.  I walked away, but I couldn&#x27;t help holding my head higher, and feeling a different man, somehow. I ain&#x27;t much of a religious chap, wasn&#x27;t then, and I am farther off it now than ever, but I&#x27;ve heard a power of the Bible and all that read in my time; and when the parson read out next Sunday about Jesus Christ dying for men, and wanting to have their souls saved, I felt as if I could have a show of understanding it better than I ever did before. If I&#x27;d been a Catholic, like Aileen and mother, I should have settled what the Virgin Mary was like when she was alive, and never said a prayer to her without thinking of Miss Falkland. While I was dying one week and getting over it another, and going through all the misery every fellow has in his first year of gaol, Starlight was just his old self all the time.  He took it quite easy, never gave any one trouble, and there wasn&#x27;t a soul in the place that wouldn&#x27;t have done anything for him.  The visiting magistrate thought his a most interesting case, and believed in his heart that he had been the means of turning him from the error of his ways -- he and the chaplain between them, anyhow.  He even helped him to be allowed to be kept a little separate from the other prisoners (lest they should contaminate him!), and in lots of ways made his life a bit easier to him. It was reported about that it was not the first time that he had been in a gaol.  That he&#x27;d `done time&#x27;, as they call it, in another colony. He might or he might not.  He never said.  And he wasn&#x27;t the man, with all his soft ways, you&#x27;d like to ask about such a thing. By the look of it you wouldn&#x27;t think he cared about it a bit. He took it very easy, read half his time, and had no sign about him that he wasn&#x27;t perfectly satisfied.  He intended when he got out to lead a new life, the chaplain said, and be the means of keeping other men right and straight. One day we had a chance of a word together.  He got the soft side of the chaplain, who thought he wanted to convert me and take me out of my sulky and obstinate state of mind.  He took good care that we were not overheard or watched, and then said rather loud, for fear of accidents -- `Well, Richard, how are you feeling?  I am happy to say that I have been led to think seriously of my former evil ways, and I have made up my mind, besides, to use every effort in my power to clear out of this infernal collection of tombstones when the moon gets dark again, about the end of this month.&#x27; `How have you taken to become religious?&#x27; I said.  `Are you quite sure that what you say can be depended upon?  And when did you get the good news?&#x27; `I have had many doubts in my mind for a long time,&#x27; he said, `and have watched and prayed long, and listened for the word that was to come; and the end of it is that I have at length heard the news that makes the soul rejoice, even for the heathen, the boy Warrigal, who will be waiting outside these walls with fresh horses. I must now leave you, my dear Richard,&#x27; he said; `and I hope my words will have made an impression on you.  When I have more to communicate for your good I will ask leave to return.&#x27; After I heard this news I began to live again.  Was there a chance of our getting out of this terrible tomb into the free air and sunshine once more?  However it was to be managed I could not make out. I trusted mostly to Starlight, who seemed to know everything, and to be quite easy about the way it would all turn out. All that I could get out of him afterwards was that on a certain night a man would be waiting with two horses outside of the gaol wall; and that if we had the luck to get out safe, and he thought we should, we would be on their backs in three minutes, and all the police in New South Wales wouldn&#x27;t catch us once we got five minutes&#x27; start. This was all very well if it came out right; but there was an awful lot to be done before we were even near it.  The more I began to think over it the worse it looked; sometimes I quite lost heart, and believed we should never have half a chance of carrying out our plan. We knew from the other prisoners that men had tried from time to time to get away.  Three had been caught.  One had been shot dead -- he was lucky -- another had fallen off the wall and broke his leg. Two had got clear off, and had never been heard of since. We were all locked up in our cells every evening, and at five o&#x27;clock, too. We didn&#x27;t get out till six in the morning; a long, long time. Cold enough in the bitter winter weather, that had then come in, and a long, weary, wretched time to wait and watch for daylight. Well, first of all, we had to get the cell door open. That was the easiest part of the lot.  There&#x27;s always men in a big gaol that all kinds of keys and locks are like large print to. They can make most locks fly open like magic; what&#x27;s more, they&#x27;re willing to do it for anybody else, or show them how. It keeps their hand in; they have a pleasure in spiting those above them whenever they can do it. The getting out of the cell was easy enough, but there was a lot of danger after you had got out.  A passage to cross, where the warder, with his rifle, walked up and down every half-hour all night; then a big courtyard; then another smaller door in the wall; then the outer yard for those prisoners who are allowed to work at stone-cutting or out-of-door trades. After all this there was the great outer wall to climb up and drop down from on the other side. We managed to pick our night well.  A French convict, who liked that sort of thing, gave me the means of undoing the cell door. It was three o&#x27;clock in the morning, when in winter most people are sleepy that haven&#x27;t much on their minds.  The warder that came down the passage wasn&#x27;t likely to be asleep, but he might have made it up in his mind that all was right, and not taken as much notice as usual. This was what we trusted to.  Besides, we had got a few five-pound notes smuggled in to us; and though I wouldn&#x27;t say that we were able to bribe any of the gaolers, we didn&#x27;t do ourselves any harm in one or two little ways by throwing a few sovereigns about. I did just as I was told by the Frenchman, and I opened the cell door as easy as a wooden latch.  I had to shut it again for fear the warder would see it and begin to search and sound the alarm at once. Just as I&#x27;d done this he came down the passage.  I had only time to crouch down in the shadow when he passed me.  That was right; now he would not be back for half-an-hour. I crawled and scrambled, and crept along like a snake until little by little I got to the gate through the last wall but one.  The lock here was not so easy as the cell door, and took me more time. While I stood there I was in a regular tremble with fright, thinking some one might come up, and all my chance would be gone. After a bit the lock gave way, and I found myself in the outer yard. I went over to the wall and crept along it till I came to one of the angles. There I was to meet Starlight.  He was not there, and he was to bring some spikes to climb the wall with, and a rope, with two or three other things. I waited and waited for half-an-hour, which seemed a month.  What was I to do if he didn&#x27;t come?  I could not climb the thirty-foot wall by myself. One had to be cautious, too, for there were towers at short distances along the wall; in every one of these a warder, armed with a rifle, which he was sure to empty at any one that looked like gaol-breaking. I began to think he had made a mistake in the night.  Then, that he had been discovered and caught the moment he tried to get out of the cell. I was sure to be caught if he was prevented from coming; and shutting up would be harder to bear than ever. Then I heard a man&#x27;s step coming up softly; I knew it was Starlight. I knew his step, and thought I would always tell it from a thousand other men&#x27;s; it was so light and firm, so quick and free. Even in a prison it was different from other men&#x27;s; and I remembered everything he had ever said about walking and running, both of which he was wonderfully good at. He was just as cool as ever.  `All right, Dick; take these spikes.&#x27; He had half-a-dozen stout bits of iron; how ever he got them I know no more than the dead, but there they were, and a light strong coil of rope as well. I knew what the spikes were for, of course; to drive into the wall between the stones and climb up by.  With the rope we were to drop ourselves over the wall the other side.  It was thirty feet high -- no fool of a drop. More than one man had been picked up disabled at the bottom of it. He had a short stout piece of iron that did to hammer the spikes in; and that had to be done very soft and quiet, you may be sure. It took a long time.  I thought the night would be over and the daylight come before it was all done; it was so slow.  I could hear the tick-tack of his iron every time he knocked one of the spikes in. Of course he went higher every time.  They were just far enough apart for a man to get his foot on from one to another.  As he went up he had one end of the coil of the rope round his wrist. When he got to the top he was to draw it up to fasten to the top spike, and lower himself down by it to the ground on the other side. At last I felt him pull hard on the rope.  I held it, and put my foot on the first spike.  I don&#x27;t know that I should have found it so very easy in the dark to get up by the spikes -- it was almost blackfellows&#x27; work, when they put their big toe into a notch cut in the smooth stem of a gum tree that runs a hundred feet without a branch, and climb up the outside of it -- but Jim and I had often practised this sort of climbing when we were boys, and were both pretty good at it.  As for Starlight, he had been to sea when he was young, and could climb like a cat. When I got to the top I could just see his head above the wall. The rope was fastened well to the top spike, which was driven almost to the head into the wall.  Directly he saw me, he began to lower himself down the rope, and was out of sight in a minute. I wasn&#x27;t long after him, you may be sure.  In my hurry I let the rope slip through my hands so fast they were sore for a week afterwards. But I didn&#x27;t feel it then.  I should hardly have felt it if I had cut them in two, for as my feet touched the ground in the darkness I heard the stamp of a horse&#x27;s hoof and the jingle of a bit -- not much of a sound, but it went through my heart like a knife, along with the thought that I was a free man once more; that is, free in a manner of speaking.  I knew we couldn&#x27;t be taken then, bar accidents, and I felt ready to ride through a regiment of soldiers. As I stood up a man caught my hand and gave it a squeeze as if he&#x27;d have crushed my fingers in.  I knew it was Jim.  Of course, I&#x27;d expected him to be there, but wasn&#x27;t sure if he&#x27;d be able to work it. We didn&#x27;t speak, but started to walk over to where two horses were standing, with a man holding &#x27;em.  It was pretty dark, but I could see Rainbow&#x27;s star -- just in his forehead it was -- the only white he had about him. Of course it was Warrigal that was holding them. `We must double-bank my horse,&#x27; whispers Jim, `for a mile or two, till we&#x27;re clear of the place; we didn&#x27;t want to bring a lot of horses about.&#x27; He jumped up, and I mounted behind him.  Starlight was on Rainbow in a second. The half-caste disappeared, he was going to keep dark for a few days and send us the news.  Jim&#x27;s horse went off as if he had only ten stone on his back instead of pretty nigh five-and-twenty. And we were free! Lord God! to think that men can be such fools as ever to do anything of their own free will and guiding that puts their liberty in danger when there&#x27;s such a world outside of a gaol wall -- such a heaven on earth as long as a man&#x27;s young and strong, and has all the feelings of a free man, in a country like this. Would I do the first crooked thing again if I had my life to live over again, and knew a hundredth part of what I know now?  Would I put my hand in the fire out of laziness or greed? or sit still and let a snake sting me, knowing I should be dead in twelve hours?  Any man&#x27;s fool enough to do one that&#x27;ll do the other.  Men and women don&#x27;t know this in time, that&#x27;s the worst of it; they won&#x27;t believe half they&#x27;re told by them that do know and wish &#x27;em well.  They run on heedless and obstinate, too proud to take advice, till they do as we did.  The world&#x27;s always been the same, I suppose, and will to the end.  Most of the books say so, anyway. Chapter 20 What a different feel from prison air the fresh night breeze had as we swept along a lonely outside track!  The stars were out, though the sky was cloudy now and then, and the big forest trees looked strange in the broken light.  It was so long since I&#x27;d seen any. I felt as if I was going to a new world.  None of us spoke for a bit. Jim pulled up at a small hut by the roadside; it looked like a farm, but there was not much show of crops or anything about the place. There was a tumble-down old barn, with a strong door to it, and a padlock; it seemed the only building that there was any care taken about. A man opened the door of the hut and looked out. `Look sharp,&#x27; says Jim.  `Is the horse all right and fit?&#x27; `Fit enough to go for the Hawkesbury Guineas.  I was up and fed him three hours ago.  He&#x27;s ----&#x27; `Bring him out, and be hanged to you,&#x27; says Jim; `we&#x27;ve no time for chat.&#x27; The man went straight to the barn, and after a minute or two brought out a horse -- the same I&#x27;d ridden from Gippsland, saddled and bridled, and ready to jump out of his skin. Jim leaned forward and put something into his hand, which pleased him, for he held my rein and stirrup, and then said -- `Good luck and a long reign to you,&#x27; as we rode away. All this time Starlight had sat on his horse in the shade of a tree a good bit away.  When we started he rode alongside of us. We were soon in a pretty fair hand-gallop, and we kept it up. All our horses were good, and we bowled along as if we were going to ride for a week without stopping. What a ride it was!  It was a grand night, anyway I thought so. I blessed the stars, I know.  Mile after mile, and still the horses seemed to go all the fresher the farther they went.  I felt I could ride on that way for ever.  As the horses pulled and snorted and snatched at their bridles I felt as happy as ever I did in my life. Mile after mile it was all the same; we could hear Rainbow snorting from time to time and see his star move as he tossed up his head. We had many a night ride after together, but that was the best. We had laid it out to make for a place we knew not so far from home. We dursn&#x27;t go there straight, of course, but nigh enough to make a dart to it whenever we had word that the coast was clear. We knew directly we were missed the whole countryside would be turned out looking for us, and that every trooper within a hundred miles would be hoping for promotion in case he was lucky enough to drop on either of the Marstons or the notorious Starlight.  His name had been pretty well in every one&#x27;s mouth before, and would be a little more before they were done with him. It was too far to ride to the Hollow in a day, but Jim had got a place ready for us to keep dark in for a bit, in case we got clear off. There&#x27;s never any great trouble in us chaps finding a home for a week or two, and somebody to help us on our way as long as we&#x27;ve the notes to chuck about. All the worse in the long run.  We rode hardish (some people would have called it a hand-gallop) most of the way; up hill and down, across the rocky creeks, through thick timber.  More than one river we had to swim.  It was mountain water, and Starlight cursed and swore, and said he would catch his death of cold.  Then we all laughed; it was the first time we&#x27;d done that since we were out. My heart was too full to talk, much less laugh, with the thought of being out of that cursed prison and on my own horse again, with the free bush breeze filling my breast, and the free forest I&#x27;d lived in all my life once more around me.  I felt like a king, and as for what might come afterwards I had no more thought than a schoolboy has of his next year&#x27;s lessons at the beginning of his holidays.  It might come now. As I took the old horse by the head and raced him down the mountain side, I felt I was living again and might call myself a man once more. The sun was just rising, the morning was misty and drizzling; the long sour-grass, the branches of the scrubby trees, everything we touched and saw was dripping with the night dew, as we rode up a `gap&#x27; between two stiffish hills.  We had been riding all night from track to track, sometimes steering by guesswork. Jim seemed to know the country in a general way, and he told us father and he had been about there a good deal lately, cattle-dealing and so on.  For the last hour or so we had been on a pretty fair beaten road, though there wasn&#x27;t much traffic on it. It was one of the old mail tracks once, but new coach lines had knocked away all the traffic.  Some of the old inns had been good big houses, well kept and looked after then.  Now lots of them were empty, with broken windows and everything in ruins; others were just good enough to let to people who would live in them, and make a living by cultivating a bit and selling grog on the sly.  Where we pulled up was one of these places, and the people were just what you might expect. First of all there was the man of the house, Jonathan Barnes, a tall, slouching, flash-looking native; he&#x27;d been a little in the horse-racing line, a little in the prize-fighting line -- enough to have his nose broken, and was fond of talking about `pugs&#x27; as he&#x27;d known intimate -- a little in the farming and carrying line, a little in every line that meant a good deal of gassing, drinking, and idling, and mighty little hard work.  He&#x27;d a decent, industrious little wife, about forty times too good for him, and the girls, Bella and Maddie, worked well, or else he&#x27;d have been walking about the country with a swag on his back.  They kept him and the house too, like many another man, and he took all the credit of it, and ordered them about as if he&#x27;d been the best and straightest man in the land. If he made a few pounds now and then he&#x27;d drop it on a horse-race before he&#x27;d had it a week.  They were glad enough to see us, anyhow, and made us comfortable, after a fashion.  Jim had brought fresh clothes, and both of us had stopped on the road and rigged ourselves out, so that we didn&#x27;t look so queer as men just out of the jug mostly do, with their close-shaved faces, cropped heads, and prison clothes. Starlight had brought a false moustache with him, which he stuck on, so that he looked as much like a swell as ever.  Warrigal had handed him a small parcel, which he brought with him, just as we started; and, with a ring on his finger, some notes and gold in his pocket, he ate his breakfast, and chatted away with the girls as if he&#x27;d only ridden out for a day to have a look at the country. Our horses were put in the stable and well looked to, you may be sure. The man that straps a cross cove&#x27;s horse don&#x27;t go short of his half-crown -- two or three of them, maybe.  We made a first-rate breakfast of it; what with the cold and the wet and not being used to riding lately, we were pretty hungry, and tired too.  We intended to camp there that day, and be off again as soon as it was dark. Of course we ran a bit of a risk, but not as bad as we should by riding in broad daylight.  The hills on the south were wild and rangy enough, but there were all sorts of people about on their business in the daytime; and of course any of them would know with one look that three men, all on well-bred horses, riding right across country and not stopping to speak or make free with any one, were likely to be `on the cross&#x27; -- all the more if the police were making particular inquiries about them. We were all armed, too, now.  Jim had seen to that.  If we were caught, we intended to have a flutter for it.  We were not going back to Berrima if we knew it. So we turned in, and slept as if we were never going to wake again. We&#x27;d had a glass of grog or two, nothing to hurt, though; and the food and one thing and another made us sleep like tops. Jim was to keep a good look-out, and we didn&#x27;t take off our clothes. Our horses were kept saddled, too, with the bridles on their heads, and only the bits out of their mouths -- we could have managed without the bits at a pinch -- everything ready to be out of the house in one minute, and in saddle and off full-split the next. We were learned that trick pretty well before things came to an end. Besides that, Jonathan kept a good look-out, too, for strangers of the wrong sort.  It wasn&#x27;t a bad place in that way. There was a long stony track coming down to the house, and you could see a horseman or a carriage of any kind nearly a mile off. Then, in the old times, the timber had been cleared pretty nigh all round the place, so there was no chance of any one sneaking up unknown to people.  There couldn&#x27;t have been a better harbour for our sort, and many a jolly spree we had there afterwards.  Many a queer sight that old table in the little parlour saw years after, and the notes and gold and watches and rings and things I&#x27;ve seen the girls handling would have stunned you. But that was all to come. Well, about an hour before dark Jim wakes us up, and we both felt as right as the bank.  It took a good deal to knock either of us out of time in those days.  I looked round for a bit and then burst out laughing. `What&#x27;s that about, Dick?&#x27; says Jim, rather serious. `Blest if I didn&#x27;t think I was in the thundering old cell again,&#x27; I said. `I could have sworn I heard the bolt snap as your foot sounded in the room.&#x27; `Well, I hope we shan&#x27;t, any of us, be shopped again for a while,&#x27; says he, rather slow like.  `It&#x27;s bad work, I&#x27;m afraid, and worse to come; but we&#x27;re in it up to our neck and must see it out.  We&#x27;ll have another feed and be off at sundown.  We&#x27;ve the devil&#x27;s own ride before daylight.&#x27; `Anybody called?&#x27; says Starlight, sauntering in, washed and dressed and comfortable-looking.  `You told them we were not at home, Jim, I hope.&#x27; Jim smiled in spite of himself, though he wasn&#x27;t in a very gay humour. Poor old Jim was looking ahead a bit, I expect, and didn&#x27;t see anything much to be proud of. We had a scrumptious feed that night, beefsteaks and eggs, fresh butter and milk, things we hadn&#x27;t smelt for months. Then the girls waited on us; a good-looking pair they was too, full of larks and fun of all kinds, and not very particular what sort of jokes they laughed at.  They knew well enough, of course, where we&#x27;d come from, and what we laid by all day and travelled at night for; they thought none the worse of us for that, not they.  They&#x27;d been bred up where they&#x27;d heard all kinds of rough talk ever since they was little kiddies, and you couldn&#x27;t well put them out. They were a bit afraid of Starlight at first, though, because they seen at once that he was a swell.  Jim they knew a little of; he and father had called there a good deal the last season, and had done a little in the stock line through Jonathan Barnes. They could see I was something in the same line as Jim. So I suppose they had made it up to have a bit of fun with us that evening before we started.  They came down into the parlour where our tea was, dressed out in their best and looking very grand, as I thought, particularly as we hadn&#x27;t seen the sight of so much as a woman&#x27;s bonnet and shawl for months and months. `Well, Mr. Marston,&#x27; says the eldest girl, Bella, to Jim, `we didn&#x27;t expect you&#x27;d travel this way with friends so soon. Why didn&#x27;t you tell us, and we&#x27;d have had everything comfortable?&#x27; `Wasn&#x27;t sure about it,&#x27; says Jim, `and when you ain&#x27;t it&#x27;s safest to hold your tongue.  There&#x27;s a good many things we all do that don&#x27;t want talking about.&#x27; `I feel certain, Jim,&#x27; says Starlight, with his soft voice and pleasant smile, which no woman as I ever saw could fight against long, `that any man&#x27;s secret would be safe with Miss Bella.  I would trust her with my life freely -- not that it&#x27;s worth a great deal.&#x27; `Oh! Captain,&#x27; says poor Bella, and she began to blush quite innocent like, `you needn&#x27;t fear; there ain&#x27;t a girl from Shoalhaven to Albury that would let on which way you were heading, if they were to offer her all the money in the country.&#x27; `Not even a diamond necklace and earrings?  Think of a lovely pendant, a cross all brilliants, and a brooch to match, my dear girl.&#x27; `I wouldn&#x27;t &quot;come it&quot;, unless I could get that lovely horse of yours,&#x27; says the youngest one, Maddie; `but I&#x27;d do anything in the world to have him. He&#x27;s the greatest darling I ever saw.  Wouldn&#x27;t he look stunning with a side-saddle?  I&#x27;ve a great mind to &quot;duff&quot; him myself one of these days.&#x27; `You shall have a ride on Rainbow next time we come,&#x27; says Starlight. `I&#x27;ve sworn never to give him away or sell him, that is as long as I&#x27;m alive; but I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll do -- I&#x27;ll leave him to you in my will.&#x27; `How do you mean?&#x27; says she, quite excited like. `Why, if I drop one of these fine days -- and it&#x27;s on the cards any time -- you shall have Rainbow; but, mind now, you&#x27;re to promise me&#x27; -- here he looked very grave -- `that you&#x27;ll neither sell him, nor lend him, nor give him away as long as you live.&#x27; `Oh! you don&#x27;t mean it,&#x27; says the girl, jumping up and clapping her hands; `I&#x27;d sooner have him than anything I ever saw in the world. Oh! I&#x27;ll take such care of him.  I&#x27;ll feed him and rub him over myself; only I forgot, I&#x27;m not to have him before you&#x27;re dead. It&#x27;s rather rough on you, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27; `Not a bit,&#x27; says Starlight; `we must all go when our time comes. If anything happens to me soon he&#x27;ll be young enough to carry you for years yet.  And you&#x27;ll win all the ladies&#x27; hackney prizes at the shows.&#x27; `Oh! I couldn&#x27;t take him.&#x27; `But you must now.  I&#x27;ve promised him to you, and though I am a -- well -- an indifferent character, I never go back on my word.&#x27; `Haven&#x27;t you anything to give me, Captain?&#x27; says Bella; `you&#x27;re in such a generous mind.&#x27; `I must bring you something,&#x27; says he, `next time we call.  What shall it be? Now&#x27;s the time to ask.  I&#x27;m like the fellow in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, the slave of the ring -- your ring.&#x27;  Here he took the girl&#x27;s hand, and pretending to look at a ring she wore took it up and kissed it. It wasn&#x27;t a very ugly one neither.  `What will you have, Bella?&#x27; `I&#x27;d like a watch and chain,&#x27; she said, pretending to look a little offended. `I suppose I may as well ask for a good thing at once.&#x27; Starlight pulled out a pocket-book, and, quite solemn and regular, made a note of it. `It&#x27;s yours,&#x27; he said, `within a month.  If I cannot conveniently call and present it in person, I&#x27;ll send it by a sure hand, as they used to say; and now, Jim, boot and saddle.&#x27; The horses were out by this time; the groom was walking Rainbow up and down; he&#x27;d put a regular French-polish on his coat, and the old horse was arching his neck and chawing his bit as if he thought he was going to start for the Bargo Town Plate.  Jonathan himself was holding our two horses, but looking at him. `My word!&#x27; he said, `that&#x27;s a real picture of a horse; he&#x27;s too good for a -- well -- these roads; he ought to be in Sydney carrying some swell about and never knowing what a day&#x27;s hardship feels like. Isn&#x27;t he a regular out-and-outer to look at?  And they tell me his looks is about the worst of him.  Well -- here&#x27;s luck!&#x27;  Starlight had called for drinks all round before we started.  `Here&#x27;s luck to roads and coaches, and them as lives by &#x27;em.  They&#x27;ll miss the old coaching system some day -- mark my word.  I don&#x27;t hold with these railways they&#x27;re talkin&#x27; about -- all steam and hurry-scurry; it starves the country.&#x27; `Quite right, Jonathan,&#x27; says Starlight, throwing his leg over Rainbow, and chucking the old groom a sovereign.  `The times have never been half as good as in the old coaching days, before we ever smelt a funnel in New South Wales.  But there&#x27;s a coach or two left yet, isn&#x27;t there? and sometimes they&#x27;re worth attending to.&#x27; He bowed and smiled to the girls, and Rainbow sailed off with his beautiful easy, springy stride.  He always put me in mind of the deer I once saw at Mulgoa, near Penrith; I&#x27;d never seen any before. My word! how one of them sailed over a farmer&#x27;s wheat paddock fence. He&#x27;d been in there all night, and when he saw us coming he just up and made for the fence, and flew it like a bird. I never saw any horse have the same action, only Rainbow. You couldn&#x27;t tire him, and he was just the same the end of the day as the beginning.  If he hadn&#x27;t fallen into Starlight&#x27;s hands as a colt he&#x27;d have been a second-class racehorse, and wore out his life among touts and ringmen.  He was better where he was.  Off we went; what a ride we had that night!  Just as well we&#x27;d fed and rested before we started, else we should never have held out. All that night long we had to go, and keep going.  A deal of the road was rough -- near the Shoalhaven country, across awful deep gullies with a regular climb-up the other side, like the side of a house. Through dismal ironbark forests that looked as black by night as if all the tree-trunks were cast-iron and the leaves gun-metal. The night wasn&#x27;t as dark as it might have been, but now and again there was a storm, and the whole sky turned as black as a wolf&#x27;s throat, as father used to say.  We got a few knocks and scrapes against the trees, but, partly through the horses being pretty clever in their kind of way, and having sharpish eyesight of our own, we pulled through. It&#x27;s no use talking, sometimes I thought Jim must lose his way. Starlight told us he&#x27;d made up his mind that we were going round and round, and would fetch up about where we&#x27;d started from, and find the Moss Vale police waiting there for us. `All right, Captain,&#x27; says Jim; `don&#x27;t you flurry yourself. I&#x27;ve been along this track pretty often this last few months, and I can steer by the stars.  Look at the Southern Cross there; you keep him somewhere on the right shoulder, and you&#x27;ll pull up not so very far off that black range above old Rocky Flat.&#x27; `You&#x27;re not going to be so mad as to call at your own place, Jim, are you?&#x27; says he.  `Goring&#x27;s sure to have a greyhound or two ready to slip in case the hare makes for her old form.&#x27; `Trust old dad for that,&#x27; says Jim; `he knows Dick and you are on the grass again.  He&#x27;ll meet us before we get to the place and have fresh horses.  I&#x27;ll bet he&#x27;s got a chap or two that he can trust to smell out the traps if they are close handy the old spot. They&#x27;ll be mighty clever if they get on the blind side of father.&#x27; `Well, we must chance it, I suppose,&#x27; I said; `but we were sold once, and I&#x27;ve not much fancy for going back again.&#x27; `They&#x27;re all looking for you the other way this blessed minute, I&#x27;ll go bail,&#x27; says Jim.  `Most of the coves that bolt from Berrima takes down the southern road to get across the border into Port Philip as soon as they can work it.  They always fancy they are safer there.&#x27; `So they are in some ways; I wouldn&#x27;t mind if we were back there again,&#x27; I said.  `There&#x27;s worse places than Melbourne; but once we get to the Hollow, and that&#x27;ll be some time to-day, we may take it easy and spell for a week or two.  How they&#x27;ll wonder what the deuce has become of us.&#x27; The night was long, and that cold that Jim&#x27;s beard was froze as stiff as a board; but I sat on my horse, I declare to heaven, and never felt anything but pleasure and comfort to think I was loose again. You&#x27;ve seen a dog that&#x27;s been chained up.  Well, when he&#x27;s let loose, don&#x27;t he go chevying and racing about over everything and into everything that&#x27;s next or anigh him?  He&#x27;ll jump into water or over a fence, and turn aside for nothing.  He&#x27;s mad with joy and the feeling of being off the chain; he can&#x27;t hardly keep from barking till he&#x27;s hoarse, and rushing through and over everything till he&#x27;s winded and done up. Then he lies down with his tongue out and considers it all over. Well a man&#x27;s just like that when he&#x27;s been on the chain. He mayn&#x27;t jump about so much, though I&#x27;ve seen foreign fellows do that when their collar was unbuckled; but he feels the very same things in his heart as that dog does, you take my word for it. So, as I said, though I was sitting on a horse all that long cold winter&#x27;s night through, and had to mind my eye a bit for the road and the rocks and the hanging branches, I felt my heart swell that much and my courage rise that I didn&#x27;t care whether the night was going to turn into a snowstorm like we&#x27;d been in Kiandra way, or whether we&#x27;d have a dozen rivers to swim, like the head-waters of the M`Alister, in Gippsland, as nearly drowned the pair of us.  There I sat in my saddle like a man in a dream, lettin&#x27; my horse follow Jim&#x27;s up hill and down dale, and half the time lettin&#x27; go his head and givin&#x27; him his own road.  Everything, too, I seemed to notice and to be pleased with somehow.  Sometimes it was a rock wallaby out on the feed that we&#x27;d come close on before we saw one another, and it would jump away almost under the horse&#x27;s neck, taking two or three awful long springs and lighting square and level among the rocks after a drop-leap of a dozen feet, like a cat jumping out of a window. But the cat&#x27;s got four legs to balance on and the kangaroo only two. How they manage it and measure the distance so well, God only knows. Then an old &#x27;possum would sing out, or a black-furred flying squirrel -- pongos, the blacks call &#x27;em -- would come sailing down from the top of an ironbark tree, with all his stern sails spread, as the sailors say, and into the branches of another, looking as big as an eagle-hawk.  And then we&#x27;d come round the corner of a little creek flat and be into the middle of a mob of wild horses that had come down from the mountain to feed at night. How they&#x27;d scurry off through the scrub and up the range, where it was like the side of a house, and that full of slate-bars all upon edge that you could smell the hoofs of the brumbies as the sharp stones rasped and tore and struck sparks out of them like you do the parings in a blacksmith&#x27;s shop. Then, just as I thought daybreak was near, a great mopoke flits close over our heads without any rustling or noise, like the ghost of a bird, and begins to hoot in a big, bare, hollow tree just ahead of us.  Hoo-hoo! hoo-hoo!  The last time I heard it, it made me shiver a bit.  Now I didn&#x27;t care.  I was a desperate man that had done bad things, and was likely to do worse. But I was free of the forest again, and had a good horse under me; so I laughed at the bird and rode on. Chapter 21 Daylight broke when we were close up to the Black Range, safe enough, a little off the line but nothing to signify.  Then we hit off the track that led over the Gap and down into a little flat on a creek that ran the same way as ours did. Jim had managed for father and Warrigal to meet us somewhere near here with fresh horses.  There was an old shepherd&#x27;s hut that stood by itself almost covered with marsh-mallows and nettles.  As we came down the steep track a dog came up snuffing and searching about the grass and stones as if he&#x27;d lost something.  It was Crib. `Now we&#x27;re getting home, Jim,&#x27; says Starlight.  `It&#x27;s quite a treat to see the old scamp again.  Well, old man,&#x27; he says to the dog, `how&#x27;s all getting on at the Hollow?&#x27;  The dog came right up to Rainbow and rubbed against his fetlock, and jumped up two or three times to see if he could touch his rider.  He was almost going to bark, he seemed that glad to see him and us. Dad was sitting on a log by the hut smoking, just the same as he was before he left us last time.  He was holding two fresh horses, and we were not sorry to see them.  Horses are horses, and there wasn&#x27;t much left in our two.  We must have ridden a good eighty miles that night, and it was as bad as a hundred by daylight. Father came a step towards us as we jumped off.  By George, I was that stiff with the long ride and the cold that I nearly fell down. He&#x27;d got a bit of a fire, so we lit our pipes and had a comfortable smoke. `Well, Dick, you&#x27;re back agin, I see,&#x27; he says, pretty pleasant for him. `Glad to see you, Captain, once more.  It&#x27;s been lonesome work -- nobody but me and Jim and Warrigal, that&#x27;s like a bear with a sore head half his time.  I&#x27;d a mind to roll into him once or twice, and I should too only for his being your property like.&#x27; `Thank you, Ben, I&#x27;ll knock his head off myself as soon as we get settled a bit.  Warrigal&#x27;s not a bad boy, but a good deal like a Rocky Mountain mule; he&#x27;s no good unless he&#x27;s knocked down about once a month or so, only he doesn&#x27;t like any one but me to do it.&#x27; `You&#x27;ll see him about a mile on,&#x27; says father.  `He told me he&#x27;d be behind the big rock where the tree grows -- on the left of the road.  He said he&#x27;d get you a fresh horse, so as he could take Rainbow back to the Hollow the long way round.&#x27; Sure enough after we&#x27;d just got well on the road again Warrigal comes quietly out from behind a big granite boulder and shows himself. He was riding Bilbah, and leading a well-bred, good-looking chestnut. He was one of the young ones out of the Hollow.  He&#x27;d broken him and got him quiet.  I remembered when I was there first spotting him as a yearling.  I knew the blaze down his face and his three white legs. Warrigal jumps off Bilbah and throws down the bridle. Then he leads the chestnut up to where Starlight was standing smoking, and throws himself down at his feet, bursting out crying like a child. He was just like a dog that had found his master again. He kept looking up at Starlight just like a dog does, and smiling and going on just as if he never expected to see such a good thing again as long as he lived. `Well, Warrigal,&#x27; says Starlight, very careless like, `so you&#x27;ve brought me a horse, I see.  You&#x27;ve been a very good boy. Take Rainbow round the long way into the Hollow.  Look after him, whatever you do, or I&#x27;ll murder you.  Not that he&#x27;s done, or anything near it; but had enough for one ride, poor old man.  Off with you!&#x27; He changed the saddle, and Warrigal hopped on to Bilbah, and led off Rainbow, who tossed his head, and trotted away as if he&#x27;d lots to spare, and hadn&#x27;t had twelve hours under saddle; best part without a halt or a bait. I&#x27;ve seen a few good &#x27;uns in my time, but I never saw the horse that was a patch on Rainbow, take him all round. We pushed on again, then, for ten miles, and somewhere about eight o&#x27;clock we pulled up at home -- at home.  Aileen knew we were coming, and ran out to meet us.  She threw her arms round me, and kissed and cried over me for ever so long before she took any notice of Starlight, who&#x27;d got down and was looking another way.  `Oh! my boy, my boy,&#x27; she said, `I never thought to see you again for years.  How thin you&#x27;ve got and pale, and strange looking.  You&#x27;re not like your old self at all. But you&#x27;re in the bush again now, by God&#x27;s blessing. We must hide you better next time.  I declare I begin to feel quite wicked, and as if I could fight the police myself.&#x27; `Well spoken, Miss Marston,&#x27; said Starlight, just lifting his hat and making a bit of a bow like, just as if she was a real lady; but he was the same to all women.  He treated them all alike with the same respect of manner as if they were duchesses; young or old, gentle or simple -- it made no odds to him. `We must have your assistance if we&#x27;re to do any good. Though whether it wouldn&#x27;t be more prudent on your part to cut us all dead, beginning with your father, I shouldn&#x27;t like to say.&#x27; Aileen looked at him, surprised and angry like for a second.  Then she says -- `Captain Starlight, it&#x27;s too late now; but words can never tell how I hate and despise the whole thing.  My love for Dick got the better of my reason for a bit, but I could ---- Why, how pale you look!&#x27; He was growing pale, and no mistake.  He had been ill for a bit before he left Berrima, though he wouldn&#x27;t give in, and the ride was rather too much for him, I suppose.  Anyhow, down he tumbles in a dead faint.  Aileen rushed over and lifted up his head. I got some water and dabbed it over him.  After a bit he came to. He raises himself on his elbows and looks at Aileen. Then he smiles quietly and says -- `I&#x27;m quite ashamed of myself.  I&#x27;m growing as delicate as a young lady. I hope I haven&#x27;t given you much trouble.&#x27; When he got up and walked to the verandah he quite staggered, showing he was that weak as he could hardly walk without help. `I shall be all right,&#x27; he said, `after a week&#x27;s riding again.&#x27; `And where are you going when you leave this place?&#x27; she asked. `Surely you and my brothers never can live in New South Wales after all that has passed.&#x27; `We must try, at all events, Miss Marston,&#x27; Starlight answered, raising up his head and looking proud.  `You will hear something of us before long.&#x27; We made out that there was no great chance of our being run into at the old place.  Father went on first with Crib.  He was sure to give warning in some way, best known to father himself, if there was any one about that wasn&#x27;t the right sort. So we went up and went in. Mother was inside.  I thought it was queer that she didn&#x27;t come outside. She was always quick enough about that when we came home before, day or night. When I went in I could see, when she got up from her chair, that she was weak, and looked as if she&#x27;d been ill.  She looked ever so much older, and her hair was a lot grayer than it used to be. She held out her arms and clung round my neck as if I&#x27;d been raised from the dead.  So I was in a kind of a way.  But she didn&#x27;t say much, or ask what I was going to do next.  Poor soul! she knew it couldn&#x27;t be much good anyway; and that if we were hunted before, we&#x27;d be worse hunted now. Those that hadn&#x27;t heard of our little game with the Momberah cattle would hear of our getting out of Berrima Gaol, which wasn&#x27;t done every day. We hadn&#x27;t a deal of time to spare, because we meant to start off for the Hollow that afternoon, and get there some time in the night, even if it was late.  Jim and dad knew the way in almost blindfold. Once we got there we could sleep for a week if we liked, and take it easy all roads.  So father told mother and Aileen straight that we&#x27;d come for a good comfortable meal and a rest, and we must be off again. `Oh! father, can&#x27;t Dick and Jim stop for a day?&#x27; cries out Aileen. `It does seem so hard when we haven&#x27;t seen Dick for such a while; and he shut up too all the time.&#x27; `D&#x27;ye want to have us all took the same as last time?&#x27; growls father. `Women&#x27;s never contented as I can see.  For two pins I wouldn&#x27;t have brought them this way at all.  I don&#x27;t want to be making roads from this old crib to the Hollow, only I thought you&#x27;d like one look at Dick.&#x27; `We must do what&#x27;s best, of course,&#x27; said poor Aileen; `but it&#x27;s hard -- very hard on us.  It&#x27;s mother I&#x27;m thinking of, you know. If you knew how she always wakes up in the night, and calls for Dick, and cries when she wakes up, you&#x27;d try to comfort her a bit more, father.&#x27; `Comfort her!&#x27; says dad; `why, what can I do?  Don&#x27;t I tell you if we stay about here we&#x27;re shopped as safe as anything ever was? Will that comfort her, or you either?  We&#x27;re safe today because I&#x27;ve got telegraphs on the outside that the police can&#x27;t pass without ringing the bell -- in a way of speaking.  But you see to-morrow there&#x27;ll be more than one lot here, and I want to be clean away before they come.&#x27; `You know best,&#x27; says Aileen; `but suppose they come here to-morrow morning at daylight, as they did last time, and bring a black tracker with them, won&#x27;t he be able to follow up your track when you go away to-night?&#x27; `No, he won&#x27;t; for this reason, we shall all ride different ways as soon as we leave here.  A good while before we get near the place where we all meet we shall find Warrigal on the look-out. He can take the Captain in by another track, and there&#x27;ll be only Jim and I and the old dog, the only three persons that&#x27;ll go in the near way.&#x27; `And when shall we see -- see -- any of you again?&#x27; `Somewheres about a month, I suppose, if we&#x27;ve luck.  There&#x27;s a deal belongs to that.  You&#x27;d better go and see what there is for us to eat. We&#x27;ve a long way and a rough way to go before we get to the Hollow.&#x27; Aileen was off at this, and then she set to work and laid a clean tablecloth in the sitting-room and set us down our meal -- breakfast, or whatever it was. It wasn&#x27;t so bad -- corned beef, first-rate potatoes, fresh damper, milk, butter, eggs.  Tea, of course, it&#x27;s the great drink in the bush; and although some doctors say it&#x27;s no good, what would bushmen do without it? We had no intention of stopping the whole night, though we were tempted to do so -- to have one night&#x27;s rest in the old place where we used to sleep so sound before.  It was no good thinking of anything of that kind, anyhow, for a good while to come.  What we&#x27;d got to do was to look out sharp and not be caught simple again like we was both last time. After we had our tea we sat outside the verandah, and tried to make the best of it.  Jim stayed inside with mother for a good while; she didn&#x27;t leave her chair much now, and sat knitting by the hour together. There was a great change come over her lately.  She didn&#x27;t seem to be afraid of our getting caught as she used to be, nor half as glad or sorry about anything.  It seemed like as if she&#x27;d made up her mind that everything was as bad as it could be, and past mending.  So it was; she was right enough there. The only one who was in real good heart and spirits was Starlight. He&#x27;d come round again, and talked and rattled away, and made Aileen and Jim and me laugh, in spite of everything. He said we had all fine times before us now for a year or two, any way. That was a good long time.  After that anything might happen. What it would be he neither knew nor cared.  Life was made up of short bits; sometimes it was hard luck; sometimes everything went jolly and well. We&#x27;d got our liberty again, our horses, and a place to go to, where all the police in the country would never find us. He was going in for a short life and a merry one.  He, for one, was tired of small adventures, and he was determined to make the name of Starlight a little more famous before very long. If Dick and Jim would take his advice -- the advice of a desperate, ill-fated outcast, but still staunch to his friends -- they would clear out, and leave him to sink or swim alone, or with such associates as he might pick up, whose destination would be no great matter whatever befell them.  They could go into hiding for a while -- make for Queensland and then go into the northern territory. There was new country enough there to hide all the fellows that were `wanted&#x27; in New South Wales. `But why don&#x27;t you take your own advice?&#x27; said Aileen, looking over at Starlight as he sat there quite careless and comfortable-looking, as if he&#x27;d no call to trouble his head about anything.  `Isn&#x27;t your life worth mending or saving?  Why keep on this reckless miserable career which you yourself expect to end ill?&#x27; `If you ask me, Miss Marston,&#x27; he said, `whether my life -- what is left of it -- is worth saving, I must distinctly answer that it is not.  It is like the last coin or two in the gambler&#x27;s purse, not worth troubling one&#x27;s head about.  It must be flung on the board with the rest.  It might land a reasonable stake.  But as to economising and arranging details that would surely be the greatest folly of all.&#x27; I heard Aileen sigh to herself.  She said nothing for a while; and then old Crib began to growl.  He got up and walked along the track that led up the hill.  Father stood up, too, and listened. We all did except Starlight, who appeared to think it was too much trouble, and never moved or seemed to notice. Presently the dog came walking slowly back, and coiled himself up again close to Starlight, as if he had made up his mind it didn&#x27;t matter. We could hear a horse coming along at a pretty good bat over the hard, rocky, gravelly road.  We could tell it was a single horse, and more than that, a barefooted one, coming at a hand-gallop up hill and down dale in a careless kind of manner.  This wasn&#x27;t likely to be a police trooper.  One man wouldn&#x27;t come by himself to a place like ours at night; and no trooper, if he did come, would clatter along a hard track, making row enough to be heard more than a mile off on a quiet night. `It&#x27;s all right,&#x27; says father.  `The old dog knowed him; it&#x27;s Billy the Boy. There&#x27;s something up.&#x27; Just as he spoke we saw a horseman come in sight; and he rattled down the stony track as hard as he could lick.  He pulled up just opposite the house, close by where we were standing. It was a boy about fifteen, dressed in a ragged pair of moleskin trousers, a good deal too large for him, but kept straight by a leather strap round the waist.  An old cabbage-tree hat and a blue serge shirt made up the rest of his rig.  Boots he had on, but they didn&#x27;t seem to be fellows, and one rusty spur.  His hair was like a hay-coloured mop, half-hanging over his eyes, which looked sharp enough to see through a gum tree and out at the other side. He jumped down and stood before us, while his horse&#x27;s flanks heaved up and down like a pair of bellows. `Well, what&#x27;s up?&#x27; says father. `My word, governor, you was all in great luck as I come home last night, after bein&#x27; away with them cattle to pound.  Bobby, he don&#x27;t know a p&#x27;leeceman from a wood-an&#x27;-water joey; he&#x27;d never have dropped they was comin&#x27; here unless they&#x27;d pasted up a notice on the door.&#x27; `How did you find out, Billy?&#x27; says father, `and when&#x27;ll they be here?&#x27; `Fust thing in the morning,&#x27; says the young wit, grinning all over his face. `Won&#x27;t they be jolly well sold when they rides up and plants by the yard, same as they did last time, when they took Dick.&#x27; `Which ones was they?&#x27; asks father, fillin&#x27; his pipe quite business-like, just as if he&#x27;d got days to spare. `Them two fellers from Bargo; one of &#x27;em&#x27;s a new chum -- got his hair cut short, just like Dick&#x27;s.  My word, I thought he&#x27;d been waggin&#x27; it from some o&#x27; them Gov&#x27;ment institoosh&#x27;ns.  I did raly, Dick, old man.&#x27; `You&#x27;re precious free and easy, my young friend,&#x27; says Starlight, walking over.  `I rather like you.  You have a keen sense of humour, evidently; but can&#x27;t you say how you found out that the men were her Majesty&#x27;s police officers in pursuit of us?&#x27; `You&#x27;re Cap&#x27;n Starlight, I suppose,&#x27; says the youngster, looking straight and square at him, and not a bit put out. `Well, I&#x27;ve been pretty quick coming; thirty mile inside of three hours, I&#x27;ll be bound.  I heard them talking about you.  It was Starlight this and Starlight that all the time I was going in and out of the room, pretending to look for something, and mother scolding me.&#x27; `Had they their uniform on?&#x27; I asked. `No fear.  They thought we didn&#x27;t tumble, I expect; but I seen their horses hung up outside, both shod all round; bits and irons bright. Stabled horses, too, I could swear.  Then the youngest chap -- him with the old felt hat -- walked like this.&#x27; Here he squared his shoulders, put his hands by his side, and marched up and down, looking for all the world like one of them chaps that played at soldiering in Bargo. `There&#x27;s no hiding the military air, you think, Billy?&#x27; said Starlight. `That fellow was a recruit, and had been drilled lately.&#x27; `I d&#x27;no.  Mother got &#x27;em to stay, and began to talk quite innocent-like of the bad characters there was in the country.  Ha! ha!  It was as good as a play.  Then they began to talk almost right out about Sergeant Goring having been away on a wrong scent, and how wild he was, and how he would be after Starlight&#x27;s mob to-morrow morning at daylight, and some p&#x27;leece was to meet him near Rocky Flat.  They didn&#x27;t say they was the p&#x27;leece; that was about four o&#x27;clock, and getting dark.&#x27; `How did you get the horse?&#x27; says Jim.  `He&#x27;s not one of yours, is he?&#x27; `Not he,&#x27; says the boy; `I wish I had him or the likes of him.  He belongs to old Driver.  I was just workin&#x27; it how I&#x27;d get out and catch our old moke without these chaps being fly as I was going to talligrarph, when mother says to me -- `&quot;Have you fetched in the black cow?&quot; `We ain&#x27;t got no black cow, but I knowed what she meant.  I says -- `&quot;No, I couldn&#x27;t find her.&quot; `&quot;You catch old Johnny Smoker and look for her till you do find her, if it&#x27;s ten o&#x27;clock to-night,&quot; says mother, very fierce. &quot;Your father&#x27;ll give you a fine larrupin&#x27; if he comes home and there&#x27;s that cow lost.&quot; `So off I goes and mans old Johnny, and clears out straight for here. When I came to Driver&#x27;s I runs his horses up into a yard nigh the angle of his outside paddock and collars this little &#x27;oss, and lets old Johnny go in hobbles.  My word, this cove can scratch!&#x27; `So it seems,&#x27; says Starlight; `here&#x27;s a sovereign for you, youngster. Keep your ears and eyes open; you&#x27;ll always find that good information brings a good price.  I&#x27;d advise you to keep away from Mr. Marston, sen., and people of his sort, and stick to your work, if I thought there was the least earthly chance of your doing so; but I see plainly that you&#x27;re not cut out for the industrious, steady-going line.&#x27; `Not if I know it,&#x27; said the boy; `I want to see life before I die. I&#x27;m not going to keep on milling and slaving day after day all the year round. I&#x27;ll cut it next year as sure as a gun.  I say, won&#x27;t you let me ride a bit of the way with ye?&#x27; `Not a yard,&#x27; says father, who was pretty cranky by this time; `you go home again and put that horse where you got him.  We don&#x27;t want old Driver tracking and swearing after us because you ride his horses; and keep off the road as you go back.&#x27; Billy the Boy nodded his head, and jumping into his saddle, rode off again at much about the same pace he&#x27;d come at. He was a regular reckless young devil, as bold as a two-year-old colt in a branding-yard, that&#x27;s ready to jump at anything and knock his brains out against a stockyard post, just because he&#x27;s never known any real regular hurt or danger, and can&#x27;t realise it. He was terrible cruel to horses, and would ruin a horse in less time than any man or boy I ever seen.  I always thought from the first that he&#x27;d come to a bad end.  Howsoever, he was a wonderful chap to track and ride; none could beat him at that; he was nearly as good as Warrigal in the bush.  He was as cunning as a pet dingo, and would look as stupid before any one he didn&#x27;t know, or thought was too respectable, as if he was half an idiot. But no one ever stirred within twenty or thirty miles of where he lived without our hearing about it.  Father fished him out, having paid him pretty well for some small service, and ever after that he said he could sleep in peace. We had the horses up, ready saddled and fed, by sundown, and as soon as the moon rose we made a start of it. I had time for a bit of a talk with Aileen about the Storefields, though I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to say their names at first.  I was right in thinking that Gracey had seen me led away a prisoner by the police. She came into the hut afterwards with Aileen, as soon as mother was better, and the two girls sat down beside one another and cried their eyes out, Aileen said. George Storefield had been very good, and told Aileen that, whatever happened to us or the old man, it would make no difference to him or to his feelings towards her.  She thanked him, but said she could never consent to let him disgrace himself by marrying into a family like ours. He had come over every now and then, and had seen they wanted for nothing when father and Jim were away; but she always felt her heart growing colder towards him and his prosperity while we were so low down in every way. As for Gracey, she (Aileen) believed that she was in love with me in a quiet, steady way of her own, without showing it much, but that she would be true to me, if I asked her, to the end of the world, and she was sure that she could never marry any one else as long as I lived. She was that sort of girl.  So didn&#x27;t I think I ought to do everything I could to get a better character, and try and be good enough for such a girl? She knew girls pretty well.  She didn&#x27;t think there was such another girl in the whole colony, and so on. And when we went away where were we going to hide?  I could not say about particular distances, but I told her generally that we&#x27;d keep out of harm&#x27;s way, and be careful not to be caught. We might see her and mother now and then, and by bush-telegraphs and other people we could trust should be able to send news about ourselves. `What&#x27;s the Captain going to do?&#x27; she said suddenly. `He doesn&#x27;t look able to bear up against hardship like the rest of you. What beautiful small hands he has, and his eyes are like sleeping fires.&#x27; `Oh, he&#x27;s a good deal stronger than he looks,&#x27; I said; `he&#x27;s the smartest of the lot of us, except it is dad, and I&#x27;ve heard the old man say he must knock under to him. But don&#x27;t you bother your head about him; he&#x27;s quite able to take care of himself, and the less a girl like you thinks about a man like him the better for her.&#x27; `Oh, nonsense,&#x27; she said, at the same time looking down in a half-confused sort of way.  `I&#x27;m not likely to think about him or any one else just now; but it seems such a dreadful thing to think a man like him, so clever and daring, and so handsome and gentle in his ways, should be obliged to lead such a life, hunted from place to place like -- like ----&#x27; `Like a bush-ranger, Ailie,&#x27; I said, `for that&#x27;ll be the long and short of it. You may as well know it now, we&#x27;re going to &quot;turn out&quot;.&#x27; `You don&#x27;t say that, Dick,&#x27; she said.  `Oh! surely you will never be so mad. Do you want to kill mother and me right out?  If you do, why not take a knife or an axe and do it at once?  Her you&#x27;ve been killing all along. As for me, I feel so miserable and degraded and despairing at times that but for her I could go and drown myself in the creek when I think of what the family is coming to.&#x27; `What&#x27;s the use of going on like that, Aileen?&#x27; I said roughly. `If we&#x27;re caught now, whatever we do, great or small, we&#x27;re safe for years and years in gaol.  Mayn&#x27;t we as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb?  What odds can it make?  We&#x27;ll only have bolder work than duffing cattle and faking horse-brands like a lot of miserable crawlers that are not game for anything more sporting.&#x27; `I hear, I hear,&#x27; says sister, sitting down and putting her head in her hands.  `Surely the devil has power for a season to possess himself of the souls of men, and do with them what he will. I know how obstinate you are, Dick.  Pray God you may not have poor Jim&#x27;s blood to answer for as well as your own before all is done. Good-bye.  I can&#x27;t say God bless you, knowing what I do; but may He turn your heart from all wicked ways, and keep you from worse and deadlier evil than you have committed!  Good-night. Why, oh why, didn&#x27;t we all die when we were little children!&#x27; Chapter 22 I brought it out sudden-like to Aileen before I could stop myself, but it was all true.  How we were to make the first start we couldn&#x27;t agree; but we were bound to make another big touch, and this time the police would be after us for something worth while.  Anyhow, we could take it easy at the Hollow for a bit, and settle all the ins and outs without hurrying ourselves. Our dart now was to get to the Hollow that night some time, and not to leave much of a track either.  Nobody had found out the place yet, and wasn&#x27;t going to if we knew.  It was too useful a hiding-place to give away without trouble, and we swore to take all sorts of good care to keep it secret, if it was to be done by the art of man. We went up Nulla Mountain the same way as we remembered doing when Jim and I rode to meet father that time he had the lot of weaners. We kept wide and didn&#x27;t follow on after one another so as to make a marked trail.  It was a long, dark, dreary ride.  We had to look sharp so as not to get dragged off by a breast-high bough in the thick country. There was no fetching a doctor if any one was hurt.  Father rode ahead. He knew the ins and outs of the road better than any of us, though Jim, who had lived most of his time in the Hollow after he got away from the police, was getting to know it pretty well. We were obliged to go slow mostly -- for a good deal of the track lay along the bed of a creek, full of boulders and rocks, that we had to cross ever so many times in a mile.  The sharp-edged rocks, too, overhung low enough to knock your brains out if you didn&#x27;t mind. It was far into the night when we got to the old yard.  There it stood, just as I recollect seeing it the time Jim and I and father branded the weaners.  It had only been used once or twice since. It was patched up a bit in places, but nobody seemed to have gone next or nigh it for a long time.  The grass had grown up round the sliprails; it was as strange and forsaken-looking as if it belonged to a deserted station. As we rode up a man comes out from an angle of the fence and gives a whistle. We knew, almost without looking, that it was Warrigal. He&#x27;d come there to meet Starlight and take him round some other way. Every track and short cut there was in the mountains was as easy to him as the road to George Storefield&#x27;s was to us.  Nulla Mountain was full of curious gullies and caves and places that the devil himself could hardly have run a man to ground in, unless he&#x27;d lived near it all his life as Warrigal had.  He wasn&#x27;t very free in showing them to us, but he&#x27;d have made a bridge of his own body any time to let Starlight go safe. So when they rode away together we knew he was safe whoever might be after us, and that we should see him in the Hollow some time next day. We went on for a mile or two farther; then we got off, and turned our horses loose.  The rest of the way we had to do on foot. My horse and Jim&#x27;s had got regularly broke into Rocky Flat, and we knew that they&#x27;d go home as sure as possible, not quite straight, but keeping somewhere in the right direction.  As for father he always used to keep a horse or two, trained to go home when he&#x27;d done with him.  The pony he rode to-night would just trot off, and never put his nose to the ground almost till he got wind of home. We humped our saddles and swags ourselves; a stiffish load too, but the night was cool, and we did our best.  It was no use growling. It had to be done, and the sooner the better.  It seemed a long time -- following father step by step -- before we came to the place where I thought the cattle were going to be driven over the precipice. Here we pulled up for a bit and had a smoke.  It was a queer time and a queer look-out. Three o&#x27;clock in the morning -- the stars in the sky, and it so clear that we could see Nulla Mountain rising up against it a big black lump, without sign of tree or rock; underneath the valley, one sea of mist, and we just agoing to drop into it; on the other side of the Hollow, the clear hill we called the Sugarloaf.  Everything seemed dead, silent, and solitary, and a rummier start than all, here were we -- three desperate men, driven to make ourselves a home in this lonesome, God-forsaken place!  I wasn&#x27;t very fanciful by that time, but if the devil had risen up to make a fourth amongst us I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  The place, the time, and the men seemed regularly cut out for him and his mob. We smoked our pipes out, and said nothing to each other, good or bad. Then father makes a start, and we follows him; took a goodish while, but we got down all right, and headed for the cave.  When we got there our troubles were over for a while.  Jim struck a match and had a fire going in no time; there was plenty of dry wood, of course.  Then father rolls a keg out of a hole in the wall; first-rate dark brandy it was, and we felt a sight better for a good stiff nip all round. When a man&#x27;s cold and tired, and hungry, and down on his luck as well, a good caulker of grog don&#x27;t do him no harm to speak of. It strings him up and puts him straight.  If he&#x27;s anything of a man he can stand it, and feel all the better for it; but it&#x27;s a precious sight too easy a lesson to learn, and there&#x27;s them that can&#x27;t stop, once they begin, till they&#x27;ve smothered what brains God Almighty put inside their skulls, just as if they was to bore a hole and put gunpowder in. No! they wouldn&#x27;t stop if they were sure of going to heaven straight, or to hell next minute if they put the last glass to their lips.  I&#x27;ve heard men say it, and knew they meant it.  Not the worst sort of men, either. We were none of us like that.  Not then, anyhow.  We could take or leave it, and though dad could do with his share when it was going, he always knew what he was about, and could put the peg in any time. So we had one strongish tot while the tea was boiling. There was a bag of ship biscuit; we fried some hung beef, and made a jolly good supper.  We were that tired we didn&#x27;t care to talk much, so we made up the fire last thing and rolled ourselves in our blankets; I didn&#x27;t wake till the sun had been up an hour or more. I woke first; Jim was fast asleep, but dad had been up a goodish while and got things ready for breakfast.  It was a fine, clear morning; everything looked beautiful, &#x27;specially to me that had been locked up away from this sort of thing so long.  The grass was thick and green round the cave, and right up to the big sandstone slabs of the floor, looking as if it had never been eat down very close.  No more it had. It would never have paid to have overstocked the Hollow. What cattle and horses they kept there had a fine time of it, and were always in grand condition. Opposite where we were the valley was narrow.  I could see the sandstone precipices that walled us in, a sort of yellowish, white colour, all lighted up with the rays of the morning sun, looking like gold towers against the heavy green forest timber at the foot of them. Birds were calling and whistling, and there was a little spring that fell drip, drip over a rough rock basin all covered with ferns. A little mob of horses had fed pretty close up to the camp, and would walk up to look curious-like, and then trot off with their heads and tails up.  It was a pretty enough sight that met my eyes on waking.  It made me feel a sort of false happiness for a time, to think we had such a place to camp in on the quiet, and call our own, in a manner of speaking. Jim soon woke up and stretched himself.  Then father began, quite cheerful like -- `Well, boys, what d&#x27;ye think of the Hollow again?  It&#x27;s not a bad earth for the old dog-fox and his cubs when the hounds have run him close. They can&#x27;t dig him out here, or smoke him out either.  We&#x27;ve no call to do anything but rest ourselves for a week or two, anyhow; then we must settle on something and buckle to it more business-like. We&#x27;ve been too helter-skelter lately, Jim and I.  We was beginning to run risks, got nearly dropped on more nor once.&#x27; There&#x27;s no mistake, it&#x27;s a grand thing to wake up and know you&#x27;ve got nothing to do for a bit but to take it easy and enjoy yourself.  No matter how light your work may be, if it&#x27;s regular and has to be done every day, the harness &#x27;ll gall somewhere; you get tired in time and sick of the whole thing. Jim and I knew well that, bar accidents, we were as safe in the Hollow as we used to be in our beds when we were boys.  We&#x27;d searched it through and through last time, till we&#x27;d come to believe that only three or four people, and those sometimes not for years at a time, had ever been inside of it.  There were no tracks of more. We could see how the first gang levied; they were different. Every now and then they had a big drink -- `a mad carouse&#x27;, as the books say -- when they must have done wild, strange things, something like the Spanish Main buccaneers we&#x27;d read about. They&#x27;d brought captives with them, too.  We saw graves, half-a-dozen together, in one place.  THEY didn&#x27;t belong to the band. We had a quiet, comfortable meal, and a smoke afterwards. Then Jim and I took a long walk through the Hollow, so as to tell one another what was in our minds, which we hadn&#x27;t a chance to do before. Before we&#x27;d gone far Jim pulls a letter out of his pocket and gives it to me. `It was no use sending it to you, old man, while you was in the jug,&#x27; he says; `it was quite bad enough without this, so I thought I&#x27;d keep it till we were settled a bit like.  Now we&#x27;re going to set up in business on our own account you&#x27;d best look over your mail.&#x27; I knew the writing well, though I hadn&#x27;t seen it lately.  It was from her -- from Kate Morrison that was.  It began -- not the way most women write, like HER, though -- So this is the end of your high and mighty doings, Richard Marston, passing yourself and Jim off as squatters.  I don&#x27;t blame him -- [no, of course not, nobody ever blamed Jim, or would, I suppose, if he&#x27;d burned down Government House and stuck up his Excellency as he was coming out of church] -- but when I saw in the papers that you had been arrested for cattle-stealing I knew for the first time how completely Jeanie and I had been duped. I won&#x27;t pretend that I didn&#x27;t think of the money you were said to have, and how pleasant it would be to spend some of it after the miserable, scrambling, skimping life we had lately been used to.  But I loved you, Dick Marston, for YOURSELF, with a deep and passionate love which you will never know now, which you would scorn and treat lightly, perhaps, if you did know.  You may yet find out what you have lost, if ever you get out of that frightful gaol. I was not such a silly fool as to pine and fret over our romance so cruelly disturbed, though Jeanie was; it nearly broke her heart. No, Richard, my nature is not of that make.  I generally get even with people who wrong me.  I send you a photo, giving a fair idea of myself and my HUSBAND, Mr. Mullockson.  I accepted his offer soon after I saw your adventures, and those of your friend Starlight, in every newspaper in the colonies.  I did not hold myself bound to live single for your sake, so did what most women do, though they pretend to act from other motives, I disposed of myself to the best advantage. Mr. Mullockson has plenty of money, which is NEARLY everything in this world, so that I am comfortable and well off, as far as that goes. If I am not happy that is your fault -- your fault, I say, because I am not able to tear your false image and false self from my thoughts.  Whatever happens to me in the future you may consider yourself to blame for.  I should have been a happy and fairly good woman, as far as women go, if you had been true, or rather if everything about you had not been utterly false and despicable. You think it fortunate after reading this, I daresay, that we are separated for ever, BUT WE MAY MEET AGAIN, Richard Marston. THEN you may have reason to curse the day, as I do most heartily, when you first set eyes on</div></div></div><div class="loadMoreContainer_VbNF"><button class="loadMoreButton_BUAG">See
